<abstract>
<p>In this article we offer a dynamic relational perspective in which frames and framing work together in the practice of leadership development. Mead’s (1932) notion of sociality is introduced as a way of engaging with movements within and between frames, where it is these framing movements that we argue hold the potentiality of emergent practice. The article responds to a growing interest in the delineation, conceptualization and practice of <italic>leadership</italic> as opposed to <italic>leader</italic> development, where we understand leadership development in terms of the creation of social capital, relational capacity and collaboration. However, there is little, if any, research into how these dimensions may be developed intentionally in practice. Using online forum data from an 18-month-long leadership development programme, we demonstrate three different sociality movements, which we have labelled kindling, stretching and spanning. Our analysis positions sociality at the core of leadership development interventions, and practice more generally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organizational scholarship is increasingly turning to questions of practice as a way of engaging with the complexity and messiness that characterize organizational life and experience. Nowhere is this need more pressing than in the leadership domain, where the various imperatives driving competitive advantage bump up against each other, demanding action in the face of uncertainty. In this context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day (2001)</xref> has recognized a need to differentiate between developing <italic>leaders</italic> and developing <italic>leadership</italic>, where leader development is concerned with the human capital of individualized knowledge, skills and behaviours, while leadership development relates to the social capital required to build relationships that promote cooperative work. These two perspectives draw on different sets of assumptions that necessarily invoke different forms of inquiry.</p>
<p>Leader development focuses on leaders and followers as discrete entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712451185">Drath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712451185">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>), calling for research that defines their distinctive characteristics and explores their interdependencies. By contrast, ‘leadership development’, as we use the term here, promises to engage more effectively with the dynamic and relational dimensions of leadership practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day, 2001</xref>). Recognizing that leadership development is more than the sum of leader developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712451185">Hosking, 1988</xref>), this perspective focuses on relational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712451185">Cunliffe and Eriksen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712451185">Gergen, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712451185">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712451185">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>) and distributed or shared leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712451185">Gronn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712451185">Pearce and Conger, 2003</xref>), suggesting an alternative view of leadership development as a movement towards an uncertain future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712451185">Pye, 2005</xref>) that involves the pursuit of novelty and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712451185">Grint, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712451185">Heifetz, 1994</xref>). However, this view is accompanied by a confused and inadequate repertoire of conceptual foundations, practices and enabling technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712451185">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712451185">Raelin, 2007</xref>). Thus, although the distinction between developing leaders and developing leadership is increasingly accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712451185">Day and Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712451185">Iles and Preece, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712451185">Jones, 2006</xref>), the specific theories, concepts, language and practices that might inform the latter still need considerable attention, refinement and further development.</p>
<p><italic>Leader-</italic>orientated development technologies such as coaching, psychometric testing and competency frameworks remain central and prevalent, even in interventions that are avowedly concerned with <italic>leadership</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712451185">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day, 2001</xref>). Consequently there is a real need for new concepts and new ways of languaging a more collective, collaborative understanding of leadership as the emergent product of relational interactions. We see our inquiry here as part of a nascent movement towards constructing the discursive strategies or practices that explain how leadership is performed linguistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712451185">Foldy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712451185">Ospina and Foldy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712451185">Wodak et al., 2011</xref>). At the same time, there is a growing trend towards educational programmes that blend face-to-face and online activities, which raises interesting questions about the added value of virtual learning environments in development programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712451185">Arbaugh and Benbunan-Fich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712451185">Swan, 2002</xref>). Arguably, online development environments create a particular nexus of theory and practice that is of significant interest to critical researchers.</p>
<p>In this article we seek to better understand and articulate leadership development as an emergent relational practice within the specific context of online development conversations. We draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712451185">Mead’s (1932</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712451185">1934</xref>) seminal thinking about the emergence of relationality as a way of understanding how the social capital of leadership is developed continuously and modified through social and online interactions. We argue that this social capital manifests as temporary frames of meaning (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712451185">Fairhurst, 2010</xref>), which offer a changing repertoire of discursive resources that may be drawn on selectively by interacting participants. Further, Mead’s notion of ‘sociality’ captures the dynamic process of constructing meanings in the movements within and between frames, while also creating the opportunity for new frames to emerge. By locating leadership in the emergence of and movement between frames, sociality offers a point of focus and a set of practices that have the potential to build more complex and nuanced understandings of leadership development. Thus the specific questions that motivate this article are:</p>

<list-item><p>How do different frames interact in the collaborative and relational practice of leadership development?</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>We begin in the next section by elaborating existing understandings of <italic>leadership</italic> as opposed to <italic>leader</italic> development and reviewing the relevant literature on the use of online platforms in development programmes. Next, we proceed to assemble a thorough-going dynamic, relational argument that positions sociality as a core theoretical construct. We then present an empirical illustration that demonstrates the fluidity of leadership development among a group of managers who were participants in an ongoing conversation about their collective leadership practice. Engaging directly with skilful processes of relationship development and ‘acts of organizing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712451185">Hosking, 1988</xref>: 147), we focus on the discursive analysis of conversational interactions, where the participants were seeking an expression of leadership more inclusive than the received wisdom of senior executive control. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for further theory development and for the practice of leadership development.</p>

<sec id="section2-0018726712451185">
<title>The practice of leadership development</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712451185">Day and Harrison (2007</xref>: 362), ‘what passes most often as leadership development in research and practice can be more accurately labelled as individual leader development … What is missing in most development initiatives is the focus on the interpersonal context’. This observation clearly signals the need for more relational approaches to understanding leadership that can usefully inform the practice of leadership development. However, early research on so-called ‘leadership development’ adopted a technical rather than theoretical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712451185">Conger, 1992</xref>), where ‘leadership’ was considered a property of individuals, and ‘leadership development’ became a training vehicle allowing individuals to accumulate leadership resources. This reflects an ontological commitment that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712451185">Drath et al. (2008</xref>: 635) described as ‘a tripod – a leader or leaders, followers and a common goal they want to achieve’. The assumptions of this tripod model underpin virtually all theoretical schools of leadership, including the currently popular theories of transformational, charismatic and authentic leadership. We argue, though, that as long as leadership continues to be perceived as the mere aggregation of individual leaders and their acts, the omission of relationality and its implications from any serious consideration will limit theory-building and practice.</p>
<p>Responding to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day (2001)</xref> proposed a distinction between leader development and leadership development. For him, leader development builds ‘intrapersonal competence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day, 2001</xref>: 584) as an investment in, and means of protecting, human capital. By contrast, leadership development seeks to grow social capital by building interpersonal relationships, networks, and structures that result in shared meanings and cooperative endeavour. It ‘expands the collective capacity of organizational members … to work together in meaningful ways … [allowing] groups of people to learn their way out of problems that could not have been predicted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451185">Day, 2001</xref>: 582). Whereas human capital relates to the knowledge and competences of individuals, social capital is an attribute of those social situations that produce cooperative action.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712451185">Day and Harrison (2007</xref>: 364) noted that the complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in today’s organizations mean that ‘having well-developed leaders is insufficient for organizational success’ because ‘contexts calling for leadership become increasingly peer-like and collaborative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712451185">Drath et al., 2008</xref>: 636). We acknowledge that the development of both human and social capital is necessary and, indeed, mutually informing, but we are wary of approaches that see these as two sequential stepping stones toward mature leadership practice. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712451185">Lord and Hall (2005)</xref> charted a sequence from novice to expert leadership where the self is progressively more collectively influenced. Waiting for individuals to reach levels and roles that somehow ‘naturally’ require a more social orientation seems to us to suggest a traditional leader-centric model that undervalues relational ways of engaging with leadership and its development.</p>
<p>The core of our argument, then, is that leadership development may be understood productively as an ongoing relational process, in which social capital is constructed continuously in the interactions of collaborative practice. The extent to which these development processes might be supported by online communications is a question that has exercised scholars of education for some time. After all, ‘the defining characteristic of the computing medium … is its interactivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712451185">Swan, 2002</xref>: 23), suggesting a natural fit with the collaborative and relational style of practice that we are seeking to elaborate here. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712451185">Swan’s (2002)</xref> view, the potential for online platforms to facilitate communications between participants in a development programme is a compelling reason to pursue this approach. She argued that online communications are perceived to be more equitable, more democratic and more supportive of idea sharing. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712451185">Garrison and Anderson (2003)</xref> have observed that online communications are often characterized by elevated levels of critical reflexivity as participants pause to think about incoming posts before crafting their own responses. Interestingly, online communications are often criticized for their lack of richness owing to the absence of facial expressions and aural cues. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712451185">Swan (2002)</xref> has demonstrated that online conversants compensate for this limitation by using a paralanguage that includes emoticons, punctuation, capitalization, self-disclosure, humour, and so on.</p>
<p>Much of the empirical research into online learning has been located in classroom situations and has been directed towards the assessment of its effectiveness, especially in comparison to more traditional, face-to-face learning environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712451185">Arbaugh and Benbunan-Fich, 2006</xref>). However, little significant difference in student satisfaction and perceived learning outcomes has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712451185">Alavi and Gallupe, 2003</xref>), perhaps suggesting that there may be other questions that researchers might more productively engage with. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712451185">Hodgson and Watland (2004)</xref> argued for more research into the interactive and collaborative dimensions of online learning. They pointed out that adult learning is better understood through a pedagogy of socially constructed meanings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712451185">Arbaugh and Benbunan-Fich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712451185">Huang, 2002</xref>), proposing that research into this field should therefore also be informed by a constructionist position. As we argue in the next section of this article, this is precisely the position that we have adopted here.</p>
<p>Although there is a large literature in the field of education dealing with online learning, the leadership development domain is remarkable for the paucity of writing on this subject. A rare example is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712451185">Ladkin et al. (2009)</xref>, who have demonstrated, perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively, that in an organizational context the virtual domain has an immediacy that enhances learning by allowing managers to experiment directly with new ideas in their own working environments. They further argued that an online environment facilitates situated and contextualized learning by promoting a collaborative discourse. Ladkin et al. have termed this a form of ‘close learning’ ideal for a ‘context-dependent practice such as leadership’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712451185">2009</xref>: 201), where the slower pace of online learning appears to offer a platform upon which the social capital required to build leadership may, at least in part, be developed. But exactly how conversants use online interactions in their leadership development practice remains largely unexplained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018726712451185">
<title>Towards leadership as sociality</title>
<p>Significant contributions have already been made towards a relational perspective that reorients leadership in terms of processes, practices and interactional engagements (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712451185">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712451185">Crevani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712451185">Cunliffe and Eriksen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712451185">Wood, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712451185">Uhl-Bien (2006)</xref> made an important distinction between a simple interactional model of leadership in which influence is passed between actors who themselves remain intact throughout this process, and a fully relational perspective in which actors both construct, and are constructed by, their social interactions. In a similar vein, Hosking argued for a new perspective that ‘starts with processes and not persons and views persons, leadership and other relational realities as made processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712451185">Hosking, 2007</xref>: 247). In such inquiries, human relatedness provides ‘the focus of concern and the explanatory fulcrum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712451185">Gergen, 1995</xref>: 35), and whatever is ‘in relation’ ‘is constantly in the making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712451185">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>: 661). Entities are regarded as ephemeral and devoid of stable categorical meanings, so reductionist analyses must give way to more holistic approaches that work within situated leadership practice. Equally, there is no stable, external ‘spectator’ viewpoint; rather, all actors, including researchers, are co-evolving participants in the construction of relationships, structures, realities and meanings.</p>
<p>We have chosen to construct our theoretical argument around the process philosophy of George Herbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712451185">Mead (1932</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712451185">1934</xref>). He articulated a comprehensive theory of human practice in which social selves and social situations are mutually constituted in the intertwining of agentic actions and temporalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712451185">Simpson, 2009</xref>). For him, all practice arises in the relational gesture and response of conversation, where the meanings that conversants ascribe to themselves and their social situations are constructed and reconstructed continuously. Thus, the relational dynamics of conversation lie at the very heart of Mead’s argument; it is through our social interactions that we become reflexively aware of our selves, and at the same time we are able to influence the meanings inferred by others.</p>
<p>A second pillar in Mead’s theory is that conversational meaning-making is mediated by ‘significant symbols’. Whereas a symbol may suggest different meanings to different people, a significant symbol evokes a shared meaning, where ‘shared’ should be understood as ‘usually implicit agreements … that serve as an interpretive context’ rather than as zones of ‘overlapping substantive content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712451185">Dachler and Hosking, 1995</xref>: 6). For Mead, ‘[g]estures become significant symbols when they implicitly arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse, or are supposed to arouse, in other individuals, the individuals to whom they are addressed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712451185">Mead, 1934</xref>: 47). Significant symbols are not intended to convey precise meanings; rather, it is their potential for ambiguity that allows scope for alternative interpretations, and ultimately for meanings to be transformed in the context of conversation. Significant symbols may take concrete form as, for instance, office furnishings, mission statements or design prototypes, but equally they may arise as more abstract notions such as roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712451185">Simpson and Carroll, 2008</xref>), discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712451185">Hardy et al., 2000</xref>) or frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712451185">Fisher, 1997</xref>). The last of these, frames, is rooted in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712451185">Goffman (1974)</xref>, who himself was influenced strongly by Mead’s ideas.</p>
<p>Goffman proposed frames as key to the representation, reproduction and mobilization of meaning in that they offer a fundamental organizing principle where ‘definitions of a situation are built up in accordance with principles of organization which govern events – at least social ones – and our subjective involvement in them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712451185">Goffman, 1974</xref>: 10–11). The bulk of more contemporary work on frames builds upon this understanding. Frames have been variously characterized as ‘conceptual scaffolding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712451185">Fisher, 1997</xref>: 3.4) or ‘assumptional structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712451185">Schön and Rein, 1994</xref>), suggesting a strong alignment with both generative metaphor and story. More particularly, we argue that frames may be usefully understood as significant symbols in the practice of relational meaning-making. They serve a reflexive purpose that allows us to examine different perspectives by standing in the shoes of others in order to engage temporarily with alternative frames. At the same time, the meanings attached to specific frames are never permanently fixed. Rather, they mutate as relational meanings shift over time. In Mead’s view, all creative action emerges from the reflexive and mutable possibilities of significant symbols (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712451185">Joas, 1996</xref>). We suggest that the practice of leadership necessarily invokes creative action, which we theorize here in terms of frames understood as significant symbols.</p>
<p>In our attempt to re-language framing as a dynamic process, we have drawn further inspiration from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712451185">Mead (1932)</xref>, in particular his notion of ‘sociality’. He defined sociality as that phase of action that lies ‘betwixt and between the old system and the new’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712451185">1932</xref>: 73), or ‘the capacity of being several things at once’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712451185">1932</xref>: 75). This ‘in limbo’ phase of action is the temporal dimension of framing movements that arise when two or more frames are in play. It emphasizes the continuity of movement such as, for instance, in walking, as weight is transferred from one foot (the old frame) to the other (the new frame). In effect, sociality is the process of readjustment or re-construal of meanings that is necessitated by movement from one frame to another. ‘If emergence is a feature of reality this phase of adjustment, which comes between the ordered universe before the emergent has arisen and that after it has come to terms with the newcomer, must be a feature also of reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712451185">Mead, 1932</xref>: 73). It is in this transitional phase of readjustment, where emergent objects belong to different frames of meaning simultaneously, that shared meanings are re-cognized, selves and situations are re-constructed, and directions for further action are re-negotiated; in other words, sociality is generative of novelty and change. Being ‘betwixt and between’ is key to understanding those dynamic movements, such as problem-solving, interpersonal interactions and direction setting, that define the leadership domain.</p>
<p>In sum, we propose an explicitly relational and processual approach to theorizing leadership practice in which the generative interplay between frames (significant symbols) is understood in terms of dynamic framing movements (sociality). The undifferentiated flux of experience is made sensible when frames of meaning are imposed, albeit temporarily, punctuating and being carried along by the flow, and creating possibilities for new insight and direction. Thus the process by means of which leadership emerges requires both access to a repertoire of different frames of meaning and a means of framing – that is, moving between these frames. Leadership development should therefore be concerned with increasing the repertoire of available frames, while also improving the collective capacity to move amongst multiple frames in conversation. In contrast to conventional leadership research, much of which works with ‘mental models or inner representations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712451185">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>: 661) that assume stable, individual configurations of perceiving, thinking and reacting, relational leadership focuses on processes where leadership is ‘a continuous social flow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712451185">Crevani et al., 2010</xref>: 79) in which ‘it is the situated, moment by moment, construction of direction that becomes interesting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712451185">2010</xref>: 81).</p>

<title>Observing leadership development</title>

<title>Research context</title>
<p>The data used in this illustration were accessed during an 18-month leadership development programme involving a group of 20 senior managers from a public utility company. The group, all of whom reported directly to the executive level of management in the company, comprised six women and 14 men from various technical backgrounds, and located across geographically distributed sites. The programme was commissioned shortly after a period of restructuring that had brought disparate units into new configurations. While the company’s executive sought to build individual leader capability, they were equally committed to creating a ‘joined-up’ senior leadership group. The programme comprised six three-day residential workshops separated by five ‘inter-sessions’, each about three months long, during which development was focused around an online learning platform, small group peer meetings, and participant-led interventions in their own working contexts. Each workshop and inter-session centred on a particular theme (in sequence, <italic>Interrogating Leadership, Leading Together, Harnessing Conflict, Leading Change, Culture Work</italic> and <italic>Shaping Leadership Spaces).</italic> While these themes provided a focus for programme activities, the development process was grounded in the ongoing context, work and conversations of the participant group, making participants co-constructors of the programme’s trajectory, pace and direction. Overall, the programme may be understood as a blended learning site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712451185">Arbaugh and Benbunan-Fich, 2006</xref>) where both face-to-face and online platforms were used to support leadership development.</p>
<p>The specific empirical material presented here was generated from a participant-led attempt to find an expression of leadership that was relevant to their situation. The metaphor of a <italic>swamp</italic> – used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712451185">Heifetz (1994)</xref> to refer to conditions of complexity that demand adaptive leadership – was introduced in the third workshop. On their own initiative, the participants conceived a need for conversations dedicated to leadership (as opposed to management or operations) that would allow exploration of the kinds of complex issues that seemed to require an adaptive response. They convened weekly, face-to-face meetings, which they called ‘swamp meetings’ to remind themselves of the need to confront complexity, to be open to working adaptively with different perspectives, and to pursue powerful questions. The swamp meetings began about 9 months into the programme, and initially involved only the programme participants, but later included members of the executive team and other peers. The meetings continued in a variety of formats until, and even beyond, the formal end of the programme. They marked a significant departure from earlier discussions, which had focused more on the content and application of individual leader development tools. We understand these swamp meetings as a committed engagement to deepening participants’ collective leadership practices.</p>
<p>The conversational content of the swamp meetings was confidential, and therefore unavailable to us as research data. However, we were granted access to the online forum discussions that were conducted between swamp meetings, and which provided continuity for participants in different physical locations. Online conversations are generally asymmetrical, with participants choosing to lurk at times, be more active at other times, and have random patterns of presence and absence. In contrast, the forum associated with the swamp meetings was characterized by high levels of activity and participation. The forum data therefore provide evidence of intense relational work that is directly situated in the participants’ day-to-day leadership practices. While perhaps lacking the richness of face-to-face conversation, and thus risking ‘missing out on the relational dynamics and complexity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712451185">Grant et al., 2010</xref>: 226) of meaning-making, these online conversations did demonstrate the gesture and response dynamic that underpins Mead’s theorization of human practice. We argue, then, that even in the online forum, important frames (significant symbols) and framing movements (sociality) were clearly discernible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0018726712451185">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In all, there were 93 postings to the online swamp forum, involving all 20 participants and ranging from two lines to two pages of varied content including personal opinions, snippets of speeches, emails, accounts of conversations, and requests from the Executive for comment. Participation levels were variable, with 37 of the posts being attributed to just three participants. These three (identified as Blue, Red and Grey) were not differentiated in status, experience or development role from any of the other participants, but stood out as articulate, confident and committed to the online component of the programme and the inter-session conversation of the group. Each of these three participants is present in the two framing episodes that we present later (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712451185">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712451185">3</xref>), and can be read as prominent in these. The issue of lurking was discussed during the programme and accepted, if not desired, as part of the natural rhythm of online interaction. Lurkers, of course, were often in contact with other participants in their face-to-face work and in this way could influence the discussion offline. The forum was participant-led, with external facilitators offering support and clarification only when invited to do so. There is no input from facilitators in the two framing episodes that follow.</p>
<p>We have proposed that frames (as significant symbols) and framing (as sociality) are integral to the development of leadership that is both relational and generative. Accordingly, our analysis of the data proceeded in two stages. First, we undertook a broad discursive reading to surface frames that appeared repeatedly (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451185">Table 1</xref>). We identified these frames by paying attention to how choices in language influenced meanings. Metaphoric or paralanguage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712451185">Swan, 2002</xref>) appeared to strike the participants (judging by how they responded and engaged with each other), and struck us as playing a significant role in carrying meanings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712451185">Fairhurst, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712451185">2010</xref>). Other language dimensions that appeared significant were the verbs that captured a sense of the ‘doing’ embedded in each frame (e.g. ‘react’, ‘learn’, ‘flit’), pronoun usage that captured something of the relational dynamics of this group (e.g. ‘us and them’, ‘in our hands’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712451185">Watson, 1995</xref>), and speech acts that drew our attention to the performance or action dimension of what was being said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712451185">Cooren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712451185">Cooren and Fairhurst, 2004</xref>). Thus each frame appears to offer an interpretive context imbued with energy and meaning for the participants. While some of these frames recurred consistently throughout the data, others waxed and waned, but were nevertheless important features of the group’s meaning-making. Frames were assembled by us and presented back to the facilitation team, the group of participants and, with their explicit permission, their senior team for discussion. This resulted in a series of conversations on the nature of each frame and on the relationship between them which greatly enriched this analysis and provided both confirmation and challenge to the researchers in terms of their analytical and discursive choices.</p>

<p>In the second stage of data analysis we tracked different framing movements, seeking to uncover those emergent dynamics of ordinary conversation that constitute leadership development. Here, we sought to identify ‘framing episodes’ where tensions between frames would arise, develop momentum, and be contested, debated and ultimately resolved, if only temporarily. Arguably, to the extent that it is progressive over time, the entire dataset is threaded through with framing episodes, but for this article, we present only two that illustrate different types of framing movements. These two episodes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712451185">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712451185">3</xref>) were selected on both theoretical and pragmatic grounds as the most sustained and concise examples of framing movements in the dataset, and therefore the most amenable to reproduction within the constraints of a journal article. Both episodes involved multiple participants in a focused sequence of exchanges that built transparently on each other. Both avoided some of the complications that come with using online data: the insertion of long documents, cross-postings intended for other concurrent forums, and lack of energy to sustain a connected series of postings. Both moved the group into leadership action, not so much within the context of the programme, but in their organizational practice domain, which was central to their development experience (for example, in constructing different forums to involve their senior leaders, and in proposing ideas that caught the attention of their senior leaders). Most critically, however, both were narrative in tone, building a sense of story within an episode and even between the two episodes. If we understand narrative quality as strongly about cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712451185">Boje, 2001</xref>), then these interactions were ones where participants appeared to be intentionally building a ‘gesture and response’ pattern through postings that addressed each other and the conversation directly. Given that online forums frequently exhibit discontinuity as participants submit postings written earlier, or respond to earlier postings out of sequence, the episodes we present have been chosen for their sequential coherence.</p>

<p>We used a number of clues to help us identify the beginnings and endings of each framing episode. For instance, the second framing episode is initiated by the first post in an entirely new forum. Other related conversational forums were already in progress, but Blue’s construction of this new forum topic does signal something akin to a new chapter in the discussion. Likewise, Orange’s posting was the last ever posting in this particular forum and signalled a definite end to this episode. The posting by Red that initiates the first framing episode is a complete break from preceding posts that were purely instrumental in their function. Red’s expressed opinion appears to spark a whole lot of energy and contributions that constitute the entirety of this episode, which ends once the topic of discussion has been exhausted. This endpoint is signalled by a shift in focus rather than a complete topic shift as occurred in the second framing episode.</p>

<title>Frames and framing episodes uncovered</title>

<title>Four frames</title>
<p>A number of frames were identified in our analysis of the online forum data, but here we present only four, these being the frames that inform our later analysis of framing episodes. For ease of reference, we have labelled these four frames ‘school’, ‘expedition’, ‘intermediary’ and ‘performance’, where these signifiers indicate the meanings and storylines that each frame builds. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451185">Table 1</xref> presents data extracts that exemplify each of these four frames:</p>
<list id="list2-0018726712451185" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>School frame</italic> The language of this frame involves not only education, as in ‘learning’, ‘lecturing’, ‘testing’, ‘questioning’, ‘credit’ and ‘showing what we know’, but also a series of colloquialisms that evoke the attitude and mindset of students, such as ‘behaving’, ‘fawning’, ‘abject’, ‘ridicule’, ‘tease out’ and ‘score points’. Participants did not connect this frame to themselves as learners in a development programme, but rather to their leadership practice in relation to their executive team. Adaptive leadership centres on the capacity of a group to learn together to create something new, so constant references and reminders of the learning capability of the group were an ongoing story strongly reinforced by the facilitation team.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Expedition frame</italic> This frame built a sense of journeying, by using concepts such as ‘base camp’, ‘moving on’, ‘adapting’, ‘journey’, ‘path’, ‘discovery’, ‘challenging’, ‘approach’, ‘pitfalls’ and ‘search’. This appeared to be an adaptive frame (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712451185">Heifetz, 1994</xref>), where participants assumed a context of complexity that required them to navigate unknown and uncharted territory. It emerged as the dominant metaphor of this leadership development programme and at least in part reflects the programme’s theoretical orientation towards adaptation, relationality and complexity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Intermediary frame</italic> Here the participant group is positioned in relation to either those they manage or their executive team. The participants thus ‘plant seeds’, ‘stretch/shape expectations’, ‘keep them real’, ‘pass messages’ and ‘report back’. This frame represents the classic middle management experience of never-ending and often contradictory expectations and demands from ‘above’ and ‘below’. The positioning of middle managers as intermediaries is seen in Balogun’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712451185">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712451185">Balogun and Johnson, 2004</xref>), where she finds they play a far more strategic and complex role in change leadership than is often recognized. Salient in such complexity is their need to ‘sense-give’ both to those above and below them as well as ‘sense-make’ for themselves and each other, as it is their role to keep the business going while at the same time implementing and refining the change work. Given this conceptualization of intermediary, its discourse may seem less cohesive than the others but nonetheless indicative of the complexity Balogun is introducing by her use of this term.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Performance frame</italic> This frame was built strongly on an extended theatre metaphor, in ‘turn the lights off’, ‘stage-managed’, ‘audience’, ‘demonstrate’, ‘rehearsal’, ‘our show’, ‘putting on a play’, ‘spectator’ and ‘perform’. It was applied to issues of communication and creating conversations with the executive team that moved beyond operational to strategic considerations. Performance was not a strong frame in the online forum, but this theatrical framing of performance (as opposed to performance as an organizational bottom-line or benchmark) was entirely the group’s construction, as we will demonstrate below.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section9-0018726712451185">
<title>Two framing episodes</title>
<p>The framing episodes we present here are excerpts from the online forum data that capture the conversational dynamic and the shifting interplay between different frames (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712451185">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712451185">3</xref>). Contributors are distinguished using different colour codes, and relevant sections of text are linked to specific frames. The tables present sequential postings that are verbatim records except where their length has been edited to sharpen focus on the working of the four frames.</p>
<p>This editing process involved two phases: the first removed all phatic communication or small talk designed to announce, welcome, acknowledge, socialize and close out the entry and exit of participants to the forums, and the second removed utterances that were solely ‘evidential’ or ‘argumentative’ or ‘transactional’, providing support for the frames and framing, but not in direct dialogue with them. In the interests of transparency we will give some examples of our editing choices. So from Blue’s opening statement in episode 2 we edited out <italic>‘</italic>I have to go off site just now but will post some Qs later’ as a statement of pause or temporary exit. From Purple’s response to that forum we edited out a number of paragraphs that began, ‘Even in this perfect storm we’re still growing and our EBITDA, though not as high as we’d like, is still on an upward slope’ that continued to give a financial snapshot of the organization. Ideally one would be able to include this more phatic and transactional discourse alongside the more framing orientated discourse, but pragmatically the sheer size of Purple’s posting would have taken all the available space for data. We realize this will be an ongoing issue for researchers wanting to use data from online conversation forums so we offer our choices both to help protocol development and also to show the unresolved nature of research methods involving new technologies. While one of the authors took prime responsibility for these choices, the other used the complete transcripts to confirm and challenge these calls.</p>
<p><italic>First framing episode</italic> This episode occurred approximately 12 months into the programme as the group struggled to decide how to respond to growing executive interest in their progress. This episode was preceded by a posting that included three pages of notes outlining what the executive was hoping for in terms of the outcomes of this leadership development programme. It is interesting that, throughout the first year of the programme, no mention had been made of any specific executive expectations.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712451185">Table 2</xref> we see the participants considering whether, and how, to engage their executive through their swamp meetings. The discussion was prompted by a suggestion that the executive should be invited to a special swamp meeting, but this is strenuously debated as the participants consider what role the executive should have at such a meeting. Different options are aired, ranging from executive as guides and advisors, to active swamp dwellers, to silent observers.</p>
<p>Red invokes the ‘school’ frame, but negates it as a viable strategy by saying it would be inappropriate to look to the executive for answers (‘I don’t think it should be a “let’s ask the exec questions” thing’). She then makes a tentative suggestion about an alternative approach that might be more inclusive. Green also questions the purpose of executive involvement (‘I don’t believe …’), invoking the ‘expedition’ frame as a positive way forward (‘How about taking them on a journey?’).</p>
<p>Blue begins to construct an entirely new frame – a ‘performance’ frame that picks up on Red’s earlier reference to the ‘Swamp Opera’, elaborating it through rapid associations of words, and moving from notions of presenting (‘model’), to the role separation of the two groups (‘audience’) and activities such as rehearsing and performing (‘practice’, ‘demonstrate’). Blue thus builds a vivid, generative image of performance and invites others to confirm, extend or challenge it. Grey responds to this new frame by seeking to strengthen it (‘it’s our show’). In so doing he reworks ‘audience’ to ‘spectator’, making a subtle distinction: while audiences are not centre stage, they are also not entirely passive in the sense that ‘spectators’ may be understood. Nor are ‘spectators’ necessarily theatre related, and hence the rewording potentially opens up the frame to different kinds of performance. Here there is both an intensification of the frame (in terms of the tone, and the nature of the positioning of the executive team) and an extension of the scope of the frame (to include other kinds of performances).</p>
<p>But this intensified and expanded frame also draws critique. Red reworks ‘spectator’ by posing the more satirical notion of ‘show pony’. At each successive rewording the frame appears to lose appeal. The last, ‘show pony’, is linked to a childlike desire for reassurance (‘please Dad, give me approval that I am doing it right’) that must sit uncomfortably in a group of senior managers wanting more accountability and leadership space. Yellow’s entry to the forum is interesting at this point as he doesn’t speak to performance in any direct discursive way, but nonetheless goes straight to the core conflict in the performance frame and articulates the ‘us and them’ that this issue is pivoting on. Yellow’s reference to ‘collective leadership’ is as a proposal for a discussion topic in the swamp meeting itself. Finally, Blue negates the ‘performance’ frame (‘the word ‘audience’ is not quite right’) and restarts the conversation on a different premise (‘we should include all’). This appears to reinforce to Orange the importance of relationality (‘need to have a conversation’) and the centrality of the ‘expedition’ frame (‘exploring meaning and surfacing assumptions’).</p>
<p>We note there are two explicit references to leaders and leadership in this excerpt, confirming this first episode as a legitimate example of the working and reworking of the group’s leadership development practice. The first is Red’s statements that ‘Leaders don’t …’, which at the very least affirms her understanding of self and group as desiring inclusion in the leader category. The second is Yellow’s exhortation to ‘show some collective leadership’; it is telling that this collective leadership is perceived as needing to happen ‘in the room’ (of the swamp meeting) and that daring may be required. Thus Red and Yellow’s contributions are clues that these participants see (or desire to see) themselves as leaders, and the group members are using these swamp meetings to do a courageous kind of leadership work.</p>
<p><italic>Second framing episode</italic> This conversation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712451185">Table 3</xref>) occurred about a month after the first, by which time members of the executive had attended several swamp meetings, and as the leadership development group found the original purpose of their meetings increasingly undermined, their frustrations were beginning to boil over.</p>
<p>The episode is initiated by Blue’s expression of concern that swamp meetings are changing for the worse. His reference to ‘leadership homework’ invokes the ‘school’ frame that serves to disempower the group because now the ‘execs are “in” on’ the swamp meetings, which were originally conceived as a safe haven for the group members to explore their leadership practice. Through his ‘them and us’ tone, Blue acknowledges that the executive and this development group exist in relation to each other, and this is a source of ‘worry’.</p>
<p>In response to Blue’s ‘worry’, Red evokes the ‘performance’ frame, questioning, somewhat cynically, whether ‘perform’ and ‘vent their frustration’ have become the dominant mode of these meetings, implying that frustration is a rehearsed and repeated act that perhaps gets no other audience or stage. Red then returns to the ‘expedition’ frame (‘a place to test and try stuff and make sense of it all’) as a more constructive alternative that involves being able to make mistakes, experiment and make sense together. Purple also attempts to moderate and alleviate the ‘worry’ by bringing in the ‘intermediary’ frame (‘we’re the lens that most of the company looks through’), which affirms the importance of the group to the organization and evokes notions of responsibility that provide a serious counterpoint to both ‘worry’ and ‘frustration’. However, the connections between these various utterances are minimal and tenuous, and fail to initiate sustained framing work.</p>
<p>The email exchange between the CEO and an executive member (introduced by Blue) interrupts the conversation, implying the inadequacy of the ‘intermediary’ frame by insinuating that the group is avoiding vertical communication with their GMs in favour of horizontal conversation within the group. This seems to perpetuate the sense of powerlessness associated with the ‘school’ frame, and leads to an emotive posting by Grey, who is enraged – ‘THEY CANNOT SHUT DOWN THE DISCUSSION’ – and appears to interpret the email as a threat to the group’s conversation. The ‘school’ frame may reflect anything from ‘conscientious and co-operative’ to ‘naughty and resistant’: this particular invocation is the latter, complete with appropriate colloquialisms (‘Puh-lease’), and reinforced by the denial of student status (‘the meeting is not a student council meeting’). The ‘naughty student’ is called into existence from outside the group, and can be seen chiefly as a response to an imposed frame that is deemed offensive and inadequate.</p>
<p>Orange picks up the ‘school’ frame (‘pulling our heads in’, ‘sulking in our corners’) showing an immediate understanding and take-up of its tone, language and intent. However, Orange enacts a different kind of student who loves the challenge of a powerful question and dislikes not having an adequate answer (‘It’s actually a damn good question – do we have a good answer (or any answer at all)?’). In a deft shifting of the frame, Orange seeks to deflect the heat of Grey’s posting by evoking a more mature student. Grey resists this shift (‘This is wrong wrong wrong’), but as an alternative invokes the ‘expedition’ frame, although he doubts its capacity to prevail (‘This will end in tears – probably ours’). Orange reinforces the ‘expedition’ frame, claiming back the group’s responsibility (‘isn’t the remedy in our hands?’) and raising the spectre of ‘collective failure’ if ‘we leave it to one or two individuals’. Here, Orange is addressing the core of relationality as the continued ability to be in conversation.</p>
<p>We note that leadership is again directly referenced by two of the participants. The swamp meetings, or more specifically the involvement in them by the group, are referred to as ‘leadership homework’. This, on its own, is an ambiguous statement given that leadership may in fact be shorthand for leadership development programme homework, or be taken literally as the practice of leadership elicited by the programme. Purple’s comment could be seen as supporting the latter interpretation, given his reframing of the conversation directly to their organizational leadership context ‘an internal leadership perspective’, where ‘they’, he perceives, are the biggest contributors to ‘leadership issues’. This episode then, coming a few weeks after the first, shows an even stronger situating of the group’s leadership in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018726712451185">
<title>Three framing movements</title>
<p>The first episode demonstrates how, in conversation, the performance frame emerged and was strengthened as a significant symbol that offered a new context for interpreting events. We have labelled this particular framing movement ‘kindling’, to reflect the initiation and expansion of the entirely new ‘performance’ frame. The chance conjunction in Red’s posting of the familiar and rich ‘swamp’ concept with the new ‘opera’ concept (‘We need to draw them in to the Swamp Opera’) sparked this kindling movement, leading to a robust construction of shared meaning where each contribution fleshed out the frame (‘audience’, ‘spectator’ and ‘show pony’) and made its assumptions more visible. So we see Blue, Grey, Red, Yellow and Blue successively engaging with this emergent frame, and in so doing, elaborating the frame as a resource for the ongoing conversation. By contrast, the performance frame pops up only very briefly in the second framing episode, where it proves not very useful as a resource for this different conversation. Thus, framing movements are dependent upon the group’s capacity to engage with each other’s language and concepts, effectively standing in each other’s shoes to see alternative perspectives. It’s the choice of terms that either moderates or intensifies the frame. We understand this as a form of negotiation that determines the frame’s positioning, power and endurance.</p>
<p>This second episode provides deeper insight into how, through the process of sociality, significant symbols are worked with. In particular, we identify two more framing movements that we call ‘stretching’ and ‘spanning’. The stretching movement is illustrated by the expansion of meanings within the ‘school’ frame to encompass not only the naughty, rebellious, recalcitrant student (‘from where I sit I feel he was lecturing us like naughty kids’), but also the interested, engaged and inquiring student who is willing to learn and seek answers (‘It’s actually a damn good question – do we have a good answer (or any answer at all?’). So this first exchange between Grey and Orange shows Orange positioning himself in the School frame in order to connect with Grey, but then elaborating an alternative interpretation of the frame. The image of a naughty student appears to be well entrenched in this group’s talk, being strongly expressed throughout the entire dataset. This is perhaps unsurprising given the power differential between the group members and their executive. However, in the second episode, Orange explicitly challenges this construction by stretching towards an alternative view that unsettles the familiar meanings of the ‘school’ frame.</p>
<p>Grey picks up on this shift to a less reactionary mode of engagement and uses the new imagery to refocus his energy, leading to a ‘spanning’ movement that is exemplified when Orange’s reworking of the ‘school’ frame provides a point of ready access to the ‘expedition’ frame. It is a shorter distance to move from a ‘school’ frame that implies a spirit of inquiry to an ‘expedition’ frame that embraces future uncertainties. We can see the textual and relational work involved in the construction of a bridge that spans between these two frames, effectively merging them into a larger and more complex vehicle for meaning-making. It’s Grey, the advocate and spokesperson for the oppositional student end of the school frame, who makes a shift to the expedition frame quite directly if not entirely happily (‘This is wrong wrong wrong – the journey is what matters’). In this episode, the spanning movement is sealed in Orange’s reworking of ‘this will end in tears (probably ours)’ to ‘if we don’t want it to end in tears (particularly ours)’. This inversion bookends the framing episode with a reinforcement of collectivity (‘together we do this and make a real difference’). Orange directly frames the significance of this for the group (‘this could be a defining moment’), which appears as a call for collective uptake of the ‘expedition’ frame.</p>

<sec id="section11-0018726712451185" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given that research into the linguistic accomplishment of leadership is still in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712451185">Wodak et al., 2011</xref>), and that the actual dynamics of a more relational and collective leadership is ‘intangible and often obscure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712451185">Foldy et al., 2008</xref>) to researchers and practitioners alike, then the identification of new language and discursive strategies has become an imperative for those interested in the development of leadership theory and practice. We contribute the identification and conceptualization of these three framing moments (kindling, stretching and spanning) as holding the potentiality of emergent practice. Virtual conversations such as those represented in this inquiry provide a rare means of accessing the linguistic performance of collectives undertaking concerted work together. Given that working collaboratively to solve issues, sense-make and create movement or momentum is increasingly likely to involve at least some online interaction, then it is appropriate to explore how sociality movements are able to inform the practice of leadership development.</p>
<p>The notion of framing has been described by others as a cognitive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712451185">van Dijk, 1980</xref>) or shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712451185">Foldy et al., 2008</xref>), a micro-level language of metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712451185">Lakoff and Johnson, 1980</xref>) and an art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712451185">Fairhurst, 2010</xref>). In our approach we concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712451185">Benford and Snow (2000</xref>: 614), who argued that framing is an ‘active, processual phenomenon that implies agency and contention at the level of reality construction’. Frames themselves, when theorized as significant symbols, are inherently mutable and continuously negotiated. Given that two of our movements actually happen within frames (kindling and stretching), then resisting conceptualizing frames as rigidly fixed and unchanging entities opens up the possibility of seeing different movements long before something like reframing (a traditionally important process in many leadership development programmes). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712451185">Benford and Snow (2000)</xref>, we have explored the dynamics of movement between frames (with spanning in particular), but unlike them we have done so in a processual, relational way where kindling, stretching and spanning are not pre-emptive, planned design choices undertaken by a consortium or leader, but responses that emerge in the moment as people engage with each other in contextualized leadership conversations.</p>
<p>If we put kindling, stretching and spanning together, we have a language for the movement that happens both within frames and from frame to frame, with points of reference for the kind of leadership development that proceeds from these. The ‘kindling’ movement creates a new frame, deepening and broadening its potential for engagement and contestation in meaning-making. The ‘stretching’ movement opens up an existing frame, providing opportunities to elaborate new directions. And the ‘spanning’ movement draws existing frames together, bridging the space that separates them and reducing the potential for contest between frames. Conceivably there may also be other framing movements that are not evident in our data, such as the snuffing-out of frames, or staying stuck within a frame. We propose that each of these framing movements represents a different expression of sociality. By focusing on that transitional phase of movement within and between frames, we argue that sociality adds a new dimension to the understanding of social processes such as leadership development, and a way of engaging more usefully with the processual and relational aspects of leadership development.</p>
<p>We are proposing that sociality is required to build the social capital, relationality and shared meaning-making that enables groups to think, act and work together in leadership, so we need to ask what kind of leadership development can grow and embed such sociality. This question is even more vital in a terrain where leadership development is still dominated by the conceptual, skill-building, personal growth and feedback orientations identified decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712451185">Conger, 1992</xref>). We suggest that a sociality-based and relationally orientated form of leadership development would need a strong focus on working with assumptions, identity and power. While an in-depth discussion of these three dimensions lies beyond the scope of this article, we want to show briefly how each would support and nurture leadership development.</p>
<p>In this context, kindling, stretching and spanning movements may be understood as a form of mindset work. Developing leadership in terms of mindset places emphasis on working with the assumptions that drive leadership thinking and practice as opposed to the behaviours that arise from them. This is a complex proposition for leadership development as assumptions tend to be invisible or hidden from participants, and are consequently difficult to identify, see and work with (especially with others). Our illustrative framing episodes reveal that assumptions bring with them potent emotional, cultural and historical stories. There is nothing neutral about evoking meetings as ‘swamp opera’, the group as ‘show ponies’ and the CEO as a ‘spectator’. We can see that assumptions cut right through rational, logical and detached selves to reveal and inflame what is ‘felt’. A group who can engage and work through issues at a robust assumptive level works with the roots or foundations of attachment and association with concepts, stances, positions and perspectives. We would argue that sociality builds capacity to do this assumption/mindset work with those to whom we are connected in our leadership practice. This then, is our first contribution to the theory/practice nexus of leadership development.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see a close knit relationship between frames, framing and identity questions, which these participants are engaged in as social selves. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712451185">Ospina and Foldy (2010</xref>: 297) remind us that ‘naming and shaping identity’ can in itself initiate new attempts to understand issues through alternative and different frames, thus producing a ‘cognitive shift’ or change in perception. Different frames enable participants to hone, refine and construct who they want to be in relation to an ‘other’ (the executive team) in a particular context (the wider leadership work of their organization). The framing movements detail how the struggle or tension always associated with that work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712451185">Alvesson and Willmott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712451185">Sveningsson and Alvesson, 2003</xref>) occurs. So while work at the level of identity is understood in terms of ‘forming, repairing, maintaining, strengthening or revising’ something undefined called ‘constructions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712451185">Sveningsson and Alvesson, 2003</xref>: 1165), we propose that frames and framing provide a more intimate set of constructs with which to understand how and what is in motion as identities are negotiated in the leadership terrain.</p>
<p>We see the contestation of leadership identity in all the framing movements identified, but most clearly in the stretching movement where an invitation to be a curious student in the thick of a rebellious student frame offers an alternative that wasn’t apparent in the moment. In turn, a further alternative comes with spanning when the curious student identity crosses over to an active explorer identity. It seems clear that ongoing and sustained identity negotiation such as is detailed in these episodes needs to be a core thread of any leadership development intervention. The sociality movements captured here show how wider discourses are framed by each other and in fact need to be framed for each other in order for individuals/groups to see new possibilities. Thus we contribute frames and framing as a way for those involved in leadership development to more effectively conceptualize and practise the ongoing work of constructing leadership identity(ies).</p>
<p>Our third contribution is that sociality offers options for working with power dynamics, which have long been considered one of the most problematic terrains for leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712451185">Gagnon, 2008</xref>). These episodes show framing to be a political process in which meanings are contested, and even the micro-processes of everyday conversation are saturated with power. Certainly each of the frames is invested with different understandings of power: the ‘school’ frame speaks to asymmetry and relative powerlessness, the ‘intermediary’ frame implies a distinctive but limited potential for influence, the ‘performance’ frame expresses a desire for more voice, and the ‘expedition’ frame suggests a more mutual and open leadership space involving both the participant group and their executive. Necessarily, then, framing movements are negotiations of power that need to happen within groups, and then between groups. We note that framing carries power in a ‘live’ way where different choices of being powerless, powerful and empowered are offered, conveying a fluidity and agency that talking to structures and positions often does not. Of perhaps all organizational constructs, power most demands a discursive treatment that permits more access and movement for those involved. In our view, framing movements offer this potential.</p>
<p>We propose, then, that drawing our gaze to the interplay of sociality and significant symbols redefines the work and practice of leadership development to a significant extent. Relational leadership primarily looks like meaning, conversation and idea work that is orientated towards a shared purpose. An aligned leadership development intervention would be one where identifying and testing assumptions, fostering constructive difference and conflict, asking powerful questions, and sense-making would be occasioned by shared events, challenges and calls to action. If some of those events, challenges and calls to action are based in the organization (as opposed to in the development site), then a process of translation is prompted where discursive strategies from the development space can be tested in the organization space and resulting frames and framing experimented with, adapted and actioned with the support of the development programme. It is in this context that we strongly agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712451185">Ladkin et al.’s (2009)</xref> advocacy of online initiatives for leadership development, which carry the immediacy of participants’ working environments, allowing a direct crossover between the development and organization spaces.</p>
<p>There are also implications here for the content areas or topics of leadership development. Along with reflecting, strategizing, storytelling and the like, framing is a staple of leadership development programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712451185">Fairhurst, 2010</xref>). But we argue that practices such as framing, which are ordinarily considered as skills residing inside an individual’s head, also need to be understood productively as movements through relational practice. If we accept that premise, then we have the promise of further differentiating leadership development from leader development. If we consider leadership as a form of social capital, then locating framing within individuals cannot build the interpersonal capacity that supports social capital. Seeing framing as a relational process will foster interdependences that reconstitute leadership in terms of collective action. Future research should seek to understand leadership practices in terms of their relationality and dynamics, thus facilitating the building of useful frames around leadership development (as opposed to leader development) that are currently largely absent.</p>
<p>In addition, our approach raises a question for leadership development programmes: how to create opportunities for focus and application? We have depicted interactions from the online learning component of a leadership development programme. As online learning and development programmes are definitely on the rise, it is useful to speak to the design and organization of such spaces from our inquiry. These interactions come from online forums that were participant initiated and sustained and which focused on conversations that looked out of the programme and back to their organization. We would argue that having such an unstructured, participant-championed space gave participants the opportunity to talk to their leadership practice in ways that enacted, as opposed to intellectualized, the negotiations that construct the realities of their leadership. It seems to us that the facility and space to engage with existing work discourses are few and far between in the packed face-to-face modules and sessions of many leadership development programmes, so we advocate intentionally different strategies for virtual and face-to-face engagement within a development experience. We see that virtual spaces can be development-led by participants, whereas this is harder to achieve in face-to-face settings.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous action project is most often used as both the site for the practice of newly acquired leadership skills, and as the means for participants to make an immediate contribution back in their organization. For this participant group, however, what had greater transformative potential was their pursuit of a more open, connected and challenging relationship with their executive team. Such an endeavour holds the promise of creating a deep and lasting platform for joined-up leadership. Consequently, we think those in leadership development need to undertake real work, with the caveat that in the leadership terrain ‘real work’ is relational so, while this might need a project as a catalyst, let us not lose sight of relationality.</p>
<p>What we have outlined here is a form of development that corresponds intimately to leadership practice beyond the programme/intervention. Facilitation needs to use such interactions as ‘case in point’ learning, firstly making the frames visible and unpacking the meanings and dynamics inherent in them, and secondly tracking the framing movements that kindle, stretch and span these frames. If framing can be facilitated and developed with individual managers, then it can also be facilitated and developed with groups. Our identification of these framing movements can, at the very least, name three processes that may be worked with as groups create new realities and rationalities together. Equally these three movements can be used to expose how processes of influence, creativity and strategy are progressed or blocked within interactions. Questions about why some contributions make an impact while others get no response, why in some instances ideas build and in others go round in circles, are central to understanding how collectives accomplish direction and momentum. Those are the leadership practices that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712451185">Rost (1991)</xref> described as ‘black boxed’; it would be a huge step forward to be able to shed light on them, while also building greater reflexivity and agility.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Both leader development and leadership development are central to organizations’ practice of the kind of leadership that recognizes complexity, pursues new possibilities, and focuses on collective capacity building. New ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies are required to work with the concepts and practices of leadership in ways that foreground emergence, relationships, interaction and meaning. Outlined in this article are a processual ontology, a relational epistemology and a methodology privileging conversation, frames and framing.</p>
<p>We accept that there are limitations in this research and accordingly future research possibilities. Two episodes from online conversations within one blended learning programme are too specific and narrow to theorize too broadly beyond the context of online leadership development experience. Addressing how sociality might provide similar or different contributions to ‘offline’ leadership lies thus outside the legitimate borders of this inquiry, although intuitively we might suppose that kindling, spanning and stretching have an existence and value in more varied spheres. We also acknowledge the perennial limitation of discursive or interactive research of this type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712451185">Ospina and Foldy, 2010</xref>) in being unable to address the terrain and particularly outcomes or actions that lie beyond the interaction. So while this group certainly did shift palpably to an expedition frame with their senior executive by the end of the programme, we cannot know what tangibly resulted or was sustained as a result of the framing dynamics outlined here. Finally, although the frames were identified and tested out with participant, executive and facilitation groups associated with the programme, the analysis of the movements between the frames had not been completed by the end of the programme and hence we have not seen these worked more consciously and directly with those in the pursuit of leadership development, leaving the active pursuit and acquisition of these dynamics through development an unanswered question.</p>
<p>However, we can offer some practical implications from this study for the design and delivery of leadership development programmes that use virtual learning technologies. Firstly, developmentally orientated online learning sites cannot be approached primarily as sites of content transmission and acquisition, but should instead be regarded as liminal spaces that invite community formation, relational dynamics, collaborative energies and work-like processes. The more rich and unconstrained an interactional environment, the more immediate, experimental and interactive will be the choices possible for, and visible to, participants. Such choices increase the likelihood of those agentic understandings and possibilities so core to leadership practice.</p>
<p>Secondly, the leadership development facilitation role in an interactive online environment needs to draw on an array of perhaps less conventional facilitator roles. We see a need for: (i) punctuation, where facilitators briefly pause the conversation and highlight either frames or framing movements to increase their visibility; (ii) reflective commentary, where facilitators observe and feed back what they are seeing over the course of the conversation; and (iii) brokering, where facilitators facilitate new conversations between members of a group or try to broker conversations from an online group with other groups in or beyond an organization. In short, facilitation is orientated towards making processes such as these framing movements visible, creating conversations where participants learn about them in the work they are doing together, and catalyzing the relational work on which so much of leadership depends.</p>
<p>There are various practices that are imperative in strengthening sociality. Foremost among these is curiosity, sustained questioning, a comfort with ambiguity and confusion, and the ability to live within complexity. These are direct drivers of all three of our framing movements, coupled with activities and challenges that require participants to sense-give, sense-make, interpret, respond and challenge each other. We hope our inquiry offers the confidence that such practices and activities can be co-constructed in an online environment in ways that parallel and embed the leadership conversations, relationships and work undertaken offline.</p>
