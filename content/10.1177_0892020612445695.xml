<abstract>
<p>The Australian school context has been something of a failed test case of trying to organise schooling around the tenets of the market as a regulating mechanism. The result has been an intensification of social stratification as the already ‘disadvantaged’ miss out yet again in education. This short paper argues that what is needed to interrupt and puncture this unfortunate policy trajectory, is to begin to include the desires, wishes, lives and experiences of young people − and the way to do this is through the promotion of policy approaches that are informed by and celebrate ‘student voice’.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has to be a compelling reason for doing research that has a ‘student voice’ focus because it is complex, costly and demanding research to do. You have to have a highly developed capacity to empathise with the situations of young people and be open to listening to perspectives from young informants that do not fit with conventional interpretations as they are involved in the identity formation process of ‘becoming somebody’ − all the while trying to contain your rage at a systemic process that is policy deaf to these young lives.  </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0892020612445695">
<title>Context</title>
<p>In the Australian context in which I have been doing this kind of research for nearly three decades, we have all of the circumstances of the ‘perfect storm’, and the reasons for doing student-voiced research are not only compelling, but they are also incontrovertible. </p>
<p>First, the effect of not having such a mindset comes across as an ‘adult knows best’ syndrome in which the focus is exclusively on comparative international performance, economic competitiveness and, by and large, a failure to seek or embrace any understandings from young people themselves as to the complexity of what is happening in their lives, and the maturity they bring in approaching things outside of their school lives. The result is that young people, especially those from the most complex, challenging, and disadvantaged circumstances, continue to be ‘failed’ by education systems that neither understand them nor care about giving them meaningful ownership of their education − and it shows! The latest official statistics reveal that in the State of Victoria, Australia, less than 50 per cent of young males from backgrounds designated as ‘low SES’, do not complete school to the end of year 12 (or equivalent), with the figure barely rising to 57 per cent in remote areas, and 60 per cent in metropolitan areas, and with females being only slightly better in each category, resulting in a state-wide average of 64 per cent of young people completing school to end of year 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020612445695">Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, 2009</xref>). Naturally, there is all kind of political posturing and spin to try to explain away these scandalous figures, but in the end, there can be no denying that there is a dominant policy agenda that is totally uncaring and distrustful, and the effects on young people are not hard to see. </p>
<p>Second, the not unrelated reason for the necessity of student-voiced research is that Australia has been a standout case internationally in the way it has enthusiastically and unquestioningly embraced, over the past three or four decades, what can only be politely described as a relentless and unremitting assault on public education. These so-called reforms have their genesis in notions of neoliberalism. We see this in the emphasis on individualisation, self-responsibilisation, school choice and the move to self-managing schools. Such practices are being sutured and held in place by the use of inappropriate accountability regimes such as high-stakes national testing, national curriculum frameworks, standards and benchmarks, which feed into the production of even more dubious league tables. All of these are being ideologically warehoused around the application of flawed notions of the sovereignty of the market as an allocation and distributary mechanism in education. The simple fact is that educational reforms cannot be ‘steered at distance’ away from classrooms and local community contexts. To work, school reformers need to understand the relational essence of schools and why young people attend schools, and how they live their lives inside schools − all of which point us to the crucial importance of student voice. </p>
<p>Third, there is the social stratification that has accompanied these ill-conceived reforms that has meant that those who can exercise choice have fled, and the young people with the most pressing needs are residualised and marginalised in public schools that continue to be ‘named and shamed’, in contexts in which they and their families are regarded in effect as failures in the marketplace. They are unable to exercise choice and mobility, and for good reasons. To take an illustration from the regional town in which I live and work, it has just been revealed that ‘The public high schools in the city enrol 62 per cent of all poor readers in Year 7, but only 26 per cent of all advanced readers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020612445695">Teese, 2011</xref>: 60) − which is taken to mean that public schools are not able to lift literacy to levels of their private school counterparts. Yet another alleged indication of the inherent inadequacy of public schools and their students.</p>

<title>Consequences for institutional leadership and management</title>
<p>Research that starts out from the perspectives of actively and authentically listening to the lives, experiences and aspirations of young people and what works for them inside the learning process, has within it the scope to uncover the impediments, barriers and constraints that turn young people off school in droves. This is what is happening with the extant policy trajectories described above. On the other hand, by adopting approaches that actively listen to young lives, then you:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>stand a chance of hearing the issues as they are existentially experienced by young people, rather than foreclosing this by purporting to have ‘solutions’, but which in effect amount to ‘problems’ that either do not exist, are foreclosed by predetermined answers, or else have no connection at all to what is actually happening;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>develop ways of resolving issues that are likely to impede the learning of young people by integrally involving them from the outset, in articulating what the issues are, and navigating ways in which they will have a commitment to working out how to deal with matters in ways that give them a real modicum of ownership and the likelihood of a positive resolution;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>embrace aspects of young lives that are seen as lying outside of school and that should be ‘parked’ at the school gate or classroom door, but which have a profound effect on learning, and instead dealing with them in open and mature rather than demeaning and punitive ways;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>confront the burning issue of learning ‘relevance’ as seen from the vantage point of young people, and avoid the single most alienating factor that switches them off school, and instead, develop a meaningful curriculum and pedagogy that has a chance of captivating and engaging young people in wanting to learn.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The kind of questions for leaders and managers in schools could not be starker or clearer. They need to be constantly asking questions like the following.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>How are the reforms that are being visited upon my school improving the life chances and opportunities of my students?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Where are the spaces in my school where young people have the unfettered opportunity to have authentic and meaningful (as distinct from tokenistic) ownership of their learning?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can I make it my role and responsibility as the educational leader of the school to ensuring that the school exists and works for young people, and how do I protect them from ill-conceived policies that if not interrupted will damage their lives and life chances by turning them off school?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Who can I work with to form the necessary alliances of solidarity so as to maintain the courage with which to pursue forms of learning that are in the interests of young people?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can I disseminate the startling results that will flow from this alternative, and how can I engender others in having the courage to ‘speak back’ to damaging policies by invoking student voiced approaches?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Unless we address questions like this, the future of education for countless millions of young people will continue to be a stark and meaningless wasteland.</p>
