<p>‘Positioning’ as a marketing tool is about how companies differentiate themselves in the minds of their prospects. ‘Repositioning’ however calls for companies to adjust the perceptions of prospects about either them or their competitors. Thirty-two years ago, a classic book <italic>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</italic> was published—a book that revolutionized the world of marketing. But times have changed. Competition is fiercer. Consumers are savvier. Communications are faster. And once-successful companies are in crisis mode. Jack Trout, legendary marketing strategist, acclaimed author of many marketing classics published in many languages and also President of Trout &amp; Partners Ltd., an international consultancy firm based in Connecticut, along with Steve Rivkin, a naming expert and partner with Trout &amp; Partner, completes and moves beyond his classic book <italic>Positioning</italic> and describes how winning the minds of customers is only part of the road to success and demonstrates the critical role of ‘Repositioning’ in beating the competition in times of change and crisis.</p>
<p>Using real world examples taken from companies of various western countries, the book explains, why repositioning is so important in today’s overcrowded marketplace. Divided into four valuable sections, the text provides various perspectives to conquer the ‘3 Cs’ of business—Competition, Change and Crisis, that can keep a company ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>The authors start with emphasizing that every repositioning programme should start with ‘Competition’ in mind because today the big difference is that what used to be national markets with local companies competing for business has become a single global market with everyone competing for everyone’s business everywhere. Here the book provides a good reading of a powerful framework for establishing a repositioning strategy by not only showing the weaknesses of the competition, but also the strengths and advantages of one’s own company. Reframing the competition means hanging a negative on a rival to reflect a favourable comparison on own selves. Trout and Rivkin cite examples in the olive oil, prestige cars, vodka and other industries showing how this strategy can fence in the competition. However the authors caution that, when a company attacks competition, it may get attacked in return. Also consumers after getting confused may become indifferent to all the offerings whether by the company itself or competition.</p>
<p>The book engrosses the readers by detailing the fact that, ‘Change’ is happening in the competition, the industry and the economy as a whole. Also recent times have educated management that it is a time of uncertainty and ‘crisis’. A company or its competitors may face a crisis due to economic conditions, cost increases, or a serious product or public relations disaster. A failure to meet these challenges, along with the constant threat of being overtaken by the competition, serves to make repositioning a crucial part of overall business strategy. Through examining the potential impact of the competition, change in the market and the potential for crisis within a company or the economy, an organization can meet those challenges through a strong, well planned repositioning strategy.</p>
<p>The book highlights important ways of repositioning to bring change, which add to the intellectual input provided by the book. Adopting new disruptive technology, adding a service to product, oversimplifying company’s message and evolving distribution are some of them. The book stresses that for repositioning, successful marketers need to provide effective leadership, set direction and communicate value to the marketplace. It has been very categorically pointed out that repositioning is about readjusting people’s perceptions, not changing their perceptions. Hence time and patience are key ingredients to repositioning strategy.</p>
<p>The book gives practicing managers some food for thought by pointing out how companies can go wrong in repositioning themselves. Firstly it is said that trying for convergence of products and using price for repositioning might result in loss of uniqueness offered by company. Secondly, repositioning requires flexibility and size of the organization makes it very difficult. Large organizations have tendency to be inwardly focused because they feel they know everything about the market and as a result fail to understand changing needs of the customers. Managements of companies should also understand that often repositioning is wrongly done by managers due to personal agenda of ‘making a mark’, rather than what is best for the company. Authors emphasize that repositioning for growth can be a trap. Growth is the by-product of doing things right, but not a worthy goal. Even mergers and joint ventures do not necessarily mean that ‘repositioning’ is a must, because even big brand names do not guarantee innovation.</p>
<p>One grey shade of the book is its western world context only in text and examples. If the book includes Indian context, it would enhance the acceptability of the book in India. However this aspect in no way undermines the immense utility of the book.</p>
<p>The book which has the basic objective of providing an insight of how to adapt, compete—and succeed through repositioning, provides a powerful combination of theory and practical application that can be utilized to strengthen an organization while leaving the competition far behind. Hence it is appropriately suited for reading by students of marketing management as well as practicing product and brand managers of various sectors of industry. Jack Trout has retooled his most effective positioning strategies— providing a must-have arsenal of proven marketing techniques specifically redesigned for current climate and convincingly brought out that winning in today’s world is often a matter of repositioning.</p>
