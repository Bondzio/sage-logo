<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Joel Pessa is a surgical anatomist who has published many detailed studies of human anatomy, particularly of the face. I believe that the book he has coauthored with Rod Rohrich, <italic>Facial Topography: Clinical Anatomy of the Face</italic>—which I will review in detail here—will take its proper place aside other classic studies of human microcirculation in the trunk and extremities, namely those of Manchot,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484494">1</xref></sup> Salmon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484494">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484494">3</xref></sup> and Taylor and Plamer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484494">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The basic premise of the book, and what makes it stand out from other texts in the field, is that subunits of the face are partitioned by fascial planes. The presumed purpose of these planes is to protect the embedded vascular and nervous structures from shear forces. The fascial protection of vessels and nerves coursing through movable tissue was previously noted by both Manchot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484494">1</xref></sup> and Salmon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484494">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484494">3</xref></sup> Although defined perforator vascular territories are not new ideas, the authors’ concept that fat is compartmentalized is novel. This conclusion is based on the diffusion patterns of dye injected into various areas of fat, and is part of the authors’ extensive, detailed research that is worth reading.</p>

<title>Strengths</title>
<p>The photography in this text is exhaustive and clear, and the illustrations by Amanda Yarberry Behr meet the unequaled standard typical of Quality Medical Publishing books. Furthermore, the illustrations defining fat “compartments” within the face with water-soluble ink injection are visually appealing and facilitate better understanding of the anatomy being described.</p>
<p>This book also contains an excellent dissection of the temporal fossa—an area seldom addressed in anatomic texts. This dissection is relevant to defining the course of the frontal branch of the facial nerve, as well as to identifying the fat pads surrounding the layers of the “superficial temporal fascia” (“temporoparietal fascia”). Also, the authors’ detailed dissection of the orbit parallels the excellent atlases of Zide and Jelks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484494">5</xref></sup> Dissection of the nasal area completes the text.</p>
<p>The authors efficiently extrapolate their findings into surgical principles. First, they conclude that cutaneous creases are a guide to underlying vasculature. For instance, they propose that the supratrochlear arteries in the glabella correspond to vertical corrugator creases and that the preauricular crease corresponds to the course of the superficial temporal artery. The authors conclude that “creases” are associated with deep vessels. “Wrinkles,” on the other hand, are correlated with superficial vessels. The clinical importance of these observations is in avoidance of intravascular injection when using fillers such as hyaluronic acids.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the most significant conclusion of the book pertains to the apparent delineation of separate fat compartments within the face. The authors define a large number of superficial as well as deep fat compartments, based on dye diffusion patterns. They then conclude that deflations in these compartments are a major contributor to age-related facial changes. The presence of these deep compartments has been confirmed by other authors utilizing computerized tomography imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484494">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The authors also conclude that the deeper fat compartments, specifically the deep medial compartment beneath the mimetic lip elevators and the lateral suborbicularis fat (SOOF) over the malar area, are the most applicable to volume injection. Injection into the deep medial compartment is theorized to decrease the depth of the upper cheek-lip fold (nasolabial fold), while injection above the periosteum of the SOOF is theorized to increase malar prominence and improve the lid-cheek junction. Although such conclusions are logical and contribute to the progression of knowledge in this area, clinical documentation of the effectiveness of these techniques requires confirmation.</p>

<title>Weaknesses</title>
<p>Since this is an anatomic atlas, there are few definitive weaknesses. One might choose to question the proposed relationship of surface creases and wrinkles to underlying vasculature. One might also question the proposed surgical significance of the fat compartments.</p>

<sec id="section4-1090820X13484494">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, this text is a meticulous dissection study of the anterior forehead and face. However, the more important contribution is the introduction of the concept of compartmentalization of the cheek fat. As the role of fat atrophy in the aging face is subject to much analysis, the compartment observation delineates a potential pattern of correction and would be a worthwhile point of study for any cosmetic physician performing procedures (surgical and nonsurgical) on the face.</p>
