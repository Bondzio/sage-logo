<abstract>
<p>We examined the validity of ‘Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change’ six stages in exercise domain. A paper-pencil survey was completed by 457 workers. Self-efficacy tended to increase from Precontemplation to Action, did not change from Action to Maintenance, and then increase from Maintenance to Termination. Pros tended to increase and cons decrease only from Precontemplation to Action. A follow-up survey was completed by 331 workers. More preparers (25.4%) moved to Action compared to precontemplator (3.8%) and contemplators (6.5%). Relapse rates were lower among those in Termination (17.0%) than those in Action (43.8%) and Maintenance (38.1%). These results partially supported the validity.</p>

<p>Regular exercise is beneficial for maintaining physical and mental health. Despite such benefits, the number of people who do not exercise regularly is relatively high worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312437262">World Health Organization, 2004</xref>). In addition, a majority of people who begin an exercise program tend to drop out within one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312437262">Sallis and Owen, 1999</xref>). An accurate model of behavior change is necessary to understand how and why people first initiate and then maintain regular exercise, since such a model could help formulate effective interventions to help people to be physically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312437262">Mâsse et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312437262">Prochaska and DiClemente, 1983</xref>) is one of the models that have been broadly used for health behaviour change (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312437262">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312437262">Kirk et al., 2010</xref>). Applied to regular exercise, it describes behavior change as a progression through six stages of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312437262">Prochaska et al., 2008</xref>): Precontemplation (not intending to exercise regularly in the next six months); Contemplation (intending to exercise regularly in the next six months); Preparation (exercising but irregularly); Action (exercising regularly for less than six months); Maintenance (exercising regularly for more than six months but less than five years), and Termination (exercising regularly for more than five years, having 0% temptation to relapse and 100% self-efficacy to exercise regularly).</p>

<p>Stage of change is predictive of initiation or maintenance of a health behavior. The first three stages of change are expected to differ with regard to the probability of future initiation of regular exercise associated with them. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312437262">Blissmer et al. (2010)</xref> reported that the first three stages are related differentially to future progression to Action or Maintenance across three very different behaviors including smoking cessation, sun protection behavior, and diet. Progression from the Preparation stage has higher probability than from the Contemplation stage. Likewise, progression from the Contemplation stage has higher probability than from the Precontemplation stage. In addition, the TTM assumes that people in the Action, Maintenance, and Termination stages are different in terms of their risk of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312437262">Prochaska and Marcus, 1994</xref>). There is less likelihood of relapse from the Maintenance stage than from the Action stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312437262">Lowther et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The TTM also includes other constructs affecting stage transitions, such as self-efficacy, temptation, pros, cons, and processes of change. Among these, self-efficacy, pros, and cons are assumed to mediate stage transitions. Self-efficacy is defined here as confidence that one can continue to exercise despite situations that tempt one to stop regular exercise. Pros and cons represent weighting advantages and disadvantages of initiating or maintaining regular exercise. Self-efficacy regarding exercise increases in a non-linear way through the advancing stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312437262">Marshall and Biddle, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312437262">Marshall and Biddle (2001)</xref>’s meta-analytic study reported that a medium effect existed between Precontemplation and Contemplation, small to medium between Contemplation and Preparation, and medium between Preparation and Action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312437262">Fallon and colleagues (2005)</xref> reported that self-efficacy was substantially higher among individuals in Termination than those in Maintenance, which was substantially higher than those in Action. Pros increase and cons decrease clearly with stage progression, but do so non-linearly. For Pros, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312437262">Marshall and Biddle (2001)</xref>’s meta-analytic study reported that a large effect existed between Precontemplation and Contemplation, very small between Contemplation and Preparation and small between Preparation and Action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312437262">Fallon et al. (2005)</xref> reported that pros for exercise was not substantially different from Action to Maintenance to Termination. For cons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312437262">Marshall and Biddle (2001)</xref> indicated that small to medium effects existed between Pre-contemplation and Contemplation, between Contemplation and Preparation, and between Preparation and Action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312437262">Fallon et al. (2005)</xref> reported that cons for exercise was not substantially different from Action to Maintenance to Termination.</p>
<p>Most previous studies based on the TTM in the exercise domain have examined five stages in which Termination has not been defined, so that one can consider the Maintenance and Termination stages to be combined (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312437262">Marshall and Biddle, 2001</xref>). The requirements of 100 percent self-efficacy and 0 percent temptation may be too strict, and Termination may be not realistic for the majority of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312437262">Prochaska et al., 2008</xref>). In these studies, individuals who have exercised regularly for more than six months have been regarded as being in Maintenance. In contrast, there is relatively a small number of empirical studies that consider the Maintenance and Termination stages separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312437262">Cardinal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312437262">Cardinal and Levy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312437262">Fallon and Hausenblas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312437262">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312437262">Fallon et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is, however, potentially useful to deal with Maintenance and Termination separately in the exercise domain, with removal of the requirements of self-efficacy and temptation, for understanding the mechanism of relapse and long-term maintenance. Stopping regular exercise can occur for individuals who have already exercised regularly for more than six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312437262">Annesi, 1996</xref>). Most previous studies have regarded these individuals as being in the Maintenance stage. In this group, it is likely that some individuals maintain regular exercise, while the others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312437262">Cardinal, 1999</xref>). Assuming another stage in which people continue regular exercise for more than six months may enable us to understand how and why people continue to maintain regular exercise. Thus, dealing with Maintenance and Termination separately may enable us to explore predicators of relapse and long-term maintenance of regular exercise, by examining factors affecting stage transitions from Action to Maintenance and from Maintenance to Termination.</p>
<p>Usefulness of dealing with Maintenance and Termination stages is also highlighted by the fact that inconsistent results of long-term stage-matched intervention studies have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312437262">Adams and White, 2005</xref>). Some studies have reported significant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312437262">Jonhson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312437262">2008</xref>), while others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312437262">Kirk et al., 2009</xref>). Increasing our knowledge about predictors of stage movements may provide useful information to formulate more effective interventions.</p>
<p>Validity of stage classification, or classifying the process of exercise behavior change into six stages of change through which people initiate and maintain regular exercise, presupposes such exploration. Two approaches have been applied to test the validity of this stage classification, but the previous findings are limited, as described as follows. The present study will be carried out to overcome these limitations and provide further support for the stage classification.</p>
<p>One approach previous studies used was to find relationships between the stages of change and the TTM constructs predicted by the TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312437262">Velicer et al., 1998</xref>). It is important to investigate non-linear patterns for validating the stage classification (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312437262">Armitage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312437262">Armitage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312437262">Sutton, 2000</xref>) when examining inter-stage differences. Linear increases or decreases of key TTM variables are indicative of a pseudo-stage model, not a true stage model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312437262">Sutton, 2000</xref>). One of example of a non-linear relation is that substantial difference exists between some stages (eg, Precontemplation and Contemplation), but not between other stages (eg, Contemplation and Preparation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312437262">Armitage et al., 2003</xref>). If there are such linear relations, researchers can assume any number of stages and support it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312437262">Sutton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312437262">Weinstain et al., 1998</xref>). Previous studies have provided some support. The generalizability of the findings is, however, limited in that no study has examined the relationships between the six stages of change and other TTM constructs. Examining all six stages simultaneously will provide a more comprehensive picture of how these important TTM mediators change through the exercise behavior change process, and represents a more critical test of the theory.</p>
<p>Another approach used in previous research was to examine the predicted differences of probability for initiating or quitting regular exercise in the first three and the later three stages, respectively. Some studies have reported findings that are consistent with the predictions with regard to the differences of rates of progression and relapse in the first three and the other stages, respectively (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312437262">Callaghan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312437262">Plotnikoff et al., 2001</xref>). These studies showed that the first three stages indicated differential probability of progression to the Action stage, but combined the stages of Maintenance and Termination. It remains unknown whether the portions of people who relapse are different between Action, Maintenance, and Termination. These differences are highly important for examining the validity of stage classification. If these stages are similar in regarding the risk of relapse, the validity of dividing people who exercise regularly into three stages would be highly challenged.</p>
<p>The purposes of this study were three-fold. The first purpose was to compare self-efficacy, pros, and cons for regular exercise across all the six stages of change. We predicted that self-efficacy would increase with stage advancement. We also predicted pros would increase from pre-Action to Action stage, but then would not change substantially from Action to Maintenance to Termination, while the opposite would be true for cons. The second purpose was to examine the portions of participants progressing to and ending up at the Action stage from each of the Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation stages. We predicted that a portion of preparers moving to the Action stage would be higher than that of Contemplators, which would be higher than that of Precontemplators. The third purpose was to compare those portions of people from each of the stages of Action, Maintenance, and Termination who relapse to pre-Action stages. We predicted that a portion of relapse would be lower in Termination than that in Maintenance, which would be lower than that in Action.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Of 1000 workers whom were asked to volunteer for the present study, 61 female and 402 male workers (response rate = 46.3%) completed the baseline survey from two manufacturing factories in Saga prefecture, Japan, in July 2010. The relatively low response rate may be explained by voluntary nature of the survey. Mean age, height, weight, and BMI of 402 men were 38.9 years (SD = 12.1), 1.7 meters (SD = 0.1), 65.3 kg (SD = 10.6), and 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD = 3.1), respectively. On the other hand, for the 61 women, mean age, height, and weight were 39.3 years (SD = 11.5), 1.6 meters (SD = 0.1), 51.0 kg (SD = 7.2), and 20.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD = 2.7), respectively. Two-hundred-forty-six workers (53.1 %) were factory workers, while the remaining workers (46.9 %) were office workers. Although no data was collected directly, it was expected that most workers had high school or higher education. We cannot know how representative the sample is of Japanese manufacturing workers, due to the lack of data of a representative sample.</p>
<p>Three hundred thirty-one workers also participated in the 3-month follow-up survey. We chose this relatively short interval, since it was convenient for us. Mean age, height, weight, and BMI of 291 men were 38.7 years (SD = 12.0), 1.7 meters (SD = 0.1), 65.6 kg (SD = 10.1), and 22.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD = 3.0), respectively. On the other hand, those variables for the 40 women were 38.6 years (SD = 10.6), 1.6 meters (SD = 0.1), 51.7 kg (SD = 8.1), and 21.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD = 3.1), respectively.</p>

<p>The stage of change was assessed using this algorithm that divides people into the five stages, the model in which Termination is not defined. The original item for Termination was added by the authors. The participants were given a definition of regular exercise as engaging in 20–30 minutes exercise such as walking twice or more per week, and then were asked: ‘Are you engaging in regular exercise currently?’ This definition of regular exercise was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312437262">Oka (2000)</xref>. They were instructed to choose one of the following six items which best represented their current practice of regular exercise and readiness to initiate it: (1) ‘No. I have no intention to begin in the next six months.’ (Precontemplation stage); (2) ‘No. But I intend to begin in the next six months.’ (Contemplation stage); (3) ‘No. But I exercise irregularly.’ (Preparation stage); (4) ‘Yes. I have been practicing for less than six months.’ (Action stage); (5) ‘Yes. I have been practicing for at least six months.’ (Maintenance stage); or (6) ‘Yes. I have been practicing for more than five years (termination stage).’ Based on the notion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312437262">Fallon and Hausenblas (2001)</xref> that 100 percent self-efficacy and 0 percent temptation may not be proper for the exercise domain, we excluded these requirements. The authors considered that removal of these requirements for Termination would result in more frequent assignment of the participant to Termination. But these requirements have been removed in a recent study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312437262">Fallon et al. (2005)</xref> as well, so it was decided to remove it before the research. Two-week test-retest reliability (r = 0.75) and validity of the original algorithm (five stages) were supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312437262">Oka, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The ethics committee at Kurume University approved the present study. Prior to the survey, permission was obtained from factory managers to distribute the questionnaire to each worker. Each questionnaire was distributed to each worker by an industrial nurse and/or manager. Each participant received the explanation about the voluntary nature of the survey as well as the purpose of the study. Informed written consent was obtained from each participant. A collection box was placed for articipating workers to drop off their questionnaires at each factory. The workers were asked to complete the questionnaire if they were willing to volunteer for the survey and to return it to the box within two weeks. No additional contact to each worker was made during this period. It depended completely on each participant whether he/she completed the questionnaire at home or on-site. The follow-up survey was conducted three months later in the same way. The content and procedure of the survey were comparable to those of the baseline survey. Only the workers who participated in the baseline survey were requested to complete the questionnaire. The response rate of the follow-up survey was 71.5 percent. It is not known why some workers refused to participate in the follow-up survey, but one possible reason might be the voluntary nature of the survey.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistically significance was set at less than 5 percent. The scores for self-efficacy, pros, and cons were converted into T-scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50, SD=10). To test the first purpose of the study, a multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used, with Tukey’s post-hoc tests and with stage of change as independent variable, to examine differences in self-efficacy, pros, and cons. Data from 457 of the 463 workers who completed the baseline survey were used for the analyses.</p>
<p>To test the second purpose of the study, the differences for people who progressed to the Action stage over three months were examined using a chi-square test. To test the third purpose of the study, a chi-square test was conducted to compare replapsers from the Action, Maintenance and Termination stages. In this analysis, relapse was defined as being in an earlier stage at the follow-up survey compared to that at the baseline one. This definition is convenient, but is limited in that the changes in the stages occurring during three month period cannot be evaluated. The data for 331 workers were used for these analyses.</p>

<p>The result of the follow-up ANOVA for self-efficacy indicated a significant effect for stage (F5,451 = 58.74, p&lt;0.01, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.39). Self-efficacy in was significantly higher in Preparation, Action, Maintenance, and Termination than in Precontemplation and Contemplation (all <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). It was also higher in Action, Maintenance, and Termination than in Preparation (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05, and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively). It was higher in Termination than in Maintenance (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in Self-efficacy between Precontemplation and Contemplation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06), between Action and Maintenance (<italic>p</italic>=0.98), and between Action and Termination (<italic>p</italic>=0.06). Self-efficacy tended to be higher in later stages. The differences were more prominent in the pre-Action stages and Action, but were less between post-Action stages. The differences across the six stages indicated non-linear patterns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105312437262">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the follow-up ANOVAs for stage were significant for both pros (F5,451 = 9.58, p&lt;0.01, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.10) and for cons (F5,451 = 21.24, p&lt;0.01, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.19). Effect sizes were medium and large, respectively, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312437262">Cohen (1988)</xref>’s criteria. Pros tended to increase, while cons decreased, with stage progression. Substantial differences were found across the pre-Action stages, but no such differences were found in the later stages. The differences of pros and cons across the six stages showed non-linear patterns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105312437262">Figure 2</xref>). Pros in Precontemplation was significantly lower than in Preparation, Action, Maintenance, and Termination (all <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first purpose of this study was to examine the associations between the six stages of change for regular exercise and the TTM variables including self-efficacy, pros, and cons. Partially consistent with the initial prediction, self-efficacy tended to be higher in later stages, but no significant difference was found for self-efficacy when comparing it in the Action and Maintenance stages. Pros tended to be higher and cons lower from Precontemplation to Action, but no substantial differences were found for them in the Action, Maintenance, and Termination stages. Furthermore, non-linear trends of changes were found in these TTM variables. An unexpected finding was that there was no clear difference in self-efficacy between Action and Maintenance, which was not in line with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312437262">Fallon et al. (2005)</xref>. In addition, there was no substantial difference in pros between the first two stages, which was not consistent with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312437262">Marshall and Biddle (2001)</xref>, that the difference of pros between these stages was substantial and robust across the studies examined. It is necessary to collect more data on inter-stage differences of TTM variables across all six stages for improved characterization of each stage. With that said, present findings helped us to see that if increase in self-efficacy stagnates, regular exercise might lapse and that pros and cons may be influential only pre-Action stages. This study provided the first evidence that increases of self-efficacy of pros and decrease of cons across the six stages show non-linear patterns, providing partial support for the validity of applying the six stages of change to regular exercise.</p>
<p>The second purpose of the present study was to investigate the differences of the portions of people who progressed to Action from each of Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation. It was predicted that participants would be more likely to progress from Preparation to Action than from Contemplation to Action, and the least likely would be to progress from Precontemplation to Action. Partially consistent with the prediction, we found that more preparers moved to Action compared to Precontemplator and Contemplators. The difference of portions between the first two stages was in a predicted direction, but was not substantial. The results are partially in line with those of previous studies (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312437262">Callaghan et al., 2010</xref>). These findings also provided further but partial support for validity of stage classification.</p>
<p>The third purpose of the present study was to compare the differences of portions of people who relapsed to pre-Action stages from each of Action, Maintenance, and Termination. It was predicted that relapse from Termination would be less likely than from Maintenance, which would be less likely than from Action. Partially consistent with the prediction, we found higher rates of relapse in Action and Maintenance compared to that in Termination. The difference of relapse rate between Action and Maintenance was in a predicted direction, but relatively small (43.8 % versus 38.1 %). This study provided first evidence to suggest that different levels of relapse risk occur in the Action, Maintenance and Termination stages. These results provided partial support for the validity for dividing individuals who exercise regularly into these three stages, and the six stage classification in the domain of exercise.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the differences in relapse rates between Maintenance and Termination stages may be that self-efficacy differs between Maintenance and Termination, and self-efficacy has been found to be inversely related to relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312437262">Callaghan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312437262">O’Hea et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312437262">Plotnikoff, et al., 2001</xref>). We found that self-efficacy was higher in Termination than in the Maintenance stage. Therefore, lower rate of relapse may be found in Termination than in the Maintenance stage.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study is that it is impossible to determine causal relationships between stage of change and self-efficacy, pros, and cons with regard to analyses to achieve the first purpose. Use of cross-sectional design has been reported to provide a weak test of a stage model of behavior change such as the TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312437262">Weinstein et al., 1998</xref>). However, the cross-sectional design in the present study is still reasonable, since no study has examined the differences of self-efficacy, pros, and cons across the all six stages. Despite the contribution of the present study, it has been suggested that a longitudinal design including experimental and intervention studies should be used to examine relationships between stages of change and other TTM variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312437262">Herzog et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312437262">Plotnikoff et al., 2001</xref>). The second limitation is that only self-efficacy, pros, and cons were examined, due to the lack of measures for processes of change and temptation in Japanese. It would be useful to examine these constructs in future studies. Third, we defined relapse as being in an earlier stage at the follow-up survey than that at the baseline one, and could not examine any stage movements that occurred during the interval. It is necessary to collect data more frequently. Fourth, we carried out two surveys with an interval of three months. With such a short follow-up, particular stage transitions (eg, pre-Action to Maintenance and Termination) can not occur. In addition, it is possible that more frequent relapse from post-Action stages and progression to post-Action stages from pre-Action stages can occur. It is necessary to conduct a longer follow-up. Fifth, we focused on examining the validity of stage classification, but further clarification of TTM predictors of stage movements including relapse from post-Action stages need to be established.</p>
