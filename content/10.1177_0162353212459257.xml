<abstract>
<p>The current study explores the potential relationships among perceived parenting style, perfectionism, and creativity in a high-ability and high-achieving young adult population. Using data from 323 honors college students at a Midwestern university, bivariate correlations suggested positive relationships between (a) permissive parenting style and creativity and (b) authoritarian parenting style and socially prescribed perfectionism. Furthermore, negative relationships were also found between authoritarian parenting style and creativity. These relationships were further investigated using a path model that included control variables for gender and parent education level. Findings suggest statistically significant relationships between creativity and gender, authoritarian parenting and socially prescribed perfectionism, authoritarian parenting and creativity, and permissive parenting and creativity.</p>

<p>The ability to think creatively, to produce novel and appropriate responses and outcomes in given situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212459257">Brown, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353212459257">Plucker, Beghetto, &amp; Dow, 2004</xref>), will be paramount for individuals to succeed in a competitive, global environment. Although creative-thinking skills are important for all individuals, they are particularly important for high-ability individuals, as they are more likely to enter professions such as medicine, engineering, and technological fields that demand problem-solving skills and innovation. To succeed in these professions, high-ability learners cannot rely on mastery of content alone but need to hone their creative-thinking skills as well. Acknowledgment of this realization leads parents and educators to then pose the following question: What factors influence creative-thinking skills in high-ability students? Gaining an understanding of this question will allow parents and educators to adapt their styles to more effectively develop creative-thinking skills in high-ability students. To determine potential influences on creativity within a high-ability and high-achieving population, a review of previous research is first necessary.</p>
<p>Creativity has been extensively studied in educational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212459257">Andiliou &amp; Murphy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459257">Dai, Swanson, &amp; Cheng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212459257">Piirto, 2004</xref>). Yet, despite the broad accumulated knowledge on the topic, more research is needed to understand what aspects of personality affect creative expression and how background experiences influence the development of creativity. It is also important to determine precisely what is meant by the term <italic>creativity</italic>, as many researchers in the field are not even in complete agreement about the exact nature of this construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459257">Davis, 2004</xref>). For the purpose of this study, a widely used and basic description of the construct would be any behavior or outcome that is both “novel” and “appropriate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212459257">Brown, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353212459257">Plucker et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, in our discussions of creativity, we implicitly refer to what is known as <italic>little c</italic> creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459257">Davis, 2004</xref>). This type of little c creativity is demonstrated through everyday problem solving by relatively ordinary people, as opposed to <italic>Big C</italic> creativity, that is demonstrated by individuals such as artists or scientists who are well known and distinguished in their domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212459257">Csikszentmihalyi, 1996</xref>). As little c creativity can be investigated in larger groups of individuals, rather than only with a few eminent people in a particular field, it is the preferred conceptualization for the current study.</p>
<p>In addition to the little c/Big C distinction, within the field of creativity research, there is also an ongoing debate over the manifestation of creativity. Some claim that creativity is specific to individual domains such as music, fine arts, writing, or science and that the characteristics and skills necessary for creativity in a certain domain do not translate to other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212459257">Baer, 1994</xref>). However, others assert that creativity is a more general trait or cognitive skill that can be expressed in a wide range of circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353212459257">Plucker, 1998</xref>). This debate is discrete from, yet also related to, the little c/Big C issue, insofar as Big C is demonstrated within specific fields and would therefore support a more domain-specific conceptualization of creativity. The converse idea that domain generality can be connected with little c creativity, as a general cognitive skill would be more apparent in everyday problem solving, also applies to the conceptualization of creativity used in the current study. Although it is true that some researchers prefer to conceptualize little c creativity in conjunction with domain specificity (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0162353212459257">Root-Bernstein &amp; Root-Bernstein, 2004</xref>), for the purposes of the current study, a little c/domain-general perspective will be applied.</p>
<p>Because a domain-general, little c creativity is applicable to a variety of individuals and across many different domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459257">Davis, 2004</xref>), the measure of creativity should also be consistent with this conceptualization. A variety of creativity measures exist, and range from self-report measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212459257">Gough, 1979</xref>) to divergent thinking assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0162353212459257">Torrance, 1998</xref>) to ratings of creative products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212459257">Amabile, 1982</xref>). Self-report measures are methodologically the most efficient, and as they explicitly assess multiple aspects of creativity are the most reflective of a little c, domain-general perspective. The dimensions of creativity can be cognitive in nature, such as use of imagination or intellectual problem solving; behavioral, such as engaging in creative activities; or affective and emotional, such as desire for spontaneity and openness to ideas. One such self-report measure, the Scale of Creative Attributes and Behaviors (SCAB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212459257">Kelly, 2004</xref>), defines these various dimensions of creativity as creative engagement, creative cognitive style, spontaneity, tolerance, and fantasy.</p>
<p>Creativity research is often categorized into a focus on four different variables: person, process, product, and press—the 4 Ps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459257">Davis, 2004</xref>). The person component emphasizes the internal personality characteristics of creative individuals, the process component looks at the internal processes that take place during creative expression, the product component explores the characteristics of products considered to be creative, and the press component investigates the ways in which environment can influence creativity. It is crucial to note that the 4 Ps are not considered to be separate types of creativity, but instead as potential lenses through which researchers can design, explore, and interpret investigations of creativity. Viewing creativity from these potential lenses is consistent with a multidimensional understanding of creativity. Although they are often presented as separate categories, it is nevertheless important to explore how these components intermingle in the manifestation of creativity. For example, the person component may affect the process, which in turn can affect the final product, all of which can be influenced by the press of the situation. The current study attempted to examine one potential connection among these components by investigating how the <italic>press</italic> component of parenting style, along with the <italic>person</italic> component of perfectionism, can affect creativity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162353212459257">
<title>Parenting Styles</title>
<p>The notion of different types of parenting styles has received a great deal of attention in developmental psychology through the past four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212459257">Berk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212459257">Crain, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212459257">Baumrind (1978)</xref> described different parenting styles, which vary according to their degree of responsiveness and demandingness. An authoritative style exhibits high levels of responsiveness and demandingness. Authoritative parents make reasonable demands, but are very accepting of their children as well. An authoritarian style exhibits a high level of demandingness but a low level of responsiveness. Authoritarian parents are very strict with their children and emphasize discipline over nurturing. A permissive style exhibits a low level of demandingness but a high level of responsiveness. Permissive parents are very accepting but exhibit less control over their children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353212459257">Maccoby and Martin (1983)</xref> also described a fourth parenting style, indifferent, in which parents show low levels of responsiveness and demandingness. Indifferent parents have little interest or involvement in the child’s life.</p>
<p>These parenting styles may have an effect on creativity, although this effect can vary by age, gender, and different cultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212459257">Chao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459257">Coolahan, McWayne, Fantuzzo, &amp; Grim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353212459257">Snowden &amp; Christian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0162353212459257">Tennent &amp; Berthelsen, 1997</xref>). Harsh treatment, such as that found in psychically and emotionally abusive parent–child relationships, along with excessive control and demands, can lead to low levels of creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353212459257">Pandey, 2005</xref>). Research also suggests that authoritarian mothers are less likely to provide home environments conducive to creativity, instead establishing restrictive environments that inhibit growing independence; use physical means of discipline; and expect children to not make mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0162353212459257">Tennent &amp; Berthelsen, 1997</xref>). This negative relationship between parental control and creativity has also been demonstrated in laboratory settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212459257">Gronick, Gurland, DeCourcey, &amp; Jacob, 2002</xref>). Because authoritarian parenting style is characterized by harsh treatment and high levels of control, it is important to further understand how various components of this and other parenting styles can positively or negatively affect creative expression. Is it the low level of responsiveness, characteristic of the authoritarian style, which negatively affects creativity? If so, should indifferent parenting also be negatively related to creativity? Or is it the high level of demandingness in the authoritarian style, also found with the authoritative style, which contributes to the negative influence?</p>
<p>Results linking responsiveness to creativity have been found in gifted populations as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353212459257">Snowden and Christian (1999)</xref> found that authoritative parenting was important for fostering creativity in young gifted children. In a study of adolescents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212459257">Dacey (1989)</xref> also found that an interest in a child’s behavior with few specific rules to govern it was largely present in the families of highly creative individuals. This type of responsiveness to the child’s behavior is characteristic of the permissive and the authoritative parenting styles. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353212459257">Lim and Smith (2008)</xref> found that higher levels of acceptance, related to authoritative and permissive styles, from parents are associated with higher levels of creativity in children. Given the previous research on the effect of parenting style for gifted and nongifted populations, it may be that responsiveness is the most important dimension for creative expression. Generally, the literature has indicated that parenting styles high in responsiveness (permissive and authoritative) had positive relationships with creativity, whereas the authoritarian style, which is low in responsiveness, was usually negatively related to creativity.</p>

<sec id="section2-0162353212459257">
<title>Perfectionism</title>
<p>In addition to parenting style, perfectionism is another construct that has been studied within gifted populations. Although a debate exists over the precise nature and potential effects of perfectionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212459257">Greenspon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212459257">Parker, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162353212459257">2002</xref>), some evidence suggests that this characteristic is commonly associated with many high-ability and high-achieving individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162353212459257">Parker &amp; Adkins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0162353212459257">Schuler, 2000</xref>). The construct of perfectionism is widely accepted as multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212459257">Frost, Marten, Lahart, &amp; Rosenblate, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212459257">Hewitt and Flett (1991)</xref> defined the dimensions based on the source of the excessively high standards. Self-oriented perfectionists are those that maintain unrealistically high standards for themselves, whereas other-oriented perfectionists have unrealistically high standards for other people. Finally, socially prescribed perfectionists perceive that others have unrealistically high expectations for them. Although some researchers have argued that perfectionism has a healthy component (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162353212459257">Owens &amp; Slade, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0162353212459257">Silverman, 2009</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212459257">Flett and Hewitt (2006)</xref> argued that their research collectively shows that self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism are not healthy but rather associated with various maladaptive tendencies. These researchers assert that <italic>healthy</italic> perfectionism is sometimes confused for conscientiousness, and perhaps this is what others are referring to when they speak of the adaptive aspects of perfectionism.</p>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212459257">Joy and Hicks (2004)</xref> explored the potential relationship between perfectionism and creativity, they found that high degrees of perfectionism were negatively related to creative performance. This negative relationship between creativity and perfectionism has also been found in gifted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212459257">Gallucci, Middleton, &amp; Kline, 2000</xref>). In addition, studies have found that perfectionism correlates with various factors such as stress, anxiety, and concern for mistakes (for a review of studies, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212459257">Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2002</xref>) that have been found to negatively correlate with creativity as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212459257">Curl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0162353212459257">Zhang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also evidence that demonstrates a connection between parenting style and perfectionism. An extensive qualitative study suggested that the development of socially prescribed perfectionism is related to authoritarian parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353212459257">Speirs Neumeister, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0162353212459257">Speirs Neumeister and Finch (2006)</xref> found an indirect relationship between parenting style and perfectionism, reporting that authoritarian and indifferent parenting styles predicted insecure attachment, which then predicted either self-oriented or socially prescribed perfectionism. Research has also indicated that authoritarian styles are related to maladaptive perfectionism, or particularly negative aspects of perfectionism such as excessive doubts and extreme concern for making mistakes, in a college student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212459257">Kawamura, Frost, &amp; Harmatz, 2002</xref>). The emphasis on enforcing strict rules may not only inhibit a freedom for creative expression but can also contribute to the development of strict self-imposed rules. The imposition of strict controls, either from the self or from others, can have a negative effect on creative potential, as authoritarian parenting and perfectionism may decrease creativity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0162353212459257">
<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>As with any psychological construct, certain demographic aspects of an individual can have an effect on his or her personal and social experience, and the concepts of creativity, perfectionism, and parenting style described above are no exception. One must keep in mind that many factors can play a role in explaining individual differences. Therefore, it should be noted that previous research shows gender-based differences in perceptions of parenting style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212459257">McGillicuddy-De Lisi &amp; De Lisi, 2007</xref>), the relationship between parenting style and perfectionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212459257">Flett, Hewitt, &amp; Singer, 1995</xref>), and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212459257">Baer &amp; Kaufman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162353212459257">Rejskind, Rapagna, &amp; Gold, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, research suggests that parenting style may differ depending on socioeconomic status (SES) of families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459257">Coolahan et al., 2002</xref>), with parental education level having great influence on SES in our society. Given this wealth of prior research, it is important to consider these differences in any explanation of how parenting style, perfectionism, and creativity may be related.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0162353212459257">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Based on the results of previous research, the goal of the current study was to explore the relationships among parenting style, perfectionism, and creativity in a population of high-ability and high-achieving college students. It was hypothesized that those parenting styles high in responsiveness (permissive and authoritative) would be positively related to overall creativity, whereas the parenting styles low in responsiveness (authoritarian and indifferent) would be negatively related to overall creativity. Given the multidimensional conceptualization of creativity utilized with this study, more specifically it was predicted that authoritarian parenting style would be negatively related to creative engagement. This hypothesis was derived from the idea that the low responsiveness of authoritarian parenting would contribute to a lack of encouragement for involvement in creative activities. It was also predicted that authoritarian parenting style would be negatively related to the creative aspects of spontaneity and tolerance. These aspects of creativity have affective and emotional components that may be less likely to thrive in environments of high demands but low responsiveness associated with authoritarian parenting. It was expected that authoritative and permissive parenting styles would be positively related to creative engagement and fantasy, as the high responsiveness of these styles is more likely to encourage creative thoughts and activities. Permissive parenting style was also expected to be positively related to spontaneity and tolerance, as the low demandingness coupled with high responsiveness of this style might boost these emotional components. Finally, it was expected indifferent parenting style would be most negatively related to creative engagement, as the low demands and responsiveness of this style would probably not provide children with either the encouragement or resources to engage in many types of creative activities and behaviors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was expected that all three types of perfectionism (self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed) would be negatively related to creativity but positively related to authoritarian parenting style. More specifically, it was expected that the more affective and emotional components of spontaneity and tolerance would be more negatively related to self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism. As these types of perfectionism have an internal target, individuals high in these types of perfectionism may not allow themselves to engage in unplanned, unconventional, and potentially unapproved behavior. In addition, it was expected that other-oriented perfectionism would be negatively related to tolerance, as expecting perfection from others is inconsistent with showing a lenient attitude. Given the prior research suggesting that perfectionism is linked to both parenting style and creativity, a final goal of the current study was also to explore these three constructs together, investigating how parenting style and perfectionism might relate to each other in their influence on creativity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0162353212459257">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 323 students in the honors college of a Midwestern university, ranging in age from 18 to 23 years (<italic>M</italic> = 19.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.5). There were 85 males (26.3%), 230 females (71.2%), and 8 students (2.5%) not reporting their gender. The majority of students (89.8%) reported their ethnicity as Caucasian. Although there are more females than males, and more Caucasian than minority students in the sample, these respondent characteristics do not differ significantly when compared with the demographics of the entire honors college population; therefore, the sample was highly representative of the population and not considered biased in terms of gender or ethnicity. Each class was represented, with freshmen (45.2%), sophomores (18.3%), juniors (12.7%), and seniors (20.4%) included in the sample. A majority (80%) of the students reported that at least one parent had completed a 4-year degree. Admissions to the honors college is based on standardized test scores (SAT and ACT), high school grade point average (GPA), recommendations, and writing samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162353212459257">
<title>Data Collection Procedures</title>
<p>Students were recruited through an email requesting their participation in a research study about the psychological development of giftedness. All students in the honors college received this email, which contained a link to the survey instrument. The surveys were completed online during a single session. An incentive raffle for a free mp3 player was used, and approximately 26% of all honors college students participated. Although this response rate is somewhat lower than desirable, comparisons with population demographics (see above) ensure the representativeness of the sample and generally relieve concern of a self-selection bias by key characteristics. Three separate recruitment periods took place over the spring of 2008, fall of 2008, and spring of 2009. The average completion time, after removing outliers of greater than 2 hr (most likely due to participants leaving the web browser open while leaving the computer or working on other tasks) was 43 min. Students completing the survey instrument more than once had their second set of responses deleted from the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0162353212459257">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The following measures were included in a larger battery of 12 instruments, plus demographic items. The instruments covered topics including creativity, temperament, attachment style, parenting, perfectionism, suicide ideation, social coping, ethnic identity, social dominance, achievement motivation, overexcitability, and personality traits; not all instruments administered are included in the current study. Two versions were administered; each version contained all of the instruments. The order of instruments was counterbalanced between versions to account for potential survey fatigue, as all participants completed all 12 instruments and demographic items.</p>
<sec id="section9-0162353212459257">
<title>Parenting Scales</title>
<p>The parenting style assessment was adapted from a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212459257">Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg, and Dornbusch (1991)</xref>, in which the instrument was designed as part of a larger group of scales to retrospectively determine perceived authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and indifferent parenting styles for the mothers and fathers of participating students. Participants read four descriptive paragraphs, one for each style, and indicated whether the description was characteristic of their mother, father, or other caregiver. If the description was not characteristic of any caregiver, they left it blank. For each style, respondents could score 0 (neither parent), 1 (one parent), 2 (both parents or one parent and one other caregiver), or 3 (both parents and one other caregiver). This produced an ordinal-level variable for each parenting style, indicating the degree of exposure to that particular style; the higher the score, the greater the degree of perceived exposure to the parenting style. Previous research shows that the parenting style descriptions are able to determine predicted patterns in outcomes of psychosocial development, school achievement, internalized distress, and problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212459257">Lamborn et al., 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS)</title>
<p>The MPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212459257">Hewitt &amp; Flett, 1991</xref>) measured perfectionism with a 45-item scale to assess self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism. Participants indicated their level of agreement with statements about certain perceptions and behaviors (i.e., “I strive to be the best at everything I do” and “My family expects me to be perfect”) using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Three subscale scores were calculated from the responses, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perfectionism. Scores for each subscale can range from 15 to 105.

<p>The SCAB is a self-report creativity measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212459257">Kelly, 2004</xref>) designed to assess the dimensions of creative engagement, creative cognitive style, spontaneity, tolerance, and fantasy. This 20-item scale instructs participants to indicate their level of agreement with statements about typical attitudes, characteristics, and behaviors (i.e., “I enjoy creating new things,” “I am flexible in my thinking,” and “I often fantasize”) using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Five subscale scores and one overall score can be calculated from the responses, with higher scores indicating higher levels of creativity.

<title>Analytical Procedures</title>
<p>In the first stage of analyses, a series of bivariate correlations were completed to explore the potential relationships between parenting style and creativity, parenting style and perfectionism, and perfectionism and creativity. In the next stage, we created a structural equation model using our hypothesized relationships suggested by past literature and our findings from the first stage of this study. Creating this path model allowed us to further investigate the relationship between variables while correcting for potential inflation due to multiple correlations. Because AMOS, the statistical package used for analysis of the path model, does not allow for missing values in the computation of modification indices, only those cases without any missing data were included in the model. Perhaps due to the high achievement and conscientiousness of the students in this study, there were very few cases with missing data and thus only a few cases were lost (path model <italic>n</italic> = 298) and these lost cases did not change the makeup of the characteristics of the sample. After determination of acceptable model fit, the path coefficients were examined to review the possible relationships.</p>

<p>Although many of these correlations were significant, it should be noted that the strengths of the correlations were rather weak. In considering the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values, calculated by squaring the correlation coefficient to create an estimate of the explained variance, for many of these relationships, the correlation only explained anywhere from 1% to 4% of the variance. It may be that there is not a strong relationship between the different variables, or it may be that the relationship with parenting style is not reflected well with a linear analysis. Although participants could theoretically score between 0 and 3 on the parenting style measures (with a higher score meaning greater exposure to the style), there was a negative skew for authoritarian and permissive styles, with many participants scoring a 0 and very few scoring a 2 or 3. Mathematically, this limits the variability and reduces the likelihood of getting a strong correlation.</p>

<title>Path Model</title>
<p>To create the most parsimonious path model, only those variables with significant bivariate correlations were selected for inclusion in the model. This combination of bivariate correlations and path analyses has been utilized in previous research with college student scores on multiple self-report instruments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459257">Diseth &amp; Kobbeltvedt, 2010</xref>). Therefore, authoritative parenting style, indifferent parenting style, self-oriented perfectionism, and other-oriented perfectionism were not included in the model. Furthermore, only the overall creativity score was included as an endogenous variable in the model, rather than including each of the subscales, because the overall score was the only creativity measure consistently related to parenting style. When using the traditional measure of model fit (χ<sup>2</sup>), the model had a weak fit. Because the size of the sample inflates the chi-square value, other model-fit indices were considered. The following cutoffs suggest a good fit when testing structural models: Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) values greater than .95, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value less than .06, and PCLOSE should be greater than .05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212459257">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0162353212459257">Table 5</xref>, these tests, even the more conservative RMSEA and PCLOSE, all suggest that the model is a good fit for the data.</p>

<p>The outcome for the path model was overall creativity. Both gender (1 = female) and parental education level (1 = first-generation college student) were exogenous variables in the model. The two parenting styles (authoritarian and permissive) that the correlation analyses showed were related to perfectionism and creativity were also included in the model. Because socially prescribed perfectionism was the only type of perfectionism that was correlated with overall creativity or parenting style, it was the only perfectionism scale included in the model.</p>
<p>Although both indirect and direct effects were explored in the path model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162353212459257">Figure 1</xref>), only four direct relationships were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 or lower). Permissive parenting style was shown to have a statistically significant positive effect on a student’s overall creativity (.162), whereas, in contrast, exposure to an authoritarian parenting style had a negative effect (−.212). This negative effect was actually the strongest influence on a student’s overall creativity. The path coefficient for authoritarian parenting style on socially prescribed perfectionism (.218) suggested a positive relationship and the strongest one in the overall model. Finally, although there is not much literature to support this finding, the negative path coefficient for gender on overall creativity (−.168) suggests that male students reported higher overall creativity. Possible explanations for this finding, as well as the others, are explored in more detail in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several different sets of analyses were completed, each revealing further evidence concerning the relationship between creativity, parenting style, and perfectionism in high-ability and high-achieving young adults. The positive correlation between creativity (overall and fantasy subscale) and permissive parenting suggests that more perceived exposure to a permissive style is related to higher levels of self-reported creativity. This finding provides evidence for a potential strength of a permissive parenting, at least among gifted young adults. The results of the path model also support this potential strength of permissive parenting, as this relationship remained significant even when taking into account the influence of other variables. Although most research provides evidence supporting authoritative parenting as being associated with positive outcomes, this study failed to find evidence for this. Recent research does suggest that the positive outcomes of authoritative parenting may not generalize to other cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212459257">Chao, 2001</xref>). It may be that the high degree of responsiveness found in permissive and authoritative parenting is what is most important for nurturing creativity, but the high degree of demandingness is not as effective for this particular population of high-ability and high-achieving young adults. There is also the possibility that because it is virtually impossible to disentangle genetic and environmental influences, it may also be that more creative parents tend to be more permissive and are passing on their creative traits biologically to their children. This would be an interesting question for future research to address.</p>
<p>The relationship between authoritarian parenting and creativity is more complex to interpret. The negative correlation between authoritarian style and creativity suggests that more perceived exposure to this style is related to lower levels of creativity, and this relationship was also significant in the path model. This finding further supports the potential weaknesses of this style, particularly with a gifted population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212459257">Dwairy, 2004</xref>). The positive correlation between authoritarian style and socially prescribed perfectionism, with more exposure to authoritarian parenting also showing higher levels of perfectionism, replicates previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353212459257">Speirs Neumeister, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0162353212459257">Speirs Neumeister &amp; Finch, 2006</xref>) and provides further evidence for the weaknesses of authoritarian parenting. The results of the path model further elaborate on the relationship between these variables. Even when controlling for gender and first-generation status, the significant relationships between authoritarian parenting style and socially prescribed perfectionism, and authoritarian parenting style and creativity remained. Perceived authoritarian parenting style appears to have detrimental consequences in various areas for high-ability and high-achieving young adults, related to increases in socially prescribed perfectionism and decreases in creativity.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that permissive and authoritarian are the exact opposite styles when considering dimensions of demandingness and responsiveness. Authoritarian parents are high in demandingness and low in responsiveness, whereas permissive parents are low in demandingness and high in responsiveness. These opposite styles had opposite effects on creativity in the model, with permissive as a positive predictor and authoritarian as a negative predictor. It may also be that the combination of both dimensions is the critical piece in understanding the effect of parenting style on creativity.</p>
<p>Further complicating the relationships between the constructs in the model is the idea of conditional acceptance and the effect it can have on perfectionism. Conditional acceptance by parents results in a child’s thinking pattern of “I am acceptable [to my parents] as long as I can perform well [make good grades, win awards, etc.]” and is a pervasive theme in the literature concerning the clinical implications of perfectionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212459257">Greenspon, 2008</xref>). Judgments and critiques may be frequently voiced, and children grow up believing they are never good enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459257">Greenspon, 2011</xref>). However, although conditional acceptance plays a role in the development of perfectionism, it is not necessarily constrained to one particular parenting style, which may additionally obscure patterns in the results.</p>
<p>Although previous literature has demonstrated a link between perfectionism and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212459257">Gallucci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212459257">Joy &amp; Hicks, 2004</xref>), in neither the bivariate correlation nor the path model was socially prescribed perfectionism significantly related to overall creativity. This result may be due to the differences in the various facets of perfectionism in the instrument that was used in this study, or it may be that this finding is not apparent in a high-ability and young adult population. Some highly creative gifted young adults may not be perfectionists, or some may be creative despite their perfectionism. Another potential reason for a lack of relationship between perfectionism and creativity in this study may be the conceptualization of creativity from a domain- general perspective. It could be that in a subpopulation within a specific domain, perfectionism might have greater explanatory power when it comes to domain-specific creativity. Some researchers assert that perfectionism is a facet of the conscientiousness trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459257">MacCann, Duckworth, &amp; Roberts, 2009</xref>), and indeed some have found that conscientiousness is a predictor of self-oriented perfectionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0162353212459257">Stoeber, Otto, &amp; Dalbert, 2009</xref>). Incorporating this research with the findings of a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212459257">Feist (1998)</xref> who found that conscientiousness was related to scientific creativity, but not artistic creativity, one can understand how a domain-general measure of creativity, such as the one included in this study, might not fully capture the relationship. This conclusion is further supported by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353212459257">Kelly and Kneipp (2009)</xref>, which linked scores on the SCAB to artistic vocational interests, suggesting that this domain-general measure might not be the most precise assessment of nonartistic domains.</p>
<p>The age of the sample is an additional piece of information that is important to consider when interpreting the findings of this study. Although the parenting style measure was written in the present tense, the participants were retrospectively responding to the instrument, given that they had approximately two decades of parenting information to contemplate. They could have based responses on their current relationship with their parents or over the course of growing up. It may be that authoritative is related to the most positive outcomes growing up, as the literature suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212459257">Baumrind, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0162353212459257">Roberts Gray &amp; Steinberg, 1999</xref>), but is less important to college students. Perhaps once they become young adults, a more permissive style is associated with more positive outcomes, particularly for high-ability and high-achieving students who may want the support without the demands.</p>
<p>There were also some interesting findings based on the inclusion of the control variables of gender and first-generation student status in the path model. First-generation status was included to account for a potential effect on parenting style, as previous research has suggested that parenting styles can differ depending on the SES of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459257">Coolahan et al., 2002</xref>). However, these paths were not significant in the model. It may be due to the skewed distribution of the sample, as only 20% of the students were first-generation college students. It may also be that these socioeconomic differences in parenting style are not found in families with high-ability or high-achieving children, or that parenting styles were altered to accommodate the special needs of these children. More research with high-ability and high-achieving populations is needed to further explore potential reasons for this finding.</p>
<p>Gender was another control variable that was included based on previous research, but does not consistently reflect prior findings. Although empirical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212459257">McGillicuddy-De Lisi &amp; De Lisi, 2007</xref>) suggests that perceptions of parenting style can differ for males and females, the paths for gender and permissive and authoritarian parenting style were not significant in our model. Furthermore, the paths for gender and socially prescribed perfectionism were not significant in the model. Previous research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212459257">Flett et al. (1995)</xref> found that authoritarian parenting style was related to socially prescribed perfectionism in males, but not females. However, later research with a sample of gifted college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353212459257">Speirs Neumeister, 2004</xref>) did not find evidence for this gender difference. It may be that the distinctive experiences of high-ability and high-achieving individuals, as compared with a more general sample of college students, cancel out the differences between males and females. Again, more research is needed on the family experiences of high-ability and high-achieving students.</p>
<p>The model showed a significant path coefficient from gender to creativity, suggesting that in our sample, males had higher levels of creativity than females. A significant difference in this direction was not expected, as a majority of research indicates no gender differences for creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212459257">Baer &amp; Kaufman, 2008</xref>) or slightly favors females on measures of verbal creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162353212459257">Rejskind et al., 1992</xref>). It may be that males and females vary in different types or aspects of creativity, and some measures are more sensitive to these variations than others. One study found a similar gender difference for flexibility and elaboration, using a divergent thinking test to assess creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212459257">Ai, 1999</xref>), whereas another found differences in the ways that creative males and females (in a sample of engineers and musicians) chose to describe themselves on a self-report measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459257">Charyton &amp; Snelbecker, 2007</xref>). Some research suggests that males self-report more positively on other characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0162353212459257">Simon &amp; Nath, 2004</xref>); this may be true for creativity as well.</p>
<p>It could also be that gender differences emerge under certain environmental conditions, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212459257">Baer (1997)</xref> found that an expectation of evaluation is detrimental to females’, but not males’, creative production. Perhaps the females in this study were more sensitive to the scientific nature of the research process and felt their responses would be evaluated more severely. A final explanation for this finding could relate to this sample itself. Previous research has found that the relationship between creativity and academic achievement is much stronger for males than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459257">Asha, 1980</xref>). Because admission to the honors college is based primarily on academic achievement (standardized test scores, GPA, teacher recommendations), the males in the sample may show higher levels of creativity, as compared with the females, who show greater variation in creativity. More research is needed to explore gender differences in creativity specifically with high-ability and high-achieving young adult populations.</p>
<sec id="section18-0162353212459257">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although there are several strengths of this study, some limitations should also be considered. One limitation involves the online data collection. Although this type of research has the advantages of increased sample size and ease of data collection, one must rely completely on self-reported measures, which may not always be objective. However, most studies looking at self-reports of students in higher education suggest that self-reports and actual abilities are positively related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212459257">Anaya, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212459257">Hayek, Carini, O’Day, &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353212459257">Pike, 1995</xref>). One should also keep in mind that the parenting style measure was not only self-reported but retrospective, which could have introduced further error into the precision of the instrument. Furthermore, the sample was somewhat homogeneous in terms of age and ethnicity. Because admission to the honors college was based on high achievement, only those students with high ability who are also high achievers could be included in the study; therefore, there were no underachievers in our sample. The pattern of results might differ dramatically for high-ability underachievers, as parenting and perfectionism may influence achievement levels as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353212459257">Nugent, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0162353212459257">Rimm, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to these limitations, there were relatively weak significant correlations and path coefficients, which suggest that there are many other factors not measured in this study having an influence on the perceived parenting style, perfectionism, and creativity of the participants. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. Although complex correlational models such as path analyses can provide richer information than simple bivariate correlations, the research is still correlational and causality cannot be confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0162353212459257">Trafimow, 2006</xref>). Additional research with more representative samples including high-ability underachievers that incorporate other measures of the same constructs is needed to draw more definitive conclusions. Findings may not be replicated on samples of young adults at different ability levels. In young adults who show a broader range of abilities, the patterns found in this study may not be reproduced, or it could be that the explanatory power of parenting style increases.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that parenting styles can have an effect on creativity for high-ability and high-achieving young adults, in particular authoritarian and permissive styles. However, these relationships are complicated by other factors, such as gender and perfectionism, which can also influence creativity. More research is needed on how parenting style, something one is exposed to since birth, affects the individual as a young adult in positive and negative ways. Furthermore, potential gender and cultural differences are important for consideration in the study of how parenting style can influence development. As previous studies have shown, parenting style can have a differential effect, depending on certain characteristics of the child and the environmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212459257">Chao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212459257">McGillicuddy-De Lisi &amp; De Lisi, 2007</xref>). There are multiple subjective factors to be considered in emotional development, particularly attachment, and the potential for individual variation requires more investigation of these constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0162353212459257">Sroufe, 1996</xref>). Research is also needed to explore the complexities of how the thought processes associated with perfectionism and creativity are moderated by characteristics such as gender as well as environmental and cultural experiences.</p>
<p>As we leave the information age and enter the innovation age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212459257">Hill, 2007</xref>), the importance of creativity for success beyond the classroom cannot be overstated. This study contributes to the understanding of influences on creative thinking for high-achieving, high-ability students. It also generates several additional questions regarding influences on creativity that provide a springboard for future research. As more research is completed in this area, we will hone our understanding of how best to nurture the development of creativity in our high-ability students, thus benefiting not only the students but also education and society as a whole.</p>
