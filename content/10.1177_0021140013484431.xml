<p>Those, like Karl Rahner and Jacques Dupuis, who led the way in developing a theology of religions did not introduce reflections drawn from the priesthood of Christ.  Those very few (e.g. Robert Sherman) who reflect on the priesthood of Christ have not appreciated the possibilities it offers for a theology of religions.  After drawing on Hebrews, Paul, and John, this article cites relevant testimony from the Feast of Christ the King and Vatican II’s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy.  It then develops six themes from Christ’s universal and eternal priesthood—in particular, what can be called the sacerdotal existential—which illuminate the situation of those who follow other religions or none at all.</p>

<p>From the second half of the 20th century and into the third millennium, numerous Catholic and other Christian writers have taken up the theology of religions. Divergent views have prompted serious debates in many languages. But in all that literature, as far as I can see, no one has set out to reflect on other faiths in the light of the priesthood of Jesus Christ. Without alleging that his priesthood should be seen as <italic>the</italic> major approach to be adopted in this field, nevertheless, I believe, as will be argued below, that the theme of his priesthood pulls together some, or even much, of what Christian thinkers would, or at least should, want to deal with, when reflecting on other living faiths. But so far the light that Christ’s priesthood throws on those other faiths remains an untold story.</p>
<sec id="section1-0021140013484431">
<title>Karl Rahner, Jacques Dupuis, and Others</title>
<p>Before exploring what the priesthood of Christ can contribute to a theology of religions, let me illustrate the general neglect of this theme by first sampling the work of two leading authors in this area: Karl Rahner (1904–84) and Jacques Dupuis (1923–2004). Both shaped what many Christians have thought about the followers of other religions, Rahner (with others) prepared the way for the relevant teaching of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), but neither Rahner nor Dupuis introduced Christ’s priesthood into their theology of religions.</p>
<p>Starting from a lecture that he delivered in April 1961, ‘Christianity and the Non-Christian Religions,’ Rahner often returned to this and closely related themes, both in the <italic>Theological Investigations</italic> and in <italic>Foundations of Christian Faith</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140013484431">1</xref></sup> Yet he never reflected on other religions and their followers—or, for that matter, on the offer of divine salvation to all human beings—in the light of Christ’s priesthood. It would have been surprising if he had done so, since in all his writing he did not have much to say on that priesthood.</p>
<p>The relatively little that Rahner wrote about Christ’s priesthood turned up in spiritual writing directed towards those about to be ordained to the priestly ministry or already exercising that ministry. Both in Germany and in Rome, Rahner often gave eight-day retreats, based on the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius, to young, German-speaking candidates for the priesthood. Many of these meditations were eventually edited and printed in 1965, and, in the same year, translated and published in English.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140013484431">2</xref></sup> Rahner closed the section of the retreat, which corresponded to the ‘second week’ of the Exercises, with a meditation on the priesthood. The opening page dealt briefly with the priesthood of Christ, about which Rahner made two points. First, from the moment that the Word took on a human existence, he is ‘essentially God’s high priest.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140013484431">3</xref></sup> Here Rahner followed St John Chrysostom and others in the Christian tradition, when firmly stating that the priesthood of Christ and its exercise began with the incarnation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021140013484431">4</xref></sup> Secondly, Rahner understands that Christ as priest ‘pours out God’s love’ on ‘the whole world’ and ‘makes possible the holy conversation’ between ‘God and the whole world.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021140013484431">5</xref></sup> Linking ‘the whole world’ with the exercise of Christ’s priesthood might, in another context, have led Rahner to reflect on the followers of other religions and the followers of none. But, given the audience for whom he was developing the meditation, he moved at once to speak of ‘our priesthood,’ ‘our priestly existence,’ and ‘our priestly life.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021140013484431">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a 1967 book, published the following year in English, Rahner wrote of the greatness and the burden of the priesthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021140013484431">7</xref></sup> Addressed chiefly to his fellow priests, the chapters originated in ordination sermons, jubilee sermons, retreat conferences, essays, lectures, and prayers. Once again he did not focus on the priesthood of Christ himself. The book includes a chapter on ‘Christ the Exemplar of Priestly Obedience’ and a ‘Prayer for the Right Spirit of Christ’s Priesthood’ (which began by calling Christ ‘high priest of all human beings’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021140013484431">8</xref></sup> Yet, in both the chapter and the prayer, Rahner directed his attention to those exercising ordained ministry in the Church and did not set himself to explore the priesthood of Christ himself, let alone connect that priesthood with the religions of the world. In some related publications, listed at the end of the book, we find that Rahner maintained steadily the same primary focus: on the life and ministry of ordained priests rather than on Christ’s own priesthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021140013484431">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, Rahner retrieved some conferences that he had given in 1961 to candidates for priestly ordination and published them in 1970.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021140013484431">10</xref></sup> The conferences were intended to encourage his hearers to understand more deeply and accept more devoutly the priestly way of life. For Rahner, ordained priesthood embodied selfless, loving service of others and of God’s coming kingdom. Once again, the focus of the book allowed for only incidental references to Christ’s own priesthood and certainly not for any drawing of lines between that priesthood and world religions. Even when Rahner spoke of the ‘continuation of Christ’s priesthood,’ he was primarily concerned to show how Catholic priests unite a prophetical calling with a cultic role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021140013484431">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the end of the 1960s and right through the 1970s, Rahner continued to write about the priestly office and the spirituality of priests. But he developed his reflections without first establishing any detailed theology of Christ’s high priesthood, from which he could then draw some conclusions about the work and spiritual life of those who share in that priesthood through ordination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021140013484431">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jacques Dupuis, at greater length than Rahner, constructed, over many years, a theology of religions. This work climaxed with <italic>Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism</italic> and <italic>Christianity and the Religions</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021140013484431">13</xref></sup> In both books he discussed the ‘mediation’ exercised by Christ, but he did not characterize that mediation as ‘priestly.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021140013484431">14</xref></sup> It was only once in either of the books that he ever spoke about Christ as ‘priest’ or ‘high priest,’ and that was in a passage where he was concerned with Melchizedek, ‘the type of him who will be the eternal High Priest.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021140013484431">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>From his first publication in 1960 right through to 2003, Dupuis often wrote about various Christological questions, and eventually published <italic>Who Do You Say I Am? Introduction to Christology</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021140013484431">16</xref></sup> But in no book or article did he ever explore the nature of Christ’s priesthood as such. Hence, so far from being able to shape in any sense his theology of religions, the high priesthood of Christ simply never entered his reflections. At best, like Rahner, he only touched on it, and that was when reviewing four books on ordained priesthood (in 1971, 1975, and 1978) and publishing four brief articles on the same topic (two in 1975 and one in both 1975 and 1979).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021140013484431">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rahner, Dupuis, and other specialists in the theology of religion, as I found, failed to explore possibilities offered by Christ’s priesthood being exercised for the benefit of all humankind. Perhaps, I fondly imagined, theologians who write on that priesthood—or at least a few of them—might apply some of their conclusions to the situation of those who follow ‘other’ faiths or follow none at all. Then I discovered to my astonishment how very few theologians, both in the past and in modern times, have investigated the priesthood of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021140013484431">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of those very few to do so recently has been Robert J. Sherman. But he steadfastly declines to accept and examine what Christ’s priesthood could mean for the wider world. Christ’s ‘priestly mediation and intercession,’ he writes, are ‘what make Christian worship possible in the first place. Christ is <italic>our heavenly high priest, the head of the church</italic>, enabling all who minister or worship in his name.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021140013484431">19</xref></sup> But does Christ exercise his priesthood only for members of the church who assemble for Christian worship? Do the baptized monopolize the attention of Christ as ‘our heavenly high priest,’ so that he is not high priest for all other human beings, many of whom may never have heard his name? Without argument, Sherman seems to have instinctively limited the beneficiaries of Christ’s priestly office to the members of the Church.</p>
<p>After examining Rahner, Dupuis, Sherman, and other modern theologians, I came to two negative conclusions. First, those (many) who write on other faiths do not introduce the priesthood of Christ into their discussion. Secondly, those (very few) who write on Christ’s priesthood have not appreciated the possibilities it offers for a theology of religions. What story would I now propose telling about the high priesthood of Christ and the light it sheds on the revealing and saving self-communication of God to those of other faiths?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021140013484431">
<title>Hebrews, Paul, and John</title>
<p>(1) The Letter to the Hebrews stands apart by containing the only explicit biblical narrative of Christ as priest and by portraying him extensively in the exercise of his high priesthood. The vision of Christ as eternal High Priest makes its first appearance in Hebrews and seems a self-consciously avant-garde interpretation of Christ’s life, death, and exaltation. Written between 60 and 95 CE (more plausibly before 70) and sent to Italy (Rome?) from Ephesus (Heb 13:23–24), Hebrews is an anonymous sermon aimed at encouraging a particular community, which had earlier suffered considerable hardships (Heb 10:32–34), to maintain their faith and hope. They may be facing further persecutions (Heb 13:3). Some of them could be already ‘slipping away’ (Heb 2:1), in danger of letting their hearts become ‘hardened by sin’ (Heb 3:13), being threatened by ‘strange teaching’ (Heb 13:9), and even abandoning their faith in Christ (Heb 3:12; 6:4–6; 12:25). Certain individuals are already staying away from the liturgical meetings of the community (Heb 10:25).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021140013484431">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>All these particular circumstances leave us with the question: does Hebrews, while expounding the priesthood of Christ, envisage its impact affecting only a specific Christian community or perhaps other such communities suffering from similar challenges? From such particular ‘scraps,’ can we create a compelling narrative of Christ as high priest who exercises a ‘universal’ office and offers salvation to the whole world?</p>
<p>Priesthood and sacrifice are correlative terms—something taken for granted by the author of Hebrews (Heb 8:3). The priestly practices outlined in the Pentateuch that he recalls involved offering sacrifices of animals. When he mentions for the first time the <italic>priestly</italic> identity of Christ, he links it at once to Christ’s <italic>sacrificial</italic> activity: he became ‘a merciful and faithful high priest to expiate the sins of the people’ (Heb 2:17). In the context ‘people’ here points, at least immediately, to the descendants of Abraham and Sarah and not to the human race in general. Nevertheless, the author of Hebrews envisages a group that is much broader than the group he addresses, a particular community that is being ‘tested’ (Heb 2:18).</p>
<p>The horizon that the letter proceeds to open up will be as large as the whole human race. The author lists three qualifications which made Jesus the high priest of the new dispensation: ‘every high priest is [1] taken from among human beings (<italic>anthrôpôn</italic>) and [2] appointed on behalf of human beings (<italic>anthrôpôn</italic>) with respect to the matters pertaining to God, [3] in order to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin’ (Heb 5:1). In other words, as high priest Christ has been (1) chosen from among human beings, and (2) not self-appointed, but called by God to represent them (3) in the sacrificial offering he makes, in particular for the expiation of their sins.</p>
<p>Through taking on the human condition through the incarnation (Heb 1:1–4), the Son of God satisfied the first condition. As high priest he could represent (all) human beings, precisely because he shared their condition, including growth, suffering and death (Heb 5:5–9). The opening verses of Chapter 5 address explicitly the (three) requirements that qualified Christ for his role as high priest. Elsewhere, Hebrews fills out the (first) priestly requirement of ‘being taken from among human beings.’ As ‘high priest’ he could ‘sympathize’ with ‘our weaknesses’ by being tested/tempted in all ways (Heb 15). In ‘the days of his flesh’ he prayed, and did so in painful and threatening situations (Heb 5:7). He grew, was tested, and made perfect through suffering (Heb 2:10,18), above all through enduring death (Heb 2:9,14; 5:7), a death by crucifixion (Heb 6:6).</p>
<p>Jesus shared and shares humanity with all human beings, who are ‘the children’ of the one God and Father, ‘for whom and through whom all things exist.’ As ‘originator’of their salvation, Christ goes before his ‘brothers and sisters’ to deliver them from being enslaved to the fear and power of death (Heb 2:10–15). This passage will specify these ‘brothers and sisters’ as ‘the descendants of Abraham’ (Heb 2:16). Nevertheless, it is ‘sharing’ the same human ‘flesh and blood’ (Heb 2:14) through being created by the one divine Father that makes the one human family, who have been delivered by the high priestly work of Christ. He became high priest not only for the descendants of Abraham but also for all who belong to the human family.</p>
<p>While death and exaltation proved the defining moment of Christ’s priesthood, a priestly self-offering characterized his whole human existence (Heb 10:5–7). From the start, Hebrews links his priestly activity of purifying sin (Heb 1:2–4) with the incarnation, through which he entered into solidarity with all human beings. The incarnation allowed the Son of God to become a high priest for everyone.</p>
<p>This global perspective also builds on the priest-king Melchizedek, who blesses Abraham (Gen 14:17–20) and is called a ‘priest forever’ (Ps 110:4). The mysterious person of Melchizedek provides a figure who is both prior to and superior to the (Jewish) Levitical priests. After three times attributing to Christ an eternal priesthood ‘according to the order of Melchizedek’ (Heb 5:6,10; 6:20), the author of Hebrews comes clean, so to speak, with his strategy: the priesthood of the mysterious priest-king was earlier and greater than the Levitical priesthood (Heb 7:1–28). Since the Scriptures do not mention Melchizedek’s ancestors, birth, or death, he ‘remains’ a priest forever (Heb 7:3), unlike the Levitical priests who all died and could not continue in office forever. Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of the spoils from a victory over ‘the kings’ and received a blessing from him, thus showing how Melchizedek was greater than Abraham and his descendant Levi (the head of the priestly tribe). With the cornerstone of Melchizedek in place, Hebrews presses on to argue that, being a ‘priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek,’ Christ is superior to any Levitical high priest. He ‘holds his priesthood permanently,’ and ‘always lives to make intercession’ for those who ‘approach God through him’ (Heb 7:24–25). Thus Christ is not only a priest for everyone (see above) but for always. His priesthood is exercised for all people and for all time (and beyond).</p>
<p>As high priest, Christ functions as the ‘mediator of a new covenant’ (Heb 9:15; 12:24). The new covenant forms a linchpin, without which Hebrews would fall apart. This definitive commitment of God is interpreted against the background of the Mosaic covenant with the Jewish people but stands in contrast with it as the ‘better’ or fully efficacious covenant (Heb 8:7–13). But does this covenant brought about by Christ the high priest apply to the whole human race? At first glance, it appears to be limited to Christian believers.</p>
<p>Christ’s sacrifice, Hebrews declares, has opened a new and living way into the presence of God, and allows his followers to move in hope towards the inner shrine of heaven, where Jesus their ‘forerunner’ and high priest belongs forever (Heb 10:19–20). They can continue to appropriate Christ’s self-offering, knowing that he constantly ‘appears in the presence of God’ on their behalf (Heb 9:24; see 6:20). Christ’s priestly journey into the heavenly sanctuary has ended with his sitting at the right hand of God (Heb 1:3). But for his followers his priesthood continues forever, inasmuch as he ‘lives always’ to ‘make intercession’ for those who ‘approach God through him’ (Heb 7:25). But what of ‘the others’?</p>
<p>Sometimes Hebrews seems comprehensive in its proposals about the beneficiaries of Christ’s priestly work. Jesus, it announces, ‘tasted [i.e. experienced] death for everyone’ (Heb 2:9). Yet it can also propose that he ‘became the source of eternal salvation [only?] for all who obey him’ (Heb 5:9). Receiving the offer of salvation prompts believers into following Jesus on the journey of faith. What then of those who, through no fault of their own, have never heard of Jesus and thus are not in a position to repent of their sins, ‘obey’ him, be delivered from death, and enjoy in glory the presence of God? It seems that for Hebrews salvation is available only to those who know of Christ’s priestly work and can approach God’s ‘throne of grace’ to ‘receive mercy’ for past sins and find grace for present and future ‘need’ (Heb 4:10). Is the possibility of salvation through the new covenant restricted to those who consciously approach the royal throne of God through Jesus the high priest (Heb 7:25)?</p>
<p>A roll-call of heroes and heroines of faith (Heb 11:1–12:1) does not list any Christians, but only those who lived before Christ and hence could not consciously have accepted redemption coming through his priestly work. Not surprisingly, Hebrews proposes in Chapter 11 an ‘open’ version of faith: ‘the reality of things hoped for’ and ‘the proof of things not seen. By this [faith] the elders [our ancestors] received approval. By faith we understand that the universe was fashioned by the word of God, so that from what cannot be seen that which is seen has come into being’ (Heb 11:1–3). A further verse adds two (rather general) requirements to this ‘open’ account of faith: ‘without faith it is impossible to please God; for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him’ (Heb 11:6).</p>
<p>The opening three verses of Hebrews 11 highlight faith but say little about its content. The passage hints at the future. Divine promises (presumably of some eternal inheritance) have aroused the hope of human beings and their trust that God will keep these promises, which concern future things that are ‘not seen.’ Faith also involves a conviction about the past. One understands by faith the unseen origin of the world: it was ‘fashioned by the word of God.’ Just as people of faith rely on the word of God about the <italic>genesis</italic> of the universe, so too do they rely on the word of God’s promise when considering the <italic>goal</italic> of the world and of their own existence. Both in their view of the past and their hope for the future, the lives of those who have faith are intertwined with the life of the invisible God.</p>
<p>This account of faith makes no mention of Christ. He will appear later, when the list of heroes and heroines of faith reaches the figure of Jesus, ‘the pioneer and perfecter of faith’ (Heb 12:2). The opening verses of Hebrews 11 have invoked ‘the elders’ or ‘ancestors,’ people whom God honoured for their persevering faith. Then follow examples of those who have lived on the basis of faith, with particular attention paid to Abraham, Sarah, and Moses. Some of those who exemplify faith (Abel, Enoch, and Noah) existed prior to Abraham, Sarah, and the formation of the chosen people. One figure of faith is ‘Rahab the prostitute,’ an outsider who belonged to the story of the conquest of the promised land (Jos 2:1–24; 6:22–25).</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:6 lets us glimpse the shape that the faith of outsiders can take. ‘Pleasing God’ means doing the divine will, in particular, through deeds of kindness and service of others (Heb 13:16, 20–21). Such conduct need not depend upon a conscious relationship with Christ the high priest. A faith that ‘pleases’ God is a possibility open to all. Likewise, ‘approaching’ God in prayer does not necessarily depend upon an awareness of the priestly intercession of the exalted Christ. That intercession functions, whether or not worshippers are conscious of the priestly presence of Christ when they draw near to God in prayer. These and further aspects of Hebrews 11:6 spell out an ‘open’ account of faith. Salvation through such faith is offered to all people and offered on the basis of the self-sacrificing priesthood of Christ, even if they are not (or are not yet) in a position to follow him in conscious obedience on the pilgrimage of faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021140013484431">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>When pursuing the biblical witness to the relationship between the priestly work of Christ and the salvation offered to all people, Hebrews is the standout. It is the one New Testament book that gives him the title of ‘priest’ (six times) or ‘high priest’ (ten times). Nevertheless, strands of teaching from other New Testament authors also illuminate the priesthood of Christ and not least its impact on the whole human race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021140013484431">22</xref></sup> Let me limit myself to Paul and John.</p>
<p>(2) Paul writes of the risen Christ who ‘intercedes for us’ at the right hand of God (Rom 8:34). Hebrews was to take this language further by characterizing this permanent intercession as Christ being ‘a priest forever’ (Rom 7:22, 24). Without applying the title ‘priest’ to Christ, the apostle expounds themes about Christ’s priesthood and, in particular, its universal significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021140013484431">23</xref></sup> In Romans, immediately after establishing that ‘all’ human beings, Jews and Gentiles alike, ‘have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God’ (Rom 3:23), Paul uses sacrificial, priestly imagery to present Christ as the means for wiping away the sins of humanity (Rom 3:25).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021140013484431">24</xref></sup> He then elaborately contrasts the surpassing work of Christ for human salvation with the universal effects of Adam’s disobedience. Obviously using them as synonyms, the apostle passes from speaking of ‘all’ (Rom 5:12) to speaking of ‘the many’ (Rom 5;15), and then back to ‘all’ (Rom 5:18) and, finally, back to ‘the many’ (Rom 5:19). For Paul, ‘the many (<italic>polloi</italic>)’ is equivalent to ‘all (<italic>pantes</italic>).’ In 2 Corinthians, the apostle simply uses ‘all’: ‘one has died for all, therefore all have died. And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves’ (2 Cor 5:14–15). The priestly redemption, effected by Christ’s death and resurrection, has a universal impact.</p>
<p>In the seven letters commonly recognized as coming directly from Paul (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon), he never speaks of Jesus specifically as priest. He attributes other titles to Jesus: above all, Christ/Messiah, Lord, and Son of God. In the first of the Pastoral Epistles (which most scholars would not attribute in their present form to Paul), Jesus is called ‘the one mediator between God and human beings, who gave himself as a ransom for all’ (1 Tim 2:5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021140013484431">25</xref></sup> The verse points us towards two other New Testament texts. First, Hebrews also calls Christ ‘mediator’ and does so three times, when it presents his priestly work as being that of ‘the mediator of the new/better covenant’ (Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24). Second, famously Mark’s Gospel represents Jesus as the Son of Man who came ‘to give his life as a ransom for many’ (10:45). Here ‘the many’ is equivalent to ‘all’ in 1 Timothy.</p>
<p>(3) Even more than Paul, John’s Gospel gets close to giving Jesus the title of ‘priest,’ while applying to him priestly imagery and themes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021140013484431">26</xref></sup> In particular, the evangelist presents the high priest as clinching the debate about killing Jesus with words that express simultaneously ‘a criminal human calculation and a divine plan of redemption.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0021140013484431">27</xref></sup> What Caiaphas says enjoys prophetic value rooted in the priestly nature of his office: ‘it is better to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.’ As John comments, these words reveal a central truth about Jesus as priest and victim: he was about to die for the sake of and on behalf of the whole people, and that people would include not only Israel but also all the scattered children of God (John 11:49–52). The plan of Caiaphas to do away with Jesus had unwittingly set in motion a ‘universal plan of salvation to produce one people of God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0021140013484431">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Sampling the Tradition: Pius XI and <bold><italic>Sacrosanctum Concilium</italic></bold></title>
<p>After sampling the New Testament on the significance of Christ’s priesthood and its universal significance, we can sample, albeit much more briefly, how the Christian tradition understood that priesthood. Reflections might be drawn from St Augustine, other church fathers, St Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, the 17th-century French School, and Blessed John Henry Newman. Let me limit myself to Pope Pius XI and the Second Vatican Council’s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, <italic>Sacrosanctum concilium</italic>.</p>
<p>(1) Luther, among other earlier writers, had recognized an intimate association between Christ’s universal kingship and priesthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0021140013484431">29</xref></sup> In the Feast of Christ the King instituted by Pius XI in 1925, the preface addresses God the Father in the following words:
<disp-quote>
<p>You anointed Jesus Christ, your only Son, with the oil of gladness, as the eternal priest and universal king. <italic>As priest</italic> he offered his life on the altar of the cross and redeemed the human race by this one perfect sacrifice of peace. <italic>As king</italic> he claims dominion over all creation, so that he may present to you, his almighty Father, a universal kingdom: a kingdom of truth and life, a kingdom of holiness and grace, a kingdom of justice, love, and peace. (Emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Christ is being celebrated as King, but the preface (and, to some extent, the prayer over the gifts and the prayer after communion), without any special pleading, also attend to the priesthood of Christ. If distinguishable, the kingship and priesthood of Christ are inseparable; both extend to the whole ‘human race’ and to ‘all creation.’ The preface calls him ‘eternal priest’ and ‘universal king.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0021140013484431">30</xref></sup> But it could have switched the adjectives and called him ‘universal priest’ and ‘eternal king.’ Both his priesthood and his kingship are universal in their scope and eternal in their duration.</p>
<p>(2) In the first document it promulgated (in 1963), Vatican II quoted (without reference) a passage from Pius XII’s 1947 encyclical, <italic>Mediator Dei</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0021140013484431">31</xref></sup> Significantly replacing ‘the Word of God’ with a title that evokes Hebrews, <italic>Sacrosanctum concilium</italic> stated: ‘Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the New and Eternal Covenant, when he assumed a human nature, introduced into this land of exile the hymn that in heaven is sung throughout all ages. He unites the whole community of humankind with himself and associates it with him in singing the divine canticle of praise.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0021140013484431">32</xref></sup> Earlier the same constitution had taught that the risen Christ is present ‘when the Church prays <italic>and sings.</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0021140013484431">33</xref></sup> Now the same document summed up this singing as ‘one divine canticle of praise,’ led by the incarnate, high-priestly ‘Cantor.’ He joins with himself not only the Church but also ‘the whole community of humankind’ in singing a heavenly hymn that he has brought to earth. This picture brilliantly presents Christ the High Priest as joining with himself, in virtue of his incarnation, all human beings without exception, including millions who will go through life without ever hearing his name. Without consciously knowing this, they belong to his cosmic chorus and are constantly affected by his priestly work.</p>

<title>Christ’s Priesthood and ‘the Others’: Six Systematic Points</title>
<p>After sampling some items from the Scriptures and tradition, how would I propose relating systematically Christ’s priesthood to the followers of other religions? What significance could that priesthood have for a theology of religions? Let me propose six points.</p>
<p>(1) First, Christ’s priesthood is made possible through his assuming a human existence (see Rahner and Hebrews above), through which he has become part (the supreme part) of creation and head of the human community. In its ‘Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions (<italic>Nostra aetate</italic>),’ Vatican II named ‘stemming from the one stock which God created’ as the initial reason for recognizing how all human beings form one community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0021140013484431">34</xref></sup> What makes Christ’s priesthood possible, his created humanity, is precisely what binds him to all people of all places and times. It is that created humanity which, from the outset, constitutes him in his universal priesthood.</p>
<p>To be sure, the institution of the Eucharist will become a further, decisive moment in constituting Christ as high priest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0021140013484431">35</xref></sup> But the Eucharist <italic>also</italic> embodies a cosmic, universal significance that involves all human beings and the whole created world. In a lyric passage, Blessed John Paul II recalled how he had celebrated ‘Holy Mass in chapels built along mountain paths, on lakeshores and seacoasts. I have celebrated it on altars built in stadiums and city squares … This varied scenario of celebrations of the Eucharist has given me a powerful experience of its universal and, so speak, cosmic character.’ Echoing a famous work by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955), the Pope added:
<disp-quote>
<p>Even when it is celebrated on the humble altar of a country church, the Eucharist is always in some way celebrated <italic>on the altar of the world</italic>. It unites heaven and earth. It embraces and permeates all creation. The Son of God became man in order to <italic>restore</italic> all creation, in one supreme act of praise, to the One who made it out of nothing. He, the Eternal High Priest who by the blood of his Cross entered the eternal sanctuary, thus gives back to the Creator and Father all creation redeemed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0021140013484431">36</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What then ‘is accomplished in the Eucharist’ is nothing less than ‘the world which came forth from the hands of God the Creator’ now returning ‘to him redeemed by Christ.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0021140013484431">37</xref></sup> The Eucharist ‘embraces’ all creation and hence the entire human race. Christ, the invisible minister actively present at every celebration of the Eucharist, intends to accomplish through it the redemption of all human beings, Christians and non-Christians alike.</p>
<p>In the passage we have cited from John Paul II’s encyclical, he did not link the priesthood of Christ with the followers of other religions. Yet, to the extent that the Eucharist ‘embraces’ the whole of creation, it involves all men and women and effectively links them with Christ the eternal high priest.</p>
<p>(2) Secondly, from the time of Paul (1 Cor 15 and then Rom 5), St Irenaeus (in the second century), Christian theologians, liturgy, art, drama, and legends have associated Christ with every man and every woman through two corporate figures: the first Adam of the Genesis story and Christ as the New or Last Adam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0021140013484431">38</xref></sup> The figures of Adam and Eve symbolize the human condition in its glory and misery. A hymn by a Latin poet Venantius Fortunatus (d. around 610), <italic>Crux fidelis</italic> (‘faithful cross’), links two trees, the tree in the middle of the garden of Eden and the tree on Calvary, in one great drama of creation, fall, and redemption. The preface for the Feast of the Holy Cross or Exaltation of the Cross (14 September), a feast which goes back at least to the seventh century, declares: ‘death came from a tree, life was to spring from a tree.’ Some imaginative writers and artists have also linked Adam and the Second Adam through the symbol of the garden: from the garden of Eden, over which Adam and Eve presided, to the garden of Gethsemane, the garden, where Christ was buried and after his resurrection met Mary Magdalene (John 19:41–42; 20:11–18), and, finally, the garden of the heavenly Jerusalem, which Christ as the slain and risen Lamb will illuminate (Rev 21:23; 22:1–2). Adam and Christ featured frequently in popular medieval drama. The ‘Mystery Plays’ highlighted the connection between the two Adams by the practice of having the same actor portray both Adam and Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0021140013484431">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In connecting Adam and Christ, no work of literature has surpassed a ‘Hymn to God my God in my Sickness,’ written by John Donne a few days before he died:
<disp-quote>
<p>We think that Paradise and Calvary,</p>
<p>Christ’s cross and Adam’s tree, stood in one place.</p>
<p>Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;</p>
<p>As the first Adam’s sweat surrounds my face,</p>
<p>May the last Adam’s blood my soul embrace.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Donne recalls here an old and enduring legend that told the story of the tree from which Adam and Eve took the forbidden fruit and how it came to be used as the tree on which Christ died. According to a related legend, Calvary was the place where Adam was buried; the Church of the Holy Sepulchre contains an ‘Adam Chapel.’ Christian artists, at times, placed his skull, and, occasionally even his skeleton, at the foot of the cross. The New Adam dies above the grave of the first Adam. Some artists pictured Adam and Eve standing together in a sarcophagus under the cross and looking up at the crucified Christ. A few representations have the figure of Adam holding a chalice to receive the first drops of blood falling from Christ on the cross.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0021140013484431">40</xref></sup> The chalice symbolizes Adam’s priesthood and links him (and Eve) with the defining moment in the exercise of Christ’s priesthood, his death and exaltation.</p>
<p>One might recognize a prefiguring of this association by interpreting Adam and Eve as the priests of creation. In the Priestly tradition, being created in the image and likeness of God and as the crown of creation, the primeval couple have ‘dominion’ over other created beings (Gen 1:26–31). Then follows a different tradition (often called J) of their being created in a garden (Gen 2:4b–25), which involves some ancient temple imagery. In this tradition, instead of being created earlier, animals and birds are created after Adam and brought to him to be named. Even if the text does not explicitly call Adam a ‘priestly king,’ that can describe his responsible place in creation and the stewardship he exercises. In particular, being created in the divine image, he resembles the coming Christ and qualifies to be understood as a priestly mediator of God’s original covenant with human kind. But then, in disobediently eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve break their covenantal relationship and suffer the consequences (Gen 3:1–24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0021140013484431">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Acknowledging priestly overtones in the creation stories colours the meeting between Adam and the New Adam. We face a meeting between priests, one in which everyman and everywoman, represented by Adam and Eve, are blessed by the New or Last Adam. Such an elaboration of an Adam Christology provides a setting for recognizing how the priesthood of Christ had and continues to have its impact on the entire human race.</p>
<p>Eastern icons depicting Christ’s passage down into the ‘limbo of the Fathers’ and meeting with Adam and Eve—such as the sublime one in the monastery of Chora (Istanbul)—show large crowds of people standing behind them. In liberating and raising Adam and Eve, the Second Adam raises all humanity. To be sure, such icons do not expressly present Christ as the High Priest, but they do not exclude reading the scene as a meeting between priests, which embodies a redemptive impact on the entire human race and the cosmos. Whatever use might be made of Eastern icons, the original priesthood of Adam (and Eve), which a fully deployed Adam Christology could incorporate, opens the way to appreciate how the exercise of Christ’s priesthood (and, one should add, its sacramental enactment in the Eucharist) affects every human being, whether or not they ever become aware of this.</p>
<p>Thus, an Adam Christology, I would argue, opens up possibilities for a theology of religions, possibilities that have not yet been taken up. Dupuis moved in that direction by presenting creation as a cosmic event in which God made a universal covenant with humanity through Adam and Eve. Although the Genesis story does not explicitly speak of a covenant relationship, Dupuis followed St Irenaeus in recognizing a covenant given to the human race under Adam. Three further covenants followed: under Noah, under Moses, and, finally and supremely, under Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0021140013484431">42</xref></sup> Being involved in the making of the first covenant invested Adam, the representative of the human race, with some kind of priestly character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0021140013484431">43</xref></sup> But Dupuis did not pursue that line.</p>
<p>(3) Thirdly, John Henry Newman famously incorporated something of an Adam Christology in his hymn ‘Firmly I believe and truly.’ But it is elsewhere that we should look—to a sermon on Christ’s priesthood and to a letter, which offers hints about a primordial priesthood of all human beings, a priesthood that links them with Christ the high priest.</p>
<p>On 6 April 1851, when Newman chose to preach on the priesthood of Christ, he dwelt on a theme dear to Luther, Christ’s priestly service for sinners, and applied the theme very broadly in the light of John 1:29 (‘the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world’). ‘What is a priest?’ Newman asked. ‘See how much it implies: first the need for reconciliation; it has at once to do with sin; it presupposes sin. When then our Lord is known to come as priest, see how <italic>the whole face of the world</italic> is changed.’ Newman underlined the universal character of Christ’s priestly service: ‘the Son of God offers for <italic>the whole world</italic>, and that offering is himself. He who is high as eternity, whose arms stretch through infinity, is lifted up on the cross for the sins of <italic>the world</italic>.’ Here Newman was even clearer about the universal scope of the beneficiaries of Christ’s priestly sacrifice. Like Hebrews, Newman took up the language about Christ being ‘a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek,’ but, unlike Hebrews, he applied it to the permanent sacrifice of the Mass: it is not ‘done and over; it lasts.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0021140013484431">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two decades later, in the aftermath of the First Vatican Council’s definition of papal primacy and infallibility, William Gladstone questioned whether Catholics in the United Kingdom could remain loyal to their country. In an 1874 response to the prime minister, Newman famously portrayed conscience as taking precedence over any authority, papal or secular. He expressed this precedence by making use of the triple office of priest, prophet, and king: ‘Conscience is the aboriginal Vicar of Christ, a prophet in its information, a monarch in its peremptoriness, a priest in its blessings and anathemas,and, even though the eternal priesthood throughout the Church could cease to be, in it [the human conscience] the sacerdotal principle would remain and would have a sway.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0021140013484431">45</xref></sup> Here Newman presented the triple office as if it were a spiritual genetic code that pre-existed any institutional structures, and highlighted in particular ‘the sacerdotal principle’ as intrinsically shaping the human spirit.</p>
<p>Naming the universally present human conscience a ‘sacerdotal principle’ or ‘priest in its blessings and anathemas’ could make us take a lead from Rahner and coin a new expression, the ‘sacerdotal principle,’ in which all human beings participate. Let me explain. Rahner famously introduced the term ‘supernatural existential’ to describe the situation created for human freedom by the redemptive work of Christ. Even before they freely accept (or reject) grace, human beings are positively preconditioned from ‘within’ by the divine self-communication offered to all in and through Christ. Hence ‘the expressly Christian revelation’ is ‘the explicit statement of the revelation of grace,’ which all human beings already experience ‘implicitly in the depths’ of their being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0021140013484431">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Likewise, ‘the sacerdotal existential,’ adumbrated by Newman, is the priestly condition in which all human beings participate. As ‘the aboriginal Vicar of Christ,’ it is ‘constituted’ by the redemptive work of Christ. Through the sacerdotal existential, which is their conscience, human beings are positively preconditioned from within to share through baptism in the priesthood of Christ (and in his office as prophet and king). But they already experience that priesthood in the depths of their being and through the voice of conscience.</p>
<p>One might express this by saying that all human beings are, from their conception and birth, already priests (as well as prophets and kings/queens). The sacerdotal existential suggests the way in which Christ’s priestly work has already shaped them even before they ever have the chance of responding to what that work brings them in the offer of God’s grace.</p>
<p>(4) Fourthly, the priesthood of Christ involved him not only in being tried and tested, but also in becoming vulnerable to lethal persecution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0021140013484431">47</xref></sup> Extreme vulnerability, as the Letter to the Hebrews recognized, belonged to his ‘job description’ as priest. By assuming the human condition and becoming a priest, the incarnate Son of God made himself subject to suffering and violent death (Heb 5:7–8). Becoming a priest involved becoming a victim—a new and disturbing aspect of Christ’s priesthood. This becoming personally the victim took him quite beyond the job description not only of the Levitical priests (who sacrificed animals as victims), but also of Melchizedek (who offered some bread and wine and was held up by Hebrews as foreshadowing Jesus the high priest to come). Everywhere suffering characterizes the human condition, and Christ’s priestly vulnerability puts him in solidarity with every sufferer.</p>
<p>Christ the high priest drew near to all human beings in pain. His self-sacrificing death on Calvary between two criminals symbolized forever his solidarity with and priestly function for those who suffer and die, an identification with human pain expressed also by the criteria for the last judgement (Matt 25:31–46). The final blessings of the kingdom will come to those who, without necessarily recognizing Christ, have met his needs in people who suffer by being hungry, thirsty, strangers, naked, sick, or imprisoned. To articulate the worldwide presence of Christ priest and victim in all who suffer, we might say: <italic>ubi dolor, ibi Christus sacerdos et victima</italic> (wherever there is suffering, there is Christ priest and victim).</p>
<p>(5) Fifthly, for Hebrews, the death, resurrection, and glorification of Christ characterized essentially his priesthood. But this did not mean that everything that came before, above all his public ministry, was a mere prelude to the real exercise of his priesthood. His wise teaching during that ministry should also be recognized as priestly. Mediating the divine revelation to people belonged (and belongs) essentially to the work of priests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0021140013484431">48</xref></sup> The role of Jesus as preacher/teacher entered essentially into the exercise of his priesthood, as Origen, Luther, the French School, and others emphasized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0021140013484431">49</xref></sup> He continues to exercise his priesthood by being ‘the light of the world’ and the incarnate wisdom of God.</p>
<p>Hence we should acknowledge the active, if mysterious, presence of Christ the priest wherever religious truth is taught in any cultures, societies, and religions. As the Second Vatican Council stated, ‘the precepts and doctrines’ of other religions ‘often reflect a ray of that Truth that enlightens all people.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0021140013484431">50</xref></sup> That is to acknowledge the priestly role of Christ as universal mediator of divine revelation and wisdom. Such mediation belongs essentially to the exercise of his priesthood.</p>
<p>(6) Sixthly, in the exercise of his priesthood the risen and exalted Christ sends the Holy Spirit into the Church and the world. In John’s Gospel, Jesus says: ‘When the Paraclete comes whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, that One will bear witness to me’ (John 15:26). The evangelist associates the Spirit not only with witnessing to Jesus but also with new birth and life (John 3:5–8; 4:10,14; 7:37–39), with truth and teaching (John 14:16–17, 26; 16:13–15), and with mission and the forgiveness of sins (John 20:22–23). Such witnessing, giving new life, teaching the truth, and commissioning on the part of the Spirit are ongoing activities that involve a constant sending of the Spirit by the eternal High Priest. Or, to put it the other way, the Spirit universalizes the priestly work of Jesus. We might say: <italic>ubi Spiritus Sanctus, ibi Christus sacerdos</italic> (wherever there is the Holy Spirit, there is Christ the priest).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0021140013484431">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>In modern times few have done more to emphasize the universal presence and activity of the Holy Spirit than Blessed John Paul II.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0021140013484431">52</xref></sup> No individual and no culture or religion is simply ‘outside’ the influence of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit, sent by Christ the high priest, is incessantly active everywhere and for everyone. Our reflections on the universal presence of the Spirit should factor in the universal presence of Christ in the eternal exercise of his priesthood.</p>
<p>Here, then, are six systematic ways of thinking about the followers of other faiths and, indeed, of all human beings, ways that draw inspiration from the priesthood of Jesus Christ. Like his kingship, that priesthood has no limits and will have no end. It throws much light on the situation and destiny of those who follow other faiths or who follow none. Yet, so far in the theology of religions, the universal priesthood of Christ has remained an untold story. The theology of religions would, I believe, be greatly enriched by incorporating ‘the sacerdotal principle’ that would honour the priestly activity of Christ for the good of all human beings.</p>

<p>See Gertrud Schiller, <italic>Iconography of Christian Art</italic>, vol. 2, trans. Janet Seligman (London: Lund Humphries, 1971), 131, 479. She quotes a legend about the death of Adam from the Syrian <italic>Cave of Treasures</italic>. A propos of the Christ’s death on Calvary, Adam says to Seth: ‘There the Word of God will come and suffer and will be crucified up there at the place where my body lies, so that my skull will be wet with his blood. And in that hour I shall be redeemed and he will bring me back to my kingdom and restore to me my priesthood and prophetic status’ (ibid., 131).</p>

<p>Subsequently Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam and Eve, act in a priestly way by making offerings to God (Gen 4:1–4). The fact that their children make priestly offerings suggests something priestly about Adam and Eve. In the story of the renewed relationship between God and human beings, Noah acts in a priestly way (see O’Collins, <italic>Salvation for All</italic>, 8–11). That story encourages reading in a priestly way the original relationship between God and Adam (and Eve).</p>
