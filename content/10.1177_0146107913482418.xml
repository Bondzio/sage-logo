<abstract>
<p>This article draws upon insights from Gary S. Gregg to sketch an outline of periods of psychological development in one MENA (Middle East North Africa) society, ancient Israel, fleshing it out with select examples from the Bible. Cross-cultural psychology is the most appropriate discipline for pursuing this project. Six stages from infancy to adulthood are investigated constituting a first step in developing a suitable model for similar future research.</p>

<body>
<p>Except for Luke's pronouncement story about Joseph and Mary finding the twelve year old Jesus in the Temple with the teachers (Luke 2:41–52; see Fitzmyer: 436), the Synoptic gospels provide no information about Jesus' youth. Inspired by Luke's story, authors of the apocryphal gospels readily remedied that deficiency. The <italic>Infancy Story of Thomas</italic>, for example, reports what Jesus did and or said at the ages of five (2:1), six (11:1), eight (12:2), and twelve (19:1–5, a paraphrase of Luke 2:42–52; see Hennecke-Schneemelcher: 439–52). While the apocrypha are of the same genre as similar stories in other cultures and literatures that created boyhood stories for great figures such as the Buddha in India, Cyrus the Great in Persia, and Alexander the Great in Greece, contemporary social sciences can help to appreciate the psychological dimensions of traditional ways of life in MENA (Middle East North Africa). In this essay, I attempt construct a model of culturally plausible scenarios about the life-stages of ancient historical figures such as Jesus.</p>

<title>Cross-Cultural Psychology and Psychological Anthropology</title>
<p>The specific social science used in this essay is cross-cultural psychology. Western psychology (and psychiatry) is a monocultural and ethnocentric science and not at all helpful in analyzing subjects from other cultures (Nsamenang: 9; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146107913482418">Pilch 1997</xref>). It has been appropriately and derisively termed WASP (“Western academic scientific psychology”). Biblical scholars who use Western psychology to interpret produce culturally implausible interpretations of ancient texts and persons (see Van Os).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Cross-cultural psychology is the study of: similarities and differences in individual psychological functioning in various cultural and ethnocultural groups; of the relationships between psychological variables and socio-cultural, ecological and biological variables; and of ongoing changes in these variables [Berry et al.: 3].</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cross-cultural psychology is similar to yet very different from psychological anthropology, which is rooted primarily in anthropology and psychoanalytic psychiatry. Psychological anthropology developed in the 1920s. Anthropologists, mainly from the United States, were interested in psychological explanations of cultural phenomena. In their research, population-level concerns predominated. From the perspective of cross-cultural psychologists, this discipline was “untidy” and “fuzzy.” It relied on Freud too much and ignored differences within groups or even between persons. Critics of psychological anthropology point to studies of envy as an example. Psychological literature is nearly silent on this topic, but anthropological literature is rich, based on methods and theories criticized by psychologists, notably personal immersion in the culture. Anthropologists call this “participant observation,” that is, living in a culture not one's own and recording careful observations. Biblical scholars who have applied these anthropological insights to their interpretation of envy in the Bible have uncovered hitherto unnoticed cultural aspects generally unknown to or ignored by Western psychologists (see the studies of envy by Hagedorn-Neyrey and Elliott).</p>
<p>Cross-cultural Psychology began to develop from 1950 on, especially with the work of John Whiting (Whiting &amp; Child) and Robert LeVine (Levine &amp; Levine). The cross-cultural approach to psychological anthropology emerged when attention switched from intensive examinations of single cultures and the collective personality of their members to extensive examinations of relationships across cultures between cultural and personality variables. Cross-cultural psychology is rooted in academic psychology. In its methodology, the predominant focus is on individual processes and inter-individual differences.</p>

<sec id="section3-0146107913482418">
<title>Indigenous Psychology</title>
<p>From the development of cultural psychology it is but a small step to the next level, developing indigenous psychologies. “At the present time, the highest priority for MENA psychologists has to be the creation of an <italic>indigenous psychology</italic> — or, perhaps more accurately, of <italic>indigenous psychological theories”</italic> (Gregg: 376). Western psychology (or WASP) imported into the “majority world” (preferable to the terms “developing” or “third” World) is equivalent to an imposed etic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146107913482418">Pilch 2011</xref>: 5–7). The process can't stop here but must lead to the discover of a “derived etic” interpretation. Indigenous psychology, the psychology of a particular culture, is an emic reality (Adair &amp; Diaz-Loving). A working definition of indigenous psychology would be a psychology of a cultural group based on the day-to-day behavior of its members, for which local points of view provide the paradigms that guide the collection and interpretation of psychological information” (Berry et al.: 459–60). This is the task some biblical scholars pursue in their analysis of ancient texts (see Elliott; Hagedorn-Neyrey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146107913482418">Malina 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146107913482418">Pilch 2012</xref>)</p>
<p>Part I of this essay, therefore, sets out elements of the MENA social ecology of psychological development. Part II applies Gregg's adaptation of Erikson's ages and stages of psychological development to biblical data. I lean heavily on Gregg's research. The models in each of these parts of my essay strive to achieve what models customarily do: they help to retrieve data, and they help to interpret the data retrieved.</p>

<title>Elements of The Social Ecology of Psychological Development</title>
<p>Social ecology studies the way in which families interrelate, how they govern themselves, and how these social structures adapt to society's ecological setting. Scarcity of resources is very significant (e.g., unpredictable rainfall) in MENA ecology. MENA's <italic>traditional</italic> social ecology is a mixture of three ways of life: pastoral nomadism, peasant agriculture, and urban trades and commerce found throughout the ancient Mediterranean and stretching into Central Asia (Gregg: 50). This combination occurred around 9,000 to 5,000 <sc>bce</sc> with the emergence of grain cultivation and domestication of animals. Thus, these three ways of life had to learn to live symbiotically with one another. Agropastoralism developed with agricultural and pastoral production combined in a myriad of ways. One common form was “transhumance.” In this arrangement, families lived in settled villages where they cultivated fields but a portion of the household herded livestock on the surrounding range-lands (Matt 12:11; 18:12–13; Luke 15:3–6)</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important feature of premodern MENA cultures is the elementary “face-to-face” character of domination (Gregg: 48). Learning how to respond to varying patterns of authority and domination exercises significant impact upon psychological development. Seniors dominate juniors, husbands exercise authority over women, men dominate poorer kinsmen and neighbors, etc. Thus in MENA societies, a key developmental task is accommodating to relationships and decisions about one's life which one has not personally chosen.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146107913482418">Malina (1994)</xref> has analyzed face-to-face modes of social interaction in the biblical world, an ancient MENA society. In face-to-face societies, people associate mainly by co-presence. Kinship, which means being born into extended lines of blood relationship, is a key social form of face-to-face integration. However, it should be noted that such a mode of integration is not “natural.” It has to be learned; hence Gregg's emphasis on learning how to accommodate to and negotiate with varying patterns of domination. In rearing boys in MENA, the patriarch must be able to impose his will and to expect loyalty and obedience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146107913482418">Pilch 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In a comparative chart of four modes of political social interaction, Malina compares face-to-face, face-to-grace, face-to-mace, and face-to-space interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146107913482418">Malina 1994</xref>: 13–14). Here we list only the characteristics of face-to-face interactions. The key person is the patriarch, the paterfamilias (e.g., Jonah, father of Simon Peter and Andrew). Most traditional MENA societies have kinship systems that are simultaneously <italic>patrilineal</italic> (descent and rights are reckoned in the male line), <italic>patrilocal</italic> (newly married couple lives with the husband's father's family, e.g., Simon Peter, his wife and children live in Jonah's compound at Capharnaum) but also <italic>matrifocal</italic> (Prov 31:10–31), and <italic>patriarchal</italic> (men have authority over women, and senior males have authority over juniors). The patriarchal family, therefore, is focal in biblical society and generalized reciprocity rules (=giving to others with no expectation of a repayment or return). Contacts are personal, person to person. In other words, each person has or can have direct contact with authority. People see each other as fellow kin, fellow village mates. This develops and promotes a sense of collectivistic personality (though individualism is not lacking, as we point out below). People are either nomadic or settled, that is they either wander or have fixed places of residence. Further, people relate to authority by co-presence. The interactions are reciprocal and continuous with concrete other persons.</p>
<p><italic>Patria</italic> (Greek: <italic>patris</italic>) means birthplace, or locale of one's immediate ancestry and family (see Danker a.v.; for Jesus, this was Nazareth: Matt 13:54; Mark 6:1; Luke 4:23–24), and space is people inhabiting a place. Polity is coterminous with kin-groups and ancestors, since people remain bound by blood and affinity even after death (hence the significance of ancestrism in ancient Israel, e.g., Gen 35:2–29; 48:29–33; 50:22–26). Adherents of the polity are kin, because polity is defined by birth processes. Information is shared by face-to-face memory. Co-presence is central: individuals are engulfed and supported by the close physical presence of others. Moreover, tradition rooted in shared memory engulfs and supports the group. Space is determined by the place of the kin-group's origin and location. The sum of these characteristics of face-to-face interaction fleshes out the impact of such domination upon the psychological development of each individual in the group.</p>
<p>Further, while kinship is the basic building block of psychological development, in MENA societies it has three distinctive features:</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>it is endogamous (the ideal marriage partner is Father's brother's daughter, or patrilateral parallel cousin; Gregg: 59);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>social groupings (family, kin, village, etc.) are segmentary in nature, that is, they are split into smaller competing groups but also sometimes into larger cooperating groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the basic building blocks are <italic>not</italic> families or lineages but rather “patronymic associations,” that is, fluid and flexible family-like groupings that are extended by patron-client relations with non-kin. Sometimes these groupings seem to resemble what anthropologists call “lineages.” Malina observes that when persons engage in patron-client relationships, the interactions change from face-to-face to face-to-grace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146107913482418">Malina 1994</xref>: 6–8, 13–14).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To summarize, MENA societies of antiquity manifest:</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a symbiotic relationship of agricultural and pastoral ways of life (e.g., Gen 4:1–2, Cain and Abel)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>tensions between honor-based and religion-based ethical systems which provide the primary etiquettes of interpersonal relationships. (Honor-based system: lying is an acceptable strategy for maintaining honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146107913482418">Pilch 1992</xref>); religion-based system: “Though shalt not lie to one another” Lev 19:11)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a “dialectic” of rural and urban ways of life (see the parables of Jesus, e.g., Luke 16:1–9).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the “endogamous” organization of marriage, family, and kinship systems (Patriarchs, e.g., Gen 24; 27:46–28:5; etc.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the “segmentary” nature of social groupings (nested groups are both unified and fractured; MENA proverb: “I against my brother; I and my brother against our cousin; etc.”)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the centrality of “patronymic associations” — family-like groupings extended by patron-client relationships—to both social life and individual life cycles. Here ties of kinship, friendship, and patron-clientship mingle and merge.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section5-0146107913482418">
<title>Periods of Psychological Development</title>
<p>Gregg (136) builds his models on an adaptation of Erik Erikson's <italic>life-stage theory of development</italic> combined with the theory of <italic>three levels of personality organization</italic> presented by G. H. Mead, Robert LeVine, and Dan McAdams. He reduces Erikson's eight developmental stages to six since MENA research is not specific enough to address the eight. The six stages are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Infancy, first 2 years of life.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Early childhood, age 3 to 7.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Late childhood, about 7 to puberty.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adolescence from puberty to late teens.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Young adulthood from late teens to mid-twenties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adulthood from mid-twenties on.</p></list-item></list>
<p>A recent lexical semantic study (with no interest in psychological development) offers the following transliterated Hebrew words that describe stages of the (male) life cycle in Bible (Eng: 127):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>yld</italic> (“infant”; 0–3 years)</p>
<p><italic>qtn n'r/n'r</italic> (“boy”; 3–13 years)</p>
<p><italic>n'r</italic> (“young man”; 13–25 years)</p>
<p><italic>gbr/'yš</italic> (“mature adult”; 25–60 years)</p>
<p><italic>zqn</italic> (“old age”; 60–70 years)</p>
<p><italic>sybh twbh / sb' ymym / zqn m'd</italic> (“extreme old age”; 70+ years)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While not paying explicit attention to psychological development, biblical authors appear to have consistently identified life stages corresponding to those proposed by contemporary social scientists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146107913482418">
<title>A Three-level Model of Personality Organization</title>
<p>Gregg uses this model to explore how the value systems of honor-modesty and religion especially influence the development of middle-level characteristics, or culturally specific psychological entities, namely, sentiments. movites, and social personas (see below). Gregg prefers “modesty” to “shame” since it forges loyalties among men to protect land and women, especially against alliances of cousins (Gregg: 63–64). Religion, in our case, is of course Judaism.</p>
<sec id="section7-0146107913482418">
<title>Level 1: Core Personality contains three broad classes of dispositional traits:</title>
<list id="list1-0146107913482418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>basic, probably genetically</italic> determined, parameters of individual functioning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>motivational residues</italic> of early experience. The child's representations of its wishes and fears concerning other persons in its early life provide unconscious prototypes for its <italic>emotional response to others in subsequent environments.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adaptive organizations</italic> that monitor and regulate responses to stimuli coming from the external environment and internal needs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Core Personality thus encompasses the “emergent self,” “the core self,” “the subjective self,” and “the verbal self” that emerge in succession in infancy and early childhood, as well as the “personal disposition” which Dan McAdams theorizes as forming “Level I” personality characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146107913482418">
<title>Level 2: Identity —needs and motives</title>
<p>A self-concept or identity is an internal mental representation of the self that includes boundaries between, and identities with, the self and other individuals, groups, and ideologies. In its functioning as a member of society, the individual uses this enduring self-concept to monitor personal behavior and to determine the extent to which each behavior pattern is ego-syntonic, that is, consistent with his image of himself.</p>
<p>The honor-modesty system and also religious values and practices especially shape level 2. To describe the level 2 structures shaped by the MENA's two predominant value systems, Gregg uses the terms <italic>sentiment</italic> rather than “emotion,” <italic>motive</italic> rather than “trait,” and <italic>social persona</italic> (or <italic>social self</italic>) rather than self (Gregg: 106).</p>
<p>A <italic>sentiment</italic> is longer lasting than an emotion. It entails an active, continuous pursuit or avoidance of a state. The honor-modesty system shapes universal human emotions into culturally distinctive sentiments: “honor,” “modesty,” and “shame.” These further include sentiments of purity and pollution (see Leviticus), a sense of blessedness and its depletion (blessedness, e.g., Ps 1; depletion of blessedness, e.g., anxiety over Evil Eye, Sir 31:13; 37:11; etc.), a sense of receiving divine mercy and compassion (Exod 33:19; Rom 9:15); an “awe” or “fear” of divine power and judgment (Prov 1:7; frequent in Prov and Sir), and, closely allied with this awe, sentiments of righteousness and propriety associated with taking Jesus as one's model and staying on “the straight path” of virtue (1 Cor 4:16). These may converge into a sense of oneness or union with God, which overcomes a competing sense of estrangement from the divine.</p>
<p>A <italic>motive</italic> influences the long-term course of lives. The honor-modesty system fashions a set of <italic>needs</italic> or <italic>motives</italic> that define important dimensions of individual personality in the MENA culture area. The concepts of <italic>need</italic> and <italic>motive</italic> best describe how honor, modesty, and shame become psychological dispositions. Four psychological needs or motives stand out as important dimensions of individual variation in MENA societies: a need for purification (e.g., Leviticus), a need for blessedness (e.g., Temple pilgrimages), propriety (e.g., fear of God fuels the need for propriety), and mercy (understood as refuge and haven from social strife, life disappointments, sinful acts, or the terror of mortality). Mercy is equivalent to paying one's debt of gratitude. Thus, one who seeks mercy equivalently says: “I need your help right now, and you owe me!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146107913482418">Malina 1998</xref>: 92–94).</p>
<p><italic>A Social Persona.</italic> The idiosyncratically internalized honor-modesty system showed two important features. First, it constructed a whole configuration of self-in-the-world, governed by a set of game-like rules (e.g., “making oneself out to be …” as a response to Jesus' question in Mark 8:27 “Who do people say that I am?”). Second, it crystallized <italic>as if</italic> in the view of others, <italic>as if</italic> witnessed by “society” in general.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0146107913482418">
<title>Level 3: Social Persona (Social Self)</title>
<p>The social self or social persona is an identity anchored in a life story. Religious belief and practices constitute a <italic>social persona</italic> that coexists alongside the <italic>social persona</italic> formed by internalizing the honor-modesty system (see above).</p>

</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0146107913482418">
<title>Part II: Application of Gregg's Models to Biblical Data</title>
<p>Gregg links the six-period model of development adapted from Erikson with the three-level theory of psychological inspired by Mead, LeVine, and McAdams as the analytical framework for evaluating the accumulated psychological research on “traditional” MENA societies. In sum, these societies balance settled agriculture and nomadic pastoralism, experience a dialectic between rural and urban ways of life, and favor patriarchal (but “matrifocal”) family systems. These characteristics influence psychological development at each stage.</p>
<sec id="section11-0146107913482418">
<title>Childbirth and Infant Care (first two years of life)</title>
<p>Cultural models of child care have three features: moral direction, a pragmatic design, and a set of conventional scripts for action. There are two models: pediatric and pedagogical. The pediatric model aims at ensuring infant survival. It is found mainly in traditional or pre-technological milieus where the incidence of morbidity and mortality are quite high. This model is an adaptation to conditions of poor nutrition, high infant morality, and hot climates. The pegagogic model, in contrast, aims at fostering exploration and learning such as is favored in the West and in modernizing sectors of “developing societies.” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146107913482418">Table 1</xref> shows how the models compare (Gregg: 156).</p>

<p>Pediatric strategies prepare for apprenticeship (imitate, obey); pedagogic strategies prepare for the classroom (ask questions, explore). Traditional MENA societies follow the pediatric model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146107913482418">Pilch 1993</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section12-0146107913482418">
<title>Conception and Birth</title>
<p>In MENA, women are considered as the field; males provide the seed (Wis 7:1–2). The child is presumed to get its bones from the father, and blood (or sometimes flesh) from the mother. In traditional contexts, motherhood fulfills a woman's destiny, confirms her adult status, and solidifies her marriage—all of which are put in jeopardy by failure to conceive (1 Sam 1, Hannah). Also in MENA societies, conception by wind/spirit takes place with animals and with humans (see Martin). Thus Mary's conception of Jesus by a “Holy Wind” (Holy Spirit) is not as culturally puzzling in “traditional” MENA societies as in modern, Western scientific societies. A pregnant woman also becomes vulnerable to evil spirits and the Evil Eye, and she may conceal her pregnancy as long as possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0146107913482418">
<title>Naming</title>
<p>The child is named after seven days. In the biblical world, this is also when boys are circumcised (Luke 1:59; 2:21; Lev 12:2). Research indicates that in many societies that circumcise boys, the foreskin is regarded as a bit of feminine tissue that must be removed to masculinize the penis (Gregg: 200). However, being circumcised at this young age, the boy remains in the woman's world. Thus for the biblical world, circumcision does not mark a transition, since there is no transition. Thus, interpreting the rite is tricky and confusing. Scholars think, however, that it may play a role in reproducing the patriarchal orientation. Boys blame the mothers as mutilators (because they allowed it) and direct anger toward them and not toward the fathers. This is because the infant is taken from the women's world and returned there after the procedure. In the life of Jesus, this experience might be one explanation (among others) for his apparently negative exchanges with his mother.</p>
<p>After the birth, the mother and baby usually observe a 40-day period of seclusion, during which her relatives care for her as she cares for her baby (Luke 1:56, Mary plausibly helps Elizabeth). The loss of blood—said to be “black” or “dirty” just like no-longer-productive menstrual blood—and the opening of the body puts the mother in a state of pollution (Lev 12; Luke 2:22–24, 39). The woman is protectively enclosed or “covered” during the period in which her body is “open,” impure, and vulnerable (see the Kypseli video, and compare the old Christian custom of “churching,” that is, allowing a woman to return to public worship after 40 days of confinement by conferring a special blessing at the door of the church).</p>

<title>Swaddling</title>
<p>Infants are swaddled (Wis 7:4; Luke 2:7, 12). However, in most MENA societies, women carry infants in slings and gradually move them from the chest to the hip and to the back (see Nemet-Nejat: 130 for ancient Mesopotamia). Swaddling usually extends only for the first five months. This practice contrasts with the “cradle” or “crib” in Western or European cultures. Mothers give many different “health” explanations for the practice: swaddling keeps the baby warm, makes its limbs straight and strong; it is also easier to keep a child clean. A cultural explanation is that swaddling confines the infant and teaches it that s/he is not “free,” cannot wave his/her arms wildly but must lie still. She or he is not in control of life; others are.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0146107913482418">
<title>Nursing</title>
<p>Throughout the MENA region, mothers nurse frequently and on demand. In some instances, it may be as much as fifteen to twenty times a day! Nursing is the immediate response to restlessness, because in this MENA world, the ideal child is a quiet child. The child should be “seen and not heard.” Most women nurse up to the second or third year (or the next pregnancy). “I enveloped you for nine months and have fed you with my breast” is supposed to be one of the most effective and compelling entreaties in MENA societies (Gregg: 166; Boddy: 51; compare the mother of the Maccabees in 2 Macc 7:27). Women use this plea when they want obedience or assistance in later years. MENA's pediatric model seems to facilitate the development of “secure attachment” and of what Erikson terms “basic trust.” It also soothes distress and modulates emotional excitement. Perhaps most of all, it builds a strong bond of compassion and interdependence between mother and infant. This bond becomes so strong and intense that in the West among adults it is viewed as co-dependency.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that a two- or three-year-old child can speak. Boys learn that their demand to be fed is answered immediately. It is no stretch of the imagination, therefore, to imagine such a boy growing to adulthood, learning to read and write, and composing the creation story (Gen 1). If the boy's word is immediately effective in obtaining nourishment, why should God's word not be even more effective?</p>
<p>The pediatric period ends with weaning. However, this diminishing maternal care is replaced by a wider circle of caretakers, namely all the women of the household or village. This delays individuation, but group-attachment grows. Identification now with the household forms a “group self” that serves as a psychological “bridge” from the interdependent mother-son dyad to the larger society beyond the family (collectivism). Nevertheless, weaning is abrupt and often traumatic. Boys are breast fed longer than girls to promote an interdependence of mother and son that will serve the mother well in the future, a form of “social security.” Msefer believes that prolonged and abruptly terminated indulgence roots the pervasive fear of the Evil Eye, evil spirits, and other malevolent beings, since the mother is not there to protect the child as before. Now extended families become an important “object” to the weaned child. Mediterranean ethnographies suggest that over and above people's attachments to individual members of their households, they become attached to the “house” as an idealized, honor-bearing entity that persists through generations as individuals come and go (beth ‘ab). Family or “house” serves as a “self object,” an “other in which one participates and derives a sense of self” (Gregg: 176).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Swaddling, nursing on demand and used in order to quiet crying, carrying, and co-sleeping coalesce to establish a protective, soothing, excitation-dampening maternal bond during the first year or so. Mothers talk to children, but these are nothing at all like the stimulating, face-to-face conversations typical of American mothers. As Judy Brink observes: “These infants do not have toys to play with and do not form attachments to blankets or dolls as do American children. They learn to play with people, not inanimate objects.” However, these child-rearing practices associated with birth and infant-care involve serious development discontinuities. In addition, they establish sharply different trajectories for boys and girls. For further results of these practices see French.</p>

<title>Early Childhood (Ages 3–7). Level 1 of Personality Organization.</title>
<p>Toddlers now bereft of breast feeding (security, all the more significant for boys but still serious for both genders because of food shortages) develop an interactional style of “assertive dependency” and learn modesty and politeness relative to differing situations and kin-relations. These are useful in subsequent kinship and patron-client relationships. In other words, boys and girls learn how to manipulate situations to their advantage. They become masters at it. Particularly between the ages of 5 and 7, there is a shift from a pediatric model of infant care to an apprenticeship-and-obedience model of child rearing in MENA societies. At this stage, core or Level 1 Personality begins to develop. We view this in two sections: attachments and social behavior; and gender development.</p>
<sec id="section18-0146107913482418">
<title>Attachments and Social Behavior</title>
<p><italic>Maternal Caretaking.</italic> Weaned children are now neglected by the mothers who prefer the new infants. Older sisters or female cousins from age 5 to 15 often become a toddler's primary caretakers, carrying them in slings on their backs, cleaning and feeding them, and taking them along on errands. Mothers sometimes hit the toddlers, which contributes to an aggressive style of dependency (competition). The child now has to “fight” with siblings as it were to get its mother's attention. The child is raised in the women's quarters, and fathers have little contact and do little caretaking with infants and toddlers.</p>
<p><italic>Poor Health and Fears of Invisible Beings.</italic> The period between ages 2 and 4 is typically filled with health problems in MENA societies, perhaps due to reduced maternal care. In traditional milieus, many childhood ailments are believed to be caused by evil spirits (possession; e.g., Matt 17:14–21) and the Evil Eye. Anxious parents take a great many precautions. Since boys are so prized in MENA cultures, parents sometimes dress young boys like girls, and they affix apotropaic talismans (e.g., blue stones, or scarlet ribbons) to their clothing to protect against the Evil Eye. Some problems thought to be caused by Evil Eye are illnesses, nightmares, “hysterical” paralyses, illicit sexual thoughts, accidents, injuries, and even death. The Gospels report the near death or death of a twelve year old girl whom Jesus restored to life and well-being (Mark 5:22–24, 35–43//Matt 9:18–19, 23–26//Luke 9:40–42, 49–53). Given the high rates of infant and child mortality in ancient MENA societies, this girl was fortunate to have survived to the age of twelve. She may well have been the envy of others in the village who lost children at an early age. It is culturally plausible that this girl may have been the victim of the victim of the Evil Eye cast by the other villagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146107913482418">Pilch 2011</xref>: 89–105). In societies that believe in the Evil Eye, perfectly healthy members can die if they are convinced someone has cast it upon them.</p>
<p><italic>Hunger, Food, and Blessedness</italic>, During childhood, food continues to come primarily from the mother and other household women, both because women and children customarily eat separate from the men (Matt 14:13–21, esp. v 21), and because women work with food nearly all day long and intermittently give morsels to children (see Kypseli video). However, it is important to remember that the context was endemic hunger, a condition of long term food deprivation (MacDonald: 58). Eating meat was a rarity, and availability of grains depended on unpredictable and often insufficient rain. Moreover, taxation was so high (perhaps as high as 40% to 60% of crop production) that it is more appropriately called exploitation. In such circumstances, endemic hunger led to chronic malnutrition. One can readily appreciate the value of developing assertive dependency by a youngster in the struggle for the limited good, food; yet the mother and other women still might not have had much to share with the youngsters.</p>
<p><italic>Sibling Rivalry.</italic> Rivalry is openly encouraged by the shaming of a child with the strategy of comparing him with another. The purpose of this strategy is to encourage competitiveness. Paul gives a good example of a similar strategy (Rom 11:11, 13). According to Paul since God's first born (Israel) did not respond to divine overtures, God was disappointed and therefore welcomed non-Israelites, but not a great number and only on a temporary basis in order to make Israel jealous (Malina &amp; Pilch: 74). With his preaching, Paul intended to do the same (Rom 11:14). In traditional MENA societies, the mother generally bonds with the first born. However, the first born does not always respond appropriately. To elicit a favorable response, the mother will give the first born a gift, then tear it away and give it to another sibling, hoping to make the first born jealous and to win his affection and devotion. Parents do not provoke such competition from girls, whom they rarely tease with sibling comparisons.</p>
<p>In the world of “limited good,” children—especially boys —need to become assertive, competitive, clever, and persistent. Gregg prefers the term “assertive dependency” (rather than “aggressive dependency”) for it lays an interpersonal foundation for building subsequent client-patron relations with both kin and non-kin patrons.</p>
<p><italic>Children's Social Groups</italic> (based on Beatrice Whiting). In this section (191–95), Gregg extrapolates some of the research conclusions from the classic study by the Whitings (see also Edwards &amp; Bloch) and applies them to MENA societies. The Whitings studied 3–6 year olds and 7–11 year olds in six cultures. They were observed for at least 14 five minute periods over several months, and instances of the following peer-interaction behaviors were coded:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>They concluded that these interactions related to cultural complexity. In the three simple cultures (Kenyan, Mexican, Philippine) children tended to be at the nurturant-responsible end, and in the three complex cultures (Okinawan, Indian, American) they tended to be at the dependent-dominant end. Simple cultures are those in which women play a greater role in food production; children begin carrying wood and water, taking care of animals, preparing food, and cleaning at the ages of three to five. Complex cultures are those in which women are assigned primarily to household tasks; children typically begin these chores a little later or very much later. Gregg postulates that MENA societies are complex cultures. Boys are given no serious tasks until age five (see Kypseli video), when they may be asked to carry messages and run errands. They do not begin helping with farm work until the age of seven. Girls typically assume major infant-care responsibilities and household work at their mother's sides by the age of five. Girls are much more “nurturant-responsible” than boys (with mother all day), and boys are much more “dependent-dominant.”</p>
<p>The close association of dependence and dominance might seem paradoxical, but Gregg notes that it is important to keep in mind that the MENA's Big Family clientage systems repeatedly have been characterized as built from negotiated dyadic bonds of dominance and dependence.</p>
<p>The Whitings also discovered another contrast associated with household organization: sociable-intimate versus authoritarian-aggressive. Children in cultures with mostly nuclear families (Mexican, Philippine, American) score at the “sociable-intimate” end, while those with mostly extended or polygynous families (Kenyan, Indian, Okinawan) score at the “authoritarian-aggressive” end. Basically, this has to do with the quantity and character of fathers' involvement with their wives and children.</p>
<p>As MENA societies traditionally follow the patrilineal-extended pattern, they should be expected to facilitate more “authoritarian-aggressive” social behavior than “sociable-intimate.” In MENA societies, segregation of men and women, both inside and outside the household, is often more pronounced than in sub-Saharan Africa. MENA ethnographers note relatively high levels of competitive aggression among children. Older siblings and cousins are expected to act as parental authorities with younger ones, often carrying out this role with zest as they grow older and begin to be given responsibility for maintaining the family's honor in the community.</p>
<p>According to Meier, Jesus probably had brothers and sisters. “Hence, from a purely philological and historical point of view, the most probable opinion is that the brothers and sisters of Jesus [mentioned in the NT] were his siblings” (Meier: 332). These were plausibly children of Joseph and Mary after the birth of Jesus. Joseph, of course, was not Jesus' father. The siblings named in the New Testament are James, Joseph, Simon, Judas, and unnamed sisters (Matt 13:55–56//). Jesus was apparently the oldest. This position entails obligations toward the siblings, not to mention “social security” for his mother after the death of Joseph. Perhaps this explains why there is no evidence that Jesus was married. How did he relate to his younger siblings, and they to him? What impact did this have on his and their psychological development? In his adult life, we are told that “even his brothers did not believe in him” (John 7:5). On another occasion, his family attempted to save his life by declaring him “crazy” after he had seriously offended powerful authorities who resolved to destroy him (Mark 3:6, 21–22).</p>
<p>Data from the Six Cultures Study thus converge with ethnographic observations to suggest that MENA children —at least boys—tend to be more “dependent-dominant” than “nurturant-responsible” and more “authoritarian-aggressive” than “sociable-intimate” in their social behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0146107913482418">
<title>Gender Development</title>
<p>Gender differences seem to emerge around five to seven years of age. Gender is constituted of three surprisingly independent components, formed by different processes and different time schedules: gender role behaviors, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Sexual orientation appears both more biologically based and culturally determined than the outcome of parent-child interactions.</p>
<p><italic>Gender role behaviors.</italic> MENA societies' child care and socialization practices described above entail the modeling/reinforcement/punishment-driven learning of gender role behaviors: how to act as a boy or girl. About the ages of five to seven children learn this. By five or six, girls are assigned the responsibility of helping their mothers, thus becoming “nurturant-responsible.” Boys at this age have fewer tasks that require cooperation or caretaking, are less likely to be closely supervised, and more likely to be prodded or teased into competition, that is, to become more “assertively dependent” or “dependent-dominant.”</p>
<p><italic>Gender identity.</italic> Biological maleness and femaleness usually solidifies before the age of 3; constructing masculine and feminine gender identity, however, is a much more complex process that takes longer.</p>
<p><italic>Sexual orientation.</italic> Boys and girls start out life “as if” they were girls, strongly attached to their mothers. They each develop a core sense of self that is fundamentally feminine. Then the developmental tasks of boys and girls diverge. Girls have to shift erotic and love attachment from mothers to men, while retaining their core feminine sense of self and identification with mother. By contrast, boys must shift identification and sense of self from early femininity to an achieved masculinity, while retaining their sensual attachment to women. For boys, this results in “male gender ambiguity.” The New Testament gives two hints of gender ambiguity. As he laments over the Holy City: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you” Jesus continues: “How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not” (Matt 23:37–39). The image of rooster would be more appropriate than mother hen. Or Paul writing to the Jesus groups in Galatia: “My children, I am going through the pain of giving birth to you all over again, until Christ is formed in you” (Gal 4:19). Even if anachronistically Paul were familiar with and experienced in the Lamaze method, he would have no real empathy for birth pains.</p>
<p>The prevailing cultural model for rearing boys into men entails “feminizing” or “emasculating” them by forcing their subjection to harsh authority (usually in the 7 to 12 age period), which then motivates them to achieve and prove their manhood via competition with peers, domination of women and juniors, and identification with figures of authority. The Wisdom literature (notably Proverbs) that prescribes severe physical discipline of young boys proposes this as a strategy for making a man out of possibly effeminate young boys who were raised by all the women with little to no male influence (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146107913482418">Pilch 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146107913482418">1995</xref>). This results in a kind of machismo masculinity, whereby boys reject their “feminine” side but idealize and worship the woman as mother or virgin while despising the loose or wanton woman.</p>

<sec id="section20-0146107913482418">
<title>Late Childhood (Ages 7–12 to Puberty). Level 2 of Personality Organization.</title>
<p>MENA research indicates that a pair of potentially complementary social personae (or social selves) coalesce during this period, organized around the culture's predominant value orientations: the honor-modesty system and Judaism. These value orientations mold culturally distinctive sentiments, motives, and social selves that begin to emerge after viewing one's self from the perspective of society's primary roles and values. The pediatric model of care now evolves into an apprenticeship and obedience model. The submission and obedience fostered by the pediatric model is now further strengthened as respect for parents forces children to learn their adult responsibilities. Boys have to learn how to fight for family, village, and kin-group.</p>
<sec id="section21-0146107913482418">
<title>Kinship Relations and the Politics of Honor</title>
<p>By the age of six or seven, many children will have been cared for, comforted, ordered about, reprimanded, entertained, and taught by a variety of older siblings, grandparents, and aunts and uncles” (Gregg: 216). A boy is called by relationship (“my grandson),” and only after he has learned his kinship lesson is he called by his given name. The challenge, therefore, is to learn how to deal with patronymic relations. Recall that this is more than the family, even the extended family. Children must learn a core set of values, etiquettes, and strategies needed to maneuver within the patronymic association and the larger community. These strategies include deference (a sort of cultural humility calculated to obtain a request from another); hospitality (reciprocity for dyadic relations); assertive dependence (competition with siblings for limited goods); sacrifice (to force a response from others); protection (girls nurture siblings, boys defend them); intimidation (in order to maintain one's status); and mediation (strategies for defusing potential hostility, e.g., Matt 5:9; Luke 12–15). This family or kin-centered “we” consolidates in late childhood with mastery of the just mentioned repertoire of etiquettes, forming an honor-oriented social self or social persona.</p>
<p><italic>Fathers.</italic> The cultural model of fatherhood in MENA societies requires a shift from warmth, affection, and playfulness (even limited as it may have been) in early childhood to distance, formality, and discipline during this period (late childhood). In biblical society, it is possible that the father played little to no role in a child's life during early childhood. The majority of emotional care came from the women of the household. What the father must do when a boy enters the men's world at puberty is teach the boy “how to be a man.” As noted above, that is one purpose of the physical discipline of sons recommended in Proverbs (e.g., Prov 13:24; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146107913482418">Pilch 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146107913482418">1995</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Mothers.</italic> The predominant cultural model prescribes no fundamental change in mothering during late childhood as it does for fathers. Mothers spontaneously continue indulgent nurturing as a natural and necessary counterweight to the father's “new” responsibility to impose authority, especially for boys. Mothers employ such strategies as nurturing, indulgence, and protection to build interdependent loyalties. This is especially true with sons. Since affection and companionship are often lacking in the (arranged) marriage (viz., FBD), mothers turn to sons for emotional ties. Moreover, the son is social security after the death of the husband. “Mother and son constitute the only heterosexual couple that remains a stable unit in this patrilineal and patriarchal society” (Gregg: 226). She also has to be able to control the daughters-in-law but will be aided in this task by daughters, at least until they marry and move into their husband's patriarch's compound. Idealization of the mother by her sons serves as a linchpin of the patriarchal system, constraining women to the role of nurturing mother, and men to the role of her guardian (Stevens). At the heart of the patriarchal order there lies a psychological “kingdom of Mothers.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0146107913482418">
<title>Gender Differentiation</title>
<p>Throughout late childhood gender differentiation increases still further. This manifests itself mainly in terms of the spaces in which boys and girls move, and the activities in which they take part. Girls experience continuity (learn homemaking skills, but more segregated from boys); boys experience discontinuity (paternal harshness replaces maternal warmth). With both male authorities and peers, boys face tests of strength, courage, endurance, and self-control and may be teasingly or humiliatingly insulted as “donkeys,” “women,” or “homosexuals,” or threatened with castration. Emerging from intense nurturing by the women, the adolescent boy will spend the rest of his life trying to learn how to be a man and to prove it, endlessly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0146107913482418">
<title>Peers and Play</title>
<p>Traditional parents don't usually play with children of this age (though they do play with younger ones). Neither do they give them toys nor organize their play. Children associate mainly with relatives and neighbors; so most relationships continue to be governed by principles of familial hierarchy. As already noted, they learn the etiquettes of deference, and how to relate to various family members and associates in the patronymic association.</p>
<p>Children's groups are as important to their socialization as family interaction at this stage. Children gain vital experience with peers in the interpersonal strategies—assertive dependence, sacrifice, protection, intimidation, mediation, and so on as noted above—that they later will use to build networks of personal relations. It is practice or rehearsal that complements what they learn in family interaction.</p>
<p>Girls play separately and differently from the boys. Girls' games imitate women's chores. Many rhyming games that girls play tend to focus on personal possessions, sexual organs, and excrements. In the context of play this bawdy language is beyond reprimand.</p>
<p>Boys' peer play and organized games constitute an essential arena for establishing a sense of masculinity. The games include three key elements:</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the negotiation of hierarchical senior-junior, leader-follower, ruler-commoner dyads, important for adult life;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>courageous physical competition (and insults) against equals; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>domination of girls and “womanly” boys.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Quite likely the children's games to which Jesus referred (Matt 11:17–18) involved only boys. Games provide youngsters with an opportunity to experience various roles and scenarios that help them learn to see the self from the perspective of the Generalized Other (“who do people say I am?” Mark 8:27; on games, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146107913482418">Pilch 2012</xref>: 273–78). If MENA's social order, as Eickelman writes, is woven of “dyadic relations of domination and subordination,” then much of the learning of attitudes, styles, and strategies appropriate to both stances appears to be rehearsed in late childhood play.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0146107913482418">
<title>Religion</title>
<p>In addition to sentiments and motives related to states of purity-pollution, children also develop a sense of seeking to please God, an awe and often fear of God (that is, knowing who God is and who one is as a human being; Ps 111:10), a sense of receiving divine mercy and compassion when needed. Very likely these sentiments help consolidate a “social self”—that is, a self as viewed from the perspective of a Generalized Other consisting of God, the prophets, divine and demonic beings, and the community of believers into which the child is maturing. The reaction of fellow townspeople to Jesus' behavior in the synagogue at Nazareth indicates that they did not approve of the “social self” that Jesus constructed for himself (Mark 6:1–6; Luke 4:16–20; Matt 13:53–58).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0146107913482418">
<title>Adolescence (puberty to late teens).</title>
<p>Gregg observes that traditional Moroccan and probably MENA society did not recognize adolescence as a developmental period (Gregg: 252). It was quite brief for boys, and practically didn't exist for girls. The major psychological task of this period consisted of subordinating burgeoning individualistic strivings to family and community authority (collectivism). MENA societies have many tales of prodigal sons, that is, sons who did the hard work but were not treated as adult men, and hence badly misbehaved or left home (Gregg: 268; consider Luke 15:11–32 for a different perspective). Like most complex agricultural societies (China, India, medieval Europe), MENA societies do not hold initiation rites for adolescents (no bar mitzvah in Judaism until the Talmud, 500 <sc>ce</sc>). Adolescence in MENA societies—as in nearly all traditional societies—ended with marriage. Girls married within two years of puberty in 60 percent of societies examined.</p>
<p>New developmental themes now come to the fore. Boys' rough games evolve into more serious business of “performing manhood” (machismo). These may entail deadly games of challenge and riposte, dramatic displays of filial loyalty, or ascetic feats of religious devotion. By late childhood most are familiar with bawdy talk and romantic poetry and song. The play in which boys engage entails a good deal of obscene, sexual, and explicitly phallic imagery. It persists into adulthood. This raises a point worth pursuing. “Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, ‘You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the same of your mother's nakedness?’” (1 Sam 20:30). “Shame” and “nakedness” in Hebrew refer to the genitals; NJB translates “rebellious woman” as “slut”). Mayer says that in the collected sayings of Jesus, he uses 70 adjectives from daily, low class living. For example, Jesus uses a Greek word for toilet (<italic>aphedron</italic>, Matt 15:17; Mark 7:19) that is definitely low class. It is best translated as “shit house,” a good Greek proletarian word. The upper classes used the word <italic>ochetos</italic> (Mark 7:19d). Even today, MENA society adolescents begin telephone conversations with an exchange of friendly obscenities before getting to the business at hand. Is Jesus' use of the insulting word <italic>hypokrites</italic> in Matthew when referring to the Pharisees a remnant of his adolescence (though not as obscene as Saul's statement)? (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146107913482418">Pilch 2012</xref>:158–62).</p>
<p>For boys in traditional milieus, there may still remain some years of “youth” between sexual maturity and marriage. The challenges at this period are that they can hone, test, and perform the components of honorable manhood and assimilate the symbolic associations of masculinity: outside rather than inside, right rather than left, seed rather than soil, bone rather than flesh, pure rather than pollution, etc.</p>
<p>For girls, the stricter control imposed at puberty often brings an abrupt end to their “youth.” Fuller veiling and seclusion may also be enforced. Menstruation confers value but is also disempowering:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… menstruation signals fecundity but its cultural meanings tend to be negative. Menstrual blood is regarded as polluted and polluting; while menstruating women do not have to remove themselves from social interaction (as they do in some cultures), it is nonetheless a period of uncleanliness, as it was traditionally throughout the Mediterranean [Gregg: 258; see Lev 15].</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0146107913482418">
<title>Early Adulthood and Identity (late teens to mid-twenties). Level 3 of Personality Organization).</title>
<p>There is a large literature on identity in MENA societies but little is by psychologists. The internalization of cultural constructions of social personae in accord with the imperatives of honor-modesty and religion (Judaism) do not assign identities, but challenge individuals to fashion them in terms of these two value systems. The development of the third level of personality organization—for which Gregg uses Erikson's term <italic>identity</italic>—begins with the individual taking up the challenge to prove that he or she can live up to the culturally assigned ideals, or to revise or reject those ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146107913482418">Pilch 2012</xref>: 158–62).</p>
<p>The culture's “sociocentric” emphasis on familial loyalty coexists with powerful individualistic imperatives, and these readily come into conflict in late adolescence and early adulthood. The majority of young men and women resolve these in favor of family loyalties, making the key psychological “task” one of renouncing individualistic strivings—rather than that of separating from familiar interdependencies and achieving autonomy, as Western theories assume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146107913482418">Pilch 2012</xref>: 116–21).</p>
<p>In traditional milieus, adolescents become full participants in the honor-modesty system and religion, e.g., Judaism. The honor system presented men with a prototype of a truly honorable man along with a complement (idealized, of course): the modest and fecund woman, as well as a number of revolting opposites, in particular, the weak, cowardly, or unbalanced man (Prov 11:17, 20–21; 12:8; etc.) and the dishonorable and/or barren woman (Prov 2:16; 5:3; 5:20; etc). The image of woman as polluting, lacking reason, subject to desires and therefore a source of chaos and discord provides men with a ready vehicle for projectively denying their own negative qualities as they define their identities in terms of purity, reason, and self-control.</p>

<title>Mature Adulthood</title>
<p>Western theories of adult development appear to have limited applicability to MENA societies. Scholars conjecture that women may not have lived longer than 30 years, and men no longer than 40 (Meyers: 28). Given the harsh demands of peasant life, they had little time for anything else but to struggle for survival. Individualism versus collectivism in MENA societies emerges as an important topic of discussion among contemporary researchers, especially since MENA societies are assumed to be purely and exclusively “collectivist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146107913482418">Pilch 2012</xref>: 119). Kagitcibasi (96–97) and Joseph (13) argue that MENA societies cannot be termed “collectivist,” but that they foster forms of “connectivity” or “interrelatedness” in some spheres of life and individualism in others.</p>
<p>Studies of MENA women show that they often acquire a good deal of power and prestige in mid-life and later. Think of Sarah commanding a reluctant Abraham to cast out Hagar and her son (Gen 21:8–14), or Rebecca forcing her son Jacob to deceive his father and her husband (Gen 27), or Bathsheba arranging for Solomon to succeed David (1 Kings 1).</p>
<p>Two significant issues that bear on psychological development in adulthood in MENA societies are the “socio-centrism” versus “egocentrism” of MENA culture and self (as already noted); and culturally patterned shifts in gender orientation in mid- and later-life, that is, becoming more masculinely feminine, and more femininely masculine.</p>
<p>Gregg briefly summarizes research on basic personality traits (introversion-extroversion and neuroticism; and the “Big Five” traits) and on anxiety (Gregg: 326–34). The Big Five traits are</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>surgency (or extroversion)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>agreeableness,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conscientiousness,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>emotional stability (or neuroticism) and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>culture (or intellect or openness to experience; Gregg: 108; Wiggins).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Introversion-extroversion and neuroticism are probably inherited dimensions of personality. In general, the studies of these personality traits provide relatively strong evidence that general anxiety levels tend to be higher in MENA societies than in Western ones, and higher than in at least some other developing societies (e.g., “ataque de nervios”; see Guarnaccia &amp; Rogler). As already noted, “Several non-Western psychologists have argued that individualism and collectivism do not form a continuum on which cultures can be ranked, and proposed that either the I and C are specific to domains of life, or I and C form independent dimensions, so a person can be “high” or “low” on both” (Gregg: 336–37). Kagitcibasi argues that individualism versus collectivism is perhaps the most significant dimension on which cultures differ. However, neither of these forms a single dimension that characterizes all social domains. She also believes that the psychological orientations of “separatedness and relatedness” coexist in most individuals, who can experience them either in conflict or confluence.</p>
<p>Suad Joseph uses the term <italic>connectivity</italic> to describe the strongly interdependent bonds that develop in MENA society families. These differ from Western ideals of nuclear family relations, in that they emphasize group ties over individuality and in that they blend bonds of love and nurturing with the “patriarchal” authority of men over women and seniors over juniors. It is this blending of affection and authority, she believes, that makes the patriarchal system so resilient: “in patriarchal societies connectivity can become a psychodynamic instrument of domination” (Joseph: 13) Connectivity exists side by side with individualism in the same culture, and perhaps even in the same person. These are not oppositional polarities.</p>
<sec id="section28-0146107913482418">
<title>Gender Differentiation and Reversal</title>
<p>As in many cultures that emphasize more “machismo” ideals of manhood, so in MENA gender differentiation appears to peak in early adulthood. Then in mid-life, men and women begin to develop in ways that can be construed as significant modifications, if not reversals, of the “masculinity” and “femininity” they fashioned as young adults. Or as noted earlier, one becomes more masculinely feminine, or more femininely masculine. While “gender reversal” is probably not an appropriate term, MENA cultures do appear to foster a shift in gender roles during this time of life that can enlarge men's and women's interaction styles and self-conceptions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This essay drew heavily upon insights from Gregg to sketch an outline of periods of psychological development in one MENA society, ancient Israel, fleshing it out with some select examples from the Bible. Cross-cultural psychology is the most appropriate discipline for pursuing this project. The high context document known as the Bible simply doesn't report as much information as we would like for this project. However, it is legitimate to use cross-cultural psychology to fill in the blanks left by the past. As the medievals noted: <italic>ab esse ad posse valet illatio; ab posse ad esse non valet illatio.</italic> From what exists it is legitimate to infer what might have been in the past; but from what is possible now, it is not legitimate to infer that the same thing existed in the past but somehow disappeared. The elements of psychological development in MENA societies that exist at present may well have existed in the past. Following this principle, we have attempted to fill in blanks in the Bible. In the final analysis, however, this is the first stage of a work in progress.</p>
