<abstract>
<p>European policy has many implications on the formation of national policy and decision-making process. Although European Union has no direct competence in the area of sport, its value-added is apparent in the promotion of sport-related activities and the exchange of good practice, influencing sport policy in the member states. The aim of this article is to explore the impact of the European Union on Greek sport policy making. Focusing on the social dimension of sport, this article argues that the Europeanization of Greek sport policy is limited because of its reliance on weak and indirect mechanisms. Yet it perceives a kind of a selective adoption of EU initiatives and recommendations for Greece to accomplish particular goals and meet national priorities. One of the benefits of this interaction is that Greece has slowly entered into a “learning” process where EU provides a platform for sport-related policy transfer and exchange of ideas among member states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sport is an area of growing political interest as it combines economic activity and sociocultural significance. The recent advancement of the integration process in the European Union has generated new opportunities for sport. Specifically, until recently the European Union had no legal competence in the field of sport and the policy of sport was formed at national level by the member states. Two important facts have changed the future of sport in Europe. The first is the White Paper on Sport, which appointed various dimensions of sport and encouraged the visibility of sport in other EU policies. The second is the article 165 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides European Union a supportive, funding, and maintaining role in sport. In other words, sport is now included in the EU agenda and the foundations for an EU sport policy seem to have been set.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to explore the domestic impact of European Union on aspects of the Greek sport policy making focusing on the social dimension of sport. For the purposes of this article, the definition of the social aspects of sport will be related to the health-promotion, educational, recreational, and cultural role of sport. Consequently, sport policy making will be examined in terms of enhancing public health, fighting doping, enhancing the role of sport in education, promoting volunteering and active citizenship, contributing to social inclusion, integration, and equal opportunities, fighting racism and violence, and supporting sustainable development. This study aims to examine the conformity of Greek authorities to the EU initiatives, as recommended in the White Paper on Sport, in the light of the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. The theoretical framework for studying EU influence at national level is based on the concept of Europeanization, which is examined as a process of “learning” applied on an area of decision-making policy such as sport.</p>
<p>The methodology is based on an empirical research where information is gathered from a qualitative analysis of soft-law EU instruments, EU and domestic sport-related archives, and in-depth interviews with sport policy makers. As a case study research, it explores EU influence on the social dimension of the domestic sport policy in the case of Greece, as an EU Member-State. The access to primary data was the main limitation for this study due to the change of government, after the national elections in October 2009, which resulted in the shift of key actors at high-level positions in the national and regional system of sport administration. This change brought a gap in the archives kept as well as in the information diffusion because, according to Greek officials, the outgoing administration left no records.</p>

<title>Understanding Europeanization in Nonbinding Regulatory Areas</title>
<p>Reviewing the literature, Europeanization offers the theoretical framework for the conditions, the mechanisms, the process, and the impact of the interrelation between EU and Member-States. The most complete definition of Europeanization is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193723511434085">Radaelli (2004)</xref>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Europeanisation consists of processes of (a) construction, (b) diffusion, and (c) institutionalisation of formal and informal rules, procedures, policy paradigms, styles, “ways of doing things” and shared beliefs and norms which are first defined and consolidated in the EU policy process and then incorporated in the logic of domestic (national and subnational) discourse, political structures and public policies. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the case of sport, although there is no EU relevant policy, Europeanization can occur in the early stages of the formulation of the policy (construction), when implementing another policy that promotes or supports sport-related initiatives, or in a less structured way when there is diffusion and discourses on sport issues between European and national level. In addition, “Europeanisation is not simply about formal policy rules but also about less tangible aspects, such as beliefs and values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434085">Bulmer &amp; Radaelli, 2004</xref>, p. 3), which, in this study, is the expected outcome of Europeanization in sport.</p>
<p>Europeanization can be examined from a vertical (“top-down” or “bottom-up” approach) or horizontal perspective (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193723511434085">Bache &amp; Jordan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434085">Bulmer &amp; Radaelli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723511434085">Featherstone &amp; Radaelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193723511434085">Radaelli, 2004</xref>). For the requirements of this study Europeanization will be examined as a horizontal process between EU and member states, where transfer of concepts and policies is apparent among member states while EU acts as “a facilitator of inter-state transfer through mechanisms of learning and borrowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723511434085">Bache, 2005</xref>, p. 4). However, it is important to mention that probably the most correct approach to Europeanization is the “circular” or else the “two-way interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723511434085">Bache, 2005</xref>, p. 4) perspective where EU and member states interact in the decision-making process as member states provide feedback to EU policy formulation according to their national preferences and priorities.</p>
<p>Europeanization presents “parallel and interconnected processes of change at both national and supranational levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723511434085">Harmsen &amp; Wilson, 2000</xref>, p. 19). This change is not only remarked in policy aspects but also in institutions. Institutional change may reshape identities or even create pressure for new institutional forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193723511434085">Risse, Cowles, and Caporaso (2001)</xref> comment that Europeanization can lead to the development of institutions of governance at the European level. In this concept, Europeanization is understood as</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[t]he emergence and development at the European level of distinct structures of governance, that is, of political, legal and social institutions that formalise and routinise interactions among the actors, and of policy networks specialising in the creation of authoritative European rules. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723511434085">Cowles, Caporaso, &amp; Risse, 2001</xref>, p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, the idea of “policy transfer” can be applied in Europeanization as a process where EU transmits knowledge policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and so forth to the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723511434085">Bomberg &amp; Peterson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511434085">Dolowitz &amp; Marsh, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511434085">2000</xref>). Also, domestic change may result in <italic>misfit</italic> or incompatibility in processes, policies, and institutions, between European and national level and be dependant on certain <italic>facilitating factors</italic> to respond to adaptational pressures (Bonzel, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193723511434085">Duina, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434085">Knill and Lehmkuhl (1999)</xref>, refer to three mechanisms of Europeanization on EU regulatory policy: (a) Institutional compliance, (b) changing domestic opportunity structures, and (c) framing domestic beliefs and expectations. The latter mechanism is applicable in areas where the formulation of policy is not yet apparent or is in progress. Although this is the weakest mechanism and does not indicate any direct institutional impact, “framing domestic beliefs” is perceived as the first sign of Europeanization and constitutes the introductory phase for changing domestic climate in favor of European-coming ideas. In the case of sport policy making, “framing domestic beliefs and expectation” could be the most adequate mechanism to explain domestic change, as EU does not have a sport policy or institutional framework. EU decisions have more a form of recommendation rather than a regulatory base. Furthermore, the supranational institutions have mainly a supporting role, whereas national governments control the policy making in sport at national level. In addition, the complexity of decision making in sport is bolstered by the autonomy of sport organization and the economic and social dimension of sport.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434085">Bulmer and Radaelli (2004)</xref> named that type of Europeanization <italic>facilitated coordination</italic>, where the policy process is not subject to European law, decisions are based on unanimity amongst the governments, and the EU is simply an arena for the exchange of ideas. In facilitated coordination, national governments are the key actors and agreements at EU level take the form of declarations or soft-law requirements. The lack of supranational powers explains the horizontal pattern of Europeanization where collective learning, exchange of ideas, emulation, and transfer of policy are the components of the process. In other words, what is achieved is “horizontal exchanges between member governments and the resultant learning of shared policy principles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434085">Bulmer &amp; Radaelli, 2004</xref>, p. 7).</p>
<p>According to the above, it is argued that Europeanization of sport policy can be regarded as a learning process about a good policy practice where EU offers a forum for discussion and a platform for policy transfer among Member-States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434085">Bulmer &amp; Radaelli, 2004</xref>). <italic>Policy learning</italic>, is an essential tool for member states as they adapt best practices, obtain convergence toward the EU requirements, and virtually change the domestic policies accordingly. In the case of sport, <italic>learning</italic> opportunities are offered at European level through ad hoc meetings, forums, networks, social dialogue, and cooperation among stakeholders and key decision makers. EU requirements take the form of initiatives and are transmitted to national level as rules, measures, or directives, which consist of a hard-law approach to Europeanization, or as declarations, recommendations, decisions, which consist a soft-law approach to Europeanization. The White Paper on Sport and the accompanied “Action Plan Pierre de Coubertin” are some examples of soft-law instruments that will be discussed in this article to examine the reaction of Greece to EU recommendations or else the degree of domestic change as a result of Europeanization.</p>
<p>Other academics understand Europeanization as discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434085">Bulmer &amp; Radaelli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723511434085">Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434085">Kallestrup, 2002</xref>), which may contribute to “policy learning” resulting in institutional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193723511434085">Schmidt &amp; Radaelli, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723511434085">Borzel and Risse (2000</xref>, p. 8) approach the domestic impact of Europeanization as a process of socialization in which member states, through transnational networks, are involved in the formulation and implementation of European policies experiencing new practices of cooperative governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193723511434085">Kohler-Koch, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the degree of domestic change, the outcome of Europeanization, can be characterized as <italic>inertia</italic>, <italic>retrenchment</italic>, <italic>absorption</italic>, <italic>accommodation</italic>, or <italic>transformation</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723511434085">Börzel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723511434085">Cowles et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434085">Knill &amp; Lehmkuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193723511434085">Radaelli, 2000</xref>). However, it can be supported that in the case of Greek social-oriented sport policy, “change” refers to a “process” of learning and policy transferring among member states depending on horizontal mechanisms of Europeanization rather than to a direct outcome of negotiations based on vertical channels.</p>

<title>Sport in the Framework of European Policy-Making Process</title>
<p>Until recently, the EU lacked explicit competence in the area of sport. Instead, it addressed sport-related aspects in competences (rules, policies, programs) of other policy areas such as health, education and youth, competition, internal market, employment, social affairs, and others. Nevertheless, the vast majority of sport-related competences and actions remain in the hands of the member states and sports organizations. The Commission does not intervene in issues such as the organization of sporting competitions or the setting of sporting rules, respecting the autonomy of sporting organizations and the role of member states in conducting sporting affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723511434085">European Commission 2007c</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2007, the EU adopted the White Paper on Sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723511434085">European Commission 2007c</xref>) with the objective to enhance the visibility of sport in EU policy making, to raise awareness of the needs and specificities of the sector, to ensure that the specificity of sport is taken into consideration in the development and implementation of EU policies, and to promote sport-related action at EU level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723511434085">European Commission, 2007e</xref>). European value-added in this area is mainly achieved through the exchange of good practice and other supporting activities at European level. More specifically, the White Paper on Sport and the accompanying Action Plan “Pierre de Coubertin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193723511434085">European Commission, 2007a</xref>) are essential soft-law instruments for the promotion of sport, advising member states to participate in European programs, studies, and conferences and build on political cooperation, consultation, and dialogue with sport stakeholders and the European sport movement in general. The Action Plan “Pierre de Coubertin” recommends a series of EU programs where sport and physical activity can be promoted.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty with the Article 165 brought a new era in the promotion of the social aspects of sport at EU level. First of all, given that EU has a new competence in sport, there is an integration of sport in other policies and programs as well as an introduction of a purely EU Sport Program. Second, sport can be better promoted as there is one voice in international forums and third, a new legal basis is formed for implementing specific policy proposals in the area of sport, as included in the White Paper.</p>
<p>European policy making develops according to the collective participation of European institutions, EU member states, and interest groups in the EU sport-related agenda setting and decision-making process (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723511434085">Garcia, 2007</xref>, p. 3). In this framework, the European Commission has the primary authority to initiate and draft legislation and implement EU policies and decisions. Due to the horizontal nature of sport, the Directorate General of Education and Culture (DG EAC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723511434085">European Commission, 2009a</xref>), which has the primary responsibility for the sport policy making, is in constant cooperation with several other Commission DGs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193723511434085">1</xref></sup> More specifically, the sport unit of European Commission DG EAC coordinates the implementation of EU sport-related activities with the goal to develop the European dimension of sport within the limits of competences set by the Treaties. In this framework, the Unit contributes to political cooperation among EU member states in the field of sport, maintains a structured dialogue with the sports movement, and supports the exchange of good practice between different actors (EC Official web site, (a): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/sport/who-we-are/doc129_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/sport/who-we-are/doc129_en.htm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Also, the European Parliament (EP) has an important role to play in the initiation and decision-making process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0193723511434085">2</xref></sup> Within the European Parliament operates the Committee of Culture and Education (CULT) with the responsibility, among others, to contribute to the development of a sport and leisure policy taking into account the opinions of other EP Committees on sport-related issues. EP actions such as funding antidoping projects (2000-2002), establishing the European Year of Education through Sport (EYES, 2004), and drafting the White Paper on Sport (2007) are evident to the EP involvement in the social approach of sport.</p>
<p>Additionally, the EU Council of Ministers has a central role in influencing policy directions and priorities. It coordinates the cooperation of the member states on nonbinding EU regulatory areas such as sport. Specifically, the EU Sport Ministers’ and Sport Directors’ meetings, organized by each EU Presidency, address sport-related issues of common concern, exchange good practice, provide political guidance and discussions, and frame the EU rolling agenda for sport (EC Official web site, (b): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/sport/consultation-cooperation/doc77_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/sport/consultation-cooperation/doc77_en.htm</ext-link>). Following the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, policy cooperation at EU level has taken a formal structure for sport; thus in 2010 was held the first formal EU Sport Ministers’ Meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723511434085">Council of European Union, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the contribution of the interest groups in the decision-making process is essential as they exercise pressure on policy initiation and decision making and express the stakeholders’ or national interests (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434085">Chatzigianni, 2007</xref>). In the case of sport, there are various interest groups at national, European, and international level, working for the promotion of the sociocultural and economic activity of sport as well as for safeguarding the organization of sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193723511434085">Chatzigianni, 2010</xref>). According to EU documentation, the intense sport lobbying at EU level includes five EU sport-related Working Groups, comprised of national and international key actors and sport experts, that discuss on special issues for sport such as health, education and training, antidoping, social inclusion and equality, economics, and nonprofit sport organizations (EC Official web site, (c): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/sport/information-center/information-center157_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/sport/information-center/information-center157_en.htm</ext-link>). In addition, the EU recently initiated the establishment of an “Advisory Group” on sport policy (2010) leading a structured dialogue between the EU institutions, national sport authorities, and the sports world. In view of implementing the new EU powers on sport policy, this advisory committee will have an operative and consulting function.</p>

<title>Shaping the Greek Sport Policy</title>
<p>In Greece, the regulatory framework of sport and the obligations of the state are determined by Charter, Rules, and Presidential Decrees. The 1975 Charter refers to the benefits of sport for the society, constitutes sport as a state concern, and sets the state financial obligations and subsidy for sport. In particular, the Charter (1975 art. 68, para. 1) anticipates that “sport performs under the protection and higher supervision of the State,” enhancing the legislative and regulatory role of the parliamentary committees. The control of governmental work and the legislative function are two of the most important operations of the parliament.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of Educational affairs is a corporate body of the Greek Parliament, with an important role in planning and directing sport in Greece and setting the legislative framework for sport. In this context, it is responsible for supervising the implementation of policies and programs of the Ministry of Culture and its agencies such as the General Secretariat of Sport (GSS).</p>
<p>Besides, the political parties of the Greek Parliament play an important role in the formation of sport legislation through their sport sectors. The mission of the various political parties’ sport sector is to (a) produce positions and form the sport policy of the party, (b) supervise the governmental work for sport and (c) exercise parliament control over sport issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511434085">Gargalianos &amp; Asimakopoulos, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Sport is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture while it is supervised by the General Secretariat of Sport (GSS). The Ministry’s role in sport is supportive without any direct involvement in planning the development of sport. Its function is to determine and administer GSS grants and to establish the general policy framework. The General Secretariat of Sport (GSS; official web site: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sportsnet.gr">www.sportsnet.gr</ext-link>) is the top state authority for sport with a legislative framework for its function and specific competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193723511434085">Legislative Decree 3769/1957</xref> “Extracurricular Sport”). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723511434085">P.D 77/1985</xref> “the responsibility of the General Secretariat of Sport is the national executive planning for sport and the overall responsibility for all issues concerning the progress, organization, and function of sport in our country.” As an administrative body, its goal is to support sport bodies financially and organizationally, contributing to the formation and implementation of the national sport policy.</p>
<p>The GSS cooperates, among others, with the national Olympic committee (NOC), the national federations (NFs), the sport clubs, and the local authorities. However, the following sport institutions are in the interest of this article as they regulate social aspects of sport:</p>
<list id="list1-0193723511434085" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>National Council to Combat Doping (NCCD; article 128ΣT, Rule 2725/1999): Its role is the planning, monitoring, control, coordination, and implementation of antidoping actions and programs at national level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0193723511434085">3</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Standing Committee to Combat Violence (SCCV; article 41A, Rule 2725/1999): Its role is to prevent, confront, and fight the violence in sport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0193723511434085">4</xref></sup> It is perceived that the SCCV instead of being an action-oriented and executive body is restricted to a consultative role certifying the applicability of prevention and safety measures for conducting a game (SCCV Official, personal interview, March 18, 2010).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The National Council of Sport Planning (NCSP; article.40, Rule 2725/1999) is responsible for consulting the minister responsible for sport in designing the national sport strategy. It is noted that although this Council is statutory, it has not been established yet.</p>
<p>Currently, the institutional framework that regulates the relationship between the sport and the state is shaped by the Rule 2725/1999 “Amateur and Professional Sport and other arrangements” modified and completed by latter rules, that stipulated that the administration of sport bodies is based on private enterprise, whereas it recognizes the supervisory and regulatory role of the state. Areas of regulation at national level except professional and amateur sport are school sport, physical education curriculum, sport for people with disabilities, “Sport for All,” and the fight against doping and violence in sport. These measures constitute the social concern of the national sport policy and will be further discussed in this study.</p>
<p>However, in the recent years it is noted that the national sport planning was directed to hosting major sporting events such as the 2004 Olympic Games, the 2011 Special Olympics, and the lost opportunity of the 2013 Mediterranean Games,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0193723511434085">5</xref></sup> enhancing elite sport and sport infrastructure in Greece. Yet such focus does not correspond with the development of “Sport for All” or amateur sport and school sport.</p>
<p>In general, sport is a social provision that applies to and interacts with other public policies. As this article deals with the promotion of the social and educational value of sport, it would be interesting to examine the interaction of sport policy with education and public health policy at national level. Thus the interaction among the GSS and the Ministries of Education and Health toward achieving common goals will be briefly addressed in this article.</p>

<title>Findings Regarding the Greek Participation in EU Initiatives</title>
<p>According to the White Paper on Sport, EU recommends member states to take actions on the following issues of the social dimension of sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193723511434085">European Commission, 2007b</xref>):</p>

<title>Public Health and Physical Activity</title>
<p>Sport, as a form of physical activity, plays a crucial role in the protection and improvement of public health. According to EU “Health in all Policies” (HIAP) approach, health has become an integral part in all EU policies as well as in EU sport initiatives.</p>
<p>Physical activity together with nutrition and diet are key priorities in the EU public health policy and are taken up in the actions of the Public Health funding Program “Together for Health” (2008-2013). The objectives of the program are to protect and promote citizens’ health, reduce health inequalities, and generate and exchange health information and knowledge. However, in the case of Greece, the approved health-related projects do not include physical activity in their actions. Consequently, it can be argued that the reaction of Greece to EU initiatives involving sport in health projects is slow, indicating low signs of Europeanization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0193723511434085">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greece had an important intervention on EU injury prevention strategies related to the health policy. In particular, the Centre for Research and Prevention of Injuries (CE.RE.PRI), Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Medical School at the University of Athens, was granted the responsibility of “Coordination and Administration (Secretariat) of the Working Party on Accidents and Injuries” for the period 2004-2006, within the framework of the Public Health Program (2003-2008). The Working Party on “Accidents and Injuries” (WP-AI) was operating for the period 2003-2008 providing safety-promotion and injury-prevention strategies. It not only functioned as a forum for discussion and exchange of information and experience on injury prevention but also provided advice and support to the European Commission and contributed to the development of a sustainable injury surveillance system (Injury Database). In 2007 the WP-AI was supervened by the EU Working Group on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion. However, there is no information provided for the current participation of a Greek governmental expert in this Group, which indicates a partial involvement in EU actions probably deriving from personal initiative of some key actors rather than from a national policy strategy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the lack membership of a Greek sport body in the EU “Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health” shows that the level of national awareness on integrated actions for health, diet, and physical education is still very low in Greece. In particular, the EU “Platform” is an open and multistakeholder network membered by industry, NGO, and consumer organizations that have been committed to actions to reverse diet and physical activity trends. In the Directory 2008 there are identified national contact points of the EU Platform for providing information and supporting cooperation between private and public actors in member states. At national level, there is no public or governmental sport-related organization listed. In addition, there is no information provided from the Ministry of Health regarding the Greek participation on the High-Level Group on Nutrition and Physical Activity, established in 2007, which deals with health issues such as the prevention of obesity and overweight. Consequently, there is no evidence of Greek involvement into a learning process at European level for actions on diet and physical activity.</p>
<p>The lack of Greek involvement in EU initiatives is also apparent in the EU study on “Young People’s Lifestyles and Sedentariness and the role of sport in the context of education as a means of restoring the balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193723511434085">Brettschneider &amp; Naul, 2004</xref>).” The study was mainly a national and European literature review on aspects of young people’s nutritional behavior and leisure lifestyle with special concern on physical activity in education. It was conducted in 2005 by a Research Consortium of experts from member states in collaboration with leading national Universities. Yet Greece did not get involved in providing research data and as a result the national information was based on generalized findings of other relevant researches. However, the aforementioned EU study took a step forward for the promotion of sport as a determinant factor for a healthier lifestyle and led, in 2005, in the establishment of the EU Working Group on “Sport &amp; Health.” The aim of the group is to contribute to the exchange of information and best practices, and the integration of sport and physical activity into health and education policies with the intention to combat obesity and other diseases. Greece participated in the Group for the first time in the May 2010 indicating that “it is in the GSS plans to be placed between and participate in the forthcoming Working Groups for sport” (political representative, GSS, personal interview, March 17, 2010), signifying progress in EU involvement.</p>
<p>One essential project of the EU Working Group on “Sport and Health” and an Expert Group was the development of the “EU Physical Activity Guidelines: Recommended Policy Actions in Support of Health-Enhancing Physical Activity” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723511434085">2008</xref>. Although, it is a nonbinding document, it recommends a course of action for sport decision makers in member states at national, regional, and local level to define and implement policies for the promotion of citizens’ physical activity. The Expert Group “Physical Activity Guidelines” is composed of 22 experts of all major geographical regions of the EU. Although Greece is not represented in this Group, it has confirmed the document in the EU Sport Ministers’ meeting in Biarritz (2008). At national level, it is evident from conducted interviews that the General Secretariat of Sport and the Department of Physical Education in Ministry of Education have very little information or knowledge on the content of the Physical Activity Guidelines for action and, consequently, its recommendations have not been considered in the formation of the national strategy for sport and physical activity. So, one may say that the opportunity for transfer of policy and best practices is not being utilized from Greece.</p>
<p>In the context of the Preparatory Action in the field of Sport 2009, two Greek institutions were project partners on actions for health-enhancing physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0193723511434085">7</xref></sup> Additionally, under the financial support of the same Action, the Commission implemented a Eurobarometer survey on sport and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723511434085">European Commission, 2009b</xref>) with data collection from all member states, including Greece, to further develop an evidence-based sports policy in the EU. In general, the involvement of Greece in corporate funding projects for sport and EU surveys can be perceived as a sign of Europeanization.</p>
<p>At national level, the main measures to promote the health enhancement attribute of sport are (a) the “Sport for All” program providing citizens opportunities for exercise and physical activity and (b) the Physical Education curriculum including 1 to 3 hr a week of exercise in all school grades (GSS Official for “Sport for All,” personal interview, March 18, 2010). However, contrary to EU stance, these measures present an indirect and less goal-oriented policy action for accenting the value of sport in the public health.</p>
<p>In the field of cooperation between the GSS and the Ministry of Health, only recently the Greek government proceeded to an institutional development for the interrelation of physical activity and health. During the recent reshuffling of the Greek Government in September 2010, core responsibilities for sport were transferred from the GSS and broadly from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Health. In detail, responsibilities, positions, and personnel from the Department of “Sport for All” and the Department of “Sport Development,” including “Sport for People with Disabilities” of GSS, were transferred to the Ministry of Health that is now called Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193723511434085">PD 96/2010</xref>). Regarding this current change in the structure of sport at national level, there are objections arguing that this has led to the dichotomy of sport and the demission of the role of the GSS in planning and implementing the national sport policy. From another point of view, it can be claimed that the Greek government is taking a step toward enhancing the social role of sport and indicating the benefits of sport and physical activity in improving health and preventing chronic diseases. Overall, the reallocation of sport competences could be explained as a national response to the EU approach for a joint policy in sport and health bringing new opportunities for adjustment to EU recommendations.</p>

<title>Fight Against Doping</title>
<p>As proposed in the White Paper on Sport, the European Commission is determined to implement antidoping actions with the intention to add value and complement the actions of other actors at international, European, and national level.</p>
<p>To support a network of national antidoping organizations, the EU Working Group “Antidoping” was established in 2008 and together with the Council of Europe it aims to adequately represent the position of Europe in the World Antidoping Agency. Greece has a regular participation in this Working Group, indicating signs of cooperation and discourses. According to an interview with a Greek representative, the Group is mainly dealing with issues of technical and legal concern while less attention is given to the social dimension of the phenomenon supporting research, education, information, and consultation actions (Greek antidoping agency official, GSS, personal interview, March 17, 2010). From another point of view, its role should be more directed to prevention than opposition, to education than suppressive measures. Finally, according to the interview, the national antidoping agencies had higher expectations from the Working Group in facilitating the issue of sample transfer that falls under the EC rule for aviation safety regarding liquids (Regulation 622/2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193723511434085">Official Journal of the European Union, 2003b</xref>).</p>
<p>A great EU initiative in the fight against doping was taken by the European Commission and European Parliament, organizing the first EU Conference on antidoping in 2009. Its goal was to provide a forum of discussion and exchange of ideas among representatives of EU sport governmental authorities and key stakeholders involved in the fight against doping. Given that the conference was held in Athens, it offered Greece a great opportunity to promote the fight against doping and to boost discussions at governmental level as it constitutes a top priority in the national sport agenda. It is worth mentioning that the idea for the EU Conference in Athens was launched by the European Parliament (MEP, Manolis Mavrommatis, personal interview, March 7, 2010) in a period when the vice-chair president of the Committee of Culture and Education (2004-2009) was the Greek EP representative and rapporteur of the White Paper on Sport. This fact can imply an influence of key actors of EU institutions on national level and can be regarded as a facilitating factor of Europeanization.</p>
<p>Until recently, there was skepticism at national level regarding the value-added of the EU in the Greek antidoping movement as the structural advances in the Greek sport system seem to be the result of a global antidoping pressure exercised by WADA and the Council of Europe rather than the outcome of Europeanization (GSS, Greek antidoping agency official, personal interview, March 17, 2011).</p>

<sec id="section8-0193723511434085">
<title>Education and Training</title>
<p>European Commission has indicated a great interest in the social and educational values of sport. One of the actions EU has taken in promoting sport as a vehicle for formal and informal education is the proclamation of 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport (EYES 2004; Decision No 291/2003/EC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723511434085">Official Journal of the European Union, 2003a</xref>). The aim of this pilot project was to promote voluntary activities, students’ mobility, and exchanges through sport, social inclusion, and the integration of sport in school and day-to-day life, encouraging partnerships between educational and sporting organizations at regional, national, and international level. It is assumed that the year 2004 was chosen as it coincided with the hosting of major sport events in Europe such as the Olympic Games in Athens and the “Euro” football tournament in Portugal.</p>
<p>The Greek involvement in the EYES program was outstanding as it was related to other national priorities in the event of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. In accordance with 2004 European Year of Education through Sport, the European Commission and the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games in Athens (ATHOC) launched the initiative “Olympic Champions of Education.” Youth people from the participating countries to the EYES were hosted in the Olympic Youth Camp as a reward for their high-level sport and academic performance. In addition, educational and sporting organizations as well as public authorities of Greece participated in eight Community projects for EYES and four transnational, national, regional, and local projects. In general, the high participation of Greece in transnational educational and cultural workshops and projects for sport is a sign of Europeanization.</p>
<p>Other educational opportunities through sport were launched under the Lifelong Learning Program (LLLP) aiming at enhancing the exchange, the cooperation, and the mobility among educational and vocational systems in the Community. More specifically, for the period 2007-2013 four subprograms are launched focusing on different stages of education and training:</p>
<list id="list4-0193723511434085" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Comenius, for schools;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Erasmus, for higher education;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Leonardo Da Vinci, for vocational education and training; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Grundtvig, for adult education.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Responsible for the management of the LLLP at centralized-European level is the Executive Agency Education, Audiovisual and Culture, while at decentralized action responsible is the member state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0193723511434085">8</xref></sup> According to the research, it is evident that there is an adequate Greek participation in decentralized projects related to physical activity. Yet the same cannot be supported for the centralized projects of LLLP where the Greek-selected projects did not involve any sport-related activity, indicating lack in the exchange of ideas with other member states for the educational function of sport.</p>
<p>In detail, the participation in educational opportunities through sport, which is an objective in the Comenius Program, was promoted through school networks. The projects mainly supported actions regarding health through physical activity, education through sport, inclusion for people with disabilities, fight against racism, promotion of multicultural dialogue and solidarity, spread of Olympic values, and preservation of tradition and culture through folklore dancing. Regarding the Erasmus Program, students and teachers from the five Departments of Physical Education and Sport in Greece were transferred to other European countries for studies and teaching purposes. However, no mobility was mentioned for students’ internship and staff training. In Leonardo Da Vinci Programme, sport sector is not sufficiently promoted as only two projects referred to mobility for initial vocational training (IVT) in the areas of sport management and sport journalism. In addition, there is a partnership action that refers to sport instructors’ skills in accordance to the European Qualification Framework (EQF). However, sport is not presented in projects for mobility in labor market (PLM), in vocational education training for professionals (VET professionals), and in multilateral projects for transfer of innovation. Finally, regarding the Grundvig Program, there was considerable participation of Greek organizations in educational networks and workshops aiming to the improvement of knowledge and skills through sport for adults, such as physical activities in the nature and sport tourism. In this case the outcome of Europeanization is low, as Greece took a limited advantage of the learning process among member states.</p>
<p>Regarding the EU initiatives on the “dual career” of young elite sport athletes, Greece has been partly involved. Particularly, European Commission encourages the young athletes to combine their sport career with education and professional training to be better prepared for their after sport-career life. Meeting this purpose, the EU Working Group on “Education and Training in Sport” was established in 2008 with the goal to improve the legal and political framework and facilitate the exchange of experience among member states and open discussion on issues such as the “dual career,” sport and physical activity in school,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0193723511434085">9</xref></sup> the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), and the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) in the sport sector. Although Greece has a national legal framework for the provisions to elite athletes (article 34 Rule 2725/1999) there is a debate regarding the exploitation of the full potential of these people in sport employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0193723511434085">10</xref></sup> On this ground, even if the exchange of ideas and the policy transfer through the EU Working Group would be vital for Greece, the latter did not participate on this Group until recently, showing late signs of Europeanization.</p>
<p>However, the national contribution to a relevant independent study on “training of young sportsmen/women in Europe” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193723511434085">2008</xref>) was considerable. The main purpose of the study was to create a network for the exchange of good practices in sport training to build on dual career opportunities for the elite athletes. Greece contributed to this research with sport and legal experts’ representatives and with the provision of information from national sport associations through questionnaires or interviews. In addition, under the 2009 Preparatory Action in the field of Sport, the Democritus University of Thrace, Greece, participates as a partner in a project that promotes education and training in sport with the title “Dual Career for young athletes in Europe-DC-SPORT.”</p>
<p>The increasing mobility of sports professionals have led to new initiatives in the field of vocational education and training aiming at recognizing learning experiences across different countries and different types of institutions. The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) promote a nonbinding regional framework that links national qualifications systems to a common European reference level based on learning outcome. Regarding the European Commission (EC) recommendation to member states, Greece is in the process of public consultation to develop the national Qualification System within 2010 (Ministry of Education, Official website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.opengov.gr/ypepth/?#comment_on">http://www.opengov.gr/ypepth/?#comment_on</ext-link>, 2010). Cedefop, the European Agency to promote the development of vocational education and training (VET) in the European Union, provides technical and analytical support to the EQF Advisory Group and carries out a number of comparative studies and analysis on issues related to the implementation of the framework at EU, national, and sectoral level. It is important to mention that Cedefop headquarters sits in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, and its personnel is composed of many Greek experts, which indicates participation in European institutional structures.</p>
<p>In 2003, Greece got involved into a funded project on improving employment in the field of sport in Europe through vocational training. The purpose of the project “VOCASPORT: Vocational Education and Training related to Sports in Europe: Situation, Trends and Perspectives” was to identify the trends and the gaps of current vocational training practices in the sport sector in member states, analyze the relationship between employment and vocational training, and encourage the exchange of good practices to implement EU principles set in the Copenhagen declaration at the national level. Greece contributed to this research submitting a national report of the current situation of employment and vocational training in the Greek sport sector prepared by the Democritus University of Thrace, following a GSS request. Another program was promoted through the second phase 2000-2006 of Leonardo Da Vinci: Community Vocational Training Action Program, called “Implementing the EQF in the Sports Sector.” The goal of the “EQF-Sports” was to support a network of collaboration in the field of vocational education and training for all stakeholders in the sport sector. Due to experience gained from other Community Programs such as Vocasport and EQUAL (will be discussed later), the GSS was a project-partner developing methodological tools on job description, competence framework, and learning outcomes in the sport sector and providing guides on principles for mapping the sport business activities and sport occupation. Through these projects, Greece participated in a European network, borrowing and transmitting practices of sport employment, which is the case of Europeanization.</p>
<p>Parallel to the national cross-thematic curriculum of education, there have also been introduced innovative actions and pilot programs for sport such as ‘Olympic Education’ and “Kallipatira.” In view of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, the Ministry of Education implemented for the period 2000-2005 the program of “Olympic Education” in primary and secondary schools all over the country. The goal of the program was to inspire and motivate students to adapt the principles and educational values of sport, Olympism, and volunteerism. After the Olympic Games, Athens 2004, the “Olympic education” was followed by the program “Kalipatira,” which focused on the contribution of physical education to the equality within the Greek society and the protection of human rights. The duration of this program was from 2005 to 2007 and it was funded from the 6th Community Support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0193723511434085">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Department of Physical Education in the Ministry of Education is responsible for developing the curriculum of Physical Education at all levels of education, organizing School Sport Championships and generally for regulating and operating the Physical Education and School Sport (Rule 1566/85). At national level, physical education (PE) is compulsory in primary and secondary education level ranging from 1 to 3 hr per week. However, following the European Parliament Resolution on “The role of sport in Education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723511434085">2007/2086[INI]</xref>), there is an intensive discussion between sport specialists, unionists, and the government for increasing the weekly teaching hours of PE in compulsory education level and even introducing the physical education curriculum in the kindergarten (Director of physical education, Ministry of Education, personal interview, April 13, 2010). This argument indicates a negotiation and a process of change in the beliefs and expectations of the domestic key actors as a result of Europeanization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0193723511434085">
<title>Volunteering in Sport, Active Citizenship, and Nonprofit Sport Organizations</title>
<p>The EU has highlighted the important role of volunteerism and active citizenship in the field of sport, as sport is mainly based on voluntary activities; thus it is supported by other EU policy areas.</p>
<p>According to the Action Plan “Pierre de Coubertin,” sport is promoted in the “Youth in Action Program” (2007-2013) through the activities of “European Voluntary Service” (EVS) and “Youth Exchanges.” Greece, through the National Agency General Secretariat of Youth, has implemented a series of projects for “Youth Exchanges,” where sport-related activities are utilized as a means of promoting active citizenship and a healthy lifestyle. Physical activity is included in the projects for youth contributing to nonformal education, social inclusion of people with disability, health enhancement, fight against doping, multiculturalism, and protection of the environment.</p>
<p>Although sport is highlighted in the thematic areas of the “Youth in Action” Program Guide for “European Voluntary Service,” it is demonstrated from the research that volunteering for sport-related activities is limited in the case of Greece. Until recently, only one project introduced voluntary service in sport, which referred to volunteering in therapeutic horseback riding for people with disabilities. Nevertheless, in 2010, the Greek organization “Citizens in Action” gained the significant amount of 157.500 € grant for an activity applied to the “European Voluntary Service.” It concerns a centralized project with the title “Join the Wonderful World of Special Olympics World Summer Games” (2010) referring to the promotion and the support of volunteerism for the Organisation of the 2011 Special Olympics, inviting 200 young volunteers from different European countries to support the Games. So it is verified that the social and educational dimension of sport is merely promoted through voluntary projects for youth.</p>
<p>The “Europe for Citizens Program” (2007-2013) can accentuate the important role of sport in promoting active citizenship and European integration. As European Commission recommends, European sport organizations can gain a financial support for transnational project through actions that develop networks, promote volunteerism, and encourage the mutual understanding of different cultures. However, according to the Greek records, no national sport-related project has been submitted, demonstrating that the idea of promoting European identity through sport is still very immature in the beliefs and attitudes of the Greek society.</p>
<p>Greece participated in an EU study for volunteering, launched by the European Commission in 2009, which included a part for the sport sector. The aim of the study was to indicate the legal, organizational, economic, and funding framework of volunteering for all EU member states and outline the challenges and trends in the sector for EU to be better prepared for future actions on this area. In this study, Greece participated in a series of interviews with national departments and sport organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0193723511434085">12</xref></sup> According to the results, it is argued that so far there is no Greek national strategy or framework for volunteering in sport and still the recommendations of the White Paper on Sport have not been met by national level initiatives in the same direction. It is reported that although volunteering in major sport events is rising in recent years, it cannot be claimed that volunteering is a priority in the sport policy agenda of recent governments in Greece, in contrary to EU advice.</p>
<p>In addition, the low interest of Greece on volunteering issues is also apparent in the lack participation in relevant EU networks. One such example is the EU Working Group “Nonprofit Sport Organizations,” established in 2006, aiming at analyzing and identifying possible solutions for issues such as the qualification, training, and recognition of volunteers in sport and the support of nonprofit sport organizations. In general terms, it can be supported that Greece is missing opportunities of networking and common strategy setting for volunteerism at European level.</p>
<p>At national level, a recent joint initiative for promoting volunteerism was taken by the General Secretariat of Youth and the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education. The purpose is to promote the Volunteering Program for the 2011 Special Olympics, form policies and procedures for participation incentives, and submit proposals to EU future programs on Volunteering. This initiative is in line with the 2011 European Year of Volunteerism leading to new opportunities in the sport field. However, it is evident that Greece lacks a volunteering umbrella organization for sport that would promote concentrated actions or campaigns and would represent the country at European level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0193723511434085">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Social Inclusion, Integration, and Equal Opportunities</title>
<p>Sport has a major potential as a tool for promoting social inclusion and social cohesion in European societies. The EU has addressed the important role of sport in gender equality and in the integration of people with disabilities and of disadvantaged group, including sport activities in other policies’ actions.</p>
<p>In particular, the European Commission suggests member states to participate in actions promoting social inclusion through sport and combat discrimination in sport through the EU programs “PROGRESS,” “Lifelong Learning,” “Youth in Action,” and “Europe for Citizens” (2007-2013). Specifically, the “PROGRESS” is an employment and social solidarity program, which supports European and national actions such as studies, conferences, the exchange of best practices, and networks against discrimination, equality between men and women, employment measures, and the fight against social exclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0193723511434085">14</xref></sup> However, at national level, the social dimension of sport was not promoted through the “PROGRESS” and “Europe for Citizens” program, which could imply that Greece has not yet realized or exploited the attribute of sport to build on social cohesion.</p>
<p>However, significant was the Greek involvement in a former EU program against discrimination and inequalities. The Period 2000-2006 European Commission run the Program “EQUAL,” which was an EU initiative for the integration and incorporation of new approaches in the employment policy. The “EQUAL” promoted the transnational cooperation among the member states to favor the exchange of ideas and best practices. In the field of sport, Greece implemented the national project “Using Sport to open business” (2002-2004), as part of the “EQUAL” Program, with beneficiary the Greek Organisation for Football Prognostics (OPAP SA), partners 15 sport organizations and Sport Universities, and international partner Italy. The goal of the project was to promote business and employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups, such as young unemployed, through practices for the identification of new job occupations for self-employment in the sport sector. The results presented that 18 new sports subjects were introduced in the curricula of Sport Universities, and 19 new businesses and 70 jobs were identified in the sport industry. Ultimately, it is a great progress that Greece included the sport sector in its actions to promote integration and social inclusion in employment opportunities. However, no special attention was given for equal access to people with disabilities, immigrants, or other vulnerable social groups, which are in the EU political line for sport.</p>
<p>Among other EU countries, Greece failed to be involved in a recent EU “Experts’ meeting on equal opportunities through and in sport,” held in 2005. The aim was to promote the exchange of good practices for issues of gender equality and the integration of people with disabilities through sport and, more importantly, to present recommendations for actions at EU level. Although member states were encouraged to participate in the meeting and reply to a questionnaire describing the current situation at national level, Greece was not the only EU country that remained uninvolved. Therefore, the lack of domestic response to EU initiatives can be explained from the “soft-law” (weak) approach to Europeanization.</p>
<p>The Greek Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers encountered many challenges in the field of sport. The “2003 European Year of people with disabilities” (Decision 2001/903/EC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193723511434085">Official Journal of the European Union, 2001</xref>) coincided with the Greek Presidency in 2003, while at the same time Greece was preparing for the organization of the Olympic and Paralympics Games in 2004. Under these circumstances, Greece took the initiative to organize an EU seminar for people with disabilities in sport in 2003, with the aim to promote sport against discrimination and social exclusion safeguarding the principles of social cohesion and solidarity. In this context, 2010 has been proclaimed as the “European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion” (No. 1098/2008/EC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193723511434085">Official Journal of the European Union, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0193723511434085">15</xref></sup> Although the GSS was asked to comment on the National Program of the European Year 2010 during the consultation process, sport is underrepresented in the actions to combat social exclusion. Within the same year, another EU initiative was generated in the field of sport, the establishment of a new EU Working Party on social inclusion and equality where the Greek participation is anticipated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0193723511434085">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Prevention of and Fight Against Racism and Violence in Sport</title>
<p>Within the context of cooperation and open dialogue with member states and the international sport movement, European Commission contributes to the prevention of incidents of violence and racism in the field of sport. The exchange of best practices in legal instruments, cooperation in law enforcement services, organizing conferences and discourses and including sport in EU programs are some of the EU actions for combating violence in sport. Actually, except the “Youth in Action” and “Europe for Citizens” Program, EU recommends other programs for the protection of human rights for children, youth, women and other victims of high risk and the fight against violence, crime, racism, and xenophobia. Greece has utilized—only limited—the first two programs for the promotion of the value of sport while there is no reference for the “Daphne III,” “Fundamental Rights and Citizenship,” and “Prevention and Fight against Crime” programs.</p>
<p>At this final point, the study should address the Greek involvement in the EU consultation for sport issues. Recently, the Sport Unit of the European Commission conducted an “Online Consultation on Sport” (April-June 2010) to identify the citizens’ opinion on EU sport policy and obtain input for its future work after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. It was an open-public process addressed to organizations and citizens with an interest in sport. In Greece, the GSS has already filled the questionnaire and also it had posted the online Consultation on its official web site encouraging all interested national organizations and individuals to participate. On the same base, the GSS participated in an Internet-based consultation for the White Paper on Sport in 2007. This degree of domestic involvement in the formation of an EU policy framework for sport can be perceived as another aspect of Europeanization.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-0193723511434085" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>First of all, it should be emphasized that it is too early to make assumptions on the Europeanization of the national sport policy, as it is a policy area that is currently being formed at EU level. However, if sport is approached as an area for EU involvement with a great decision-making interest at European and national level, then this study can provide some useful insights on the current impact of EU on the societal aspects of Greek sport policy making. In addition, a few decades ago it was perceived that sport policy was confined to the regulation of sport as an economic activity with a greater interest on professional football; only recently the cultural and educational value of sport were acknowledged and shielded on the society and EU actions were taken toward that direction. So, the above factors make the hypothesis of this study even more complicated.</p>
<p>The findings of this research demonstrate that the Greek national sport policy is on embryonic stage of Europeanization. A low degree of change was remarked and that was mainly apparent in the sport key actors’ beliefs, expectations, and perceptions of what should be done to improve and modernize the national sport policy, the structures, and procedures. It seems that the personnel and the people in high positions in the national sport administration have realized the necessity for a change and development and have started looking for methods to improve the national sport model. However, this change has mainly affected their perceptions and less the structure of sport or the actions and decisions ordered by the national sport law. High-position personnel of the GSS mentioned in the interview that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Greece does not have a loud voice in sport in Europe; we are more a kind of listeners of what EU recommends and followers and what other member states practice on rather than initiators and protagonists in shaping a European sport policy. (GSS Official for EU affairs, personal interview, February 8, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement demonstrates a more passive way of involvement in EU sport matters, where the Greek contribution starts with the participation but does not end with an input or a set of commitment.</p>
<p>Another point is that Greece does participate in EU initiatives but not in a systematic and methodical manner to bring results. Although Greek representatives join EU sport meetings, fora, conferences, and studies, there is a lack of preparation on the agenda, absence of national proposals and positions, deficient diffusion of information and exploitation of previous experience at national administrative level, and limited action or follow-up. Unfortunately, records and archives of previous representatives’ reports are missing as there was no permanent representative group and the representation duties were delegated according to political interests. The fact that the personnel of the GSS does not know “what is happening in Brussels” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723511434085">Alexopoulos, 2009</xref>) and no information is transferred to the different departments mentioning that “they keep the information for themselves, believing that doing so they are irreplaceable” (GSS political representative, personal interview, March 17, 2010), demonstrates the lack of cooperation among the different departments and levels of hierarchy in the central national sport authority. So, it is supported that “the relation influence-impact between the EU and Greece in sport is not systematic” (GSS political representative, personal interview, March 17, 2010).</p>
<p>As a result, the rationale of limited Europeanization could emanate from the lack of a central policy strategy on sport adjusted in the EU framework for sport. It is evident that there is no sequence and strategy in activities to meet national and European goals especially on the social dimension of sport. In addition, while Greece has a qualitative organization framework for sport, it has not been adequately managed for implementation. The lack of horizontal and vertical communication within national sport administration leads to bureaucratic limitations, delays, and inaction. Another argument is the absence of a legislative cooperation among the GSS, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education to build on a common strategy and establish common ministerial decisions for the development of the social function of sport. On the other side, while the reorganization of the Ministry of Health, which has acquired new competence in sport and physical activity, has been officially announced, nevertheless the common policy strategy remains to be defined. In general, the bureaucratic and out-of-date national administration system creates further obstacles to cope with EU processes. For instance, the GSS has not been the beneficiary on any EU sport programs; however, it participates as a partner in transnational projects. This is because the national system requires a special administrative account and processes for rendering financial sources from EU programs.</p>
<p>After 5 years, the change of the Greek government in 2009 brought some new challenges for the growth of sport with the intention to bring the national sport governmental institution “closer to Brussels” and participate to EU initiatives in sport. The political representative of the GSS mentioned that “now we are turning our sight to what is happening in sport in Europe and especially in sport-advanced countries in order to learn for their experience and gain knowledge for the sport governance” (GSS political representative, personal interview, March 17, 2010). Such an example of building on international relations is the “Protocol of Cooperation in Sport” between the Greek and the Cypriot governments. Also, the fact that the EU Commissioner of Education and Culture is Cypriot generates expectations from the Greek sport authority for an easier access to sport-related lobbies at EU level.</p>
<p>This interest on behalf of the Greek sport command for involvement in EU activities can be explained by the opportunities rising after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. More specifically, the future EU sport program, the cooperation between member states, and the participation in sport affairs at European level, offer funding, networking, organizational, and institutional opportunities at national level. Greece is expecting from European Union grants for sport, ideas, knowledge, and best practices for an in-depth reformation of the Greek sport policy. Besides, Greece needs to be close to the evolutions occurring with the formation of a common European sport policy and be better prepared for the adoption of new processes and procedures. So, as the political representative on sport commented, “a European mentality is being adopted” (GSS political representative, personal interview, March 17, 2010).</p>
<p>Moreover, there is an increased interest in the societal dimension of sport. “Sport for All,” antidoping, and fight against violence in sport are high-ranking issues in the government’s sport agenda. However, it cannot be confirmed that the document of the White Paper on Sport influenced the national planning for sport of the new government or that such issues of national priority just coincide with the EU guidance. The political representative on sport could not cross-refer this information, but from a general estimate it can be supported that there has been a change in the politicians’ perceptions, beliefs, and ideas on the way sport should be promoted. Yet it needs to be addressed that the program “Sport for All,” the Physical Education curriculum, sport for people with disabilities, the foundation of the National Council to Combat Doping, and the Standing Committee to Combat Violence are included in the national sport policy with legislation time before the White Paper on Sport and they consist of national measures resulting from the global sport developments.</p>
<p>Overall, the change in the perception for sport is in consistence with the general shift of the national policy. The Greek prime minister has announced that “despite the economic crisis, the structural changes are a priority need for the improvement of the national administration system.” Such an example is the National Program Kallicrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723511434085">Rule 3852/2010</xref>, “The new architecture of the governmental and decentralized administration—Program Kallicrates”) that reduces the number of municipalities and communities in the country, bringing changes to the administration system at local and regional level and is expected to further influence the organization and resources of sport. It is anticipated that a new sport structure will be mapped reducing the dependency of sport on the central authority and enhancing initiatives at local level<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0193723511434085">17</xref></sup> (GSS official for “sport for all,” personal interview, March 18, 2010). Another example is the announcement in 2009 of the abolishment of the Junior Ministry of Sport and 32 nonlegislated Committees of the GSS probably due to high operational costs. The duties of the junior minister of sport were assigned to the deputy minister of culture and tourism who is now responsible for the services of the general secretariat of sport. While there has been some controversy and broad concerns over this reform, it is still too early to provide a credible assessment of its virtues and vices. However, it is likely that these structural changes will have an impact on the administration of sport on national, regional, and local level.</p>
<p>Personal interviews were also held with the following officials who possessed the mentioned position at the time of the interview:</p>
<p>Department of Physical Education, Ministry of Education, (personal interview, April 13, 2010), General Secretariat of Sport, official for “sport for all,” (personal interview, March 18, 2010), Standing Committee to Combat Violence official, (personal interview, March 18, 2010), Greek antidoping agency official, (personal interview, March 17, 2010), General Secretariat of Sport, political representative, (personal interview, March 17, 2010), General Secretariat of Sport, official for sport development, (personal interview, March 3, 2010), General Secretariat of Sport, official for EU affairs, (personal interview, February, 8, 2010, and with the Member of the European Parliament Manolis Mavrommatis, (personal interview, March 7, 2010).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this article demonstrates that the Europeanization of the Greek sport policy is limited because of its reliance on weak and indirect mechanisms. Yet it perceives a kind of a selective adoption of EU recommendations for Greece to accomplish particular goals and meet national priorities. In general, the rationale of limited Europeanization could emanate from the lack of a central policy strategy on sport in collaboration with other related policy sectors, adjusted in the EU framework for sport. The low response to EU initiatives is not only apparent in the case of sport but in most of the Greek sport-related social policy sectors, mainly education and heath. This situation reflects the weak functioning of a broader national administration system which reveals bureaucratic constraints, political conflicts and alliances, as well as communication gap and lack of coordination between central and local administration.</p>

<p>Another national initiative in the area of sport is taken by the GSS referring to the “Sport for All” Program. “Sport grounds in the neighborhood” is an innovative and pilot sport program for young children, operating in sport facilities that belong to schools, municipal sport organizations or sport clubs, under the guidance of physical education teachers. The goal of the program is to offer young children the opportunity for physical activity in their neighborhood in their leisure time, adapting the principle for lifelong physical activity. It is organized by the GSS in cooperation with the School Committees, the Local Authorities, and sport clubs. It general, it can be said that there is a convergence in the actions taken for the promotion of the social aspects of sport at national and European level.</p>

<p>In the recent years, Greece has taken important steps on providing equal opportunities for sport such that the state provisions to elite athletes are equal without discriminating the athletes with disabilities, the employment and volunteering of people with disabilities in the sport, and the national “Sport for All” program, which provides sport opportunities for all aged groups such as preschool age, children, teenagers, adults, older persons, and people with special needs. It can be supported that the efforts to integrate people with disabilities in sport are remarkable but definitely not sufficient (GSS official for Sport Development, personal interview, March 3, 2010). Overall, since Greece constantly participates in numerous European and international fora for the sport movement and the social function of sport, it is believed that there must be an indirect impact on people’s perceptions through the exchange of ideas and discourses.</p>
