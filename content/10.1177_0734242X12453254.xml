<p>The Danish Society for Nature Conservation organizes every year a ‘waste in nature collection’ day. A large number of volunteers (many children) roam along roads, town parks and popular nature areas, with the mission of collecting accumulated litter. Many strange items are found such as rifles with ammunition, cell phones, bicycles and dildos. A good part of the annual 200 000 kg of rubbish collected is beverage containers, predominantly non-degradable aluminium cans (around 200 000 collected) and plastic bottles. This littering is obnoxious as the cans and bottles are not only unsightly over a very long time but these items can also pose dangers to animals and humans, and clean-up is very costly.</p>
<p>The ‘density’ of discarded containers collected from roadsides and countryside varies from &gt; 3 cans per kilogram of waste collected near the border region to Germany down to 0.3 per kilogram waste farthest away from the border. The major reason for this anomaly in the littering pattern in nature is a long-standing inequality in deposit–return systems between Germany and Denmark. A high deposit due in Germany is lifted when the goods are exported by consumers. Consequently, there is little incentive to avoid tossing empty cans (and plastic bottles) anywhere in the countryside. Only 7% of the cans found carry a (low) Danish deposit value, whereas most of the rest is imported from Germany (border trade). The irony is that many of the beverage cans imported from Germany originally contained Danish beer brewed and canned in Denmark and sold at a cheap price in Germany.</p>
<p>Fortunately only a small percentage of the total of 180 million non-deposit cans, which are annually imported, are discarded as litter. Most of the empties enter the normal Danish municipal waste system where around 87% of the household waste is incinerated. The incinerated aluminium cans represent a lost metal value of only about €2 million annually. Some unwanted technical side effects adding to the losses include: (a) the molten Al-metal leading to otherwise avoidable down time in the incinerators as grates etc. are clogged, and (b) flying fragments of light weight aluminium creating a hazard to employees and a nuisance to plant neighbours. The littered cans are even dangerous to cattle and other domestic animals when broken up by farm machinery and fragments are later ingested. The economic losses are not exactly known, but farmers near to roads in the border region claim damage casts are substantial.</p>
<p>Border trade problems are unfortunately quite common where price relations and deposits–return conditions for consumer commodities are unbalanced. The littering situation described above may be a small issue but illustrates clearly the situation in highly industrialized economies, whereas low income regions are often free of litter if the materials value is attractive to waste pickers and the local recycling industry.</p>
<p>To broaden the issue it is not surprising that authorities in high-income regions are often compelled to introduce measures to diminish the use of materials that have unwanted side effects such as undue disposal of post-consumer containers and littering. Common methods include ‘deposit and return’ systems for commodities sold to consumers, charging taxes on the materials and/or their uses, and outright bans of certain type of materials in commerce. There are several reasons to choose one or more of these methods:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12453254" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To decrease the municipal or state expenses associated with large-scale clean-up operations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To specifically reduce beverage container litter along highways, in lakes and rivers, and on other public or private properties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To provide an incentive for waste reduction by charging customers nominal per container refundable deposits; income from the collection of littered containers and the redemption of associated deposits can be a significant source of income to poor individuals and/or non-profit civic organizations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To encourage recycling and complement existing kerbside recycling programmes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To extend the usable life of taxpayer-supported community or regional landfills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To protect children and animals by reducing the likelihood of glass lacerations, and farm animals from ingesting sharp objects from broken beverage containers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To use deposits that are not redeemed to fund environmental programmes and to cover costs of processing returned containers.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Despite the benefits, it is not surprising that the introduction of behavioural adjusting measures such as deposit–return systems, taxes or material use prohibitions are often strongly opposed by consumers and retailers due to perceived and actual inconveniences and expense involved. Representatives of manufacturers and retailers claim that the measures have substantial downsides, including a reduction in consumption of consumer products, a distortion of competition between alternative commodities, and a reduction of international trade.</p>
<p>One of the most discussed issues of late is the use of plastic shopping bags. They are very convenient for users being light and strong even when wet and they may be reused for several purposes. However, the widespread use of plastic bags worldwide has led to several unwanted side effects:</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X12453254" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased litter: plastic bags comprise a significant part of roadside and other litter, carried by the wind onto fences, farms, and waterways. A good part of the floating marine debris encountered in the Pacific gyres is plastic bits and pieces often originating from non-biodegradable bags.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Large amounts of fugitive plastic bags can clog drainage systems and contribute to flooding, a problem seen often in large cities in developing countries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Disposal of non-degrading plastics, including bags, is considered an unsustainable waste handling practice.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Consequently, many jurisdictions have started to regulate the use of plastic shopping bags (often via outright bans). Plastic bag bans are now in place in several countries, including: Ethiopia, Rwanda, Republic of Congo, Tibet, South Africa, Bangladesh, Italy, and several states or cities in the USA (e.g. San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Texas and Hawaii).</p>
<p>Similarly, various taxes and levies have been imposed to discourage the use of plastic shopping bags, e.g. in Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>These examples are by no means exhaustive, only illustrating the increasing frustration worldwide over the problems caused by plastic bag use. There really is a challenge for governments and industry to devise better systems to prevent littering in rural areas, parks and the environment at large.</p>
<p>Many reports and commissions have proposed solutions to the border trade problems and the associated littering problem. Unfortunately, these programmes have been marginally effective, probably due to the tenacity of those benefitting from the usual absence of political will in neighbouring territories. How long yet before we can expect regulation?</p>
<p>Regarding the use of disposable plastic shopping bags, there are proven alternatives without serious consequences for the environment, mainly changing consumer habits to carry and use their own reusable bags. This prompts me to ask myself, why is it so difficult for legislators to opt for a plastic bag free world?</p>
<p>Even higher up the ladder is the very devastating littering of oceans with trash and plastic waste. Will it ever be possible to prevent the flush-out of the harmful materials from storm drains and sewage outfalls into the oceans?</p>
<p>Unfortunately we probably have to wait years for effective responses to these questions. In ISWA there are Working Groups with members representing authorities from the large actors, EU and USA, to small nations, universities and waste industries. Can these groupings press for (and demonstrate by example) useful actions?</p>
<p>In the meantime and in order to advocate for a solution to reduce if not eliminate the beverage can litter in the German–Danish border regions, the Danish Society for Nature Conservation plans to carry many of the recovered aluminium cans back to German shops and redeem the deposits from the deposit–refund machines with the presence of the media. This public demonstration may trigger a faster and more positive response from the appropriate authorities thereby helping to achieve a cleaner environment.</p>
