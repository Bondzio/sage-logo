<body>
<p>Two well-argued positions; both debaters use persuasive elegant points to advance their theses. A cure: most neurologists have little experience of this phenomenon. Alasdair Coles says that we cannot cure autoimmune disease. Yes, admittedly, but if we take the example of myasthenia gravis, we can put it into remission fairly permanently. Why not multiple sclerosis (MS)? The use of the term ‘cure’ in the wording of the debate was rhetorical. Cure means <italic>‘no more disease activity and no further treatment’</italic>, whereas perhaps the best we will achieve in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the next 10 years is complete disease suppression with continuing therapy.</p>
<p>Today in the clinic I met a young woman in an electric wheelchair with MS onset in 1993 and treated with beta-interferon from 1995 with frequent relapses. She quickly became secondary progressive and now has an Expanded Disability Status Scale of 8.5. Earlier in the day I saw a number of similarly highly active patients treated with natalizumab (and a few with alemtuzumab) with complete arrest in disease activity within a few years of MS onset.</p>
<p>Our colleagues the rheumatologists, always a few steps in front of us, have almost successfully cured/controlled rheumatoid disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512446523">1</xref></sup> They have the distinct advantages of accessible overt clinical measures and simple laboratory and radiological biomarkers measures of inflammatory activity. So what makes one so sanguine about curing/controlling MS?</p>
<p>First, the speed of drug discovery; we had no therapies for 100 years, modestly efficacious drugs from 1993 and highly effective targeted agents from 2006. Now a range of oral therapies are becoming available so that BG-12 (dimethyl fumerate) will probably supplant the injectables as first-line therapy in RRMS patients from 2013; fingolimod will be used for the more active intermediate patient, risk averse and/or JCV-antibody positive. The role of alemtuzumab <italic>vis-a-vis</italic> natalizumab will be decided in the next 5 years and other monoclonal antibodies are in phase III development. A process of risk assessment is ongoing with reports from phase IV studies alerting clinicians and enabling them to tailor therapies in relation to benefit and risk.</p>
<p>Second, our skills in assessing disease activity have been improved by increased access to regular MRI scanning. We are increasingly aware that clinical tools of relapse and disability measures are inadequate to measure a disease in which the major part of inflammatory activity is silent at the time when we need to control it. This lag-time between silent disease activity and its manifestation as the disability of secondary progressive MS is what impedes the rational use of therapies.</p>
<p>The third factor, the use of a sensitive biomarker of this silent inflammatory disease activity in MS, requires further study before it passes into clinical practice. Of the putative biomarkers, CSF neurofilament light levels seem a sensitive measure of ongoing axonal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512446523">2</xref></sup> Clearly the disadvantage of repeated lumbar punctures is a major hurdle, discussed recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512446523">3</xref></sup> The ability to measure acute axonal injury, as an index of the effectiveness of a therapy, is the missing tool we need to control/cure MS in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512446523">4</xref></sup> It may be that a yearly estimation of CSF neurofilament light in selected patients will be needed in order to achieve that end.</p>
