            <title>Reviewed by David Berridge, Professor of Child and Family Welfare, University of Bristol, UK</title>
            <p>Birth parents of looked after children are a neglected group. We rightly need to be child centred in our approach and put children's needs before those of their parents. There are hazards in drift and delay and children require a sense of permanency either back home or elsewhere. However, the circumstances of birth parents are seldom straightforward–looked after children often keep in contact and many eventually return once state support terminates. We are living through an era of declining sympathy for the poorest, most troubled (‘dysfunctional’) families with major welfare reforms, growing child poverty and emphasis on adoption. Despite this, there is surprisingly little research into birth parents' situation. Though it did not claim to be representative, few can have seen the excellent BBC television series <italic>Protecting Our Children,</italic> screened in early 2012, without sympathy for mothers trying to cope and adapt in the face of grinding poverty, chaotic home circumstances and, at best, untrustworthy partners.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this book on the birth parents of children living in long-term foster care is to be particularly welcomed. It comes from the highly regarded School of Social Work, University of East Anglia. The lead author, Gillian Schofield, has previously undertaken an important body of work on long-term fostering in the UK, reminding us that this can be a significant permanent option for children. With this in mind, the situation of birth parents is clearly important.</p>
            <p>The book draws on interviews with 32 birth parents from three councils, whose children (120) had been fostered for at least a year and were under 10 when first placed. Additional focus groups were held with other parents and 22 social workers. Much of the book draws on detailed extracts of parents' own, often very moving accounts of their stresses and experiences.</p>
            <p>The book begins with a background to the issues and emphasises how little attention we have given to the problem of helping birth parents come to terms with their separation and continuing role as parents to their children. Useful theoretical ideas are introduced to help understand the area, including loss (‘like a bereavement’), stigma, identity, cognitive dissonance and ‘disenfranchised grief’ – grief that is culturally unacknowledged and unsupported.</p>
            <p>Numerous very interesting and important points emerged. Parents frequently acknowledged that the right decision had been made for children to enter care and they often derived satisfaction from seeing them thrive. However, the court experience could reinforce feelings of powerlessness, shame, isolation and abandonment. Unless this is managed effectively by social workers, future involvement could be jeopardised. Not all parents expressed continuing resentment and anger: it was more complex than this. Parents continued to be engaged with children's lives, often keeping and displaying photographs of them and certificates of their achievements obtained while living in foster care. Contact was complex for parents; for example, it could be expensive, knowing what to plan and anticipating the weather. Parents' relationships with carers varied, although they often credited them with the stability they had offered their children. Family placement social workers played a key role in this but sometimes discouraged contacts with parents.</p>
            <p>Overall, this is an important, well-written book. Social workers should read it not just because of its implications for long-term fostering but because of the more general insights into birth parents' lives. Somehow it feels that their predicament is about to worsen and they need all the high-quality professional support they can get.</p>
