<abstract>
<p>The authors provide reaction to the Major Contribution (MC) “Multicultural Clinical Supervision and Benchmarks: Empirical Support Informing Supervision Practice and Supervisor Training.” The article begins with an overview reaction to the MC. Following this, each of the four articles that compose the MC are discussed. The reactions provide both a contextual response to the articles as well a response to the central theme of the MC—that is, the intersection of supervision, multiculturalism, and the competency benchmarks.</p>

<p>“Supervision” is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012453945">Bernard and Goodyear (2009)</xref> as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Supervision is an intervention provided by a more senior member of a profession to a more junior member or members of that same profession. This relationship is evaluative and hierarchical, extends over time, and has the simultaneous purposes of enhancing the professional functioning of the more junior person(s); monitoring the quality of professional services offered to the clients that she, he, or they see; and serving as a gatekeeper for those who are to enter the particular profession. (p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Major Contribution (MC)—“Multicultural Clinical Supervision and Benchmarks: Empirical Support Informing Supervision Practice and Supervisor Training” (2013)—is an excellent contribution to the supervision literature in that it examines supervision within the context of both the Competency Benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453945">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>) and the issue of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>In the introduction to the MC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012453945">Falender, Burnes, and Ellis (2013)</xref> state:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the purpose of this major contribution is to spotlight prototypes of conceptually and methodologically sound research that investigate multicultural international focused supervision practice. The Competency Benchmarks is the overarching umbrella that provides structure and direction for the individual contributions. (p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This MC consists of four articles:</p>

<p>The introduction to the MC, in addition to these four articles, provides a rich forum for discussion. Prior to providing reactions to each of the articles, we will begin with an overview reaction to the MC.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012453945">
<title>Overview Reaction</title>
<p>This MC is important and additive to the literature because it focuses on areas that have had minimal coverage in the literature. We agree that with the evolution of competency-based supervision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012453945">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2004</xref>) and the Competencies Benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453945">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>), it is especially appropriate for researchers to address these issues as well as their intersection with multiculturalism.</p>
<p>This MC also addresses the issue of supervision training. We concur that there is a lack of supervision training and that this is a significant problem in the profession. It is still the case, in the authors’ experience, that counseling psychology students may arrive at internships with little training in supervision and then be expected to provide supervision to practicum students. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012453945">Falender, Burnes, and Ellis (2013)</xref> point out, citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012453945">Hunsley and Barker (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012453945">Tebes et al. (2011)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>One factor to explain the lack of supervision training is the scarcity of empirically tested theories of and solid empirical knowledge about clinical supervision, probably because supervision practice developed independent of evidence-based treatments. (p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We agree and believe that the MC certainly begins to address the issues alluded to by the authors. We would have found it contributory if the authors had included even more specific ideas concerning ways that counseling psychology programs can emphasize supervision training as well as ideas concerning how to specifically incorporate supervision into curricula.</p>
<p>The competencies movement is a primary focus of the MC, and the fact that the authors address this issue by examining the nature of effective supervision is an additional strength of the MC. We agree that given the fact that a significant percentage of supervisors are not trained in the skills of supervision, “competence-based supervision and supervisor competencies seem especially timely” (p. 12).</p>
<p>As stated earlier, providing a multicultural framework for the issues of competency-based supervision and the Benchmarks is laudable. In our view, this is one of the most significant aspects of this work. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012453945">Westefeld (2009)</xref> stated when discussing the importance of multicultural issues in supervision:
<disp-quote>
<p>Supervisors are urged to attend to the issue of multicultural competence and its relationship to supervision. By directly addressing such issues in the supervisory process, trainees can be helped to develop true multicultural competence, be it related to practice or their own identity development. (p. 311)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the conclusion of the MC, the authors discuss a number of implications related to their work. Rather than implications, this list actually strikes us as both the potential impacts of the MC as well as areas where even more emphasis may be needed in the future. The implications they list are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0011000012453945" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Facilitating and engaging in the transformation to competency-based supervision remaining mindful of power, perspective, and the cultural and diversity relativity and context of competencies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encouraging methodological advances and new constructs in supervision research.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attending to multiple identities of client(s), supervisees, and supervisors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Translating robust results into frameworks for training supervisors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conducting research on effectiveness of supervision training for supervisors in development and for more experienced supervisors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing attention to cross-national studies of supervision practice, international competency standards, and evolving practices and guidelines in the international arena.</p></list-item></list>
<p>We agree with the significance of these implications and also believe there are additional implications of importance. In terms of training, we believe that even before the translation of robust results, counseling psychology faculty must make a more significant commitment to the issue of supervision in their curricula. While it is true that supervision needs to be addressed in graduate programs in order for programs to be accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), the wording of this requirement is, in our view, lacking in impact and somewhat ambiguous. The word <italic>supervision</italic> does appear, albeit minimally, in the <italic>Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012453945">APA, 2012</xref>). Under Domain B (“Program Philosophy, Objectives, and Curriculum Plan”), it states that programs must have a curriculum plan that allows students to understand and be competent in a long list of areas. One of the areas is “consultation and supervision” (p. 6). The word <italic>supervision</italic>, as best we can determine, appears only once in the document. In our view, though there are obviously reasons for the broad-based and flexible wording in this document, the lack of specificity in this particular area may be one reason—among many—why supervision may not receive extensive attention in graduate programs. In our view then, an additional implication of this MC is that it may impact both the APA Accreditation Commission and training program faculty generally. In particular, both groups may now be forced to examine the question of how students are being trained—or not being trained—in this pivotal area. Thus, we feel that the MC will have a potential impact even <italic>before</italic> the results will be translated into a framework. We believe that this MC will stimulate an even more basic and important response, which may lead to an increase in the attention given to the topic of supervision in our graduate training programs—attention that is long overdue.</p>
<p>We also believe a very important implication of this MC is that at the most basic of levels the MC will lead to more effective psychotherapy, and therefore more improvement on the part of clients; as supervision improves, therapy improves and clients improve. This—although basic, simplistic, and obvious—may be the most significant implication of this MC.</p>
<p>Finally, the appearance of this MC in one of our two leading journals will obviously lead to an increased focus on the topic—it will elevate this issue and bring it front and center where it belongs—thus impacting the field at a basic and significant level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011000012453945">
<title>Reactions to the Four Articles</title>
<p>We now turn to comments concerning each of the four individual articles in the MC. We begin with the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012453945">Son, Ellis, and Yoo (2013)</xref>, “Clinical Supervision in South Korea and the U.S.: A Comparative Descriptive Study.” In this article, the authors empirically examine clinical supervision in South Korea and the United States. What is particularly contributory about this study is that it deals with the Benchmark related to diversity and supervision. The researchers drew from a United States sample of 187 participants (30 men and 157 women) and a South Korean sample of 191 participants (9 men and 182 women). Though the representativeness of the sample (as stated by the authors) is a limitation of the study, and though the sample is obviously skewed heavily in the female direction, we believe that the data reported in this study are of utility. We found the fact that there were more similarities than differences between supervision in the two countries to be particularly interesting. However, it is also of note that there were some differences (e.g., concerning theoretical orientation), relative numbers concerning doctoral and masters programs, and differences in formalized supervision and licensure, vis-à-vis the definition of a psychologist. Because this is one of the few empirical studies that explicitly addresses issues related to supervision in two countries and because it is a study that responds directly to one of the Benchmarks, we believe that the study is important. We found the “Future Directions” aspect of this article particularly relevant, since there is clearly a need to examine future supervision needs both in the United States and worldwide.</p>
<p>The fact that this study found both similarities and differences suggests to us that there certainly may be common factors concerning supervision that can be put into practice throughout the world. However, the fact that differences exist also suggests the importance of supervision—like therapy—having a cultural base somewhat specific to the particular country/culture. Deciding on a strategy for meshing these complex and heterogeneous findings is one of the challenges elucidated in this article. Clearly, as the researchers indicate, future research needs to examine both the common factors as well as the specifics that will vary from culture to culture as a means of determining what the most effective model of supervision is for a given locale.</p>
<p>The next article to be discussed is “What Helps and What Hinders in Cross-Cultural Clinical Supervision: A Critical Incident Study.” This article presents an empirical study utilizing the critical incident technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012453945">Flanagan, 1954</xref>) to examine positive and negative aspects in terms of the cross-cultural supervisory process. The article also proposes a Person-Centered Mentoring Model, which focuses on positive humanistic behaviors as reflected in mentoring and supervision. The literature concerning effective supervision is voluminous (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012453945">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012453945">Hutt, Scott, &amp; King, 1983</xref>) and the current authors add to this literature by utilizing as participants 25 visible minority graduate students as well as early career professionals. The participants were asked to describe examples of positive and negative supervision and the results were organized into themes. Examples of positive themes included “Supervisor was appreciative, accepting, supportive, encouraging, and validating” and “Supervisor provided timely, clear, constructive feedback, guidance, and debriefing.” Examples of negative themes included “Difficulties of being a visible ethnic minority” and “Supervisor did not provide a safe, trusting environment.”</p>
<p>In our view, one of the most interesting findings of this study was that a number of the participants reported an increased understanding of self following a supervisory experience that was negative. The idea of “growth through adversity” is certainly not new, but it is in our view a particularly interesting phenomenon in this specific context. The growth that may occur in therapists-in-training due to encountering adversity may be of vital assistance to these trainees as they develop their therapy skills. This improvement in trainee therapeutic skills likely improves client outcomes as well.</p>
<p>It is also of particular note, as stated above, that this study makes use of the Person-Centered Mentoring Model, described in part as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, competence matters, but supervisors who possess the personal qualities of being a mentor are also important, as supported by several of the positive themes of the present study.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This study focuses on the perspective of the supervisees. However, as the authors state, having the supervisor’s perspective would certainly add an additional and significant dimension.</p>
<p>A closer examination of the specific themes that emerged from this study is instructive in terms of implications for conducting supervision. The notable positive themes in this study included the relationship between supervisee and supervisor as well as the competence of the supervisor. These were in addition to issues related to multicultural competence. Clearly, based on this study, supervisees want supervisors who are able to form positive relationships with them, who know what they are doing, and who are well versed in multicultural issues. In our view, these three pivotal issues often are also of great relevance when the process of psychotherapy is described. The critical incident themes that were negative included both issues of poor multicultural awareness and issues related to competence/support. There are obvious implications of these data for supervisors and for the training of supervisors. Specifically, these data support the importance of connecting multicultural issues with competence (i.e., Benchmarks)—the central theme of this MC.</p>
<p>In the article on effective and ineffective supervision by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012453945">Ladany, Mori, and Mehr (2013)</xref>, the authors utilized a mixed-model design to examine the experiences of supervisees who had a variety of supervisory encounters, which was intended to capture what contributed to effective and ineffective supervision experiences. Ladany et al. determined that effective supervision was based on both supervisor and supervisee variables, although the study focused solely on the supervisee report of supervisory experiences. Supervisors who “encouraged autonomy, strengthened the supervisory relationship, and facilitated open discussion” were considered effective. Conversely, supervisors who “depreciated supervision, performed ineffective client conceptualization and treatment, and weakened the supervisory relationship” were found to be ineffective. The authors hypothesized their study would offer both support and perhaps contrast to the Competency Benchmarks related to supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453945">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study were interesting in that they raised several questions related to multicultural supervision and the Benchmarks. Essentially, the authors report that supervisor behaviors that encouraged supervisee autonomy, as well as supervisors’ openness to supervisee ideas, were found to be effective. It is worth considering whether this would be considered effective cross-culturally. For example, in this issue, Son, Ellis, and Yoo found that supervision with South Korean supervisees might be more effective if it was more directive. Given this, it might have been instructive for Ladany, Mori, and Mehr to have addressed multicultural issues more in-depth.</p>
<p>A second interesting area of discussion relates to the Competency Benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453945">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). The authors note that their findings support some areas of the Benchmarks, specifically the importance of the supervisory relationship and goal setting. However, their findings provided no support for the concept of developmental levels in the Benchmarks. This is notable in that each Benchmark is organized based on developmental phases (readiness for practicum, readiness for internship, readiness for entry to practice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453945">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). Clearly, there is great potential for future research here, given the importance of this issue.</p>
<p>The authors conclude their article with a discussion of limitations and suggestions for the future. We agree that the current study was limited by its focus solely on the experiences of supervisees. We would like to see future studies examine both supervisor and supervisee experiences of supervision. This is especially salient since supervision can serve as a parallel process for the supervisee’s therapeutic relationship with clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012453945">Friedlander, Siegel, &amp; Brenock, 1989</xref>). Additionally, since clients and therapists often find different aspects of therapy to be helpful (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012453945">Westefeld, 2009</xref>), it is likely that supervisees and supervisors might respond similarly. We also agree with the authors that more supervisor accountability needs to be in place to ensure effective supervision in shaping future therapists.</p>
<p>In the article by Burnes, Wood, Inman, and Welikson, the authors build on existing research related to the use of specific theoretical orientations in the supervision process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012453945">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2004</xref>). Qualitative methods were used to investigate how supervisees in feminist-oriented supervision groups understood the process and outcome of their supervision experiences. Both supervisors and supervisees were part of focus groups, which is aligned with a feminist approach to supervision. The authors constructed a model that consisted of interacting clusters, including variables that influenced supervisee and supervisor experiences in supervision, the influence of a feminist approach, and the influence of culture, equality, and environmental factors on supervision. Similar to Ladany et al.’s study on effective supervision, the authors found allowing supervisees to lead the supervision process to be helpful.</p>
<p>As was suggested in the article on effective and ineffective supervision, we appreciated the fact that this study examined both supervisor and supervisee variables. In contrast to the other studies in this issue, the current study used intact groups to investigate supervision processes. This is a refreshing approach to studying supervision experiences in that it capitalizes on group processes already in place. In many counseling psychology training programs, group supervision occurs most frequently in the form of practicum class. Though approaches to practicum class may vary both between and within graduate training programs, the findings from this study have implications for teaching practicum. We found ourselves wondering about what the findings of this study specifically might mean for a practicum class instructor. In our experience, specific data regarding—in particular—how to structure a practicum class in a counseling psychology training program is an area of research still needing additional examination and discussion. Thus, studies that examine individual experiences may be missing this informative element of group supervision. Furthermore, we respected the use of feminist elements in the study design (i.e., the open discussion of power differentials during the study interview process that may affect future evaluations within the group).</p>
<p>There are two additional areas, in our view, that we would have liked to have seen addressed in this study. First, it seems that by having groups volunteer for the study, the authors may have inadvertently valenced the focus groups toward those with only positive experiences in feminist group supervision. It would be interesting to see how the results might be different with participants who represented both positive and negative experiences in feminist-oriented group supervision. Second, we would like to have seen the information presented in this article tied more directly to multicultural issues and the Competency Benchmarks, as was done in the other articles.</p>
<p>Overall, we found this study to be an excellent contribution to the existing literature on theoretical orientation and group supervision process and outcome. The authors were thorough in their approach to the study design and were mindful in designing a study consistent with the feminist principles they were examining. This study in particular offers insight into effective group supervision training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011000012453945">
<title>Conclusions and Implications for Counseling Psychology</title>
<p>We again applaud the authors for an important and timely contribution to the literature. In one of the more recent articles focusing on supervision in <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012453945">Westefeld (2009)</xref> interviewed several leading counseling psychologists about their views on supervision. Among other issues identified, Westefeld listed the following as key themes that emerged from these interviews:
<disp-quote>
<p>An increased emphasis in our training programs on teaching people <italic>how</italic> to supervise, development of more effective evaluation instruments that can be utilized in the supervision process, and an emphasis on supervision as a lifelong, never-ending process. (p. 312)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In many ways, the authors of this MC have addressed all three of these points. This Contribution advocates for an increased emphasis on supervision in our training programs. Additionally, the Contribution utilizes the Benchmark concept as a means of providing some aspect of measurement in relation to supervision. Finally, implicit in the Contribution is the idea that supervision is a dynamic concept.</p>
<p>In the introduction to their signal text, “Fundamentals of Clinical Supervision,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012453945">Bernard and Goodyear (2009)</xref> state:
<disp-quote>
<p>We assert that every mental health professional should acquire supervision skills, for virtually all eventually will supervise. In fact, supervision is one of the more common activities in which mental health professionals engage. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We agree. And because of this, the MC is significant. Hopefully, graduate faculty in counseling psychology training programs and other human service professionals will make note of the many significant points made in this MC and will increasingly emphasize this vital skill. As was stated earlier, as supervision training improves, the skills of human service providers improve—and clients improve.</p>
