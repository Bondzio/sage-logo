<abstract>
<p>This study presents a systematic transcript-based analysis of the dialogue occurring in a track two workshop attended by Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians. We hypothesized that participants from conflicting groups would form a shared superordinate identity in the course of the workshop. Our findings confirmed this hypothesis. Consistent with self-categorization theory, we demonstrate that the observed Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians mutually identified with the peacecamp, a collection of people and organizations that promote dialogue and conflict resolution efforts. In line with our expectations, and in contradiction to previous findings concerning communication between groups in conflict, participants demonstrated patterns of cooperative, counter-ethnocentric interaction. Through the paradigm of social identity theory, we explain these phenomena as the result of the participants' salient superordinate peacecamp identity. The study's findings offer an innovative theoretical contribution to the common ingroup identity model, showing that the reduction of intergroup bias can actually hinder the effectiveness of conflict resolution efforts. Specifically, by forming a superordinate identity, the observed participants are left less able to represents the needs, demands, and claims of their respective national groups and, hence, less able to produce ideas acceptable to their respective publics. The study also offers a practical contribution to the field of track two diplomacy, empirically verifying Hebert Kelman's assertion that when facilitators allow participants to form a cohesive group, they risk damaging both the quality of the workshop's ideas and the participants' ability to influence their leaderships (Rouhana and Kelman 1994; Kelman 1999, 2002).</p>

<p>By the time their landmark work <italic>Reducing Intergroup Bias: the Common Identity Model</italic> went to press, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712448911">Gaertner and Dovidio’s (2000)</xref> assertion that bias between groups could be powerfully mitigated through the creation of shared, superordinate identities had been confirmed in a variety of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022002712448911">Huo et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712448911">Gaertner, Dovidio, and Bachman 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712448911">Brewer 1999</xref>) but not in the context of violent conflict. The problem with conflict zones, as Gaernter and Dovidio saw it, was one of “practical engineering” (2000, 162). The contact hypothesis conditions upon which the common ingroup identity model relies—equal status, sustained interaction, cooperative interdependence, and mutually agreeable social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712448911">Allport 1954</xref>)—are exceedingly difficult to create against a backdrop of exploding bombs. Yet one enterprise does regularly create those conditions in the context of violent conflict: track two diplomacy.</p>
<p>Track two diplomacy, which is also known as “interactive problem solving” and “interactive conflict resolution,” is a social–psychological approach to conflict resolution that has been widely used in tens of ethnic conflicts, including Malaysia–Indonesia–Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712448911">Burton 1969</xref>), Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002712448911">Doob and Foltz 1973</xref>), Israel–Palestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712448911">Kelman and Cohen 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712448911">Kelman 1979</xref>), Lebanon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712448911">Azar 1984</xref>), Cyprus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712448911">Fisher 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712448911">Diamond and McDonald 1996</xref>), and Russia Baltic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022002712448911">Volkan and Harris 1992</xref>). Agha et al. define track two diplomacy as “discussions held by non-officials of conflicting parties in an attempt to clarify outstanding disputes and to explore options for resolving them in settings or circumstances that are less sensitive than those associated with official negotiations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002712448911">Agha et al. 2003</xref>, 1). The success of those discussions is highly dependent on the track two facilitator’s ability to create a safe environment for political risk tasking and, as such, facilitators often go to great lengths to protect their participants from the press and internal leaks. Workshops are conducted in secrecy, often abroad, and under Chatham House rules. Such measures temporarily extricate participants from the vagaries of violent conflict, laying the foundation for cooperative discussions under Contact Hypothesis conditions, a fact not missed by Common Ingroup Identity Model researchers.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022002712448911">
<title>Track Two Diplomacy and the Hope of Superordinate Identities in Protracted Conflict</title>
<p>In writing about Herbert Kelman’s track two workshops in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Gaertner and Dovidio noted with hope that “Even within the context of intense historical and contemporary conflict, it may be possible to be creative and engineer the development of a common ingroup identity for a subset of group members with significant residual effects for the groups as a whole” (2000, 162). Pettigrew went further yet, concluding that “These groups serve as laboratories and as a setting for direct interaction. They have the potential of initiating coalitions of peace-minded participants across conflict lines. And these workshops present a model for a new relationship between the parties” (1998, 665).</p>
<p>However, despite the abundant potential attributed to them, no empirical evidence has confirmed the formation of a superordinate identity in a track two workshop setting, and with good reason: tape recorders threaten political risk taking. The secrecy required to broach key conflict issues, even for nonofficials, cannot be created if participants fear that their words will later be used against them. Consequently, track two facilitators have historically prohibited the recording and transcription of meeting dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448911">Kelman 2006</xref>). This study is the first to overcome that limitation.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2006, the authors obtained permission to attend and record a track two workshop attended by Jewish–Israeli and Palestinians<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002712448911">1</xref>
</sup> in Jerusalem. This study is based on a careful and systematic analysis of the transcript produced from those recordings. Its first goal is to systematically gauge the extent to which Jewish–Israeli and Palestinian participants actually do form a superordinate group identity. Drawing on a combination of our experience in over thirty previous track two workshops and a number of hopeful predictions from the Common Ingroup Identity literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712448911">Gaertner, Dovidio, and Bachman 1996</xref>; Pettigrew 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712448911">Gaertner and Dovidio 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712448911">Maoz 2011</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712448911">

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Jewish–Israeli and Palestinian participants will form a superordinate identity in the workshop.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The study’s second goal was to examine the nature of intergroup interaction between the participants and to assess the extent to which this interaction would be confrontational and ethnocentric or cooperative and nonethnocentric. Given the exploratory nature of this study—as the first to analyze detailed transcripts of a track two workshop—we chose to present two alternative hypotheses for the expected nature of the intergroup interaction in the workshop.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022002712448911">
<title>Confrontational and Ethnocentric Intergroup Interaction</title>
<p>Previous studies demonstrate that dialogue between Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians is often ethnocentric and confrontational. Such dialogue is characterized by each side’s rejection of responsibility and full ascription of blame to the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712448911">Kelman 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712448911">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022002712448911">Sonnenschein, Halabi, and Friedman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712448911">Maoz 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712448911">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022002712448911">Ellis and Maoz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712448911">Bekerman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712448911">Helman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712448911">Steinberg and Bar-On 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022002712448911">Suleiman 2004</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Hypothesis 2a: Israeli–Jewish and Palestinian participants will demonstrate patterns of confrontational, ethnocentric intergroup interaction in the workshop.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022002712448911">
<title>Cooperative, Nonethnocentric Intergroup Interaction</title>
<p>Alternatively, and in line with previous work describing positive, cooperative patterns of intergroup interaction in settings of planned contact aimed at improving intergroup relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712448911">Gaertner, Dovidio, and Bachman, 1996</xref>; Pettigrew 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712448911">Gaertner and Dovidio 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712448911">Maoz 2011</xref>), the participants could be expected to engage in nonconfrontational interactions that support the creation of a shared identity. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Hypothesis 2b: Israeli–Jewish and Palestinian participants will demonstrate patterns of cooperative nonethnocentric intergroup interaction in the workshop.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Our findings show that, in line with Hypothesis 1, the Jewish–Israeli and Palestinian participants did indeed form a superordinate identity in the workshop. Surprisingly, given the deep intractability of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, our findings also show that intergroup interaction within the workshop was consistent with Hypothesis 2b. The observed Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians, many of whom have lost friends and served jail sentences as a result of their involvement in the conflict, unite against a common enemy and speak in terms of what they, as “peace-loving people” can do to end the conflict. The Jewish–Israelis join the Palestinians in criticizing the government of Israel, vociferously rejecting the attempts of their conationals to blame the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians, for their part, rebuke conationals who go too far in critiquing the Israelis. We explain this norm-defying behavior by the formation of a superordinate identity within the group: membership in the “peacecamp,” a collection of people and organizations that promote dialogue and conflict-resolution efforts.</p>
<p>Following a review of the literature on track two diplomacy, we relate to self-categorization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712448911">Turner et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448911">Hogg and Reid 2006</xref>) in order to explain the salience of the superordinate peacecamp identity for meeting participants. We then contextualize our data, describing the people that participated in the observed track two workshop and confronting one of the major problems with such workshops: the selection bias that prompts the most pliable individuals on both sides to attend. We also describe the organization that facilitated the studied workshop and the political context in which it took place. We give an overview of our methodology before going on to examine, with the help of social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712448911">Tajfel and Turner 1986</xref>), the impact of the superordinate peacecamp identity on the group’s discursive behavior. In discussing the innovative theoretical and practical implications of our findings, we demonstrate that the group’s ability to form a superordinate identity comes at the expense of their respective national identities.</p>
<p>Thus, our study makes an important theoretical contribution to understanding the limits of the superordinate identity’s utility in the context of intractable conflict. Our findings indicate that, paradoxically, the formation of a superordinate group identity seriously handicaps the ability of track two workshop participants to reach a solution to the conflict that represents the needs, demands, and claims of their respective publics.</p>

<title>Track Two Diplomacy: The Literature</title>
<p>Track two diplomacy has received considerable attention in the conflict-resolution literature. Writings on the subject can be grouped into three distinct trends, the most prominent of which is constituted by studies reviewing the methodology, implementation, and results of track two workshops—often facilitated by the author—in various conflict zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712448911">Burton 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022002712448911">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712448911">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712448911">Kelman 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712448911">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712448911">Montville 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022002712448911">Pruitt and Rubin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712448911">Notter and McDonald 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712448911">Diamond and McDonald 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712448911">Fisher 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002712448911">Chigas 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712448911">Botcharova 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022002712448911">Davies and Kaufman 2002</xref>). A second prominent trend is more theoretical and focuses on isolating the favorable conditions for the use of track two diplomacy and its ability to generate political impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712448911">Hewstone and Brown 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022002712448911">Zartman 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022002712448911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712448911">Kelman 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712448911">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712448911">Kaye 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712448911">Pearson d’Estree et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712448911">Lieberfeld 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A third trend in the literature is comprised of critiques of the field and the techniques used in workshops. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022002712448911">Rouhana (1995</xref>) has written about the “disarray” in the field of track two diplomacy, citing the field’s diffusion and its multitude of approaches as serious obstacles to its advancement as an academic subject area. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022002712448911">Rouhana and Korper (1997</xref>) have shown that in attempting to reconcile competing interests between parties in conflict, third-party facilitators can unwittingly side with the goals of the stronger conflict party, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002712448911">Abu-Nimer (1998</xref>) has written about the challenges that trainers (those who teach the participants conflict-resolution skills) face in track two workshops and the problems associated with implementing the Western styles of conflict resolution in non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>While many of the previously mentioned studies offer potential contributions to understanding the patterns of interaction in track two workshops and to thus gauging the potential effectiveness of such intergroup discussions in bringing about change in the opinions of participants and beyond, only one study has done so with rigorous empirical analysis. That study is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712448911">Pearson d’Estree and Babbit (1998)</xref>, which compared dialogue and interaction along gender lines in three Israeli–Palestinian track two workshops of varying gender compositions. Pearson d’Estree and Babbit demonstrated that typically female interaction styles were readily apparent in all-female Israeli–Palestinian workshops but almost entirely absent in mixed-gender Israeli–Palestinian workshops, indicating that feminine interaction styles are rare in mixed-gender settings. The Pearson d’Estree and Babbit study is important in being the first to offer transcript-supported observations on the nature of interaction in track two workshops, yet it is also limited by the preclusion of recording equipment in workshops. Pearson d’Estree and Babbit worked with transcripts produced from the typed notes of three observers. The present study, having recorded the deliberations of a track two workshop, was able to produce a transcript that captures not only far more of the meeting’s dialogue—close to 100 percent, in fact—but also far more dialogic detail.</p>
<p>Dialogic analysis in group settings is a bit like drinking from a fire hydrant; every minute of interaction produces an overwhelming amount of data, especially when the issues discussed are contentious. The observed participants spoke passionately and hurriedly. They interrupted and spoke over each other and frequently spoke out of turn. The recording allowed us to slow the dialogue down, listen time and time again, and produce a detailed transcript that, in turn, facilitated an in-depth analysis of the interaction between participants. However, in order to understand that analysis, the workshop must first be contextualized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022002712448911">
<title>Contextualization</title>
<p>The following section provides context for three major components of the workshop: the participants, the facilitating organization, and the political context in which the workshop took place.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022002712448911">
<title>Within the Group</title>
<p>The workshop participants are Jewish–Israeli (11 participants), Palestinian (5 participants), and international (3 participants). The Jewish–Israeli participants are mostly male, Ashkenazi<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022002712448911">2</xref>
</sup> elites. Only one participant in the workshop, an Israeli, Ashkenazi academic, was female. Women are endemically underrepresented at such workshops, a phenomenon that the facilitating organization justifies by claiming that fewer women hold the kind of positions of power from which the participants are drawn and that, when women do receive invitations to attend, they are less likely to accept them. All of the Jewish–Israeli participants are politically affiliated, with Meretz, Labor, or Kadima.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002712448911">3</xref>
</sup> One is a former top official in the Israeli Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations (Mossad), another two are retired, high-ranking Israel Defense Forces (IDF) servicemen, four are among Israel’s most renowned academics, two direct prominent nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the other is a veteran journalist.</p>
<p>The Palestinian group is also composed of elites, all of whom are currently or formerly affiliated with Fatah or the DFLP.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002712448911">4</xref>
</sup> None of the Palestinian participants were affiliated with Hamas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002712448911">5</xref>
</sup> They count among their numbers a former PLO ambassador, the director of a prominent Palestinian NGO, the president of one of the largest companies in the Palestinian Territories, and a veteran journalist.</p>
<p>Of the international participants, one is a staff member of the European organization funding the workshop, one is a junior European politician from Belgium, and the last is a representative of the European Union in the Palestinian Territories.</p>
<p>All the Jewish–Israeli and Palestinian participants in the workshop have previously participated in some form of Israeli–Palestinian dialogue. Most of them are “veteran participants,” having participated in track two workshops and other various encounters for well over a decade. It should be noted that the workshop discussions were all conducted in English, which is not a first language for all but two of the participants. The facilitating organization views English as a “neutral language,” whose use, in place of Hebrew or Arabic, favors neither side. In other contexts, the use of English might limit the participants’ self-expression, but this is not a significant problem here because all of the attending participants have an excellent command of the language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022002712448911">
<title>Within the Organization</title>
<p>The observed workshop was facilitated by an Israeli–Palestinian think tank that, at the time, had eighteen years of experience in conducting track two diplomacy. According to its mission statement, the organization is “a joint institution of Israelis and Palestinians dedicated to the resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on the basis of the ‘two states for two peoples’ solution.” The “jointness” of the organization is reflected in its programming and staffing, both of which involve roughly equal numbers of Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians. The “two states for two peoples’ solution,” otherwise known as the “two-state solution,” involves the creation of a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, alongside the State of Israel. The organization only works with Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians that support this particular solution to the conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002712448911">6</xref>
</sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022002712448911">
<title>Within Time</title>
<p>The workshop analyzed in this study was held on August 10, 2006, twenty-eight days into the Second Lebanon War and four days before a UN-brokered ceasefire put an end to hostilities. The prominence of the War in the discussions is surprisingly low, perhaps because the participants have no way of influencing its course, or possibly because of the knowledge that with a ceasefire about to take force, the War would soon be over. Whatever the case, the War’s impact on discussions was not large enough to substantially differentiate the observed meeting from the thirty or so other track two workshops that the authors have attended. Having established our data’s context, it is now possible to move on to the procedures used in its analysis.</p>

<p>We approached our study using ethnographic methods informed by discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712448911">Fairclough 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002712448911">Potter and Wetherell 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022002712448911">Shi-xu 2005</xref>), including a primary focus on the verbal practices and resources that the participants used to interact with one another and to construct their viewpoints. The study’s primary data source—a 100-page transcript—was produced from a full recording of the discussions that took place at the workshop. All participants gave signed permission, allowing the meeting discussions to be recorded and transcribed as well as for the publication of any academic material utilizing the transcription. All participants were also guaranteed anonymity within the transcript. Consequently, in all quoted transcript excerpts the real names of people, places, and organizations have been substituted with pseudonyms or random initials. Two of the authors were present at the workshop, and their observation notes, which recorded facial expressions, gestures, and other nonaudible phenomena, were incorporated into the transcript to increase its observational thickness.</p>
<p>The transcription was produced using a modified version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712448911">Myers 2006</xref>) of the transcription methods and symbols outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022002712448911">Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974)</xref>, which facilitate the notation of a broad range of speech elements including pauses (and their length in tenths of a second), interruptions, overlapping speech and emphasis on words. Transcription symbols render the text indecipherable to the untrained reader and, accordingly, have either been removed or explained in all quoted excerpts. A copy of our transcription guide is included in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022002712448911">appendix</xref> to show the reader the full range of noted speech elements. In each quoted excerpt, the speaker’s nationality and gender are indicated in parentheses, where “I” indicates a Jewish–Israeli, “P” indicates a Palestinian, and “Int” indicates an international participant. Gender is indicated by “M” for male and “F” for female participants.</p>

<sec id="section12-0022002712448911">
<title>Analytical Process</title>
<p>Our analytical process was based on grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002712448911">Corbin and Strauss 2008</xref>), a collection of analytical techniques that facilitate the inductive origination of concepts and theory from data itself. Guided by this approach and by relevant literature, after an initial reading of the materials, we developed a set of hypotheses. In testing our hypotheses, we repeatedly combed the data set for recurring patterns of interaction and dialogue relevant to our research expectations. We focused our analysis on the following verbal interaction indicators:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The formation (or nonformation) of a superordinate identity between workshop participants<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>mentioning (or not mentioning) broader overriding identity categories to which both Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians belong;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>overt self-categorization—for both individuals and the group—in an overriding identity category;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>an indication of preference for an overriding identity category over national identity.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ethnocentric, confrontational behavior<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>blaming the other side for the conflict’s continuation while refraining from assigning responsibility or blame to one’s own side;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>overt rejection of blame of one’s own side and ascription of blame to the other side.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Cooperative, nonethnocentric behavior<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>blaming one’s own side for the conflict’s continuation while justifying the other side’s behavior;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>overt rejection of blame ascription to the other side and acceptance of blame and responsibility of one’s own side.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In searching for verbal interaction indicators, we paid careful attention to phrases and ideas that were often repeated in the transcript or drew considerable attention. As patterns and themes emerged in the data set, we grouped individual interactions into categories, noting the properties of constituent interactions. We developed inclusion rules, comprising a specific constellation of properties, that delineated category borders and determined the inclusion or rejection of new instances. Occasionally, exceptional new instances led us to challenge and sometimes redefine an inclusion rule. When this happened, all previous instances were reexamined to ensure compliance with the new, refined inclusion rule.</p>
<p>After several readings, we were able to combine and refine similar categories while eliminating those that were less relevant. We looked for and tested relationships between the remaining categories, rendering a set of tentative conclusions. Finally, we deductively tested our conclusions, actively seeking instances that could disprove them. When exceptions were found, we modified our conclusions when possible or, when not, abandoned them as spurious. The process was repeated several times producing a set of findings whose presence in the data set is justifiable and can be supported and defended by an extensive body of evidence. Those phenomena are presented in the following section.</p>

<title>Formation of a Superordinate Identity: Peacecamp Self-Categorization</title>
<p>There are at least twelve instances in the transcript of both Jewish–Israelis and Palestinian participants referring to themselves or those in the room as members of the “peacecamp,” or one of its permutations, including “peace-loving people,” “peacemakers,” and “peace activists.” Given that interaction with outgroup normally increases the salience of ingroup identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712448911">Tajfel and Turner 1986</xref>), the participants’ repeated self-categorization to a superordinate identity—often in favor of their national identities—constitutes convincing and affirming evidence for Hypothesis 1. Consider the following examples from the round of introductions:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Irit (I-F):</speaker>
<p>Irit, I’m a professor of political science, and I’m uh, what I guess now I should call the <italic>left wing</italic> of Shalom Achshav [Peace Now Movement].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022002712448911">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mahdi (P-M):</speaker>
<p> I am Mahdi. I am a peace activist.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sari (P-M):</speaker>
<p>Sari, co-CEO of this organization and eh . . . peace activist.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Amots (I-M):</speaker>
<p> Amots, I was <italic>always</italic> part of the left wing of Peace Now, and eh, I’m the Israeli co-Director of this organization.</p>
</speech>
<p>In each of these examples, the participants choose, from the array of identities available to them, to self-categorize as people who are committed to peace, either by direct self-definition or by offering their membership in an organization affiliated with the peacecamp. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448911">Hogg and Reid (2006, 10</xref>) point out, the act of self-categorization makes an identity powerfully salient:<disp-quote>
<p>Self-categorization has additional effects, it not only transforms self-conception and generates a feeling of belonging and group identification, but also transforms how we actually feel and behave to conform to the group prototype. Self-categorization causes our thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and behavior to conform to our prototype of the in-group.</p>
</disp-quote> The self-categorization of these group members is, therefore, both a strong indication of the salience of the peacecamp identity and a motivation to behave in ways that conform to that identity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the participants not only self-categorize as members of the peacecamp, they ascribe the identity to the group as a whole:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ely (I-M):</speaker>
<p> But what happens when you have an international (short pause) thing like this, and you reframe (short pause) the, the potential final status agreement, and you make it easier. You see that they margin is small. And perhaps ehm (medium pause), I think the most important point was by ah, by Ido (I-M) (short pause) and ehm, all of these will not happen if we are as eh, fully organized as we are today.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the peacecamp. Ehm, we have a big competition, and if you wish, we have a conflict camp. They are better organized, they are stronger, and ehm, and if we, we continue, the, the conflict if you want, you can look at it as the Hamas, and you can look at it as the Yesha Council, or you can look at it as whatever, Hezbollah. Hierarchical, very well-organized, strong ideology, which is very clear . . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Amots (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Very well-funded.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ely (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Very well-funded. It’s very important. They have sanctioning mechanisms, if they both wants to punish one of the soldiers, then he is punished. Here we, we are all eh, look, around the table. So we are very weak.</p>
</speech>
<p>By calling on the participants to “look around the table,” Ely (I-M) is overtly categorizing the participants as members of the peacecamp, and he is not the only one to do so. In the following excerpt, Fadi (P-M) also extends the peacecamp identity to the group:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Fadi (P-M):</speaker>
<p>After the approach, when it comes to the process (short pause) I have (short pause) <italic>main</italic> three or four suggestions (medium pause). <italic>One</italic>, that we begin (short pause) with the (short pause) <italic>long-term</italic>, then we come to the short-term. We decide what is the vision (short pause) we, we need to <italic>work on</italic>. Then we decide what to do in the (short pause) short, ah, in the short [Fadi (P-M) is interrupted in a comment that cannot be made out] Eh, sorry? Yeah, yeah, we, we show, we speak about the, we, about the, the <italic>aims</italic>, the overall aims, then we come to the eh, to the eh…</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ran (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Fadi, when you say “we”, to whom do you refer?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Fadi (P-M):</speaker>
<p>I am speaking about <italic>our</italic>selves, the people who are peace-loving people, who want to work <italic>for</italic> (short pause) peace built on reconciliation.</p>
</speech>
<p>Fadi’s (P-M) statement is a rare example of a participant explicitly clarifying the referent of “we,” which he defines as “ourselves, the people who are peace-loving people.” In clarifying his reference, Fadi (P-M) explicitly places the workshop participants in the peacecamp.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in both the introductions and the quotations that followed them, both Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians self-categorized as members of the peacecamp. In line with our expectations, then, the peacecamp identity has the power to transcend nationality and form a superordinate identity; both Israelis and Palestinians in the workshop claim it and extend it to the group as a whole. With the salience and superordinance of the peacecamp identity established, the findings concerning patterns of intergroup interaction in the workshop can now be addressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022002712448911">
<title>Counterethnocentric Intergroup Interaction: Israelis Blame Their Own Government</title>
<p>Our Hypothesis 2a stated that workshop participants would engage in confrontational, ethnocentric interaction. Such interaction, as Kelman and Cohen (1976, 85) explain, is typical of groups in conflict:<disp-quote>
<p>The norms that typically govern interaction between conflicting parties call for expression of conflict, strict adherence to the position of one’s own side, legalistic arguments, outdoing the other side in the recitation of atrocities, denying the legitimacy of all of the other side’s claims, and sometimes indeed denying the legitimacy of the other side’s existence.</p>
</disp-quote> Kelman and Cohen’s norms have been empirically verified in the Israeli–Palestinian context by a number of studies demonstrating Jewish–Israeli dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002712448911">Halabi 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712448911">Maoz 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712448911">Helman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712448911">Maoz et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022002712448911">Suleiman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022002712448911">Bekerman and Zembylas 2010</xref>) and various forms of Jewish–Israeli ethnocentrism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712448911">Steinberg and Bar-On 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712448911">Bekerman 2009</xref>). Given the abundant support for Kelman and Cohen’s norms in the literature, one might expect the observed Jewish–Israelis to offer carefully constructed arguments, justifying their group’s position in the conflict while ascribing blame and/or responsibility to the Palestinian side. In fact, they do the opposite; in line with Hypothesis 2b, the observed Jewish–Israelis attack their own government’s behavior in managing the conflict, a clear manifestation of cooperative and nonethnocentric interaction. Consider, for example, the following statement by Ely (I-M):</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ely (I-M):</speaker>
<p> Ehm, I want to pick up on what eh, Amots began with. I think the focus is eh, we’re trying to see essentially how to focus on the Palestinian track. I think the conversation is going nowhere. And, eh, we are talking about eh, this myth or real, or reality, that there is no partner on the Palestinian side from a Palestinian perspective, from an Israeli perspective. And by the way, [from]<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022002712448911">8</xref>

<speaker>Ran (I-M):</speaker>
<p> Palestinian partner. Mahmoud (P-M) said there is no Palestinian partner and uh ( )<sup>

<speaker>Ely (I-M):</speaker>
<p>I am TELLING<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022002712448911">10</xref>
</sup> you as an ISRAELI, there is no Israeli partner.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ran (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Ah.</p>
</speech>
<p>Ely’s (I-M) statement defies the norms of communication between conflicting groups in two ways. First, as an Israeli, he is attempting to refocus the discussion onto what <italic>his own</italic> government can do, rather than placing the impetus for change on the other side. He does so by aligning the group’s discussion with a well-used Israeli objection to engaging in negotiations: the lack of a Palestinian partner. He then relativizes the objection by claiming that it is mirrored on the Palestinian side, prompting Ran’s (I-M) correction that “there is no <italic>Palestinian</italic>partner” (emphasis added). In response, Ely (I-M) defies the norms a second time: with a raised voice, he asserts that Israel lacks either the will or capacity (or both) to make peace with Palestinians, an outright critique of his own government and a diametric opposite of “adherence to the position of one’s own side.”</p>
<p>Ely’s (I-M) willingness to challenge his government’s actions is not unique; it is paralleled by four other instances in the transcript. Amots (I-M) accuses the Israeli Prime Minister of “lacking any determination” to make peace and, in a separate statement, lambasts the Israeli government for “completely ignoring Arab overtures for peace.” Irit (I-M) twice states that Israel is unwilling to negotiate. In blaming their own government for the conflict’s impasse, the observed Jewish–Israelis are unambiguously defying Kelman and Cohen’s norms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022002712448911">
<title>Jewish–Israeli Nonascription of Blame to the Palestinians</title>
<p>Also in line with Hypothesis 2b, the observed Jewish–Israelis vociferously reject the ascription of blame for the conflict to the Palestinians. As such, our transcript contains only two instances of a Jewish–Israeli blaming the Palestinians for the conflict’s impasse, both initiated by Amit (I-M). His first critique and the group’s reaction to it are quoted below:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Amit (I-M):</speaker>
<p>We are sitting here around the table and eh, (short pause) we portray ourselves as uh, peace activists. And we really<italic> do nothing</italic>.<sup>

<speech>
<speaker>You have to decide what you want. If you want to distance you from the, the Evil Axis, this is the opportunity. If not, you will remain with them, and you will suffer with them.

<p>YEAH. (short pause) I said, I said, (short pause) where is the bucket right now?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sagi (I-M):</speaker>
<p>This is the mirror image.</p>
<p>[Participants are heard laughing]</p>
</speech>
<p>Amit’s (I-M) statement is a clear ascription of blame to the Palestinians for the impasse in the peace process. By signing the Prisoner’s Document<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022002712448911">12</xref>
</sup> and releasing Gilad Shalit,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022002712448911">13</xref>
</sup> the Palestinians can “show the world” they are “willing and [a] partner” for peace and distance themselves from the “Evil Axis.” Here, finally, is a Jewish–Israeli participant behaving according to the norms. Amit (I-M) wants the group to stop all its <italic>talk</italic> about what the Americans and Syrians can do and focus on what needs to be done <italic>right now</italic>, and what needs to be done right now is up to the Palestinians. The implication of Amit’s (I-M) statement is that the responsibility for advancing the conflict (and the blame for its inertness) lies with the Palestinians, a discursive move encapsulated by his placement of the “bucket” in “the Palestinian arena.”</p>
<p>The response Amit’s (I-M) statement receives is emphatic. As soon as he finishes his statement, many group members, including Jewish–Israelis, begin to smirk. Mahmoud (P-M) immediately challenges Amit (I-M) to free occupied lands. Given that Mahmoud (P-M) is a Palestinian, this retort is expected and predicted by the literature. One instance of “ethnocentric talk” deserves another. But then Pierre (Int-M), an international participant, points out that Mahmoud (P-M) can give the same speech, a move that robs Amit’s (I-M) statement of its moral advantage. Then the group, <italic>both</italic> Jewish–Israelis and Palestinians, laughs at Amit (I-M). Amit (I-M) tries to clarify his statement, but Sagi (I-M) interrupts him to qualify his statement as a “mirror image.”</p>
<p>The “mirror image” is a term often used in conflict studies, which denotes a tendency of parties in conflict to have identical conceptions of themselves and the other side, usually taking some permutation of “we are the victims, and they are the aggressors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002712448911">Rouhana and Bar-Tal 1998</xref>). By qualifying Amit’s (I-M) statement as a conflict phenomenon, Sagi (I-M) strips Amit’s (I-M) statement of its argumentative power, transforming it into a mere manifestation of something that people in conflict do. For the coup de grace, the group laughs at Amit (I-M) once again.</p>
<p>Amit (I-M), it seems, has touched a nerve: a taboo against Jewish–Israelis blaming the Palestinians. After the previous statement, Amit (I-M) stays silent for an entire hour, but when he does speak again he receives a similar response:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Amit (I-M):</speaker>
<p>I said that there, the vacuum in the Palestinian entity. They could move and open the gate from within by the release of Gilad Shalit. It’s a <italic>very small item</italic> considering all the (short pause) strategic talking that we are talking about. This will open the gate for a ceasefire. This will open the gate for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. This will open the gate to negotiations.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nitzan (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Prisoners?</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Amit (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Prisoners as well, yes, sure. <italic>It is a promise</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>William (Int-M):</speaker>
<p>What happened?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nitzan (I-M):</speaker>
<p>Amots. I mean <italic>WE</italic> don’t like it, prisoners in Israel.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Amit (I-M):</speaker>
<p>No, no, I mean…</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sari (P-M):</speaker>
<p>No, eh, all these are very important…</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ido (I-M):</speaker>
<p>History (medium pause) the, the don’t let history always start (short pause) with the last event.</p>
<p>[Indiscernible comments, laughter and clapping heard from the participants]</p>
</speech>
<p>Amit’s (I-M) assertion that the release of Gilad Shalit will “open the gate” for a ceasefire, withdrawal from Gaza, negotiations, and prisoner releases is countered when Ido (I-M) comments that history does not always start with the last event, a devastating critique that challenges Amit’s (I-M) framing of events, upon which his blame ascription is based. The implication is that given a wider framing of events, the Palestinians are not wholly responsible for the current impasse, and it is not only up to them to “open the gate.” The group’s strong sentiments on this issue are best reflected in the fact that they actually clap for Ido (I-M), a rare occurrence in such a formal environment. The group’s responses to Amit’s (I-M) two statements, which should be the norm in Israeli–Palestinian dialogue, are easily the most vitriolic in the transcript. It is odd, then, that when the Palestinian participants blame Israel for the conflict, the Jewish–Israelis remain silent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022002712448911">
<title>Jewish–Israeli Acceptance of Blame</title>
<p>In contrast to the Jewish–Israelis, the Palestinians have no trouble whatsoever critiquing the other side. Consider the following excerpt:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Fadi (P-M):</speaker>
<p>It’s like smuggling. You are doing <italic>smuggling</italic> process. But you are not smuggling goods, you are smuggling problems. Where you are smuggling them? To the future. Instead of solving them, you decide to, to <italic>push them</italic> (short pause) forward, therefore, you are in, ah, ah except instead of your solving the problem, you are postponing solving the problems.</p>
<p>The Palestinian question I didn’t mention it, but it is . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ariel (I-M):</speaker>
<p>We want to leave something for our children . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Fadi (P-M):</speaker>
<p>BUT IT IS, BUT IT IS . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ariel (I-M):</speaker>
<p>We have to leave something for the children . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Fadi (P-M):</speaker>
<p>You see, is, it is, but the problem with <italic>this</italic> approach (short pause) that you leave the problems keep explode in your face in the future in more complicated way. You just postpone it, and it will explode later on in more complicated, so why not to face it (short pause) and to solve it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker> So I think</speaker>
<p>in cho, in order to be responsible (short pause) we should SHOUT LOUDLY, enough is enough and peace and control, (short pause) and let us try to be courageous to get to the peace of <italic>reconciliation</italic>, which, the, which INCLUDES (short pause) <italic>accepted</italic> the other, eh, clearly, accepting the other (short pause) <italic>dealing</italic> with the other according their <italic>needs</italic>, not according to (short pause) arrogant positions (short pause) and ideas of dominance and control.</p>
</speech>
<p>Fadi’s (P-M) critique comes in the middle of one of the longest speeches in the transcript. He has, by the point the above excerpt starts, denounced Israel for its actions in Lebanon, the Golan Heights, Gaza, Jordan, and Egypt, a sweeping critique that spans over forty years of government policy. Fadi’s (P-M) argument shows that Israeli actions have continually stoked the fires of conflict and that the peace Israel wants can be characterized as a “peace of control,” as opposed to a “peace of reconciliation.” Such sweeping arguments are found in several instances and in several forms throughout the transcript. Mahdi (P-M), for example, blames Israel for being at the root of all problems in the Middle East. Nabil (P-M) blames Israel for continually negotiating in bad faith, and Mahmoud (P-M) points to continual Israeli deceptiveness in managing the conflict.</p>
<p>Such damning accusations should, according to Kelman and Cohen’s norms, provoke a round of mutual recriminations, yet in line with Hypothesis 2b, the observed Jewish–Israelis fail to object to the accusations. The group does not respond to Fadi’s (P-M) critique (and other sweeping Palestinian critiques) in the same way that they responded to Amit’s (I-M). No one tells Fadi (P-M) that the Israelis can show similar intergenerational faults in Palestinian policy on the conflict, and nobody laughs at him. The closest thing to an argument that the Jewish–Israelis put forth is Ariel’s (I-M) joke in the previous excerpt, which is, at best, a mitigated attack against Fadi’s (P-M) argument.</p>
<p>In fact, throughout the daylong workshop, there is only one instance in which the group challenges a Palestinian who blames Israel, and it seems to be the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<speech>

<p>Mahmoud’s (P-M) statement refers to Israeli actions in Lebanon during the Second Lebanon War. There are two important aspects to note in the responses he receives. The first is that his statement is countered by both a Jewish–Israeli and a Palestinian and not, as the literature would predict, by the former alone. The second and more noteworthy aspect is that the group does not challenge the validity of what Mahmoud (P-M) is saying, but rather the suitability of his comments in the context of “<italic>this</italic> group.” Other Jewish–Israelis might deserve to hear Mahmoud’s (P-M) condemnations, but not the ones in this group, who are somehow different. That difference, we argue, is membership in the peacecamp. In the following section, we will use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712448911">Tajfel and Turner’s (1986)</xref> Social Identity Theory to understand the ways in which the salience of the peacecamp identity engenders the participants’ norm-defying behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022002712448911">
<title>The Peacecamp Identity and Jewish–Israeli Acceptance of Blame </title>
<p>Through the paradigm of social identity, the counterethnocentric tendency of the observed Jewish–Israelis to critique their own government can be understood as a process of creating positive ingroup distinctiveness through favorable comparison with an outgroup. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712448911">Crisp, Stone, and Hall (2006</xref>, 231) describe this process as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Individuals, by virtue of their affiliation, will have higher self-esteem when their ingroup is evaluated positively. The self-evaluative benefits of being a member of a positively valued group will thus motivate comparisons between the ingroup and outgroup that favor the former.</p>
</disp-quote> To understand how attacking their own government creates positive ingroup distinctiveness for the Jewish–Israeli participants, one needs to look no further than the basis of their comparison. Consider the following three excerpts:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ely (I-M):</speaker>
<p>I am TELLING you as an ISRAELI, there is no Israeli partner.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Irit (I-F):</speaker>
<p>Uhm, I don’t see where it’s the Palestinians’ initiative that’s, that’s, that’s I mean, I mean, you know, Abu Mazen been talking for year, he, he keeps pleading for negotiations, I mean, it’s <italic>Israel</italic> that has not given, not agreed to negotiations.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Amots (I-M):</speaker>
<p> Olmert’s been (short pause) sitting the Prime Minster’s Office for seven months now (short pause) <italic>saying</italic> that he’s going to meet Abu Mazen.  He met him (short pause) by chance (short pause) in Jordan.  <italic>There has not been any</italic> eh, eh (short pause) determination on the Israeli side.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sari (P-M):</speaker>
<p>And they are (short pause) five minutes apart.</p>
</speech>
<p>Each of these statements critiques Israel for the same fault: an inability or disinclination to discuss peace with the Palestinians or, in other words, failing to do exactly what the Jewish–Israeli participants are doing by attending the meeting. By critiquing their own governments’ failure to dialogue, the observed Jewish–Israelis differentiate themselves from their leadership. They, in contrast to the government, are willing to talk and willing to make peace.</p>
<p>This comparison also explains why the Jewish–Israeli participants so willingly accept strong critiques of their government from the Palestinians. Attacks against the Israeli government do not threaten the Jewish–Israeli participants because their salient peacecamp identity is defined <italic>against</italic> their national identity. The majority of the Palestinians in the room are keenly aware of this distinction. They know that the Jewish–Israelis do not support the policies of their government, which is exactly why Nabil (P-M) stops Mahmoud’s (P-M) charges of Israeli “demolishing, destructing, and killing” by telling him, “There’s nothing to relate to <italic>this</italic> group” (emphasis added). There is no reason for the Palestinians to recite atrocities; the Jewish–Israelis are already opposed to their government.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Amit’s (I-M) ascription of blame to the Palestinians, which corresponds far too closely to government positions, blurs the Jewish–Israeli participants’ positive distinctiveness and is, therefore, rigorously refuted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022002712448911">
<title>The Peacecamp Identity and Jewish–Israeli Rejection of Blaming the Palestinians</title>
<p>Amit’s two critiques are the only instances of a Jewish–Israeli blaming Palestinians and, as such, they deviate from the pattern established by other group members. Social identity theory tends to analyze deviance in terms of group norms, which are “regularities in attitudes and behavior that characterize a social group and differentiate it from other social groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448911">Hogg and Reid 2006</xref>, 8). Social Identity Theory (SIT) literature explains responses to norm violations in the following manner:<disp-quote>
<p>Ingroup members attend to prescriptive norms so as to ensure consensus on criteria for positive ingroup evaluation. The value of ingroup consensus is often made all the more real when a member breaks ranks or deviates from the group norm. Salient variations from prescriptive norms are therefore very likely to induce active regulation of the subjective image of the group. Specifically, because group members are motivated to preserve the subjective validity of their group’s norms, they will wish to correct or remove challenges to that norm within the group, and to gather evidence from outside the group to bolster the ingroup norm. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712448911">Abrams et al. 2005, 167)</xref>
</p>
</disp-quote> The group’s correction of Amit’s (I-M) deviation is accomplished by abstracting his argument as a response typical of parties in conflict, by pointing out that his statement is entirely relative to his point of view, and, not to be forgotten, by laughing at him. Through the lens of SIT, the biggest problem for the Jewish–Israeli members of the group with Amit’s (I-M) statement is not its content, but rather the danger it poses to the way the Palestinian group members perceive them. Amit’s (I-M) statement is consistent with the views of more mainstream Israelis, the kind widely documented in the literature on intergroup dialogue. If the Jewish–Israelis fail to challenge his statement, their silence may be viewed as acquiescence or even agreement with a viewpoint that contradicts that of the peacecamp. This is why the group responds in a way that not only refutes Amit’s (I-M) argument but denigrates him as well. Amit’s (I-M) statement, which in other dialogue groups would have been supported by his fellow Jewish–Israelis, is, in this context, a catalyst for his own ostracism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Before exploring our potential contributions to the common ingroup model and track two diplomacy, it is worth reminding the reader of the study’s limitations. Chiefly, our findings are based on a single case study, albeit verified by the authors’ experience in over thirty other track two workshops. Our conclusions would benefit from additional transcript-based analyses of track two workshops, preferably in different conflicts.</p>
<p>Further, because our sample excludes participants with extreme political viewpoints, our findings may not be generalizable to the more militant factions of populations, who would not participate in track two diplomacy workshops. This limitation is, unfortunately, inherent in any study looking at the emergence of superordinate identities in settings of protracted conflict. For those who hold extreme viewpoints, the act of talking—let alone negotiating—with the other side can easily be construed as fraternizing with the enemy. This risk is amplified in the context of track two diplomacy, which utilizes elite participants who are often highly sensitive to public or institutional support. These risks make it difficult for conflict-resolution interventions to recruit participants with extreme political viewpoints and, by extension, limit participation to the liberals and moderates on both sides. In the Israeli–Palestinian case, that amounts to the 50 to 70 percent on both sides that support the two-state solution to the conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022002712448911">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, the present study cannot rule out alternative explanations for our findings. For example, it may be that opinions and attitudes expressed by the participants during the discussion are, at least to some extent, a product of social desirability and reflect compliance with the salient, perceived social norms of the communicative situation: a track two workshop that emphasizes Israeli–Palestinian cooperation and striving for peace. Future studies should use additional research tools, such as before and after attitude measures and interviews with participants, to more clearly assess attitudes, opinions, and attitude change associated with participation in track two discussions and their saliency outside of the track two context.</p>
<p>That being said, it should not be forgotten that the present study offers the first empirically documented evidence for the creation of a common in group identity between groups in protracted conflict. As such, the study offers important insights into the mechanisms and practices that give rise to common in group identities in conflict settings as well as practical lessons regarding their effectiveness in promoting conflict resolution.</p>
<sec id="section21-0022002712448911">
<title>Practical Implications of the Superordinate Peacecamp Identity for Track Two Diplomacy</title>
<p>As mentioned in the literature review, much of what has been written about track two diplomacy focuses on the processes and procedures that such workshops utilize and on the conditions for their effectiveness. One aspect of that focus, which Herbert Kelman has written about extensively, is the selection of workshop participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712448911">Kelman and Cohen 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022002712448911">Rouhana and Kelman 1994</xref>; Kelman 1998, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712448911">2002</xref>). Kelman envisioned the track two workshop as a “process of forming a coalition across the conflict line—a coalition between those elements on each side that are interested in a negotiated solution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712448911">Kelman 2002</xref>, 95). However, Kelman also warned that if the coalition became overly cohesive, “it would undermine the whole purpose of the enterprise: to have an impact on the political decisions within the two communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712448911">Kelman 2002</xref>, 95). To this end, he proclaimed that “such a coalition must of necessity remain an uneasy coalition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712448911">Kelman 2002</xref>, 95). Kelman specifies:<disp-quote>
<p>It is important for the participants to develop a considerable degree of working trust in order to engage in joint problem solving, to devise direct or tacit collaborative efforts for overcoming constraints against negotiation, and to become convinced that there are potential negotiating partners on the other side. This trust, however, must not be allowed to turn into excessive camaraderie transcending the conflict, lest the participants lose their credibility and their potential political influence once they return to their home communities. Workshops can be seen as part of a process of building coalitions across the conflict line, but the coalitions must remain uneasy ones that do not threaten members’ relationships to their own identity groups. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712448911">Kelman 2002</xref>, 90)</p>
</disp-quote> Kelman’s words, based on his concerns of what <italic>might</italic> happen should members of the peacecamp engage in track two diplomacy, are empirically verified by this study. The participants do indeed form an easy coalition. They place primary importance on agreement and compromise at the expense of their national identities. Consequently, the participants are indeed able to agree on highly contentious issues, but their agreement is more the product of abandoning, not reconciling, the conflicting national interests of their respective leaderships.</p>
<p>It seems, thus, that if track two diplomacy is to influence top leaderships, it must engage people who are not only elites, but close to the leaderships and able to identify with their thinking. It must engage participants with salient national identities. By including a large number of peacecamp elites, who form an easy coalition, track two workshops have an easier time producing mutually agreeable solutions, but those it does produce are, in the end, far less valuable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0022002712448911">
<title>Theoretical Implications of the Superordinate Peacecamp Identity for the Common Ingroup Model</title>
<p>It is perhaps because the power of superordinate identities to reduce intergroup bias had been so widely substantiated that Gaertner and Dovidio viewed its implementation in conflict zones as a challenge of “practical engineering.” They questioned not <italic>whether</italic> the superordinate identity could mitigate conflict, but <italic>how</italic>. The mechanism by which superordinate identities reduce intergroup bias is “positive ingroup bias,” or a tendency for people to “evaluate ingroup members more favorably than outgroup members and allocate more rewards to members of the ingroup than to the outgroup” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712448911">Crocker and Luhtanen 1990</xref>). By creating a superordinate identity, former outgroup members are included in a new ingroup, thereby exposing them to positive ingroup bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712448911">Gaertner, Dovidio, and Bachman 1996</xref>). Among the participants in the workshop, the formation of a superordinate identity may well have reduced negative interpersonal bias, but beyond the group’s borders, the opposite is likely the case. Because the positive distinctiveness of peacecamp members is created through favorable comparisons with the Israeli government, the participating Jewish–Israelis are less able to both produce and deliver recommendations that are relevant to their leaderships. They are effectively left less effective in mitigating conflict.</p>
<p>This study shows that superordinate identities between conflicting groups can indeed be formed in track two workshops, but having answered the<italic> how</italic> we are compelled to return to the assumed <italic>should.</italic>Reducing bias does not necessarily reduce conflict, and in the context of track two diplomacy, it seems that one comes at the expense of the other. Our study thus makes an important theoretical contribution to understanding the limits of the superordinate identity’s utility in the context of intractable conflict. Our findings indicate that, paradoxically, a salient superordinate identity seriously handicaps the ability of track two participants to represent the needs and demands of their publics and leaderships.</p>
<p>Given the prevalence of track two workshops and the scarcity of systematic research on the processes occurring within them, our study offers an important contribution to the field. Having conducted a detailed analysis of an actual transcript of track two discussions, we have been able to trace and identify some of the mechanisms and practices that opposing groups in conflict zones use to establish a superordinate identity. We have also uncovered dilemmas elicited by the adoption of a superordinate identity in situations of realistic political conflict. We have shown, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712448911">Pettigrew (1998</xref>) hoped, that track two workshops can indeed serve as “laboratories and as a setting for direct interaction . . . initiating coalitions of peace-minded participants across conflict lines.” Yet there is a danger in overly cohesive coalitions. When participants form a common ingroup identity, their ability to influence their leaderships and the course of their conflict is seriously impaired. And when participants cannot influence their leaderships, the track two workshop risks remaining <italic>merely</italic> a laboratory.</p>

<p>Throughout this study comparisons are drawn between Israel and the Palestinians, not Palestine. This reflects the terminology used by the participants in this study and the fact that the Palestinians do not, at present, have an independent state. Consequently, “Israel” sometimes refers to the Israeli government and sometimes to Israelis (usually Jewish–Israelis), depending on the context. The government of Palestine is always referred to as the Palestinian Authority, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip are either referred to by name or as the Palestinian Territories.</p>
