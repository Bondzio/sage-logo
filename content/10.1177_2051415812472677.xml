<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Despite a substantial body of literature on prisoner health and the management of specific conditions that affect incarcerated persons, there remains a paucity of data pertaining to the specific urological needs of prisoners. Additionally, no study has documented the impact of prison referrals on a department of urology.</p>

<sec id="section3-2051415812472677">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 77 clinical encounters were made by 47 detained patients from seven different institutions over 12 months. All patients were male.

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The presence of several places of detention impacts significantly on a department’s workload. Management of persons detained under Home Office Licence in a general hospital poses several challenges, including confidentiality and security issues, privacy and patient concerns and prison personnel secondments. The transient nature of the prisoner population can pose difficulties for planned admissions and outpatient follow-up.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are approximately 90,236 people incarcerated in the United Kingdom (UK) in 139 correctional institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415812472677">1</xref></sup> Each of these has healthcare requirements, and the increasing prison population places demands on an already resource-conscious National Health Service. The incarcerated population is not representative of the general population and is typically between the ages of 15 and 44 years, poorly educated and from lower socioeconomic groups with significantly higher rates of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415812472677">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415812472677">3</xref></sup> Some of the medical problems that prisoners develop may be as a result of incarceration itself: The nature of confinement assists in the spread of infectious diseases, with pulmonary tuberculosis being a primary example,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415812472677">4</xref></sup> Intravenous drug use and needle sharing is endemic in the prison population and assists in the transmission of hepatitis C (with a prevalence of 30%) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415812472677">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415812472677">6</xref></sup> Further work has commented on specific aspects of prisoner health, such as burns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415812472677">7</xref></sup> the difficulties faced by geronotological prisoners,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472677">8</xref></sup> and the management of prisoners with hepatitis C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415812472677">9</xref></sup> Mental illness affects between 26% and 63% of UK prisoners and can pose problems with treatment compliance for non- psychiatric conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415812472677">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415812472677">11</xref></sup> Although previous studies have reported on the impact of diverse topics on current urological practice such as outpatient nonattenders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415812472677">12</xref></sup> and inpatient referral patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472677">13</xref></sup> there is no published work specifically pertaining to the urological needs of prisoners or the impact of prison referrals on a urological service. The aim of this study, therefore, was to document the impact of prison referrals on a university hospital department of urology and to identify the range of urological complaints that affect the incarcerated population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A twelve-month prospective study was carried out in the department of urology of Aintree University Hospital recording all elective and emergency attendances by persons detained under Home Office Licence. A detailed proforma was devised by the lead author and completed on each detainee admission or attendance and specifically recorded (a) detainee demographics including referring institution, (b) nature of complaint, (c) whether an outpatient consultation or emergency admission took place, (d) whether an elective operation or endoscopic procedure occurred, (e) the total emergency operative workload undertaken and (f) miscellaneous data including new cancer diagnoses and the nonattendance rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2051415812472677">Table 1</xref>). The proforma was modified after an interim review. A clinical episode was defined as an outpatient consultation, an emergency admission (including emergency surgery), an elective admission for a main theatre case or genitourinary endoscopy. Attendance at radiology for a procedure was excluded as it did not come under the remit of a urological appointment. Repeat presentations were recorded. We also noted if patients had been previously investigated in other hospitals and whether the authorities had informed us of potential transfers prior to procedures being scheduled.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 47 detainees were referred to the department of urology and accounted for 77 clinical episodes during the 12-month study. All were male with an average age of 31.6 years. Seven prisons, including one category A place of detention and one special high-security psychiatry hospital, accounted for the referral base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051415812472677">Figure 1</xref>). Outpatient and elective interventions were required by 38 detainees (80.9%) whilst emergency admissions accounted for nine (19.1%). Eighteen separate presenting complaints were noted, including acute traumatic presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2051415812472677">Figure 2</xref>). Although acute admissions accounted for only nine patients in total, all required emergency surgery, representing 42.9% of all surgery undertaken on detained persons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051415812472677">Figure 3A</xref>). Elective surgical interventions were required in 12 cases, representing 57.1% of total operative procedures undertaken on detainees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051415812472677">Figure 3B</xref>). Only nine patients (19.1%) required outpatient endoscopy. Repeat presentations were more prevalent amongst patients from the high-security psychiatry hospital. A total of two patients re-presented six times following initial presentation. Surprisingly, each presentation was for the same clinical complaint: foreign body insertion. A separate detainee from a HMP institution (Her Majesty’s Prison) represented twice after emergency scrotal exploration with self-inflicted wound dehiscence requiring suturing under local anaesthetic by the urology team in the accident and emergency department. The most common reason for outpatient consultation was investigation of lower tract symptoms (13, 27.7%), followed by investigation of a scrotal mass (7, 14.9%). Two new bladder cancers were diagnosed during the study. Outpatient nonattendances accounted for six patients (12.8%), and one patient discharged himself against medical advice following an acute admission. No escape attempts were recorded during acute hospitalisation. Nine patients were listed for a procedure which did not take place during the 12-month study; all of these detained patients were assessed in the final months of the study and hence were admitted after the study closed. A total of four patients (8.5%) required repeat investigation by our department, having been referred by the prison medical services despite having undergone investigations in different hospitals while incarcerated in different prisons. This duplication was due to incomplete records being sent with the initial referral letter by the prison medical service. Only one notification of a prisoner transfer was sent to our department by a prison medical officer, enabling our institution to reorganise the theatre list schedule and cancel unnecessary outpatient investigations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies on prisoner health have demonstrated that prisoners have higher prevalence rates of a number of medical conditions when compared to the normal population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472677">14</xref></sup> Previous authors have examined disease prevalence amongst all new detainees admitted to places of detention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415812472677">15</xref></sup> while specific aspects of prisoner health, such as burns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415812472677">7</xref></sup> have been well documented. Previous year-long studies have looked at all nonobstetric, nonpsychiatric admissions from 11 prisons to a large medical centre and found that genitourinary diagnoses accounted for 12% of all admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051415812472677">16</xref></sup> However, to date, there is no published work specifically examining the urological needs of prisoners or the impact of prison referrals on a university hospital department of urology.</p>
<p>The management of a detained patient in an acute general hospital poses several challenges for the detainee and the physician. Periods of incarceration deny personal freedom. Obligatory dietary, sanitation and enforced recreation patterns in addition to unfavourable living conditions ensue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415812472677">2</xref></sup> All detainees in this study were supervised by at least two prison officers continuously. As a result, patient dignity during consultation and examination was compromised. Consequently, eliciting a salient history is frequently difficult as can be the physical examination of the restrained patient. The presence of a detained patient on a ward may alarm other patients and act as a source of anxiety for staff as they may assume that the detainee has a propensity for violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415812472677">3</xref></sup> However, previous authors have shown that the presence of prison officers can be reassuring for other patients and staff when dealing with violent offenders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415812472677">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, two patients from a high-security psychiatry institution were repeatedly hospitalised following urethral foreign-body insertion. Both represented within a short time of each other and soon after their initial presentation. This phenomenon has been well documented as it requires transfer of the detainee to a separate healthcare facility for management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051415812472677">17</xref></sup> All cases were managed with endoscopic retrieval alone. The impact of these repeated admissions was highlighted to the referring institution in an effort to curtail repeated admissions, as evidence suggests that the practice can disseminate among those detained in maximum-security hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051415812472677">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study all emergency admissions (9, 19.1%) required surgical intervention, representing 42.9% of all operative work performed on incarcerated persons. This is higher than the nonincarcerated population. Previous studies examining emergency urological admissions have demonstrated that only 5% require surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051415812472677">19</xref></sup> As illustrated by this work, the incidence of self-embedding behaviour and trauma is higher than the normal population and hence the amount of emergency urological procedures performed is reflected accordingly.</p>
<p>Investigation of a scrotal mass was the second most frequent outpatient referral, accounting for 14.9% of all referrals (seven patients). No new testicular tumours were identified. Rochester et al. have previously shown that 20% of referrals to a designated scrotal clinic were due to a scrotal mass with only one new tumour being diagnosed over two years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2051415812472677">20</xref></sup> The introduction of a one-stop testicular clinic reduced waiting time for outpatient ultrasound, and the majority of patients (79%) were found to have benign scrotal pathology20. The administrative and clinical challenges posed by incarcerated men with scrotal pathology in terms of initial assessment and repeat journeys for ultrasound remain inefficient as appointments are often missed. The difficulties are further compounded if prison transfers occur without the hospital being made aware as it leads to governance issues and inconsistencies in delivery of care. Ideally a one-stop clinic would suit this clinical condition as it would allow for clinical and radiological assessment of an incarcerated patient in one visit.</p>
<p>Length of stay was not recorded in this study and is one drawback of this work. Similarly, the cost of hospitalising one detainee with the associated security implications of employing two prison officers during the inpatient stay plus transportation costs are highly relevant from a health economic viewpoint and are a potential source of future work. Additionally, we did not record at the initial referral whether any primary-care guidelines had been instituted by the prison medical service for patients presenting with lower tract symptoms or whether patients had been referred on a two-week rule. When reviewing the data, this became apparent and highlighted the need for a standardised referral letter from the prison medical officer. Potentially, if a designated referral proforma stating (a) if urological investigations had been undertaken elsewhere and (b) if primary care guidelines had been instituted were used for all referrals, it could save time and permit a more integrated approach in caring for the incarcerated patient.</p>
<p>Here we have demonstrated the impact of surrounding prisons on a university hospital department of urology and identified the range of uropathological conditions that affects the incarcerated male. A total of 18 separate presenting complaints were documented during this study. A higher number of emergency surgical procedures were performed, and this represents a specific finding of this work when compared to the normal population. The transient nature of the prison population with short periods of incarceration, remand breaks and institutional transfers for long-stay offenders poses difficulties for delivery of care. As illustrated by this work, 8.5% of patients required investigations to be repeated on initial presentation to our department despite having undergone evaluation in different hospitals. This occurred because of incomplete transfer of prison medical records. Similarly, we were notified of only one transfer to a different geographical region, enabling us to adjust the waiting list. As the study progressed we made note if a newly referred patient was (a) due for imminent release and (b) of his regular general practitioner (GP) (if applicable). This was performed to facilitate continuity of care as the GP then received a copy of the clinic letter enabling him or her to be kept informed of any investigations. We believe this to be the first epidemiological study illustrating the impact and demographics of prison referrals on a urology department in a university hospital. Managing the urological requirements of incarcerated persons can impact significantly on a department. Designated hospitals within geographical proximity of prisons should liaise with prison medical and administrative personnel to ensure that detained patients receive adequate and timely medical care when transfer to an acute facility is required. Additionally, updating the patient’s regular GP “on the outside” of any hospital visits should be mandatory to enable ongoing care on release and to reduce unnecessary reinvestigation. Improving communication channels to facilitate prompt outpatient attendance, adequate documentation transfer and use of designated referral letters will assist in providing an improved service for detainees in the future.</p>
