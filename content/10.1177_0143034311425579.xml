<abstract>
<p>If educational psychologists wish to make a meaningful difference as practitioners, both to the children they work with and the ecologies these children come from, then, knowledge and application of resilience theory is crucial. Toland and Carrigan (2011) underscore this relationship in their 2011 article in this Journal. In our contribution below, we extend their assertion by urging greater attention to the interactive processes which underpin resilience and, more particularly, to how proximal, face-to-face transactions embedded in mesosystems and microsystems and nuanced by the distal, macrosystemic influences, mould resilience. Using examples from resilience research conducted in South Africa we argue that such a focus (i.e. on the transactional ecosystemic nature of resilience) is crucial in developing contexts. Furthermore, we contend that sensitivity to mechanisms of resilience as well as the contexts and cultures in which these continuously evolve, begs an approach to practice that foregrounds the ecosystemic, promotes child-ecology transactions, and is cautious about generalizing resilience theory to children across diverse contexts, cultures and time periods. To conceptualize resilience as anything but a reciprocal, dynamic, contextually-influenced interaction between children and their ecologies, would be to fail children in developing contexts.</p>

<p>The significance of resilience theory for educational psychology, and for schools as potential sources of health-enhancing or ‘promotive’ transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311425579">Sameroff, 2010</xref>, p. 14), is undeniable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland and Carrigan (2011)</xref> make this point articulately. In their article ‘Educational psychology and resilience: New concept, new opportunities’, Toland and Carrigan urge educational psychologists<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143034311425579">1</xref></sup> to adopt a resilience perspective as ‘guiding principle’ (p. 96) for their daily practice. Their argument is couched in recognition of Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological systems theory which has provided a theoretical foundation for much of resilience theory in the past four decades. Toland and Carrigan contend that this systemic underpinning offers educational psychologists opportunities to work both individually and systemically with young people in need.</p>
<p>World-wide, scholars and researchers recognize the crucial systemic role of educational psychologists in children’s positive adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311425579">Yeo &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>). This, despite the fact that the accessibility of educational psychologists varies dramatically across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311425579">Jimerson, Stewart, Skokut, Cardenas, &amp; Malone, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311425579">Cook, Jimerson, and Begeny (2010)</xref> report that high regard for, and access to, educational psychologists is more likely in developed societies, with stable economies and emancipated world views. Nevertheless, these professionals are considered, systemically, to be ideally positioned to affect positive change, both in and for the children they serve, and in the ecologies of these children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311425579">Cook et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311425579">Woods, Bond, Tyldesley, Farrell, &amp; Humphrey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311425579">Yeo &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>). As such, they are increasingly being urged to capitalize on their systemic connections to stimulate positive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald, Lazarus, &amp; Lolwana, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311425579">Woods et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311425579">Yeo &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As we note, Toland and Carrigan also recognize and value the systemic situatedness of educational psychologists, and relate the importance of resilience theory to these practitioners’ role as change agents. Nevertheless, whilst their argument is valuable for educational psychologists in both developed and developing/emerging contexts, it underplays the ‘transactional-ecological’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311425579">Felner, 2006</xref>, p. 125) nature of resilience. In so doing, the potential of resilience theory to promote educational psychologists’ role as change agents is limited. In this article, we shall argue that attention to the interactive, multi-level manoeuvres that encourage resilience offers additional opportunities for resilience theory to inform educational psychology practice. This is particularly relevant with regard to engaging young people in a more participatory manner: A practice which discourages negative medical-model assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311425579">Edwards, Mumford, &amp; Serra-Roldon, 2007</xref>) that children (defined as birth to 18 years of age) at risk are in need of rescue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we shall reason that attention to the ecological involves more than recognition of ‘contextually specific protective factors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland &amp; Carrigan, 2011</xref>, p. 103) or of microsystemic interactions alone. Recognizing resilience as an ecological phenomenon calls for acknowledgement of distal, macrosystemic (including cultural) influences. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311425579">Vygotsky (1978)</xref> pointed out, these influences, which shape resilience, are primarily transmitted through the proximal (or face-to-face) transactions that occur in both mesosystems and microsystems. Many of the resilience-promoting resources (informing the basic protective systems underpinning resilience) reported in classic Western studies can also be found in the stories of child resilience in emerging contexts. However, they are likely to be nuanced by the ecologies of these children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311425579">Masten &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311425579">Ungar et al., 2007</xref>). When viewed this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland and Carrigan’s (2011)</xref> reference to ‘global factors which protect the course of development and promote resilience’ (p. 99) offers limited understanding of the potential of resilience theory to inform educational psychologists’ practice in developing contexts. Thus, in the following article we draw on studies of South African youth resilience to foreground how interactive, ecologically embedded negotiations are crucial to the conceptualization of resilience. Equally, we urge cautious generalization of Eurocentric resilience research findings to young people in Africentric, and other developing contexts. Finally, we offer further implications for educational psychology, based on this ‘transactional-ecological’ conceptualization of resilience.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0143034311425579"><title>Resilience-promoting transactions</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland and Carrigan (2011)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311425579">Masten &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>) have reported, the conceptualization of resilience evolved from initial understandings of individual indomitability to recognition that resilience is rooted in complex and dynamic processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311425579">Masten (2001)</xref> taught us that these processes are embedded in ‘basic human adaptational systems’ (p. 227). Typically such protective systems refer to the systems of attachment, agency and mastery, intelligence (or competent neural executive functioning), self regulation, and meaning-making. These processes operate not only at the individual level but also, as made clear by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311425579">Felner (2006)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311425579">Greene &amp; Livingston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311425579">Wright &amp; Masten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar, 2011</xref>), through transactions within and between interactive social systems in the ecology of the particular social context in which the individual is a part. Thus, where school-age children are concerned, such systems characteristically include the family, the classroom, the school, the peer group, the neighbourhood or local community and, ultimately, the whole society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald et al., 2010</xref>). All of these offer opportunity for meaningful attachment, mastery, adaptive meaning making, self-regulation, and problem-solving. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald et al. (2010)</xref> have argued, an understanding of how these ecological transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311425579">Sameroff, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311425579">2010</xref>) typically occur also needs to be understood, and acted upon, in terms of systems theory (i.e. ‘ecosystemically’). This is essential if the interventions of teachers—and by implication, educational psychologists—with children at risk are to be effective [Burden and others built substantively upon this understanding in relation to the practice of educational psychologists some time ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311425579">Burden, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311425579">Burden &amp; Hornby, 1989</xref>); this work is as relevant today as it was then]. Precisely because of such an ecosystemic understanding, researchers and scholars have begun to caution that resilience promoting processes should not be assumed to hold true for children across diverse contexts and cultures. This point has consistently been made by, inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311425579">Clauss-Ehlers (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311425579">Masten and Wright (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311425579">Wright and Masten (2006)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311425579">Ungar (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311425579">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">2011</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311425579">Veeran and Morgan (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>As noted above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311425579">Felner (2006)</xref> has suggested a ‘transactional-ecological approach’ (p. 125) to understanding the process of resilience. In essence, this understanding relies on a synthesis of Bronfenbrenner’s theory of human development as ecologically situated, and on Sameroff’s theory of human development as ‘the product of the continuous dynamic interactions of the child and the experience provided by his or her social settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311425579">Sameroff, 2010</xref>, p. 16). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311425579">Sameroff (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311425579">2010</xref>) emphasizes that transactions involve multilevel exchanges, including those with cultural conventions.</p>
<p>Recent definitions of resilience reflect the above-mentioned transactional-ecological synthesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311425579">Lerner (2006)</xref> characterized resilience as positive ‘bi-directional person←→context exchanges’ (p. 40). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311425579">Ungar (2008</xref>, p. 225) defined resilience as ‘both the capacity of individuals to navigate their way to health-sustaining resources, including opportunities to experience feelings of well-being, and a condition of the individual’s family, community and culture to provide these health resources and experiences in culturally meaningful ways’. From this, it is clear that an outcome of resilience is contingent on a process that involves reciprocal <italic>transactions</italic> between children (who ‘navigate’ and/or ‘negotiate’) and their <italic>ecologies</italic> (which ‘provide’).</p>
<p>Even more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar (2011)</xref> has suggested that, in understanding outcomes of resilience, more attention should be paid to the ecologies in which young people achieve resilience. His emphasis of the environmental roots of child-resilience calls for shifting focus away from children (and implicitly and unfairly holding individual children responsible when resilience is <italic>not</italic> achieved; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311425579">Rutter, 2005</xref>) towards what ecologies can and should do to potentiate resilience. Toland and Carrigan’s recommendation to avoid the term ‘resilient children’ (p. 97) aligns well with Ungar’s decentralization of the child when resilience is conceptualized more ecologically. Additionally, an ecologically focused understanding of resilience cautions against a generic explanation, let alone prediction, of the pathways to resilience because it recognizes the complexities of any given system. Equally, by accentuating the influence of an ecology, atypical routes to resilience are more readily understandable. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311425579">Donald, Wallis and Cockburn’s (1997)</xref> reporting of resilient ex-street children resisting authoritarian adult regulation, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311425579">Malindi and Theron’s (2010)</xref> reporting of begging as pivotal to street children’s positive growth, might at first glance seem inappropriate protective resources. Nevertheless, when the contexts of these street youth are factored in, these behaviours can be interpreted as active agency which, in particular, facilitated street youth fortitude in their social ecology. Finally, interpreting resilience as an ecological phenomenon facilitates emphasis on the cultural variability of what it means to grow up positively in contexts of risk, and how this might be achieved.</p>
<p>Thus, the case for focusing more strongly on the ‘social ecology of resilience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar, 2011</xref>, p. 1) urges educational psychologists towards reflection on the impact of ecology on the transactions that facilitate resilience. This nested give-and-take is crucial to an understanding of how resilience might inform educational psychology practice.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0143034311425579"><title>Resilience research in South Africa</title>
<p>To illustrate how ecologies inform the pathways to resilience, we turn now to studies of resilience in South Africa. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron and Theron (2010)</xref> provided a desk-top review of South African studies of resilience conducted between 1990 and 2008. This synthesis of the resources reported to encourage resilience in South African youth correlates to a large extent with the intra- and interpersonal protective resources reported in classic, international studies of resilient youth. For example, as in studies reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311425579">Kumpfer (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311425579">Wright and Masten (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311425579">Werner (2006)</xref>, South African studies of youth resilience reported, amongst others, positive personality traits, problem-solving skills, self-worth, constructive parenting practices, supportive families, health-promoting schools and teachers, supportive peers, and religious faith as protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Theron, 2010</xref>). All of these factors underpin, in varying combinations, protective systems like attachment, mastery, self-regulation, meaning-making, and cognitive development leading to intelligent behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311425579">Masten &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>). However, this review, and subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311425579">Malindi &amp; Theron, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311425579">Phasha, 2010</xref>; Theron, Cameron, Didkowsky, Lau, Liebenberg, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Dunn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Malindi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar, Theron, &amp; Didkowsky, 2011</xref>) also highlight the ecologically-embedded, interactive nature of resilience-promoting processes.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311425579">Phasha’s study (2010)</xref> with 22 (mostly Black) survivors of sexual abuse foregrounded culturally traditional child-rearing practices, valuing of education, and philosophy in the processes that encouraged their resilience. These culturally traditional factors facilitated adaptive meaning-making of the trauma, regulation of behaviour and eventual mastery (whilst not necessarily related explicitly to resilience, all of these factors are also noted by several authors in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311425579">Nsamenang and Tchombe, 2011</xref>). A second example relates to a qualitative study with Black street youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Malindi, 2010</xref>). In their theorizing on street youth resilience, they reflect on the influence of the sociopolitical history of South Africa on their participants’ capacity for stoicism and subsequent resilience-promoting meaning making, self regulation, problem solving, and mastery. Stoicism is not reported as a pathway to resilience in North American or European studies of resilience. Similarly, in their visual work with two Black youths from a South African township, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311425579">Theron et al. (2011)</xref> reported that African kinship practices were instrumental to the resilience-promoting attachments of orphaned young people. In the South African case studies offered, it was clear that extended family acceptance mediated risk, rather than resources like a close bond with a primary caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311425579">Werner, 2006</xref>) or involved and/or educated parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311425579">Wright &amp; Masten, 2006</xref>). Equally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311425579">Ungar et al. (2011)</xref> theorized that in majority world settings, including South Africa, youth resilience is shaped by community and cultural mores governing acceptable youth contributions to family survival, including youth employment and sharing in family chores. In the case of the South African youth, these culturally traditional mores were informed by Ubuntu and ‘family community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311425579">Mkhize, 2006</xref>, p. 187). Thus, culture informed mastery experiences.</p>
<p>In these accounts of resilience, the pathways of resilient Black South African young people were informed by their being part of macrosystems that subscribed to culturally traditional practices and beliefs, and by their belonging to microsystems and having access to exosystems that also endorsed such practices and beliefs. We accept that the cultural values, beliefs and practices that encouraged their resilience were fashioned by the current, proximal face-to-face social interactions they experienced. Since culture is fluid, this implies that these protective processes may not be assumed absolute or true for all time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311425579">Lee, 2010</xref>). Equally, as South African ecologies are altered by social crises (see, for example, the report of the psychological, sexual and other risks experienced by vulnerable children in child-headed households—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay, 2011</xref>), changed or novel, context-specific protective processes may emerge. Nevertheless, the cultural embeddedness of the Black youth in the South African studies, as referred to above, differentiates their pathways to resilience from those reported for youth in Europe or North-America or other contexts which more commonly inform classic resilience research (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311425579">Kumpfer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311425579">Wright &amp; Masten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311425579">Werner, 2006</xref>). Although it is true that there are generic resilience-promoting resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311425579">Wright &amp; Masten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311425579">Werner, 2006</xref>), these South African studies illustrate that such resources are nuanced by local history, indigenous practices and beliefs at a given point in time.</p>
<p>In addition to South African studies situating resilience processes within culturally traditional practices and philosophies and thereby illustrating the power of ecology in the processes of resilience, these studies report resilience as a transactional phenomenon. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311425579">Phasha’s study (2010)</xref> positioned young women as actively interpreting their rape experiences as temporary or as a learning experience. In addition, some of these young women negotiated for support from teachers and/or friends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311425579">Malindi and Theron (2010)</xref> reported that resilient street youth approached social workers, adults at shelters, and other street youth for food, clothing, support and guidance and their actions were reciprocated by these people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311425579">Theron et al. (2011)</xref> filmed a male participant walking to his cousin’s house in a bid to get food and advice. His cousin responded positively. There were also incidents of his peers, teachers, and neighbours becoming aware of his hunger and need, and supporting him. Thus, the South African studies of resilience report active transactions that encourage resilience [including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311425579">Donald and Clacherty’s (2005)</xref> observations reported below]. Specifically, in the aforementioned studies, youth are not scripted as victims or as passive recipients of interventions or other support. Rather, youth resilience is related in part to their agency and willingness to steer towards supportive resources or to bargain for these. Simultaneously, youth resilience is related in part to positive responses to their manoeuvres for support.</p>
<p>In summary, recent resilience research in South Africa flags the soundness of conceptualizing resilience as a person-context transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311425579">Lerner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311425579">Sameroff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Theron, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311425579">Ungar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar, 2011</xref>); it also signposts the danger of assuming that the roots of resilience are standard across ecologies.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143034311425579"><title>Implications for educational psychology in developing contexts</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland and Carrigan (2011)</xref> proposed that resilience theory should inform the core functions of an educational psychologist. Their proposals recognize the resilience-promoting potential of schools and of the systemic underpinnings of resilience processes. These include assessing for multilevel resources that could potentially encourage youth resilience; designing and executing interventions that decrease risk and increase adaptive processes; consulting with, and educating, schools and other community systems about their potential to function as resilience-promoting or ‘promotive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311425579">Sameroff, 2010</xref>, p. 14) resources; and conducting research into context-specific protective factors. These are valuable proposals. However, when resilience is conceptualized as an ecosystemic, transactional phenomenon, there are additional implications for educational psychologists, particularly in developing contexts.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0143034311425579"><title>An ecosystemic approach to practice</title>
<p>The call for a systemic, or ecosystemic, approach to the practice of educational psychology, and the relevance of resilience theory within this, is not a ‘new concept’ as implied in the title of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland and Carrigan’s article (2011)</xref>. With reference to the section on ‘Resilience-promoting transactions’ above, an ecosystemic approach to practice has further been promoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311425579">Edwards et al. (2007)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311425579">Käser (1993)</xref>, in this Journal. In addition, in relation to the practice of teachers—with whom educational psychologists clearly have to work closely—it has been explicitly developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311425579">Donald, Lazarus, and Lolwana from their first edition (1997)</xref> through to their fourth edition (2010; <italic>Educational psychology in social context: Ecosystemic applications in Southern Africa</italic>) as a theoretical perspective which is essential to understanding the nexus of ecological systems through which teachers’/educational psychologists’ resilience-promoting interventions need to take place. More recently, this approach has been further developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311425579">Woods et al. (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311425579">Yeo and Choi (2011)</xref>, also in this Journal.</p>
<p>It is also not an approach that is limited to developed countries. For example, in their study of youth suicide in South Korea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311425579">Lee, Hong, and Espelage (2010)</xref> called for ‘development of effective prevention and intervention strategies that address the individual psychological characteristics within larger contexts that youth are embedded in … families, peers, schools and communities’ (p. 541). Likewise, when resilience is understood as an ecological-transactional phenomenon, the ecosystemic approach which flows from this urges practitioners towards multilevel assessment, intervention, and prevention that are sensitive to how <italic>all</italic> levels of a young person’s social context (including sub-systems within systems) nurture and/or hinder resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, this approach urges particular attention to proximal or face-to-face systemic influences on resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311425579">Felner, 2006</xref>). In a developing context, this feature calls for appreciation of what local or unique resources—in addition to the generic or ‘global’ ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland &amp; Carrigan, 2011</xref>, p. 99)—enable young people to thrive. Thus, for example in an African context, this demands recognition of culturally traditional pathways to development and resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311425579">Marfo, Pence, LeVine, &amp; Levine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311425579">Phasha, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>More particularly, in developing contexts, an ecosystemic approach to practice calls for educational psychologists to ‘give away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311425579">Yeo &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>) their knowledge of how resilience might be encouraged. Such knowledge-sharing should be multilevel and promote an inclusive community of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311425579">Wenger, 1998</xref>). Thus, all stakeholders (e.g. children, parents/caregivers, teachers and other professionals involved with children, NGOs, faith-based organizations, and government) may learn not only how to promote resilience in ecosystemically relevant ways, but also to refine and extend what is known. In this way resilience theory will affect change, but more importantly, it will also evolve, to reflect and better serve a given ecosystem.</p>
<p>Most specifically, given educational psychologists’ involvement in, and access to, school contexts, an ecosystemic approach to practice encourages intimate, developmental teacher-psychologist collaboration. South African (Phasha, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Engelbrecht, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Malindi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Theron, 2010</xref>) and international reviews and/or studies of resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311425579">Masten &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311425579">Rutter, Maughan, Mortimore, &amp; Ouston, 1979</xref>) foreground the crucial roles teachers play in children’s positive adjustment to hardship. Educational psychologists need to share this knowledge with teachers, as well as support them in championing resilience purposefully in children placed at risk by the systems in which they are growing up. For example, this process can be facilitated via professional developmental programmes, workshops, literature written for teachers, informal contact, and/or mentorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311425579">Deb &amp; Walsh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311425579">Woods et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034311425579"><title>A transactional approach to practice</title>
<p>The process of resilience hinges on inputs from both children and their ecologies. This implies that when educational psychologists transact with children, their approach should position children as agentic. Children battling the odds in developing contexts have provided rich evidence of their active agency. For example, in a study that compared AIDS orphans as heads of households with eldest children in adult-headed households, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311425579">Donald and Clacherty (2005)</xref> found that several of the significant differences between the two groups were directly related to coping and interpersonal strategies in the former. The strategies of the orphans clearly illustrated an internal (<italic>agentic</italic>) versus an external (<italic>non-agentic</italic>) locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311425579">Rotter, 1966</xref>). This led to more actively initiated transactions (e.g. social networking for support) within their specific social ecology. As stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311425579">Donald et al. (2010</xref>, p. 268), such strengths could be used to facilitate resilience with all AIDS orphans and not only child heads-of-households. However, such facilitation requires that educational psychologists recognize a child’s potential to take action and steer towards support. One way of doing this is to work in a participatory manner that affords children ‘voice’ and opportunity to co-direct resilience-promoting transactions within their ecologies. So, although as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar (2011)</xref> argues, our actions should decenter children (by including ecological roleplayers as co-constructors of children’s resilience), such decentering should not script children to passivity in resilience-promoting transactions. Simply put, <italic>a transactional approach to practice would not cast children as victims in need of professional rescue</italic>.</p>
<p>At the same time, a transactional approach recognizes that in developing contexts community-based resources might be scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311425579">Pillay, 2011</xref>). Moreover, in such contexts, children probably have restricted (if any) access to educational psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311425579">Jimerson et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, our role as educational psychologists is to advocate for families and community systems to co-transact towards resilience in an effort to augment accessible, protective community-based resources. In developing contexts where educational psychologists are an inaccessible, or infrequent, resource, family, and community resources could even substitute for professional resources. This suggests a consultative and educative role (as recommended by Toland &amp; Carrigan), but also a promotive one. As educational psychologists we need to promote the development of ecological champions of resilience. Thus, we need to mobilize as available for children those parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, teachers, sports coaches, religious figures, elders, local older children and young adults <italic>who beat the odds</italic>. In fact, anyone who might co-transact meaningfully, and in culturally relevant ways, with children towards resilience could be mobilized.</p>
<p>Furthermore, educational psychologists need to advocate for schools as systems, particularly disadvantaged schools, to transact with those mentioned above towards their <italic>own</italic> resilience. Because educational psychologists collaborate closely with teachers, this presupposes a prime opportunity for the advocacy of teacher resilience too. In developing sub-Saharan African contexts this will demand sensitivity to, and support in relation to, HIV and AIDS-related challenges with which teachers and school communities grapple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311425579">Baxen, Wood, &amp; Austin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted at the outset of this article, the finding that developed societies (i.e. those where fundamental human rights have come to be explicitly valued) are more likely to provide access to school psychological services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311425579">Cook et al., 2010</xref>), motivates educational psychologists to encourage their ecologies towards respect for human rights. In other words, educational psychologists anywhere should transact to promote positive social change, not only because this is an ethical calling, but also because this potentiates improved access to psychological services for children made fragile by their ecologies.</p>
<p>Integral to a transactional approach to practice, is a freedom for educational psychologists to initiate resilience-promoting transactions. Given that resilience is embedded in bi-directional youth-ecology transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311425579">Lerner, 2006</xref>) school-based psychological service providers should respond to children’s overtures for support, but are simultaneously free to initiate transactions towards resilience promotion (the proviso, of course, is that these interventions do not immobilize children as co-transactors, and that interactions are culturally appropriate). In African contexts this would imply appealing to the widely held traditional cultural value of communalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311425579">Nsamenang &amp; Tchombe, 2011</xref>). In a study on how South African teachers promoted resilience of children placed at risk by a variety of microsystemic and macrosystemic adversities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311425579">Theron and Engelbrecht (in press)</xref> report that, at times, teachers instigated the resilience-promoting transaction, and that whilst these transactions often occurred across cultural groups (e.g. between White teachers and Black youth), they were congruent with the culture of the child. This example highlights the importance of respect for children’s cultural embeddedness and the salience of adults being free to initiate resilience-enabling processes. It also underscores the point made above, namely that <italic>a transactional approach to practice should include advocacy for school-based protective processes</italic>, <italic>given the rich potential of school ecologies to advance resilience</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, respect for the transactional nature of resilience processes urges educational psychologists to adopt research agendas that go beyond exploration of ‘contextually specific protective factors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311425579">Toland &amp; Carrigan, 2011</xref>, p. 103). Whilst we agree with Toland and Carrigan’s focus on protective factors indigenous to a given ecology, a transactional approach demands exploration of the protective <italic>processes</italic> that inform resilience, and how these are mediated by context and culture. For example, the South African studies of resilience we cite here illustrate how Black youths’ meaning-making (amongst other protective processes) facilitated resilience in contexts of ‘streetism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311425579">Donald et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311425579">Theron &amp; Malindi, 2010</xref>) and of sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311425579">Phasha, 2010</xref>). The process of making-meaning was supported by multilevel protective resources (like role-models, teachers, peers, youth tenacity, hope) and coloured by traditional beliefs and practices in the specific cultural communities concerned. Would the process be similar for youth surviving sexual abuse in other cultural communities in South Africa? Would youth in White or in ‘modernizing’ Black, middle-class communities, for example, make use of different processes, like attachment or mastery, to bounce back? Would their processes of resilience be rooted in identical, similar, or different protective resources?</p>
<p>Furthermore, a transactional approach to research calls for transformative participatory action research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311425579">Mertens, 2010</xref>). This approach positions the educational psychologist-researcher as a change agent who encourages dialogue with community members (also in the course of daily practice) and positions them as experts, particularly with regard to cultural knowledge. Together, the educational psychologist-researcher and community members then explore culturally-embedded protective processes. In this way, there is systemic opportunity for the educational psychologist-researcher to interpret stakeholders’ experiences (it would also circumvent the pragmatic limitations traditionally used to explain why practicing educational psychologists have little opportunity for research; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311425579">Atkinson, 2009</xref>). The ensuing knowledge would potentiate transactional pathways to resilience for children and their ecologies that inform both theory and practice. In essence, this approach ‘positions the school psychologist as a real world researcher and promotes … collaborative, inquiry based practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311425579">Atkinson, 2009</xref>, p. 251).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034311425579"><title>A cautious approach to practice</title>
<p>The final implication of conceptualizing resilience as an ecosystemic transactional phenomenon is a need for cautious practice. If resilience is nested in ecosystemic mechanisms, which by definition are fluid, then the resilience-promoting resources underpinning adaptational systems cannot be absolute across contexts or time. For example, as we note earlier, in South Africa, extended family practices offer opportunities for attachment, mastery, <italic>as well as</italic> other resilience-promoting processes. This is particularly true for Black children from culturally traditional communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311425579">Theron, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311425579">Theron et al., 2011</xref>). For how long will extended families continue to enable resilience, given the strain of the HIV and AIDS pandemic and how this factor (amongst others) is taxing extended family resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311425579">Wood &amp; Goba, 2011</xref>)? Will kinship practices continue to enable resilience for Black youth in urban spaces and from ‘modernizing’ families who are in the process of acculturating to middle-class Western culture?</p>
<p>Thus, understanding the changeableness of transactions within and between interactive social systems in the ecology of the particular social context in which the child is nested advises practitioner vigilance when designing or implementing preventions or interventions. It also demands flexible assessments and judicious consultation. Moreover, such a cautious approach encourages the educational psychologist to adopt a life-long researcher (rather than expert) approach in interactions with children and their ecologies.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034311425579" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As we have stressed, educational psychologists need to emphasize the bi-directional give-and-take that informs resilience and acknowledge that these transactions are nuanced by both proximal and distal systemic influences. In doing so, they are appreciating that to encourage resilience in their clients requires more than recognition of existing strengths and assets. They further appreciate that children, and their ecologies, need to co-direct their pathways to resilience, and that these pathways are constantly evolving. In developing contexts this is a particularly crucial perspective as superimposing what form children’s resilience should take, if based on non-local or dated studies, has the potential to immobilize children and their ecologies. Equally, cataloguing existing strengths, or urging the development of strengths, may, alone, not offer a viable pathway to resilience. This is not because developing ecologies are necessarily resource-poor. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311425579">Rutter (2005)</xref> noted, the presence of strengths, or protective resources, is no guarantee of resilience. Thus, an ecosystemic transactional understanding of resilience empowers children and their ecologies towards being co-responsible partners in efforts towards their wellness, in part because it advocates reciprocal transactions. This offers children and their ecologies opportunities to act in ways that are best suited to their current situatedness, even if these actions do not fit with Western or other normative expectations. In this way, children and their support systems become the experts. Too often, particularly in developing contexts, children are denied this opportunity, or their ecologies are considered non-authoritative and disrespected. Thus, in a very real sense, prioritizing the processes underlying resilience enables educational psychologists to decenter themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311425579">Ungar, 2011</xref>), and to spotlight the evolving, interactive, ecologically-embedded negotiations crucial to the process of resilience.</p>
