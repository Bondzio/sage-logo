<abstract>
<p>Building on the Schumpeterian and the Marshallian legacies, this article elaborates a model of endogenous growth. It provides a systemic explanation for the levels and the rates of total factor productivity growth. The generation of technological knowledge consists in the recombination of existing bits of heterogeneous technological knowledge that is necessarily possessed by a myriad of agents. As such, much technological knowledge is external to each agent and yet an essential input. In this context, knowledge governance mechanisms play a key role in the identification, recollection, and provision of the specific items of necessary technological knowledge, external to each agent. Effective knowledge governance mechanisms engender pecuniary knowledge externalities that take place, mainly at the regional level, when and where existing units of external knowledge can be identified, accessed, unbundled, and used—again—at costs that are below equilibrium ones for the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article contributes to the endogenous technological change approach arguing that innovation is an emerging property of the system into which the firm is embedded. It elaborates the view that innovation is the final result of the reaction to out-of-equilibrium conditions, both in factor and product markets, that can take place and become creative so as to lead to the generation of new technological knowledge and to the introduction of technological innovations only in localized circumstances that qualify the system into which the firm is embedded. The innovation process is affected by the costs and availability of internal and external knowledge. The latter, in turn, reflect the structural conditions of the system in terms of connectivity and knowledge governance. In so doing, it contests the view that innovation is a homogeneous, inexorable process that depends only on the supply of knowledge and not on its cost or process of production, as in the traditional growth theory.</p>
<p>The integration of the Schumpeterian and Marshallian legacies along the lines of the localized technological change approach provides a unifying methodology able to account for the origins of the levels and the dynamics of the residual. In this context, total factor productivity can be explained by the joint appreciation of the characteristics of the system, in terms of knowledge connectivity, and of the capability of individual firms to try and react to unexpected events by means of the introduction of technological innovations.</p>
<p>In the localized technological change approach, myopic firms are rooted in a limited portion of the technical, regional, and knowledge space by substantial irreversibility. For that reason, they are exposed to unexpected events in their product and factor markets to which they cannot fully cope with traditional substitution. Nevertheless, they can change intentionally their technology, provided a number of circumstances take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412473178">Schumpeter, 1947</xref>).</p>
<p>Firms caught in out-of-equilibrium conditions by unexpected changes in both factor and product markets, localized by the irreversibility of tangible and intangible inputs and by their idiosyncratic tacit competence accumulated by means of learning process, try and generate new technological knowledge so as to introduce technological innovations. The generation of new technological knowledge may lead to the actual introduction of innovations that increase total factor productivity only if and when their economic system is characterized by high levels of knowledge governance. The latter enables the effective identification, access, and use of external knowledge as a key input into the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge at costs that are below equilibrium.</p>
<p>Innovation is made possible by the structural characteristics of the system that provide reacting firms with external knowledge at costs that, in specific locations, are below general equilibrium levels and, hence, can account for localized total factor productivity: Innovation is as an emerging property of an economic system. If external knowledge cannot be accessed and used at costs that are below equilibrium levels, firms’ reaction is adaptive rather than creative and cannot lead to the introduction of productivity-enhancing innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412473178">Antonelli, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412473178">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this approach, the systemic conditions that qualify the access and use of external knowledge spilling from “inventors” to generate new technological knowledge and support the introduction of innovations are crucial to understanding the actual introduction of productivity-enhancing innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412473178">Arthur, Durlauf, &amp; Lane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412473178">Lane, Pumain, &amp; van der Leeuw, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach combines the Schumpeterian emphasis on the role of the reaction of firms in inducing the attempt to introduce technological change in with the Marshallian analysis of externalities. The combination of the Schumpeterian reaction with the Marshallian externalities provides an integrated framework into which out-of-equilibrium growth and development can be understood by partial equilibrium analysis. In so doing, it enables to combine a microeconomic analysis of short-term, instantaneous equilibrium with a long-term analysis of out-of-equilibrium growth and structural change at the system level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242412473178">Marshall, 1890/1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891242412473178">Metcalfe, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891242412473178">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891242412473178">Schumpeter, 1928</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach makes it possible to appreciate the variety of the localized contexts into which the generation of technological knowledge takes place. Moreover, it enables to account when, where, why, and how the pace of technological change is more or less rapid. The new growth theory, on the contrary, is bound to postulate a homogeneous rate of introduction of technological change across space and time.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is organized as follows: The next section provides a synthesis of the evolution of the notion of knowledge externalities and introduces the notion of knowledge governance. The third section frames a simple model that shows how the costs of external knowledge can account for total factor productivity growth. Then I elaborate the implications of the approach.</p>

<title>The Economics of Knowledge and Pecuniary Knowledge Externalities</title>
<p>Technological knowledge is an economic good with particular characteristics such as limited appropriability and nonexcludability, indivisibility, and, hence, complementarity and cumulativity, and nonexhaustibility. For quite a long time, the economics of knowledge has focused attention on the limits of knowledge as an economic good stemming from its limited appropriability, nonexcludability, and intrinsic information asymmetries. As a consequence, the benefits stemming from its production and exchange in the market place are missing together with the incentives for the allocation of resources to generate it and the opportunity for specialization. These characteristics would account for substantial market failure and major risks of undersupply. Because markets are unable to allocate the correct amount of resources into the generation of technological knowledge, public intervention is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412473178">Arrow, 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412473178">1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891242412473178">Nelson, 1959</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach has been reconsidered when, instead of focusing on the negative aspects—in terms of missing incentives—of knowledge nonappropriability, attention has been directed on the positive effects of the uncontrolled spillover of knowledge from “inventors” to third parties. Technological knowledge generated by each firm affects, as an “unpaid external” production factor, the production function of all the other firms. Technological knowledge, spilling in the atmosphere, becomes an externality and, hence, a resource for perspective recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412473178">Adams, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412473178">Griliches, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412473178">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412473178">Link &amp; Siegel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The new growth theory has implemented the analysis of the positive effects of knowledge nonappropriability, nonexcludability, nondivisibility, and nonexhaustibility and elaborated models of endogenous growth based on the role of knowledge externalities. In the first wave of new growth models, the spilling of knowledge externalities is homogeneous and automatic and enables the free utilization of the flows of knowledge generated in a system by third parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242412473178">Romer, 1986</xref>). Its accumulation through historic time takes place everywhere and at all times at no cost, benefiting lucky recipients who are just happy to be there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891242412473178">Romer, 1990</xref>). This literature implements the analysis of a self-sustained process of economic growth based on the benefits of knowledge indivisibility and nonexhaustibility that is endogenous and yet becomes available like exogenous manna, at no cost to passive recipients that use it as an additional factor that increases their efficiency but does not alter their choices nor their strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242412473178">Lucas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242412473178">Romer, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The powerful analytical frame elaborated by the first wave of the new growth theory has stirred a wealth of empirical and analytical investigations on the economic characteristics of knowledge and their implications for economics at-large, highlighting the uneven occurrence of productivity growth. Much evidence shows that the rates of technological change are far from being evenly distributed across historic times, industries, and regional spaces as suggested by the new growth theory. On the contrary, the introduction of technological change concentrates in historic time within well-identified gales that are located in defined portions of the industrial system and clusters in regional spaces that do keep changing across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242412473178">Abramovitz &amp; David, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891242412473178">Metcalfe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891242412473178">Mokyr, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891242412473178">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The growing empirical evidence provided by the economics of knowledge has progressively made clear that the use of knowledge spillovers is far from being homogenous and free. It entails dedicated activities and well-identified resources. Knowledge does not fall from heaven to passive recipients and does not spill freely in the atmosphere. The perspective users of technological spillovers need to act intentionally in order to take advantage of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412473178">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412473178">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412473178">Mansfield, Schwartz, &amp; Wagner, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification of the key role of tacit knowledge and the consequent understanding of the central role of user–producer interactions in the access of users to the knowledge generated by third parties make clear that both knowledge cumulativeness and complementarity require the active participation of perspective users to access external knowledge and to use it in the generation of new technological knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242412473178">David, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generation of technological knowledge substantiates the new approach. The generation of new technological knowledge by each firm consists in the recombination of existing modules of knowledge and impinges on high levels of complementarity with the knowledge generating activities in place in other firms, and cumulativeness with the stock of existing knowledge. Technological knowledge is at the same time an output and an input of the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge, and external knowledge is an essential—indispensable—input. Eventually knowledge enters the production function of all goods; as such it is twice an input—an input into the generation of new technological knowledge and an input into the generation of all the other goods. The firm is primarily a knowledge integrator able to bundle different sources of knowledge to generate new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891242412473178">Saviotti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891242412473178">Weitzman, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891242412473178">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>At each point in time, the system is endowed with a given amount of technological knowledge characterized by high levels of heterogeneity and diversity both with respect to its epistemic content and location. Moreover, it is possessed by the myriad of agents that generated it and are generating it. As such, the stock of existing technological knowledge is not only heterogeneous but also dispersed and fragmented: Much technological knowledge is external to each agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412473178">Metcalfe, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891242412473178">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>External knowledge is strictly necessary to generate new technological knowledge and its use entails dedicated interactions between the recipients and the possessors. More specifically, external knowledge that can be accessed either via market transactions or spilling from their possessors can be used by third parties only after dedicated interactions have been implemented and structured. Even knowledge spilling from the original possessor, because of limited appropriability, cannot be used freely by third parties. The appreciation of the notion of knowledge governance costs is crucial.</p>
<p>Dedicated interactions are necessary for its use to become possible not only when transactions in knowledge markets are involved, but primarily and necessarily when spillovers are concerned. This is because of the fact that it is dispersed in a myriad of highly idiosyncratic local contexts of application with high levels of irreducible tacit content. Moreover, it is codified in a variety of nontrivial codes and possessed by a myriad of heterogeneous agents with their own idiosyncratic characteristics and routines. This implies that existing external technological knowledge can be used in the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge only after dedicated resources have been invested to identify, retrieve, and extract it from its original context, and learn and adapt it to a specific context of application. Most important, it becomes clear that the use of external knowledge requires occasional transactions, but always and mainly requires dedicated intentional interactions with the actual possessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412473178">Cassiman &amp; Veugelers, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The access conditions of external knowledge depend on the quality of the knowledge governance of an economic system. The knowledge governance consists in the set of rules, procedures, modes, and protocols that organize the use of knowledge in an economic system. It includes a variety of institutional factors that qualify the architecture of relations, ranging from the extremes of pure transactions to pure interactions, including hierarchical coordination within firms and, most important, transactions together with interactions. The quality of knowledge governance mechanisms at work at each point in time, within each economic system, can be seen as the spontaneous result of a systemic process of polycentric governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412473178">Antonelli &amp; Ferrari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891242412473178">Ostrom, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of localized paths to organizing and managing at the system level the use of the existing technological knowledge as an input into the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge and the consequent introduction of total factor productivity-enhancing technological change can emerge and consolidate, according to the institutional setting of each system and its path-dependent characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412473178">Link &amp; Metcalfe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion of pecuniary knowledge externalities applies far better than the traditional notion of pure externalities. External knowledge is not free and yet strictly necessary. Active search, screening, identification, and interpretation of existing knowledge are necessary to use knowledge again and again as an intermediary input into the production of new knowledge. At the same time, it seems now clear that external knowledge is an indispensable and a nondisposable production factor, considering that its costs do affect the choice context of users. Pecuniary externalities matter when the costs of production factors differ from equilibrium levels: Recipients are active and act intentionally taking into account the external effects so as to achieve more efficient production mixes. When pure externalities apply, external conditions affect the efficiency of the production process but do not enter the production set and the production choices: Recipients are passive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412473178">Antonelli, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891242412473178">Scitovsky, 1954</xref>).</p>
<p>Pecuniary knowledge externalities are found where and when the knowledge governance costs incurred to accessing and using external knowledge are lower than its marginal product. The costs of accessing external knowledge reflect the localized conditions of using the existing knowledge that spills because of limited appropriability and can be used again because of nonexhaustibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412473178">1</xref></sup> Knowledge governance costs are determined by the quality of the knowledge interactions that make it possible to actually use the stocks of knowledge possessed by each of the agents, as well as the flows of new knowledge generated by each other agent. They include the costs of searching, screening, assessing, decodifying, extracting from its original context, learning, and finally understanding the knowledge that cannot be fully appropriated by those who generated it.</p>
<p>Even in the extreme case that appropriability levels are nihil and the possessors of technological knowledge can retain no control at all of the stream of rents associated with its use so that the market price of technological knowledge is zero and all technological knowledge spills into the atmosphere, the access to it and its use as external knowledge into the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge takes place at the positive level of knowledge governance costs. When appropriability levels are higher and the possessor of technological knowledge enters the markets for knowledge, interaction activities are necessary to perform successfully the actual transaction and to assist perspective customers in the actual use of knowledge that has been purchased. In both cases external knowledge can be used, but only at a cost. The cost of external knowledge can be lower than equilibrium levels when its governance costs are especially low. Hence, pecuniary knowledge externalities are influenced by the structure of the system and the distribution of agents within it that affect and qualify the activities that are necessary to engender the collective pursuit of generating new technological knowledge. In specific and qualified circumstances highly localized in regional space, historic time, and knowledge space, the levels of knowledge governance costs may be such that the cost of external knowledge is lower than equilibrium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412473178">Antonelli, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412473178">2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>The localized context of action emerges as a fundamental aspect of the innovation process. An understanding of the key role of the localized pools of existing technological knowledge that make possible the actual use of external knowledge in the generation of new technological knowledge opens up new prospects of inquiry regarding the effects that the costs of external knowledge have on the equilibrium growth of firms, industries, and regions and the causes of pecuniary knowledge externalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412473178">Antonelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412473178">Antonelli &amp; Barbiellini Amidei, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891242412473178">Porter, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>The Effects of Pecuniary Knowledge Externalities on Total Factor Productivity</title>
<p>The new relevance of the role of external knowledge and of its governance costs call attention on the role of knowledge not only in the knowledge generation function but also in the cost equation. This contrasts a long-standing tradition focusing on just the production function. Ever since the arrovian notion of learning, the effort to explaining the determinants of total factor productivity have been concentrated to analyzing the contribution of technology into the production function. The new growth theory has framed a model where increasing returns at the system level were compatible with standard equilibrium based on the hypothesis of knowledge cumulability and nonappropriability and related free and spontaneous spillovers among firms.</p>
<p>We articulate in this section an alternative approach that builds on the explicit identification of a knowledge generation function with internal and external knowledge as indispensable inputs and the related cost equation so as to accommodate for the role of knowledge governance costs and the possible role of pecuniary knowledge externalities. Next, we nest the knowledge generation function into a production function that includes technological knowledge as an input. In so doing, we show how pecuniary knowledge externalities can explain both total factor productivity levels and rates of change.</p>
<p>In the localized technological change approach, the generation of new technological knowledge is activated when firms try and cope with unexpected events that affect their product and factor markets in order to introduce technological innovations as a form of reaction. The irreversibility of substantial portions of their tangible and intangible inputs limits their possibility to cope with such changes by means of traditional substitution processes. The reaction will be “creative” if, when, and where the generation of new technological knowledge and the eventual introduction of new technologies are supported by the actual availability of “cheap” external knowledge to be used as an essential and indispensable production factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412473178">Antonelli, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the knowledge generation function, internal knowledge obtained by means of research and development activities and the valorization of learning processes is an essential input. However, external knowledge is also indispensable, for no one can command all of the knowledge available at any point in time. External knowledge has been generated in previous periods and/or is currently used by other firms. In the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge, internal and external knowledge are complementary inputs that have to be combined to produce new technological knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891242412473178">Nelson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891242412473178">Weitzman, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891242412473178">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In our case, the generation function and the cost equation of technological knowledge of each firm can be written as follows:</p>

<p>where <italic>T</italic> represents new technological knowledge generated with constant returns to scale by means of internal knowledge (<italic>IK</italic>) and external knowledge (<italic>EK</italic>). Here, <italic>p</italic> and <italic>u</italic> represent their respective unit costs. The unit cost of internal knowledge consists in the market price of the resources—primarily skilled labor—that is necessary to perform research and development activities and to valorize and maintain the internal stock of tacit knowledge and competence accumulated by means of learning processes. The unit governance costs of external knowledge include the costs of knowledge communication, as well as knowledge networking, and consist in the resources that are necessary to screen, identify, understand, purchase, learn, and use knowledge generated, possessed, and used by other agents in the system.</p>
<p>Pecuniary knowledge externalities are found where and when the governance costs of external knowledge (<italic>u</italic>) are below general equilibrium levels (<italic>u</italic>*). The latter would hold if and when knowledge were a standard economic good such that its equilibrium cost is found where its marginal and average costs meet its marginal product. According to the localized equilibrium condition:</p>

<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412473178">Abramovitz (1956)</xref>, we know that the level of total factor productivity is measured by the ratio between the real historic levels of output <italic>Y</italic> and the theoretical ones calculated as the equilibrium use of production factors:</p>

<p>where <italic>I</italic>* and <italic>T</italic>* are the general equilibrium quantities of production factors and <italic>A</italic> measures total factor productivity.</p>
<p>The case for total factor productivity takes place when the access to technological knowledge as an input into the generation of new technological knowledge is affected by localized out-of-equilibrium conditions and is cheaper than in general equilibrium conditions. Hence, the output of all the other goods produced downstream in localized equilibrium conditions characterized by pecuniary knowledge externalities will be larger than in general equilibrium conditions.</p>
<p>The results can be summarized as follows: Firms produce more than expected and therefore experience an “unexplained” residual in the actual levels of output that are larger than the expected ones (<italic>Y</italic> &gt; <italic>Y</italic>*), if and when:</p>

<p>These elementary passages enable support for the basic proposition that total factor productivity levels (and its increase) depend on the levels (and the rates of increase) of the discrepancy between the general equilibrium costs of external knowledge and the actual localized ones. Therefore, we can put forward the basic proposition that total factor productivity levels are stemming from pecuniary knowledge externalities:</p>

<p>Total factor productivity levels can be explained by the excess amount of output and technological knowledge determined by the localized governance costs of external knowledge that are below general equilibrium levels because of positive pecuniary knowledge externalities.</p>
<p>In such conditions, qualified by pecuniary knowledge externalities, each firm operates in localized (and transient) equilibrium conditions, but the aggregate output of the system is larger than expected in general equilibrium conditions. The working of pecuniary knowledge externalities is compatible with short-term, Marshallian, instantaneous equilibrium conditions at the firm level, whereas at the aggregate level the system is far from equilibrium.</p>

<p>The crucial distinction introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412473178">Schumpeter (1947)</xref> between passive adaptation and creative reaction plays a central role at this point of the analysis to grasp the dynamics of the system and its effects, according to its localized conditions. Firms facing changes in their product and factor markets try and react with the generation of new technological knowledge. Their reaction will be creative if pecuniary knowledge externalities qualify the access conditions to external knowledge. In this case, firms will be able to generate new technological knowledge at costs that are below equilibrium levels. The generation of technological knowledge will take place in conditions that make it possible for the introduction of productivity-enhancing innovations. The introduction of innovations will affect further the out-of-equilibrium conditions of the system and induce new firms to try and react in turn. A sustained dynamics of out-of-equilibrium growth is put in place and it will continue as long as the system is able to provide its members with the access to external knowledge at costs that are below equilibrium levels.</p>
<p>As long as there are pecuniary knowledge externalities and the local costs for external knowledge remain below general equilibrium levels, the typical complex system dynamics, stemming from the positive feedback generated by knowledge cumulability and knowledge complementarity, implemented by good knowledge governance mechanisms and the convergence of knowledge generation activities, are at work. This outcome meets the basic expectations of the Schumpeterian tradition: “Surplus values may be impossible in perfect equilibrium, but can be ever present because that equilibrium is never allowed to establish itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412473178">Schumpeter, 1942</xref>, 1950, p. 28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412473178">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the knowledge governance mechanisms are no longer suited to organize the access to the stock of technological knowledge available in the system, pecuniary knowledge externalities decline and with them the opportunities to sustain the introduction of technological innovations, the increase of total factor productivity and, hence, the scope for dynamic increasing returns.</p>
<p>When the generation of technological knowledge cannot benefit from the availability of pecuniary knowledge externalities, the reaction of firms will be “adaptive” as opposed to “creative.” In these conditions, firms can just introduce technical change as distinct from technological change and will yield equilibrium levels of output. Firms will be able to move in the existing map of isoquants and techniques, and no increase in the levels of total factor productivity can be detected. The equilibrium conditions of the system are not perturbed.</p>
<p>The essential argument elaborated so far is that productivity growth is a complex process that takes place in an environment that is heterogeneous. Technological innovation, which is the key to productivity growth, occurs as a result of a reaction to unexpected events that takes place with costs of innovation being lower at particular points in time and space than the equilibrium level of those costs. Technological innovation occurs as a result of taking external knowledge (through screening, identification, understanding, purchasing, and using) and recombining it with the use of internal knowledge. It is actually introduced when firms that are caught in out-of-equilibrium conditions try and react to unexpected changes in their product and/or factor markets and can take advantage of pecuniary knowledge externalities that make it possible to access external knowledge at a cost that is below equilibrium levels (<italic>u</italic> &gt; <italic>u</italic>*).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0891242412473178" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>This article takes issue with the idea, at the heart of the first generations of the new growth theory, that innovation is a homogeneous, inexorable process that depends only on the supply of knowledge and not its cost or process of production. It suggests that a new generation of endogenous growth theory can be elaborated, building on the view that innovation takes place as a form of creative reaction supported and actually made possible by the availability of internal and external knowledge, as determined by the knowledge governance mechanisms that cope with the structural conditions of the system.</p>
<p>In our approach, firms are induced to try and generate new technological knowledge so as to introduce innovations when unexpected changes in both product and factor markets push them out of equilibrium. The recombinant generation of new technological knowledge is activated. Its outcome is crucially affected by the localized conditions of the availability of external technological knowledge that has been already generated and used by third parties. Yet because limited appropriability can be accessed by third parties as external knowledge and because of indivisibility and nonexhaustibility, knowledge can be used again.</p>
<p>At each point in time, the system is endowed with a heterogeneous stock of technological knowledge possessed by a myriad of agents and embodied in a great variety of applications and uses with varying levels of actual connectivity. The generation of technological knowledge consists in the recombination of the existing bits of the heterogeneous stock of technological knowledge. Because of its intrinsic diversity, fragmentation, and dispersion, much necessary technological knowledge is external to each agent. External knowledge is an essential input into the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge. Knowledge governance mechanisms enable the recollection of existing technological knowledge and enable firms to use it again. The governance of localized technological knowledge helps strengthen the knowledge connectivity of the system.</p>
<p>When knowledge governance is effective and enables the identification and actual use of external knowledge, at costs that are below equilibrium levels, the output of the recombinant generation of technological knowledge and of the downstream production of other goods increases beyond equilibrium levels. The localized generation of technological knowledge can take place at costs that are below general equilibrium levels. In these circumstances firms are successful in their attempt to cope with unexpected changes in their product and factor markets by means of the introduction of productivity-enhancing innovations. The localized access to external knowledge at out-of-equilibrium costs is the key to sustaining the introduction of productivity-enhancing technological innovations, as it can account for the empirical evidence of the increase of the general efficiency of the production level beyond the levels of output expected in general equilibrium conditions. The introduction of new technologies perturbs the system, engenders new out-of-equilibrium conditions, and pushes new firms to try and react by means of the generation of additional technological knowledge. If the system provides access to pecuniary knowledge externalities, the process can keep going, sustained by the open-ended loop of positive feedbacks.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the reaction of firms caught in out-of-equilibrium conditions that try and react by changing the characteristics of their production processes or of their product without the support of pecuniary knowledge externalities will be merely adaptive, enabling firms their mobility in the existing map of isoquants feeding substitution processes and the introduction of novelties in product markets that, however, cannot increase their total factor productivity. In these circumstances, firms can only adapt to the changing conditions of their product and factor markets by means of technical change—as opposed to technological change—with no increase in the levels of total factor productivity; general equilibrium conditions are restored.</p>
<p>Here the conditions of the systemic conditions of regions, in terms of knowledge governance mechanisms at work, affect the cost equation of the generation of new technological knowledge of each firm. Pecuniary knowledge externalities are found when and where external knowledge can be identified, retrieved, and used at low costs. Only when pecuniary knowledge externalities are found can firms actually introduce technological innovations that improve the general efficiency of the production process. Furthermore, high levels of total factor productivity signal the positive effects of pecuniary knowledge externalities, and an increase in the levels of total factor productivity signals an increase in the levels of pecuniary knowledge externalities.</p>
<p>Conditions for the access to external knowledge, at costs that are below equilibrium levels, are not given or exogenous at the system level. They do vary across historic times, regions, industries, and countries. The levels of knowledge connectivity and the quality of knowledge-governance mechanisms are endogenous to the system and are strongly characterized by path dependence; they are the result of the stratification and accumulation of the actions of firms at each point in time and affect both the composition of the knowledge structure of the system and the viability of the knowledge governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>Dynamic increasing returns can take place if and when the attempts of firms to try and generate new technological knowledge and to introduce technological innovations to cope with unexpected events—made possible by pecuniary knowledge externalities—are able to sustain over time appropriate levels of knowledge connectivity at the system level in terms of composition of the knowledge structure and quality of knowledge governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>This approach provides new opportunities for empirical research on the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the regional level. The region seems the most relevant unit of analysis to investigate and identify the working of knowledge governance mechanisms and their effects in terms of pecuniary knowledge externalities and total factor productivity growth.</p>
