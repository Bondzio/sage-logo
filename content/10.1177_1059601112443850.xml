<abstract>
<p>Despite the recognized importance of groups’ external contexts to their functioning, there is little research that fully explicates the relationship between groups and their environments. Instead, much extant research treats groups as closed systems. To advance the field’s understanding, we explore the treatment of the relationship between groups and their environments in existing literature by reviewing research that incorporates groups in naturally varying environments. We identify three predominant characterizations in the literature: the environment as a resource pool, as an impetus for change, and as a target. We offer a summary of the assumptions in these characterizations, a critical examination of each characterization, and develop a future research agenda that extends each characterization and challenges its key assumptions in an effort to explore the relationship between groups and their external environments.</p>

<p>Groups and teams do not exist in a vacuum; instead, they are firmly embedded in and influenced by their environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Caldwell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112443850">Guzzo &amp; Shea, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112443850">Marrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112443850">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112443850">Sundstrom, DeMeuse, &amp; Futrell, 1990</xref>). Environments shape groups’ behaviors, internal processes, and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112443850">Ilgen, 1999</xref>) and, although the literature has noted the importance and powerful influence of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112443850">Guzzo &amp; Shea, 1992</xref>), “its influence is often unrecognized or underappreciated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112443850">Johns, 2006</xref>, p. 389). As a consequence, research often relegates the environments within which groups exist to the background.</p>
<p>Although scholars sometimes treat groups as actively engaged in two-way exchanges with their embedding environments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1997</xref>), much of the work on groups and teams characterizes them as closed systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona, 1990</xref>), and the predominant view of the field treats groups as isolated entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1997</xref>). And while some researchers have advanced alternative perspectives in which environmental influences are more thoroughly developed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112443850">Putman &amp; Stohl, 1990</xref>), most work in the groups and teams literature tends to use a general open systems perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112443850">Boulding, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112443850">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1966</xref>). Thus, while this work encompasses a wide range of relationships between groups and their environments, their specific nature is seldom articulated. As a result, the field’s understanding of the relationship between groups and their contexts remains opaque.</p>
<p>In this article, we advance the field’s conception of the relationship between groups and the environments in which they operate by offering a critical examination of how this relationship is treated, implicitly or explicitly, in current research. By approaching this question through a literature review, we offer a different and complementary perspective from theoretical efforts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112443850">1997</xref>). In particular, we explore how group researchers consider contextual influences in their work and what lessons the field can learn from that treatment. In the next section, we explain our approach to review the literature. We then examine three distinct characterizations of the environment prevalent in the literature on groups and teams. Finally, we reach beyond the current literature to consider an expanded view of the relationship between groups and their environments by proposing areas for future research.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059601112443850">
<title>Three Characterizations: The Treatment of the Environment in the Groups Literature</title>
<p>To prepare our examination of the existing literature, we first collected empirical research in the area of groups and teams, using the explicit presence of contextual factors in the research as a selection criterion. To find specific articles to be reviewed, we first started with seminal work in this area, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112443850">Gladstein (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112443850">Ancona and Caldwell’s (1992)</xref> development of the external perspective. Next, using this research as a guide, we conducted electronic searches using different keywords (e.g., group environment, group context, team boundary spanning, team boundary management, external team communications) to trace published research and to identify additional literature streams contributing to the phenomenon. We included the period between 1984 and 2011 in our review, since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112443850">Gladstein (1984)</xref> is one of the earliest studies that directly examined the relationship between groups and their external environments. We also manually scanned major Management and Organizational Behavior journals including <italic>Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Journal of Management, Journal of Organizational Behavior</italic>, and <italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic>. Finally, we cross-referenced articles identified in our search to identify additional articles not found in our initial search. Through our manual search, we found a few articles before 1984 that we considered important to include. We also followed several strategies to draw boundaries around our review. For instance, our review intentionally puts a focus on work that fits an “open systems” perspective, such that work not referring to the environment was not included. We further narrowed the work we examined by only including research examining groups in organizational settings, but not social groups, sports teams, or collectives that operate in other contexts.</p>
<p>Moreover, although experimental work is very useful in examining different aspects of the context of groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601112443850">Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991</xref>), these studies play a limited role in our review. Laboratory studies are often conducted to control for or manipulate specific contextual factors such as time, information, and membership. The experimental paradigm reflects an alternative strategy to measuring the impact of these contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112443850">Johns, 2006</xref>). As such, the understanding of group-environment interactions in laboratory studies attempts to give precision to the complexity of the environment present in the natural world. Given our purpose to reflect research in naturally varying environments, we use an approach similar to number of previous review pieces (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112443850">Cohen &amp; Bailey’s 1997</xref> review of the work teams literature and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112443850">Mowday &amp; Sutton’s 1993</xref> review of organizational context), which selectively include work that uses a laboratory paradigm. In our case, we draw from laboratory studies in which the researchers have explicitly investigated the relationship between groups and their environments, such as the work on multiteam systems (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112443850">Marks, DeChurch, Mathieu, Panzer, &amp; Alonso, 2005</xref>). The final set of articles included in our review includes roughly 150 empirical articles, book chapters, and conceptual and theoretical articles in the development of our categorization scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059601112443850">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We opted not to use a preexisting categorization scheme or typology because our interest is to understand the extant literature based on the prevalence of perspectives, rather than through the exploration of conceptually driven approaches. In other words, we are primarily concerned with perspectives that are present in the literature, rather than ones that ought to be. Thus, instead of using a preestablished typology, we sought to create our own categorization following an inductive logic. To do this, we examined the work we collected to draw similarities and differences across pieces by exploring researchers’ implicit and explicit assumptions about the environment or about the relationship between one or more groups and their environments. After an initial categorization, we revisited the theoretical categories looking for more information, exploring the detail of different pieces and establishing the boundaries of categorizations. In other words, we iterated between the classification of articles and the characterization that each category represented, attempting to clearly define each characterization.</p>
<p>We found, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112443850">Johns (2006)</xref> noted, that discussions of context often occur only tangentially or implicitly; in these cases, multiple perspectives of the relationship between groups and environments may be present simultaneously in the same article. As a consequence, drawing clear lines around individual pieces of research is problematic, requiring either the exclusion of interesting work or an artificial simplification of the work reviewed. The challenge for us, then, was to pursue completeness and clarity simultaneously. To address this challenge, we opted to organize our review to provide clarity in the core elements of the conceptual characterizations, rather than around individual pieces of research. Such an approach helps provide conceptual clarity while recognizing the complexity of the phenomenon. We believe this is a more robust approach to the question of interest: what are the important characterizations present in the literature that describe the relationship between groups and their environments?</p>
<p>A second challenge, present for any categorization scheme, is establishing the balance between complexity and parsimony. We attempted to balance the broadest coverage of perspectives with a preference for a relatively small categorization scheme, but one that would accurately reflect the richness of research that underlies it. Following a logic similar to that of inductive theory-building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112443850">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>), we followed an iterative process in which we constantly identified, discussed, discarded, and reinforced the depictions and assumptions we found in articles. In this process we iterated between articles and our categories, building smaller categories, aggregating or splitting them, looking for contradictions or concurrence. For instance, at one point we explored two different forms of influence of the context in driving change in groups. In one case, the pressure and concomitant change in the literature was gradual, while in the other it was sudden. Rather than separating these two characterizations, we ultimately decided to include them in a single characterization, given their broadly shared elements. We followed this process until the three central characterizations of groups’ environments emerged, where we saw a solid balance between complexity and parsimony.</p>
<p>The last concern we attempted to address was the need to create a scheme that, if desired, could be replicated by other authors. In addition to the steps described above, we also worked through different combinations or groupings of research, aggregating them in different ways, until we arrived at the categorization presented here. Although alternative categorizations were viable, they represented only small variations from the ones presented here, giving us confidence in the robustness of our choice. In the sections that follow, we present these three characterizations. For each one we describe the core elements, present a brief table with exemplar pieces, and provide an explicit critique of some of their core features.</p>
<sec id="section2-1059601112443850">
<title>The Environment as a Resource Pool</title>
<p>The most prevalent characterization in existing literature of the relationship between a group and its environment treats the environment as a resource pool. This characterization is best described as reflecting “inputs” in a classic systems model, where inputs are processed to create outputs (i.e., the input-processes-output model; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112443850">Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, &amp; Jundt, 2005</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112443850">Hackman (1987)</xref> specifically considers how “various input factors (such as features of the group, its task, and its work context) affect group-interaction processes . . . which in turn affect the output of the group” (p. 316). There was a substantial empirical research that either explicitly or implicitly invokes the I-P-O model, and where two central assumptions are made: that resources reside in the environment and teams can draw them in for their work.</p>
<p>Authors’ characterization of the environment as a resource pool places a strong focus on the importance of resources and acknowledges that teams are not in complete control of all the means necessary for their functioning. In this view, teams are dependent on their contexts, and they acquire resources in the form of incoming members, technology, and information by interacting with others who control the resources. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112443850">Tushman and Katz (1980)</xref> mention that “as external information is important, managers must choose, develop and facilitate appropriate linkage mechanisms to meet the information demands of their unit’s work” (p. 1084). These interactions are depicted in the literature as occurring not only in an organizational context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112443850">Denison, Hart, &amp; Kahn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112443850">Sundstrom et al., 1990</xref>) but also with the larger environmental context, including people or groups outside that organization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601112443850">Yan &amp; Louis, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112443850">Table 1</xref> presents some of the exemplar pieces that highlight research characterizing the environment as a resource pool.</p>

<p>When this characterization of the group environment is used in the literature, individuals are often seen as the carriers of some resources, particularly information and knowledge. Sometimes the integration of these resources occurs when individuals who possess information and knowledge join a team as members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112443850">Cummings, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112443850">Hackman, 1987</xref>). Considerably more attention has been paid, though, to cases where individuals act as boundary agents, as “boundary role persons,” or “boundary spanners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112443850">Adams, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112443850">Marrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112443850">Organ, 1971</xref>) and build linkages between the group and the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona, 1990</xref>). Here, the activities of these individuals are directed toward the team’s environment to manage its relationships with external actors, including other units within the organization and other organizations. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112443850">Mathieu and colleagues (2001)</xref> have advanced the idea of multiteam systems (MTSs), a particular organizational arrangement where <italic>teams of teams</italic> work collaboratively to achieve collective goals. This perspective naturally emphasizes the interdependence of groups with their contexts and the coordination efforts and boundary activities across interdependent teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112443850">Mathieu, Marks, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001</xref>). In multiteam systems (MTSs), individual team members can shift their attention to cross-team activities rather than within-team activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112443850">Marks et al., 2005</xref>), which enhances effective MTSs coordination.</p>
<p>The literature also reflects a deep understanding of how boundary-spanning activity takes place. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112443850">Ancona and Caldwell (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112443850">1992)</xref> identify a wide range of boundary-spanning activities used to deal with environmental demands, including mapping, gathering information and resources, informing, and negotiating. Similarly, authors regard some boundary-spanning individuals (i.e., “gatekeepers”) as important linking mechanisms between a group and the external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112443850">Tushman &amp; Katz, 1980</xref>). Gatekeepers bridge the gap between technical teams and the larger world outside the organization, gathering external information and translating it into terms that are more meaningful and useful for the team. They are strongly connected internally to the team and externally to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112443850">Tushman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112443850">Tushman &amp; Katz, 1980</xref>). Additionally, some work describes individuals who act as experts or counselors and who bring information and knowledge into the group without explicitly being team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112443850">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). In all these cases, it is the linkage that the role provides that allows the individual to carry information or knowledge from the environment into the group. Such carrier activity, though, is not always assumed to be automatic or assured and can be influenced by individuals’ identification with the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112443850">Richter, West, van Dick, &amp; Dawson, 2006</xref>). Thus groups are characterized as depending on their members, who strongly identify with the group, to bring resources into the group from the external environment.</p>
<sec id="section3-1059601112443850">
<title>Describing the environment</title>
<p>The literature that uses a characterization of the environment as a resource pool seldom describes it directly. As such, the most important critique of this perspective is the lack of a systematic and explicit consideration of the relationship between groups and their environments. For instance, a pervasive assumption in much of this work is that the environment is a benevolent influence. In other words, much of the work using the characterization of the environment as a resource pool presumes that the context does not threaten or adversely affect the team, but instead is a passive repository of resources that the team can simply reach out to. Such an assumption, however, is not necessarily realistic. Many groups face environments that are hostile, or where resources are scarce, and the acquisition of resources involves careful work by members. One consequence of assuming benevolence is that it can minimize the perceived importance of boundary-spanning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112443850">Faraj &amp; Yan, 2009</xref>). Because the environment is seen as benevolent and resources as abundant, there is also a relative absence of research on topics such as boundary controls and other maintenance activities that may be necessary to protect a team from the environment.</p>
<p>Since the characterization of the environment as a resource pool is seldom explicitly articulated, one result is that a systematic exploration of the phenomena that are integral to this type of relationship between groups and environments is missing, with some elements underrepresented or absent. For instance, missing in this characterization are explicit examinations of how resources flow into groups over time, and of ways to conceive of the transfer of these resources. The research says little of the effort required to maintain stable flows of resources, or of how the ease or difficulty of acquiring resources might change over time, or other dynamics in this process. The implicit use of this perspective presents an additional challenge because it tends to underspecify how the transfer of resources across the boundary takes place. For instance, the literature does not elaborate on which properties of individuals become a group resource when they join as members or how that happens. Thus, when a new group member arrives, it is not clear under what conditions her knowledge and expertise become a group resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112443850">Oh, Labianca, &amp; Chung, 2006</xref>). Also, it is not conceptually clear whether attributes such as her connections to other individuals outside of the group are a resource that is appropriated by the group or one that must be further developed before being used. In general, the lack of a systematic consideration of the transfer of resources, due to the implicit use of the characterization of the environment as a resource pool, obscures the properties of the processes necessary to ensure a stable flow of resources. Although the acquisition of resources is likely a concern that is central in many groups, this lack of knowledge limits the generalizability of research developed using the perspective of the environment as a resource pool.</p>
<p>In summary, the characterization of the environment as a resource pool present in the literature assumes that the context provides essential resources for groups and that teams are dependent on their environments for those resources. In the literature examined, this characterization is by far the most extensively portrayed perspective in the literature. As a consequence, it also has the greatest degree of elaboration, with emphasis placed on different types of resources, resource acquisition mechanisms, who obtains the resources, and why and how the resources are obtained. However, the absence of a systematic approach to this perspective also results in a skewed set of conclusions that do not fully acknowledge the challenges of ensuring resource flows into the group.</p>

<title>The Environment as an Impetus for Change</title>
<p>The second characterization of the relationship between groups and their environments prevalent in existing literature treats the context as an impetus for change. Work adopting this characterization portrays environmental forces as placing pressure on teams to modify their operations or otherwise alter their work. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112443850">Arrow (1997)</xref> argues that “most naturally occurring groups with an extended history experience temporary or permanent changes . . . and cope (or fail to cope) with other changes in tasks, technology, and operating conditions over time” (p. 75). She also indicates that, at a broader level, “group development models emphasize the importance of contingencies in the environment that influence a group’s developmental path” (p. 75). Faced with pressures from the environment to change, groups can either respond with a series of minor adjustments or alter their structure and processes in more significant ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112443850">Arrow, McGrath, &amp; Berdahl, 2000</xref>). Studies that use this characterization tend to portray one of two distinct processes. In the first process, the environment is depicted as placing subtle or strong pressures on a group that demand adaptation. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112443850">Gibson and Dibble (2008)</xref> document small and large pressures for change. In the second process, the environment is depicted as a disruptive force that produces a more dramatic shock to the activities of the group, causing the group to focus on restoring order. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112443850">Waller’s (1999)</xref> work investigated the timing of adaptive group responses to nonroutine events and found that “the longer it took crews to engage in adaptive task prioritization or task distribution activities after a nonroutine event, the lower the crew performance” (p. 135). In both cases, this characterization focuses on the contextual influences that alter the internal processes and behavior of the group. Examples of prototypical papers within this characterization are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112443850">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Environment as a pressure for change</title>
<p>In characterizing the environment as exerting pressure for change, the literature regards the influence of the context as a subtle but powerful actor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112443850">Guzzo &amp; Shea, 1992</xref>). The critical issue is that, as the context undergoes change, the change affects the group. Work in this area suggests that, to maintain performance, groups must notice these changes in their environments and determine whether these environmental changes are important enough to merit adaptation. In some cases, explicit arguments are made that uncertain and unpredictable environments require continuous adaptability, and the ability to deal with change through internal adaptation is indispensable for team effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112443850">Argote &amp; McGrath, 1993</xref>). The speed of response is also considered critical and reflects how adept the group is at recognizing a change in circumstances and making needed adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112443850">Arrow, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for a response by groups to changes in their environments rests on the idea that a good fit between group and environment can lead to improved performance—an argument rooted in contingency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112443850">Lawrence &amp; Lorsch, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112443850">Thompson, 1967</xref>) that is translated to the group level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601112443850">Van de Ven &amp; Delbecq, 1974</xref>). In the literature, authors portrayed pressures from the environment in different ways. For instance, pressures are described as internal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112443850">Mair, 2005</xref>) and external (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112443850">Keck, 1997</xref>) to the organization in which groups reside, such as changes in task, technology, and operating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112443850">Arrow, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1991</xref>). Moreover, the amount of exposure to contextual change can vary across teams, leading to different dynamics in responses. For instance, executive teams are likely to place a premium on speed, emphasizing quick modifications to their approach when the organizational context shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112443850">Keck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112443850">Keck &amp; Tushman, 1993</xref>), whereas product development teams following shifts in the environment can place a premium on developing a full understanding of the external pressures before change occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112443850">Denison et al., 1996</xref>). But the core idea of fit is always relevant, reflecting the goal of achieving a better alignment of the team’s competencies and internal processes with environmental conditions.</p>
<p>One factor elaborated in this characterization is the nature of the adjustments that groups make to their structures and processes in response to external pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112443850">Arrow, 1997</xref>). Change in a group can involve the nature of interaction or performance, the state of the group as a whole, or the patterns of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112443850">Arrow, Poole, Henry, Wheelan, &amp; Moreland, 2004</xref>). Whether a group engages in a gradual or dramatic transition depends on individuals’ perceptions of the change, environmental demands, and the speed of the change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112443850">Arrow, 1997</xref>). Moreover, adjustment activity can range on a continuum from low effort and minor modifications to high effort and substantial evolution in a group’s internal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112443850">Gibson &amp; Dibble, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, a key factor highlighted by work in this area is the need to match change in the group to the demands of the environment. Work concerning team learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112443850">Edmondson, 2002</xref>), which often examines how teams alter their behaviors in response to external challenges and fundamental changes in the nature of their work, provides a prime example in this area. Team learning is a process in which a team takes action, obtains and reflects on feedback, and makes changes to adapt or improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112443850">Edmondson, 2002</xref>). Learning can involve a substantial shift in the internal processes of a group to maintain alignment with the external environment and, over time, adaptation follows learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112443850">Ilgen et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Environment as a disruptive force</title>
<p>In characterizing the environment as an impetus for change, the literature sometimes depicts the influence of the context as dramatic and disruptive for the group. When the environment is a disruptive force, the literature describes situations in which members perceive the world beyond the group’s boundaries as a source of disturbances and disruptions. When this characterization is present in research, the context is typically one in which a group is striving to maintain stability in its internal processes or attempting to return to equilibrium after an unexpected event. In general, this focus on <italic>returning to normal</italic> emphasizes that groups are more likely to make superficial changes than to explore, confront, and make major changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander, 1987</xref>). Here the challenges from the environment are treated as temporary, episodic, and sudden, and teams’ responses are also temporary, episodic, and sudden, often geared toward restoring or preserving team status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112443850">Bechky &amp; Okhuysen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the management and organizational literature, interruptions are generally seen as negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112443850">Jett &amp; George, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601112443850">Zellmer-Bruhn, 2003</xref>) because they can impede the normal flow of work; consequently, most work in this area focuses on teams’ efforts to take action aimed at controlling, limiting, or shielding the teams’ activities from those external disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601112443850">Zellmer-Bruhn, 2003</xref>). Disruptions are often characterized as triggered by environmental stimuli, such as changing technology and novel, unexpected events. For example, Arrow’s work suggests a team is most likely to treat an event in the environment as a disruption when it is interpreted negatively and team members are otherwise satisfied with the current and projected future state of the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112443850">Arrow et al., 2000</xref>). Groups can work on routine tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601112443850">Rousseau &amp; Aube, 2010</xref>) or develop tendencies toward familiar, routine sequences of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112443850">Gersick &amp; Hackman, 1990</xref>), such that even events with potentially positive consequences can be interpreted negatively if members simply anticipate undesirable consequences from them. Thus team members may see interruptions to their work as negative, even when these interruptions can provide a window of opportunity for the team to review, rethink, and consider new alternatives for processes that can improve their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112443850">Tyre &amp; Orlikowski, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the work here underscores the importance of perception in the process of responding to environmental demands; the same environment can evoke different responses from different groups, as individuals respond to the contextual changes in light of their interpretation of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112443850">Arrow et al., 2000</xref>). In this characterization, team members generally describe events in the environment as distracting, disruptive, and dysfunctional. At the same time, to the extent that members are aware of the possible effects of these events, they have a basis for determining which strategy they should adopt, taking action on challenges they consider serious, disregarding those that can be safely ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112443850">Faraj &amp; Yan, 2009</xref>). In thinking of the environment as a disruptive force, the impact of the disruption on normal operation and performance is considered by many researchers to be the critical element (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112443850">Waller, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Describing the environment</title>
<p>In contrast to the characterization of the environment as a resource pool, work characterizing the environment as an impetus for change explicitly considers different dimensions of the environment. For instance, in this characterization the environmental context is explicitly described as dynamic and changing. As contexts for group activity, scholars have examined environmental conditions such as uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112443850">Bantel, 1993</xref>), velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112443850">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>), novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112443850">Marks, Zaccaro, &amp; Mathieu, 2000</xref>), and so forth. Uncertainty represents a state in which critical information about organization, activities, and events is not known and cause and effects relationships among environmental elements are also unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112443850">Bantel, 1993</xref>). By comparison, novelty refers to the unfamiliar, unexpected, and unpredictable nature of contextual factors, where it is often impractical or impossible to train teams for situations that they may encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112443850">Marks et al., 2000</xref>). Yet, in high velocity environments changes in demand, competition, and technology are so rapid and discontinuous that information is often inaccurate, unavailable, or obsolete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112443850">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). Clearly, what all these dimensions capture is the dynamic nature of external environments.</p>
<p>One notable shortcoming in this characterization is the absence of a formal or explicit differentiation between the influences of organizational and broader environments. In other words, in some cases the organization in which groups reside is the source of pressures for change because it can modify the task of the group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1984</xref>). But change can also occur in the wider environmental context, such as economic/political challenges, technological opportunities, and cultural challenges and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112443850">Gibson &amp; Dibble, 2008</xref>). Thus the environment as an impetus for change exists inside or outside the organization, but the work using this characterization has given little consideration to how pressures emanating from the two on a group may differ.</p>
<p>Although the characterization of the environment as an impetus for change acknowledges the dynamism of the environment, this aspect of the characterization still requires additional elaboration. For instance, in the literature there is little consideration of situations where the environment, itself, was slowly changing. But it is in these cases that pressures on groups to modify their own functioning are most likely to be observed. One stream of research that made the argument for the importance of changes in the environment on groups is the literature on entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Chong, 1996</xref>). This literature characterizes the temporality of shifts in the environment and their consequent impact on group behavior and can account for adjustments in temporal parameters of an activity (like the pace of activities or cycles of action) to match those of another activity in the organization or the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Waller, 2007</xref>). External environments influence teams by acting as external pacers, rhythm setters, creators of windows of opportunity, or sources of interruptions.</p>
<p>The characterization of the environment as an impetus for change also suffers from other shortcomings. For instance, work using this characterization focuses on situations where the force for change is evident and the reaction of a group is forthcoming. However, this focus essentially selects situations where change is occurring, ignores situations where it is not, and thus obscures theoretical explanations that may be relevant to understanding how groups react to pressures for change. Additionally, this focus likely causes an overrepresentation of situations in which individuals judge change negatively because the change requires effort and attention. This selection means that the field cannot fully understand situations in which change is either a matter of course, and perhaps is judged neutrally, or situations where change is desirable, and as a result is judged positively. Selecting situations where change is occurring also overrepresents groups that have fewer buffers between themselves and environment pressures. As a consequence, scholars know less about groups that are well-buffered or, even, what those buffers are and how they operate to shield groups from such pressures.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming in the characterization of the environment as an impetus for change is that it tends to treat groups as unitary, as single entities within which individuals perceive the environment in a homogenous manner and react in an agreed on and coordinated way. However, as in other areas of group functioning, exploring differences among members is relevant. Some members notice the demands of the environment, while others do not; some members believe that change is necessary to account for those demands, while other members do not. Treating the group as unitary obscures the differentiated roles of individuals, such as the part that group leaders play in guiding, cajoling, and persuading group members to adapt to different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601112443850">Klein, Ziegert, Knight, &amp; Xiao, 2006</xref>). By treating groups as unitary, research using this characterization obscures the dynamics among members, limiting explanations of how and why groups change in response to demands from their environments.</p>
<p>In sum, the perspective of the environment as an impetus for change reflects a view that environments are powerful and place pressure on teams to adapt. The external pressures that groups face include both organizational and environmental forces, such as changes in membership or technological changes. External pressures can also include disruptive events that interrupt the activity of groups and that groups must overcome to maintain their performance. This perspective revolves around two hypotheses. First, for gradual or incremental change, fit is important; if teams are to survive or to perform well, they must respond and change when their contexts change. For disruptive challenges, the emphasis is on achieving and maintaining a stable state. To the extent that disruptions move a team away from that stable state, responses are enacted to restore it. This is also the characterization with the most well-elaborated descriptions of the environment. However, this characterization also suffers from a lack of distinction between organizational and broader environments, and from a consideration of situations in which groups may not be responsive to pressures for change, due either to buffering by the organization or to dynamics among members.</p>

<title>The Environment as a Target</title>
<p>The final characterization of group environments identified within existing work describes the relationship between groups and their environments by treating environments as targets of groups’ activities. This characterization represents a proactive approach for dealing with the environment and so, rather than addressing the question of how the environment influences the team, work adopting this characterization attempts to answer the question of how the team reaches out to its environment and influences it. In one of the earliest expressions of this characterization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112443850">Homans (1950)</xref> drew attention to the fact that the relationship between a group and its environment is bidirectional, that it can be characterized as recursive, with groups not only influenced by their environment but also influencing it. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112443850">McGrath (1997)</xref> noted that “groups actively engage with their embedding contexts in two-way interchanges, and both group and environment adapt to one another” (p. 15). However, although some existing work focuses on this bidirectionality of influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112443850">1997</xref>), it is not as prevalent as work adopting the previously described characterizations. Exemplar articles using this characterization are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059601112443850">Table 3</xref>. The “external perspective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona, 1990</xref>) is probably the most explicit statement of the characterization of the environment as a target. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112443850">Ancona and Caldwell (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112443850">1992)</xref> conducted studies that formed the foundation for the external perspective. In addition to looking at a group’s internal activity, this research focused on outward activity directed at the environment by the group. Longitudinal studies of five consulting teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona, 1990</xref>) and 45 new product teams in five high-technology organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Caldwell, 1992</xref>) yielded two key insights. First, teams develop a distinct set of external activities and strategies directed toward their environments. Second, these activities can be positively and significantly related to group performance.</p>

<p>In this characterization, influencing the environment is important because the context embodies many constraints, uncertainties, and contingencies for the work of the group. Thus, although groups are dependent on external sources, they can reduce uncertainty substantially by negotiating directly with those on whom they depend. Teams can proactively increase their share of resources and gain organizational legitimacy, allowing for some degree of protection in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Waller, 2007</xref>). Examples of legitimacy-gaining activities include reconfiguring a team’s strategy to better align with that of the organization as well as disseminating and “shopping around” a team’s ideas to management or external clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Waller, 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112443850">Friedlander and Schott (1981)</xref> found that activities and ideas of a group are more likely to be taken seriously when the group has established a good relationship with top management. An inability to affect top management may be harmful because top management may favor other groups with resources or power to pursue alternative goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112443850">Ancona &amp; Caldwell, 1992</xref>). Also, as knowledge work becomes more complex and specialized, tasks are no longer easily performed independently or sequentially but instead require interdependent, coordinated action across areas of the organization or across organizations. Therefore, teams can use external interactions as opportunities to facilitate task performance.</p>
<p>Another stream of research using the characterization of the environment as a target examines the impact of top management teams in organizations. These teams operate by translating the external environmental demands into internal organizational guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112443850">Thompson, 1967</xref>). Forces external and internal to the organization shape an executive team and the team simultaneously shapes organizational action toward the external environment through its symbolic and substantive actions, actively dealing with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112443850">Pfeffer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112443850">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>), influencing its context through its decisions and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112443850">Bantel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112443850">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). Through issue-selling and sensemaking in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112443850">Dutton, Ashford, Lawrence, &amp; Miner-Rubino, 2002</xref>), individuals are more than recipients of contextual cues from their environments; they are also active participants in reshaping their organizational environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112443850">Dutton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112443850">Maitlis, 2005</xref>). Thus work here suggests that team members and top management teams can actively shape stakeholders’ perceptions of their units or teams. And a leader’s efforts in making a team visible to its external constituents can enhance access to resources and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112443850">Druskat &amp; Wheeler, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A final element that has received some attention in this perspective focuses on the different strategies that groups follow as they attempt to influence their context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112443850">Choi, 2002</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112443850">Ancona and Caldwell (1988)</xref> show that groups use external contacts to influence individuals with key resources and to synchronize their workflow and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112443850">Ancona’s work (1990)</xref> identifies specific team strategies for managing external environments. According to her framework, a strategy of informing involves concentration on internal team process until the team is ready to inform outsiders of its intentions; a strategy of parading consists of internal team building but simultaneously being visible to let outsiders know that members know and care about them; and a strategy of probing stresses external processes and requires team members to have high levels of interaction to diagnose outsiders’ needs and experiment with solutions to meet those needs. Thus teams with an informing strategy remain relatively isolated from their environments, while parading teams have high levels of passive observation of their environments. Teams with a probing strategy encourage members to be aggressive toward their environments and engaging outsiders. Groups that characterize the context as a target reach into their environments beyond their organization to map relevant trends, to influence critical external players, and to alter aspects of the contexts that affect group outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section9-1059601112443850">
<title>Describing the environment</title>
<p>Although the characterization of the environment as target does not always explicitly describe the relationship between the group and its environment, one feature that is present in the characterization is the bidirectionality of the relationship, with the group trying to influence the environment at the same time that it is influenced by it. Such bidirectionality distinguishes this characterization from the environment as an impetus for change or resource pool, where the influence is treated as one-way. The explicit bidirectionality means that in this perspective the environment is considerably more complex. For instance, negotiation between the group and external stakeholders is possible (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112443850">Gibson &amp; Dibble, 2008</xref>), implying that the environment is a social system, of which individuals and teams are a part. Similarly, when the actions of the team are intended to gain competitive advantage (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112443850">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>), there is a recognition that the environment is composed of other groups simultaneously trying to gain advantage, groups that are the targets of competitive actions. Moreover, the research indicates that groups adept at influencing their context perform at higher levels than those that are less adept.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important critique of this characterization is its relative absence in the literature. As previously mentioned, the characterization of the environment as a target is the least represented perspective in the literature reviewed. This characterization emphasizes the active role of groups in shaping their environments and is clearly represented in studies focused on groups that are formally responsible for addressing their context, such as top management teams, because these activities are central to their work. An additional challenge in this characterization is that it sometimes lacks attention to internal processes in these groups. For instance, one very well developed area of research, on “upper echelon” groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112443850">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>), has suffered from the need to use demographic variables as proxies for information as influences on members’ interactions or other group processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112443850">Hambrick, 2007</xref>). As a consequence, many details of how these groups influence and are influenced by their environments in these situations remain obscured. This concern is especially important because upper echelon groups are likely to differ from other groups due to selection processes and task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112443850">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>), indicating that knowledge gathered and theory developed from other types of groups may not be readily applicable. Together with the dearth of research that explicitly embraces bidirectionality, the lack of knowledge about the internal workings of these groups limit a full understanding of the true interplay between groups and environments.</p>

<title>Toward a New Research Agenda</title>
<p>Through this examination and critique, three overarching characterizations of the relationship between groups and their environments present in extant research have been identified. In this section, these characterizations function as a springboard to highlight new avenues for research. Given the general scarcity of work that explicitly considers the relationship between groups and their environments, there are many different directions that future research could take to advance understanding. For instance, one general direction that would be useful would be explicit examinations of differences and similarities between organizational (e.g., intraorganizational) and broader environments (e.g., extraorganizational) and their effects on groups, as these two forms of context are seldom compared. Unfortunately, such broad calls for changes in the overall research approach can go unheeded because, without specificity, the scholarly value of such an approach is unclear. Instead, a few specific avenues of research that could act as strong catalysts for future research on the relationship between groups and their environments are proposed. For each characterization, the avenues proposed are developed by two approaches. In one case, areas of work that capitalize on existing research as a starting point are suggested and then extended through a more expansive consideration of phenomena that are already under study. This approach highlights evolutionary and incremental opportunities for continuing research. To propose more radical research avenues for two characterizations, one of their central assumptions was questioned. Taking full advantage of the literature review, assumptions for critique and advancement of each characterization are identified. Importantly, given the reality of the wide variety of theoretical approaches evident in the literature review, research directions in line with the idea of summarizing thinking, offering new empirical questions, articulating puzzles, or challenging current conceptions were offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112443850">Kilduff, 2006</xref>). Similar to previous broad literature reviews (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112443850">Marrone, 2010</xref>), the proposed directions are offered as questions that still require examination, but which are specific and clear enough to provide an agenda for future work. These questions for future research are presented at the end of each section as concluding queries to the examination of the literature.</p>
<sec id="section11-1059601112443850">
<title>The Environment as a Resource Pool: What Resources and How They Flow</title>
<p>As noted, a considerable amount of research on groups uses a characterization of the environment as a resource pool, where groups can reach out and acquire the talent, material resources, or knowledge needed to do their work. Such a characterization of the environment, however, can still be refined to expand the understanding of groups. In particular, this characterization would benefit from explicitly questioning the stability of the context from which groups acquire different types of resources.</p>
<sec id="section12-1059601112443850">
<title>Questioning an assumption in the characterization</title>
<p>In the review of the literature, one particular shortcoming in the characterization of the environment as a resource pool stands out; that is, the environment is often treated as relatively stable, an erroneous assumption for most groups. In contrast, the other two characterizations—impetus for change or target—recognize that the environment is dynamic and that groups respond to that dynamism as part of their activities. One way of extending the view of the environment as a pool of resources is by explicitly exploring the processes through which resources in dynamic environments are acquired.</p>
<p>One aspect of dynamism worth investigating is the way in which support from management in organizations is acquired. Although it is commonly understood that groups have difficulty succeeding when they do not have management support, the literature says little about the conditions under which some groups receive support and others do not and how or why resources flow to some groups but not others. Naturally, choosing between supporting different groups when there are differences in alignment with organizational goals or performance should be straightforward; management can logically support those that contribute more to organizational goals or are more successful. However, if two groups are successful in their activities and well-aligned with organizational goals, it is difficult to predict which one may receive greater support under conditions of resource scarcity. A useful extension to current views would be to acknowledge the political, cultural, and ecological processes that influence groups’ ability to acquire resources in organizations.</p>
<p>Political processes can play an important role in the dynamics of groups’ resource acquisition regardless of the overall stability or dynamism of the environment, because power among groups in organizations is always shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112443850">Alderfer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112443850">Alderfer &amp; Smith, 1982</xref>). Power is associated with dependency, and if a group is dependent on another, it has less power in the relationship. From this perspective, groups with more power will be at a relative advantage in any competition for resources. For example, teams that are central in a network may be better performers because they have access to more resources through their connections to other teams and they may also be able to restrict the flow of resources to other teams that are competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112443850">Balkundi &amp; Harrison, 2006</xref>). Moreover, groups can actively try to reduce dependencies and instead try to become indispensable or to increase others’ dependency on their work, acting to increase their own power. Examining issues of power might also explain situations in which groups that survive are not necessarily high performing groups and how, over time, such selection mechanisms may hinder organizational performance.</p>
<p>Another possible perspective on how resources are acquired could focus on the social properties of the environments in which groups operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1984</xref>). Social and cultural elements, for instance, can help define appropriate forms of behavior that are expected from group members. As an example, individuals hold different understandings of the concept of team across national and organizational cultures, and the metaphors individuals use to describe teams carry with them expectations for how teams will be managed and how team processes will unfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112443850">Gibson &amp; Zellmer-Bruhn, 2001</xref>). Cultures high in collectivism with a strong concept of collaboration emphasize shared concerns, interdependence, and mutual help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112443850">Gibson &amp; Zellmer-Bruhn, 2001</xref>). This perspective suggests that resource acquisition mechanisms and the internal processes of groups performing the same task will vary across different social and cultural contexts. For example, group members in interdependent cultures rely more heavily on others in their organizations to perform their own tasks than groups in more independent cultures. This argument suggests that social and cultural legitimacy play a role in facilitating resource acquisition. In other words, in an organization with strong normative values, groups that conform have easier access to resources. Conversely, a group that challenges the norms of its host organization encounters resistance from others in the organization and faces a backlash, such that resources are shifted away as a form of punishment, regardless of its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Another explanation for the acquisition of resources by groups that could be explored explicitly moves the emphasis from a single group to sets of groups within organizations. Previous research has primarily focused on the patterning of change and continuity in a single group and the importance of contingencies in the environment that influence a single group’s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112443850">Gersick, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112443850">McGrath, 1991</xref>). But newer perspectives also examine the evolution over time of sets of groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112443850">Marks et al., 2005</xref>). Focusing on the dynamic aspects of resource flows in organizations directs attention to questions such as where groups come from, how resources flow within sets of groups, what persistent characteristics successful groups have, and when groups disappear, each broadening the field’s understanding. Summing up these arguments, several questions of interest emerge. For instance, “In addition to performance and organizational alignment, what other forms of evaluation explain resource flows to groups?” “What organizational processes help explain differential support or resource flows to groups?” “How do power dynamics, cultural alignment, and competition among groups influence resource flows, and do they do so in different, similar, or complementary ways?”</p>

<title>The Environment as an Impetus for Change: Influence Sources and Member Perceptions</title>
<p>By questioning the assumption regarding the perspectives of individuals toward their environments, the characterization of the environment as an impetus for change can be advanced. Here, the assumption that individuals view their environments as a negative influence on the group is questioned.</p>
<sec id="section14-1059601112443850">
<title>Questioning an assumption in the characterization</title>
<p>The characterization of the environment as an impetus for change often carries with it an assumption of antagonism between the group and the environment. This assumption suggests that group members predominantly perceive the environment negatively. One way this assumption is expressed is in the description of changes, which tend to be cast as reactive and undesirable. Such a perspective favors steadiness and predictability for members, so disruptions and change are unwelcome. In contrast, the characterizations of the environment as a resource pool and as a target tend to view the environment as a source of opportunity, as a place where the group can usefully act to achieve task success. Moreover, the characterization of the environment as an impetus for change also tends to treat the perspective of members as homogeneous and unchanging, suggesting both strong agreement among individuals and stability over time. Thus one possible direction for future research for characterizations of the environment as an impetus for change and as a disruptive force is to examine groups by shifting the perspective to understand how group adaptation may differ when group members interpret the environmental demands for change differently, for instance, by viewing change positively, when members’ perspectives on the change differ, and when those perspectives change over time.</p>
<p>Perceiving the environment as a source of positive change may depend on the specific nature of the change required. When a change is required but no benefit is clearly observed, it may be deemed an inconvenience or a waste of time, as a distraction from the tasks that the group is attempting to complete. Changes interpreted as necessary to better meet the group’s objectives may still be judged as difficult or inconvenient, but ultimately worthwhile. In those instances, members may interpret the work needed to achieve a change as a sacrifice rather than an inconvenience, and this different interpretation can motivate different levels of effort in the pursuit of a given change.</p>
<p>Additionally, group members may disagree on whether a change will have positive or negative consequences for the group. Differences in perspective on a change can result in conflict and conflict resolution activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112443850">Behfar, Peterson, Mannix, &amp; Trochim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112443850">Peterson &amp; Behfar, 2003</xref>), which may lead members to evaluate a change differently over time. But the literature lacks explanations for how these differences of opinion can affect the trajectory of any change that a group may ultimately implement. By explicitly considering the level of agreement among members as they evaluate their situation, the field can gain a more through understanding of dynamics of group change in response to environmental demands and the processes that mediate them. Some questions that arise include “How does the initial evaluation of members regarding the need for change set a trajectory of the team’s activities?” “How does the ongoing evaluation of members, based on the feedback from initial actions, modify the trajectory of a team engaging in change?” “In what circumstances do members abandon, maintain, or accelerate processes of change due to changing environmental conditions?”</p>

<title>The Environment as a Target: Boundaries as a Unit of Analysis</title>
<p>As the characterization that is least developed in the literature, treating the environment as a target for a group’s activities has considerable scope for future development. This perspective can be extended on the basis of a clear insight it provides—the blurring of boundaries between groups and their environments.</p>
<sec id="section16-1059601112443850">
<title>Extending the perspective</title>
<p>One of the most powerful insights from the characterization of the environment as a target of groups’ activities is that the boundary of groups is not strictly or uniquely definable. Instead, this characterization highlights that boundaries are created through the actions and interactions between group members and others in their environment. For instance, boundaries can be extended to encompass a broader membership, as happens through the inclusion of external advisors into the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112443850">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach suggests that one path to advance the field’s knowledge regarding groups and their environments is through a more thorough examination of group boundaries, which have often been conceptualized in a static and well-defined manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112443850">Mortensen &amp; Hinds, 2002</xref>). As a consequence, groups are typically viewed as holistic units embedded in larger systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112443850">Sundstrom &amp; Altman, 1989</xref>) with boundaries that separate and link them with their environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112443850">Alderfer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112443850">Homans, 1950</xref>). Moreover, boundaries are supposed to clearly differentiate a group from others as well as representing real or symbolic barriers to access or transfer of resources and serving as points of external exchange with other entities in the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112443850">Sundstrom et al., 1990</xref>). But some researchers have also advocated relaxing or modifying this perspective to more accurately reflect reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112443850">Mortensen &amp; Hinds, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112443850">Friedlander (1987)</xref>, for instance, argues that looking beyond the boundaries of groups to develop explanations for their behavior is indispensable, as it is easy to underestimate the impact of the larger systems to which groups belong. Reconsidering boundaries is important because they are the site where groups whose goals and assumptions are diverse come together, where dependencies for critical information and resources become evident.</p>
<p>One potential approach to explore these questions involves treating the boundary itself as the unit of analysis in examinations of groups. A focus on boundaries forces the examination of the relationships between groups and the linkages between them. Also, since boundaries are defined by and are inseparable from a group’s internal properties, this examination encourages attention to internal and contextual factors simultaneously. This perspective suggests that, for instance, when one is studying demographic diversity within a single group, considering the boundary forces one to simultaneously consider the demography of the embedding context, including occupational, industry, and organizational characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112443850">Chi, Huang, &amp; Lin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112443850">Joshi &amp; Roh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The adoption of the group boundary as a unit of analysis also highlights the multiple conceptions of boundaries, placing attention on the specific characteristics of the relationship between a group and its context as well as the different purposes that boundaries have for a group. Although researchers have mainly focused on boundaries as a result of identity perceptions (i.e., by asking who is a group member) and how team members define the group and its boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112443850">Alderfer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112443850">Arrow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112443850">Hackman, 1987</xref>), research can also recognize other conceptions of boundaries. For instance, by asking which members of an executive team are involved in making a given decision, the field can move from conceptions of boundaries focused on membership to boundaries defined by relevance or competence. Moreover, if research asks how far the span of control of an executive team extends, a boundary can be defined on the basis of power or control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112443850">Santos &amp; Eisenhardt, 2005</xref>). Also, conceiving groups as having multiple boundaries operating simultaneously opens an opportunity to understand boundary phenomena, such as their permeability, in a deeper way. In each case, alternative conceptions of boundaries can allow for a more detailed exploration of groups and their relationship to their context. There are several questions that deserve attention in future research to examine the boundaries of groups. For instance, “What are different forms of boundaries for groups?” “How are these boundaries defined when they are structural or, alternatively, how are they enacted when the boundaries are relational or behavioral?” “Are different processes necessary to bridge those boundaries, such that boundary-spanning activity is different across types of boundaries?”</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>For groups, managers, and employees in organizations, the context of their work is an omnipresent influence, and one that is not fully acknowledged in scholarly work. Such a shortcoming is problematic because it can limit the applicability of theories and findings, which can be substantially affected by the contextual influences of any given group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112443850">Johns, 2006</xref>). If scholarly work is to attain relevance among practitioners, it must fully embrace the lived experience of groups and their members in organizations.</p>
<p>Although work remains to be done, the research examining groups in context also suggests some avenues that can be of practical value for managers and employees in organizations. For instance, the research indicates that an active engagement with the environment is more likely when it is viewed as a source of opportunities rather than threats. To the extent that leaders can influence the perspective of group members to adopt a point of view based on opportunities, they may create a more proactive stance. In addition, the work presented here also suggests how, when seeking support from outsiders, group members and leaders have a number of levers based on power, status, cultural fit, and so on. This approach suggests that the strategies a group can use to access resources in the context may be numerous and that selecting one or more to use in a given situation is an important part of the ongoing work of groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The intent of this review has been to advance the field’s understanding of the relationship between groups and the environments in which they operate. In this review, the focus was primarily on research in which groups operate in naturally varying environments. Such an approach provides a rich description of the most widely used and prevalent perspectives in the literature. Given the purpose of the review, laboratory studies were included in a selective manner. A more thorough review of laboratory work, explicitly examining contextual variables, would be useful to provide a richer description of the effects of contextual variables on groups. Such a review would be a complement to the work presented here and would also inform knowledge in a valuable manner. Within this review, three dominant perspectives reflecting the treatment of relationships between groups and their environments were identified. The first two perspectives illustrate how environments can influence groups, while the last perspective focuses on how groups influence their contexts. Although in theory a group may exist without a context, real groups have embedding contexts, and empirical results suggest that external environments have an important influence on teams. In spite of its importance, there is scant research that addresses the context of groups in a systematic, theoretically rich manner.</p>
<p>Within this article, a new research agenda to advance work that explores the relationship between groups and their contexts is offered. The three overarching characterizations form a starting point to suggest streams of research that examine the complex set of relationships between groups and environments. This article addressed aspects of the group environment currently underexplored, including political, ecological, and cultural processes that can explain resource flows in groups, other forms of contextual influence beyond resources on groups, and emphasis on groups’ boundaries as the unit of analysis. Given the critical impact of environments on groups and teams, environments are likely to be a particularly fruitful focus for new advances in the study of groups and teams.</p>
