<abstract>
<p>Using data from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study, we describe parent involvement and support activities in schools educating a nationally representative sample of students with emotional disturbances (EDs). We describe the extent to which programs aimed at encouraging family involvement are offered by schools and received by families and their relationship to child, family, and school characteristics. Student-level information was obtained from students, teachers, and parents, whereas school-level information was obtained from school administrators. Although schools attended by 71% of the students reported offering at least one type of family involvement activity, teachers reported only 17% of families of children with ED received a parent support service. Compared with families who did not receive support services, those who did were more involved in their school, and their children received more services in the community and had higher achievement levels. The need and potential methods for increasing parent engagement are discussed.</p>

<p>An extensive body of research investigating the extent to which parents are involved in the schooling of their children indicates greater parent involvement is associated with better academic achievement and mental health of children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207312460889">Pomerantz, Moorman, &amp; Litwack, 2007</xref>). Numerous studies examining outcomes such as reading and math achievement, attendance, behavior, and graduation rates support this relationship (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207312460889">Fan &amp; Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207312460889">Hill &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207312460889">Jeynes, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207312460889">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312460889">Pomerantz, Grolnick, &amp; Price, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207312460889">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>). Some of the most important policies, laws, and reports at the federal level concerning the education and development of children have promoted the role of parents and their need to become involved in their child’s schooling. Among these federal initiatives are Title I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207312460889">Borman, 2000</xref>), the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1044207312460889">No Child Left Behind Act (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1044207312460889">Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; 2004)</xref>, the Surgeon General’s Report on the Mental Health of the Nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1044207312460889">United States Department of Health and Human Services, 1999</xref>), and the report of the President’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1044207312460889">New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003)</xref>. These initiatives promote the school as the hub for parent involvement activities, which are a central focus of school reform aimed at improving outcomes for all students at the state, district, and school levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1044207312460889">Epstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207312460889">Fine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207312460889">Wallace &amp; Walberg, 1991</xref>). A striking example of these efforts is the allocation of US$43 million in the 2003–2004 school year by New York City to hire parent coordinators to contact parents in each of the system’s 1,200 schools in an effort to increase parent involvement and improve student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1044207312460889">Gootman, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Research on Parent Involvement</title>
<p>A significant body of research examining the effects of parents’ involvement indicates its positive associations with higher student achievement, including studies with families from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207312460889">d’Ailly, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1044207312460889">Hill, &amp; Craft, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207312460889">Jeynes, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207312460889">2005</xref>). Studies of teachers’ reports of parents’ involvement in such activities as parent–teacher conferences, open house events, and parent reports of reading to children and checking homework were associated with higher student grades (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1044207312460889">Grolnick &amp; Slowiaczek 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207312460889">Jeynes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1044207312460889">Newman, Wagner, Huang, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1044207312460889">Sénéchal &amp; LeFevre, 2002</xref>). Some mixed results have been reported in studies of the effects of parental helping with homework and student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207312460889">Cooper, 1989</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1044207312460889">Pomerantz and Eaton (2001)</xref> found that once children’s initial achievement was taken into account, mothers’ assistance predicted an increase in children’s achievement over time, with the implication that parental assistance with homework for children who are having difficulty improves academic achievement.</p>
<p>In view of the relationship between parent involvement and student achievement, schools are interested in intervention programs aimed at increasing the involvement of parents. However, when studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to increase parent involvement are examined, the results are inconclusive. In two meta-analyses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207312460889">Cooper, Charlton, Valentine, and Muhlenbruck (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1044207312460889">Mattingly, Prislin, McKenzie, Rodriguez, and Kayzar (2002)</xref> found little empirical support for these programs in improving student achievement or behavior. Because of significant methodological flaws in the studies examined, the authors of the two meta-analyses concluded that findings do not negate or support their value but rather that the effectiveness of such programs has not yet been adequately examined.</p>
<p>Another potential source of conflicting results in studies of parent involvement could be the way parent involvement is measured. Levels of parent involvement may differ when reported from the perspective of school administrators, classroom teachers, or parents. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207312460889">Bowman-Perrot et al. (2011)</xref> found that parents who were more involved and had more contact with their school had children who were suspended and excluded more often than noninvolved parents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207312460889">Duchnowski and Kutash (2011)</xref> found that schools that were lower performing and less involved in reform than demographically comparable schools had parents who reported higher involvement through more contacts with schools than parents in the higher performing schools. Researchers in both of these studies, after debriefing participants, suggested that administrators may have perceived that parents attending required discipline meetings in schools as instances of parent involvement, whereas parents who reported higher involvement viewed the discipline meetings as negative and adversarial rather than promoting positive engagement. A more thorough examination of these perspectives is needed in the field to help explain some of the conflicting findings from current studies.</p>

<title>Diverse Forms of Involvement</title>
<p>There is a significant body of literature examining the diverse types of parent involvement in their child’s learning and the effects of involvement associated with their child’s achievement. Parent involvement activities range from attending parent–teacher conferences and open house events to helping with homework and reading to children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207312460889">Culp, Hubbs-Tait, Culp, &amp; Starost, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207312460889">Epstein, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1044207312460889">Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207312460889">Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207312460889">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1044207312460889">Ritblatt, Beatty, Cronan, &amp; Ochoa, 2002</xref>). National surveys indicate that more than two thirds of parents attend parent–teacher conferences or open house events and a like number of parents report helping with homework at least once a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1044207312460889">U.S. Department of Education, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>New Frameworks for Parent Involvement Programs</title>
<p>Regardless of mixed findings from selected studies of attempts to increase parent involvement, schools continue to perceive parent involvement as an important component of school improvement activities aimed at increasing student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207312460889">Domina, 2005</xref>). To increase parent involvement, schools have developed and implemented a range of workshops, training programs, and other strategies to promote parental skills and attitudes, all aimed at improving student outcomes through increased involvement by parents in their child’s education. To provide some conceptual guidance to these efforts, Adelman, Taylor, and their colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207312460889">Center for School Based Mental Health, 2011</xref>) have recently synthesized some of the major frameworks in the field of family involvement, such as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1044207312460889">Epstein (1988)</xref> and the extension of this framework by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1044207312460889">Jackson and Cooper (1989)</xref>. Adelman and Taylor have developed an extensive program aimed at removing psychosocial barriers to learning and systemically increasing learning supports for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207312460889">Adelman &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>). Enhancing parental involvement plays a central role in their approach. In their recent synthesis of relevant theoretical frameworks, Adelman and Taylor identify two categories or determinations underlying the majority of parent involvement activities: a socialization agenda and a helping agenda.</p>
<p>They propose that the socialization agenda is evident in the widespread use of parent training programs that aim to influence family attitudes toward school and promote practices by parents that can facilitate the achievement of school goals. This agenda is supported by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207312460889">National Institute of Mental Health (2001)</xref>, which identified parents’ lack of skills in engaging effectively in the education and treatment of their children as a major challenge to implementing evidence-based mental health practices. The most frequent activity in this category is training programs aimed at teaching parents behavior management and general parenting skills. Fortunately, there is an emerging body of rigorously conducted research indicating that parent training programs can result in improved student behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207312460889">Fabiano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207312460889">Gardner, Burton, &amp; Klimes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1044207312460889">Pelham &amp; Fabiano, 2008</xref>). In these programs, approaches that emphasize positive parenting behaviors are the core curriculum, and parent blaming for their child’s challenging behaviors is avoided.</p>
<p>Adelman and Taylor’s helping agenda is exemplified by interventions that address barriers to learning by facilitating family access to health and social services provided in the school and through referrals to community services. By colocating social services at schools, it becomes easier for families to also be involved in activities that promote student academic achievement and positive mental health. An example of an intervention to help parents overcome social and economic barriers to their child’s learning is the network of school-based family resource centers in Kentucky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1044207312460889">Robbins &amp; Armstrong, 2005</xref>). These centers, collaborative partnerships between schools and community agencies, provide a range of services and resources that include food and clothing banks as well as information about health and mental health care, and financial assistance. Family resource centers and full-service schools are present in many communities across the country and play a role in increasing parent involvement that leads to improved academic and behavioral functioning in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207312460889">Center for School Based Mental Health, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, there is substantial evidence in general education of parent involvement activities that are associated with improved academic achievement in their children. These include attending parent–teacher conferences, open house events, helping with homework, reading to children, and taking part in workshops and training to improve parenting skills. However, it is noted that studies evaluating interventions aimed at increasing parental involvement to improve student academic achievement have been inconclusive thus far due to methodological flaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207312460889">Cooper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1044207312460889">Mattingly et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the multiple methods and sources used to measure the level of parental involvement across studies may be another contributing factor to some mixed findings. With support from state and federal policy, schools continue to pursue strategies to increase parental involvement to improve student achievement.</p>

<title>Focus on Families of Children Who Have Emotional Disturbances (EDs)</title>
<p>It is reasonable to assume, based on the requirements and regulations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1044207312460889">IDEA (2004)</xref>, that families of children who have disabilities could also benefit from such programs and their need may be even greater than that of families of nondisabled children. However, the extent to which families of children who receive special education services have access to programs intended to increase family involvement, and the effects of these programs are unclear and underresearched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Javitz, &amp; Valdes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1044207312460889">Zhang, Hsu, Kwok, Benz, &amp; Bowman-Perrott, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While the achievement gap between all categories of children who have disabilities and their nondisabled peers needs to be reduced, the case of children who have EDs is especially troubling. For more than two decades, federal, state, and local education policymakers and administrators and parents have expressed distress about the numbers of children and families experiencing the negative consequences of the inappropriate behavior and poor academic performance associated with ED. Despite advances in developing effective practices, students with ED who are receiving special education services have the highest school absenteeism rates and probability of failing grades, and the lowest graduation rates relative to peers with and without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1044207312460889">Blackorby et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Spiker, Linn, Gerlach-Downie, &amp; Hernandez, 2003</xref>). While in school, these students receive minimal amounts of psychosocial support and little support for their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1044207312460889">M. Wagner et al., 2006</xref>). In many cases, this all too common scenario leads to a poor transition to young adulthood and adverse life outcomes, including a 57% likelihood of being arrested within 2 years of leaving school and, relative to others with and without disabilities, the highest rate of post-high-school job instability and risk of entering the adult mental health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1044207312460889">Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312460889">Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Lynn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1044207312460889">Newman, Wagner, Knokey, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, Epstein, &amp; Sumi, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, state and federal policies enthusiastically support the involvement of parents in the education and development of their children. Furthermore, the effectiveness of some parental involvement activities in improving academics is supported by an extensive empirical base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207312460889">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>), including several meta-analyses synthesizing the results of more than 100 studies and producing findings with moderate to large effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207312460889">Fan &amp; Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1044207312460889">Houtenville &amp; Conway, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207312460889">Jeynes, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207312460889">2007</xref>). Findings from studies using nationally representative samples of students, however, indicate that students with ED are less likely to have families who are effectively involved in their education than peers with or without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1044207312460889">Newman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, Epstein, &amp; Sumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1044207312460889">M. Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). Although parents may attend conferences with school staff, many of the meetings concern discipline infractions and suspensions rather than opportunities to build positive partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207312460889">Duchnowski &amp; Kutash, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, they are less likely to play an active role in the development of their children’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), academic remediation, or transition planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207312460889">Kutash, Duchnowski, Green, &amp; Ferron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1044207312460889">M. Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, a potentially effective resource for improving student outcomes, that is, family involvement, appears to be ineffectively used by families of children who have ED.</p>
<p>An in-depth examination of activities aimed at improving parent involvement conducted by schools that educate students who have ED is needed. Information is needed about the characteristics that differentiate more involvement-promoting schools to assess the current state of the art and to direct a research agenda aimed at improving family involvement for this needy group of students. Understanding the child and family characteristics related to greater involvement and access of available services is also critical to accomplishing this objective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1044207312460889">
<title>Purpose of the Current Study</title>
<p>At present, there is much attention focused on strategies and interventions to provide support for parents of children who have ED to increase their engagement and involvement in their child’s educational and mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1044207312460889">Hoagwood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207312460889">Kutash, Duchnowski, Green, &amp; Ferron, 2011</xref>). At this stage of the research, there are still fundamental questions about the extent to which the education system is providing these support services and the characteristics of the students and their families who receive these services compared with those who do not. Data from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS) conducted by Wagner and colleagues (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, Epstein, &amp; Sumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1044207312460889">M. Wagner et al., 2012</xref>) offer a unique opportunity to examine some of these points. The current study is a secondary analysis of SEELS in which we describe characteristics of the schools attended by a nationally representative sample of students who had ED and the extent to which programs and services aimed at encouraging family involvement were offered.</p>
<p>Five research questions guide this study. First, to what extent do schools attended by a nationally representative sample of students identified as having ED offer the following parent support services: family liaisons, family resource centers, and workshops or courses on parenting? Second, are there differences in the characteristics of schools that offer these parent support services and schools that do not offer these services?

<title>Data Source</title>
<p>The current study utilizes data from the SEELS, conducted by SRI International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Epstein, 2005</xref>) with funding from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education Programs. SEELS examined the characteristics, experiences, and achievements of students with disabilities nationwide and their families. The focus of the current study is on those students with a primary disability classification of ED, who were selected in a two-stage sampling process. First, a random sample of school districts and state-supported schools serving only students with disabilities was selected and then stratified to represent different geographic regions, sizes (school enrollment), and levels of district wealth (eligibility for free or reduced price lunch). In the second sampling stage, a designated number of children and youth in each district or state-supported school were randomly selected from each federal special education disability category and were invited to participate in the study. Students in the SEELS sample were weighted to represent the number of students nationwide who were classified with a particular disability and instructed in the kind of school or school district from which they were selected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1044207312460889">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study Participants</title>
<p>The current study includes SEELS participants with a primary disability classification of ED and not known to be in a special school at the time of data collection. Findings from the current study therefore represent students nationally who received special education services within the ED category; students with emotional or behavioral problems who were served in a primary disability category other than ED or who were not found to be eligible for special education services are not represented by the current study sample.</p>
<p>The initial SEELS sample consisted of more than 11,000 elementary school students between 6 and 12 years of age who were receiving special education services in December 1999. Approximately 1,081 of the students in this initial sample had a primary disability classification of ED. Of these children, the majority were White (66.8%), male (80.1%), and living in households with an annual reported income of US$20,000 or less (40.3%) or between US$20,001 and US$35,000 (25.9%). Nearly three fourths of these students had parents who reported their highest level of education achieved to be “some high school” (19.4%), high school graduate/<italic>General Educational Development</italic> (36.5%), or “some college” (16.9%). Data collection began in 2001 and was conducted in three waves separated by approximately 1 year. Data were collected from principals describing the characteristics of schools during the first wave of data collection. Teachers reported on students’ school programs during Waves 1, 2, and 3, with response rates ranging from 59% to 74%. Parents were interviewed at each wave, with a response rate ranging from 75% to 85%. Students completed a direct assessment of their academic functioning, with response rates ranging from 63% to 82%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1044207312460889">
<title>Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>Reported results include weighted frequencies and means, which are population estimates for students classified with ED nationally, as well as the standard errors of those estimates. Tests of significance were conducted to compare differences in weighted frequencies and means. To calculate whether the difference between percentages was statistically significant, the squared difference between the percentages of interest was divided by the sum of the squared standard errors to obtain an <italic>F</italic> statistic. Because sample sizes are large for all analyses, <italic>F</italic> statistics larger than 3.84 indicated significance at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level, statistics between 6.63 and 10.79 indicated significance at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 level, and statistics greater than or equal to 10.8 indicated significance at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 level. Instrumentation is described below according to the five research questions guiding the current study.</p>

<title>Instrumentation</title>
<sec id="section11-1044207312460889">
<title>Research Question 1</title>
<p>The first research question, to what extent do schools attended by a nationally representative sample of students identified as having EDs offer specific parent support services, was addressed using data obtained from the School Characteristics Survey. The School Characteristics Survey was administered once at the onset of the study to a school staff person (usually the principal) who could report on the characteristics and policies of the school. Broad information about the school and information about the student body were collected, along with information related to school policies and programs for students with disabilities. Specific to the first question addressed in the current study, principals indicated whether their school offered a parent liaison, family resource center, or workshops or courses on parenting. The proportion of schools that offered at least one of these parent support services and schools that did not offer at least one of these support services was examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1044207312460889">
<title>Research Question 2</title>
<p>The second research question, are there differences in the characteristics of schools that offer at least one of these parent support services and schools that do not, was also addressed using data from the School Characteristics Survey. The following school characteristics were examined: number of students enrolled at the school, racial/ethnic makeup of the student body, percentage of students eligible for free/reduced-price lunch, percentage of students who moved during the previous school year, type of community in which the school was located, kinds of community resources available to students, and which of 13 activities were in place to promote parent involvement (i.e., open house/back-to-school night; schoolwide parent–teacher conferences; invitation to school events; written contract between school and parent; parent–student learning activities at school; parent volunteer opportunities; newsletter to parents; parent involvement in instructional issues; parent involvement in governance; schoolwide e-mail list/web page/homework hotline; services to support parent involvement, such as child care; translation of information for non-English speaking parents; and educational programs for parents, such as a family literacy program). Schools that offered at least one of the specific parent support services (i.e., parent liaison, family resource center, or workshops or courses on parenting) were compared with schools that did not offer any of these services on each of these school characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1044207312460889">
<title>Research Question 3</title>
<p>The third research question, are there differences between parents of students with ED who received teacher-reported parent support services from the school compared with those who did not, and are there differences between students in these two groups, was addressed using data from several sources.</p>
<sec id="section14-1044207312460889">
<title>School program survey</title>
<p>First, data obtained from teachers who completed the School Program Survey were used to identify parents who received support services from the school. The School Program Survey assesses an individual student’s overall school program, placements, and educational progress, and is completed by a teacher who knows the student’s educational program well. Teachers’ responses during the first wave of data collection to an item on the survey that asks whether the student’s family received training, counseling, or other supports/services through the school system (including services contracted from other agencies) during the current school year were used to identify parents who received support services from the school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1044207312460889">
<title>Parent Interview</title>
<p>Following the identification of parents who received support services from the school and those who did not, characteristics of parents and students in these two groups were compared using information provided by parents during the Parent Interview and information obtained through the direct assessment of students. The Parent Interview is an approximately 45-min telephone interview completed by parents that focuses on student and family characteristics, students’ experiences at school, parents’ expectations for their children’s future, students’ nonschool activities, and parents’ satisfaction with their children’s school and school programs. Data collected from Parent Interviews conducted during the first wave of data collection were used to assess differences between groups on the following parent and student characteristics (each described in detail below): duration of disability, social skills functioning, receipt of services, parent satisfaction, and parent involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1044207312460889">
<title>Duration of disability</title>
<p>Duration of disability was assessed by parent report of (a) time (in years) between recognition of their child’s problem or disability and their child’s first receipt of services, (b) time (in years) between first receipt of professional services and initiation of special education services, and (c) time (in years) their child had received special education services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1044207312460889">
<title>Social skills functioning</title>
<p>Students’ social skills functioning was assessed according to parents’ responses to 11 items on the Parent Interview related to their child’s social interactions, 9 of which were drawn from the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) Parent Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1044207312460889">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>). For each of these items, parents indicated how often their child engaged in a particular social interaction. Response options ranged from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 2 (<italic>very often</italic>). Summed responses form a scale of overall social skills ranging from 0 to 22, with higher scores indicating better social skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1044207312460889">
<title>Receipt of services</title>
<p>Students’ receipt of services was measured by parent report of whether their child had received psychological/mental health services/counseling, social work services, academic tutoring, medical services for diagnosis/evaluation, or case management during the past 12 months. For services the student had received, parents specified whether they were received from or through the student’s school or district. Prescription psychotropic medication use by students was assessed by parents’ responses to a single item asking whether their child was taking a prescription medication to help control his or her behavior, mood, or emotions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1044207312460889">
<title>Parent satisfaction</title>
<p>Parent satisfaction was assessed according to parent report of their level of satisfaction with their child’s school, teacher, and special education services; with other education services their child had received; with the level of information provided to parents by the school about their child’s behavior and academic performance; and with the amount and difficulty of their child’s homework. Response options for each of these items ranged from 1 (<italic>very satisfied</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very dissatisfied</italic>), yielding a summary score of overall parent satisfaction that ranged from 6 to 24, with lower scores indicating greater satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1044207312460889">
<title>Parent involvement</title>
<p>Parent involvement was assessed according to parent report of whether they or another adult in the household had attended a general school meeting (e.g., back to school night or a meeting of a parent–teacher association), attended a school or class event (e.g., a play, sports event, science fair), or volunteered at the school (e.g., chaperoned a class field trip, served on a school committee). Items were scored as 0 (<italic>no</italic>) or 1 (<italic>yes</italic>), yielding a summary score for the three items ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater parent involvement at school. Two additional parent involvement items specific to more formal school involvement activities were examined independently. These included items that asked parents whether they had attended a parent–teacher conference and/or an IEP meeting during the past school year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1044207312460889">
<title>Direct assessment</title>
<p>Information on students’ academic functioning was obtained through the direct assessment of students. Assessments were conducted using research editions of subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1044207312460889">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>) that were developed in conjunction with the original test developers for use in SEELS. The WJ-III is a norm-referenced, comprehensive, individually administered assessment of academic skills and knowledge with strong psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207312460889">Cizek, 2003</xref>) that is routinely used in school and other settings. Subtests were augmented with measures of phonemic awareness and rapid letter naming taken from the kindergarten and first grade version of the <italic>Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing</italic> (CTOPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1044207312460889">Torgesen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1044207312460889">R. K. Wagner, Torgesen, &amp; Rashotte, 1999</xref>) as well as a measure of passage comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207312460889">Deno &amp; Marston, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1044207312460889">
<title>Research Question 4</title>
<p>The fourth research question, are there differences between parents of students with ED who reported participating in parent support activities in the school or community compared with those who did not, and are there differences between students in these two groups, was addressed using information obtained from the Parent Interview and direct assessment of students. First, parents’ responses during the first wave of data collection to a question during the Parent Interview that asks whether they had participated in any meetings, programs, or trainings for families of students with disabilities (in the school or in the community) during the past school year were used to identify parents who participated in support activities and those who did not. Characteristics of parents and students in these two groups were then compared in the same manner described for the previous research question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1044207312460889">
<title>Research Question 5</title>
<p>The fifth research question, are there differences between parents of students with ED who reported different patterns of participation in parent support activities in the school or community over a 3-year period, and are there differences in students whose parents reported these different patterns of participation, was addressed in the following manner. First, according to parent report on the Parent Interview, parents of study participants were identified as having (a) consistently participated in support services (i.e., any pattern that did not contain a “no” response when asked whether that parent had participated in training or support services), (b) inconsistently participated in support services (i.e., any pattern that contained at least one “yes” and one “no” response), and (c) consistently not participating in support services (i.e., any pattern that did not contain any “yes” responses). These three groups were then compared on the same characteristics examined in Questions 3 and 4 at each of the three waves of data collection.</p>

<title>Availability of Parent Support Services in Schools</title>
<p>Overall, according to principal report on the School Characteristics Survey, 71.4% of students with ED represented in SEELS attended a school that offered at least one of the following: a parent liaison, a family resource center, or workshops or courses on parenting. A total of 63.8% of students attended a school that offered workshops or courses on parenting, 34.7% attended a school that offered a parent liaison, and 24.7% attended a school that offered a family resource center.</p>

<title>Comparison of Students With ED and Their Parents Who Reported Different Patterns of Participation in Support Activities in the School or Community Over Time</title>
<p>For the following analyses, three groups were created based on parent report of participation in meetings, programs, or trainings for families with children with disabilities over a 3-year period. The first group included parents who consistently reported that they participated in these activities and their children (approximately 30% of the current study sample). The second group included parents who inconsistently reported that they participated in these activities and their children (approximately 16% of the current study sample). The third group included parents who consistently reported that they did not participate in these activities and their children (approximately 54% of the current study sample). Results are presented for comparisons of the three groups at Waves 1, 2, and 3 of data collection.</p>
<p>At Wave 1, students whose parents consistently participated in these activities were more likely to be taking a prescription medication for a disability than students whose parents consistently did not participate in these activities (54.6% vs. 38.4%, <italic>F</italic> = 6.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Students whose parents consistently participated also had significantly higher scores on standardized tests of applied problem solving (95.60 vs. 87.16, <italic>F</italic> = 9.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and letter–word identification (91.38 vs. 84.84, <italic>F</italic> = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Parents who consistently participated in these activities also reported being more involved at their child’s school (<italic>F</italic> = 8.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and being significantly less satisfied (11.60 vs. 10.32, <italic>F</italic> = 4.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than parents who consistently reported that they did not participate in these activities.</p>
<p>At Wave 2, the three groups of students did not differ with regard to any of the variables considered for the current study. However, at the third wave of data collection, parents who consistently participated in these activities reported being more involved in their child’s school than parents who consistently did not participate in these activities (<italic>F</italic> = 7.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data from the nationally representative SEELS sample have provided a unique description of students who have ED, the schools they attended, their families, and services available at their schools that are intended to support parent involvement. Data were collected from principals, teachers, and parents as well as students. We focused on the relationship between school-provided support services that were aimed at improving parent involvement and factors associated with these programs.</p>
<sec id="section39-1044207312460889">
<title>Data From Three Different Sources</title>
<p>From principals, we found that 71% of students with ED attended schools that provided at least one of three parent support services (i.e., family liaison, family resource center, and/or workshops or courses on parenting). These findings document the widespread adoption of the notion of supporting parents whose children attend elementary schools and the emphasis that the education community has placed on this type of activity. There were no demographic differences at the school, student, or family level between schools that offered a parent support service and those that did not. Schools that did provide a parent support service, however, did offer more services overall than schools that did not provide this support, even when density of community resources was controlled. This finding is in line with previous research on improving and reforming schools, which demonstrated that these schools tend to offer more services in general and more services from community agencies colocated in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207312460889">Duchnowski &amp; Kutash, 2011</xref>). It also underscores that not all schools are providing the same or equal number of services, and this is an important consideration when looking at the differential outcomes of students across schools.</p>
<p>Teachers reported that 17% of parents received training, counseling, or supports from the school over a school year. However, 36% of parents reported participating in some type of either school- or community-based parent involvement/support activity. Students of these parents received a greater number of services from any source than students whose parents did not participate in these types of activities in the school or community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section40-1044207312460889">
<title>Characteristics Associated With Parent Involvement</title>
<p>Several differences emerged in family and student factors when the parents who did participate in parent support activities were compared with parents who did not participate. For example, children whose parents received support services from the school had less time elapse between parent’s first noticing evidence of a problem or disability in their child and first receipt of service (including special education services)—4 months versus 2 years. This gap has been viewed as a loss of valuable time for remediation and results in increased problem severity in children. The 2-year gap found for children who have ED has been documented in other studies and appears to be a typical pattern for this population of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207312460889">Duchnowski, Hall, Kutash, &amp; Friedman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207312460889">Greenbaum et al.,1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1044207312460889">Kutash et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207312460889">M. Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, Epstein, &amp; Sumi, 2005</xref>). Students whose parents received support services from the school spent more of their school day in special education settings. In addition, a greater percentage of students whose parents participated in support activities in the school or community were taking medication for behavior, mood, or emotions than students whose parents did not report participating in these activities. When these results are combined with the finding that students of parents who participated in support activities received more services from any source, it may be that higher use of medication is reflective of more contact with community-based medical professionals. This result remains speculative, however, as the data on various types of community-based services are not specified in the SEELS data set.</p>
<p>Parents who consistently participated in support activities in the school or in the community reported greater involvement in their child’s school. Furthermore, parents who participated in support activities in the school or community at some point in time were more likely to attend parent conferences and report greater involvement in their child’s education than nonparticipating parents. Conversely, they also reported less satisfaction with their child’s school and education program in an array of domains (overall school interactions, teacher interactions, and amount of homework), and this level of satisfaction is below national levels of parent satisfaction with elementary schools. This latter finding is counterintuitive in that it is commonly believed that greater involvement by parents would be associated with greater parent satisfaction with schools, and it will need further examination as to the quality, type, and duration of parent support activities offered by schools and communities. It may be that as parents become more involved with their child’s school and programs, they may also become more aware of federal and state regulations concerning special education and are learning new self-advocacy skills. As a result, they may have heightened expectations for their child’s program and may perceive weaknesses in the existing program, leading to dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207312460889">Bitterman, Daley, Misra, Carlson, &amp; Markowitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1044207312460889">Summers, Hoffman, Marquis, Turnbull, &amp; Poston, 2005</xref>). Another possibility is that this is characteristic of parents who have children with ED, and comparisons with parents of children with other types of disability and parents of nondisabled peers will need to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207312460889">Montes, Halterman, &amp; Magyar, 2009</xref>). Finally, and most importantly, for the education community, the students whose parents did participate in activities associated with parent involvement performed better on a test of problem-solving skills, indicating a possible association between greater parent involvement and academic achievement in students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207312460889">Jeynes, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207312460889">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312460889">Pomerantz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207312460889">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The empirical literature indicates that school programs intended to promote parent involvement have not been adequately evaluated and provide mixed results related to the effectiveness of these programs. Yet schools continue to view these initiatives as an important part of school improvement efforts. In the case of children with ED represented in SEELS, 71% attended schools that provided at least one such service. Both the socialization and helping agenda of parent involvement proposed by Adelman and Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207312460889">Center for School Based Mental Health, 2011</xref>) were evident, in that schools are offering programs that address parenting skills, behavior management, and linking parents with resources. Teachers report, however, only a small percentage of parents (17%) who have children with ED receive such services. More than one third of children, however, had parents who reported engaging in a school or community parent support activity, and our findings suggest that there are some positive factors associated with receipt of this type of service, including greater overall parent involvement in school, attending a parent–teacher conference, and greater academic success by students of these parents. Furthermore, the results suggest sustained involvement by parents over time in these types of activities is also associated with student academic success.</p>
<p>The overarching finding that many parents are involved in some parent support function is encouraging and suggests that efforts to learn how to engage more parents in these services would be worthwhile. The finding that parents who received the support services compared with those who did not had children who received significantly more services from any source (i.e., the school or community) is an important finding. Previous studies have illustrated the important role of community services in serving this population of students and the importance of colocating community-based services in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207312460889">Duchnowski &amp; Kutash, 2011</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1044207312460889">Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Green, 2011</xref>). It has been proposed that an effective approach to improving the outcomes of children who have ED and increasing their access to mental health services is through the development of collaborative, integrated systems of service between the schools and community providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312460889">Kutash et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1044207312460889">Pumareiga, &amp; Vance, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1044207312460889">Weisz, Sandler, Durlak, &amp; Anton, 2005</xref>). The current findings would support the continued development of such systems.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study was a secondary analysis of an existing data set on a nationally representative sample of children from all the disability categories identified by IDEA with only those children who were identified as having ED being analyzed in this study. Although SEELS has provided a wealth of information for us to examine, there were limits to our ability to conduct analyses of parent involvement at a deeper level. For example, we could not assess possible differences associated with group activities such as workshops and individual activities such as service from a family resource center. We do not know the content of the workshops and training that parents attended, and possible differences that might be associated with differences in subject matter. In addition, it was not possible to fully examine school-based and home-based activities. Furthermore, the interpretation of the results is limited by the different response rates across data sources.</p>
<p>However, we feel that given the dearth of information about this needy population and the history of poor outcomes for these students, we have found some important results in the study. These findings support continued efforts to further examine and explicate the relationship between parent involvement and outcomes of students who have ED.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section42-1044207312460889">
<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>Schools that educate children who have ED appear to have an array of services to promote parent involvement in their child’s education, and there are numerous federal policies that promote the involvement of parents in their child’s education as an important contributor to their child’s success. In the case of parents of children who have ED, there is a discrepancy between availability of service and engagement by parents in activities aimed to promote their involvement. The current challenge facing the field is to develop practices with effective content and mechanisms that would result in increased family engagement.</p>
<p>For example, expansion of school activities associated with Adelman and Taylor’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207312460889">Center for School Based Mental Health, 2011</xref>) socialization and helping agendas may be a fruitful area for researchers and school partners to pursue more fully. The findings from the current study and those in our review are consistent with Adelman and Taylor’s recommendation that schools focus on building skills in parents (socialization) and assisting with access to health and mental health care needed to overcome barriers to child learning (helping). Adelman and Taylor have provided leadership in promoting the need to make the implementation of strategies to increase parent involvement part of systemic reform in schools rather than just an “add-on” program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207312460889">Adelman &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Another approach would be to expand on individual support programs that use a peer-to-peer approach as an adjunct to schools’ efforts to engage parents and promote their involvement in the education and treatment of their children who have ED. Attention to peer-to-peer support has been described as exploding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1044207312460889">Hoagwood et al., 2010</xref>), and examples of models of this type of intervention are emerging in the literature. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207312460889">Kutash, Duchnowski, Green, and Ferron (2011)</xref> have demonstrated the efficacy of a parent-to-parent program that produced reduced caregiver strain, increased engagement with teachers and mental health service providers, and improved academic and behavioral outcomes for children. There is a need to examine the potential sources of support and reimbursement for these services so that schools will not be alone, especially during a time of shrinking budgets.</p>
