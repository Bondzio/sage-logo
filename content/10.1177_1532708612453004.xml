<abstract>
<p>Last fall, the author took his <italic>Politics and Education</italic> class to see <italic>Waiting For “Superman.”</italic> This was a movie we had been preparing to see all semester. The class focused on reading contemporary educational policy as a symptom of neoliberal economic and political ideology. We went into the movie knowing what we were going to see and how to critique it. But a funny thing happened on our way out of the theater—many of us were crying. Despite all our strong and tough ideological critiques, we were glassy-eyed and barely even able to remember who deregulation was and what Milton Friedman had to do with anything. After a semester of thinking with our heads, we were standing there feeling with our hearts. In this paper, the author reflects on these experiences by paying attention to his own pedagogy and how the critique of neoliberalism functions to both preclude and produce certain types of affects.</p>

<title>There’s Crying In Education Policy?</title>
<p>We, my undergraduates and I, were crying. We were in the lobby of a movie theater in Times Square —the neoliberal urban space par excellence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612453004">Delany, 1999</xref>)—on a class field trip they termed “neoliberal tourism.” We’d visited the charter schools associated with the Harlem Children’s Zone, the home offices of Teach For America (TFA), and then made our way to the theater to see <italic>Waiting For “Superman”</italic> (<italic>WFS</italic>).</p>
<p>Up until that point, our semester-long preparation of reading current education policy as part of a neoliberal agenda had kept us on our toes and suspicious. A well-balanced diet of political economy, ideology critique, and following the money proved to be a solid regiment. We <italic>knew</italic> what we were looking for. We <italic>knew</italic> how to situate it. We <italic>knew</italic> how to critique it. And yet, despite <italic>knowing</italic> all of these things, there we were, in the lobby, in public, <italic>crying</italic>.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time I’d cried at a movie. Even though I teach cultural studies and am trained in the hermeneutics of suspicion, movies make me cry, even ones that are classist, ableist, sexist, patriarchal, orientalizing, racist, and moreover normative in every possible way. Every time I cry at the end of <italic>The Blind Side</italic> or <italic>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</italic>, I’m reminded that there remains a gap between what my head is suspicious of and the way I sometimes feel. More importantly, these conflicted <italic>feelings</italic> exist for my students as well. Despite all of our doping on preventative critique, they too were having <italic>feelings</italic> that remained, even though they <italic>knew</italic> otherwise.</p>
<p>What I want to think about in this paper is why we were crying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612453004">1</xref></sup> We should have been bulletproof to the manipulative ways the film played politics by pulling on heartstrings. Instead, we were rattled. And so I want to explore two aspects of this situation below, both in relation to the systemic relationship between emotions and politics, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532708612453004">Clough and Halley (2007)</xref> call the “affective turn” in critical theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612453004">Ahmed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612453004">Butler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532708612453004">Love, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532708612453004">Ngai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612453004">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>). First, I want to think about how and what the critique of neoliberalism and neoliberal educational policy offers us. I will perform the strong, suspicious critique of neoliberalism and neoliberal education policy with which my class and I went into the theater prepared with, a critique in-line with the field of critical policy studies, which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612453004">Edmondson and D’Urso (2007)</xref> write, “involve careful consideration of the histories and the social attachments of policy and research ideals.” This reading will be an example of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612453004">Sedgwick (2003)</xref> calls a “paranoid reading” or what Jameson (1993) calls a “symptomatic reading”—the critical methods through which we seek to unveil, demystify, and plumb up the latent meanings that have been repressed by hegemonic narratives. This will provide a baseline to question what the critique allows us to know in terms of its production of content. What, actually, does the critique of neoliberalism tell us? More importantly, how does the methodology of the critique, that is, the way we gain access to knowledge via suspicion/paranoia, limit what we come to know and feel as a result? What does crying have to do with not only what we learn from critique of neoliberal ideology, but what does it have to do with the way in which a critique of neoliberal ideology comes to know about neoliberalism and ideology itself?</p>
<p>Second, from these questions I will then move onto thinking about crying as both a response to my own pedagogical decisions and also in relation to larger political and social structures. Like many theorists who have turned to affect as central to political inquiry, I will draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532708612453004">Raymond Williams’ (1985)</xref> notion of “structures of feelings” to help illuminate how the intimate world of feelings intersects with political ideologies and institutions. I will offer two hypotheses about how we might make sense of crying in relation to the political and will then conclude with thoughts on the difference between suspicion and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612453004">Giroux (2004)</xref> calls educated hope.</p>
<p>Attention to affects and feelings are important for this paper, as they have re-emerged as sites of interest to researchers and theorists within and as a result of neoliberalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612453004">2</xref></sup> The rise of neoliberal ideology and policy in the early 1970s played a big role in the fracturing of various socialist and labor movements that had once held culture and capital together in their struggles for freedom and redistribution. The emergent neoliberal logics of individualism and personal responsibility, coupled with the state and market accommodating for multiculturalism and lifestyle politics/consumerism, helped to foster new social movements based around identity politics. Though I don’t argue, as others have, that most of these rights-oriented groups lost their critiques of capital or that essentialist views of identity hemorrhaged solidarity and led to radical separatism, I would argue that the shift of emphasis to identity did transform the social and activist landscape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612453004">3</xref></sup> Ideology critique and analyses of power/knowledge helped to articulate how the particular—raced, gendered, sexed, dis/Abled bodies—experienced oppression. However, some have argued that pushing a critique of capital into a secondary or tertiary position marked a loss of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612453004">Harvey (2003)</xref> calls a “universal valency” that would have provided more connective tissue for solidarity (p. 179).</p>
<p>As capital took a more spectral position in activism and research, neoliberal policies drastically changed the geographical and temporal landscape of capitalism. The financialization, digitization, and transnationalization of capital radically decentered capitalism into an even more sublime and elusive system that became difficult to theorize within the constructs of Marxist totality thinkng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532708612453004">Robinson, 2004</xref>). And so when researchers and theorists returned to thinking about capital in late capitalism, it proved to be difficult, messy, and full of pointing fingers at faceless, abstract, and fragmentary no-things (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453004">Fischer, 2009</xref>). Further, though capitalism had been pushed into every nook and corner, totality thinking and analysis, which attempted to account for every nook and corner, proved unhelpful in thinking about the fractured and particular experiences within neoliberalism/late capitalism. The waning of totality thinking and the difficulty to perceive the systemic operations of capital both forced and enabled a phenomenological turn in research. Here we have affect.</p>
<p>First pioneered by feminist and queer thinkers, the turn to affect was a move to de-abstract analysis and provide an alternative route to thinking about larger structural/political institutions. Through thinking about everyday, ordinary, and public feelings, among other bodily affects, the production of an embodied data set that can disclose information about the systems in which we live emerges. We might say that the ascent of a sentimental surplus in excess of ideology critique is itself symptomatic of the neoliberal conjuncture. We feel because we can’t quite think our way out of the present. Thinking about feelings first is a critical move, but a critical move that puts faith in small-scale description rather than large-scale ideological exposure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612453004">Best &amp; Marcus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532708612453004">Love, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612453004">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>). Though neoliberalism is still in the background as some<italic>thing</italic> or even <italic>the</italic> thing that we are interested in, our interest begins not from a bird’s eye view, but from somewhere more immediate. The hope is that a different starting point might put us in a different relationship with the material and might lead to new formulations of communities and mobilizations.</p>

<title>The Diagnosis—or: A Paranoid, and Possibly Ad Hominem, Intertwined Reading of Neoliberalism and Educational Policy</title>
<p>Preliminary aside: In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612453004">Sedgwick’s (2003)</xref> critique of what she calls paranoid readings, she identifies five characteristics that we should pay attention to in the sketch I offer below of the critique of neoliberalism and neoliberal educational policy. She argues that paranoid readings are: anticipatory, reflexive and mimetic, strong theories, full of negative affects, and premised on a faith of exposure (p. 130). Although I offer a more formal exploration of these claims below, I believe naming them here offers the reader better access to my critique.</p>
<p>At the level of economic and political policies and discourses, neoliberalism has been in “ideological gestation” since around 1920 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532708612453004">Peck, 2010</xref>, p. 20). From both sides of the Atlantic, the building blocks of neoliberalism began to emerge through conversations about the relationship between free-markets and the state (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612453004">Gamble, 2009</xref>, pp. 70-84). Though without consensus about the details of the program, what materialized was some semblance of a market-based philosophy in which liberty, in the classical Liberal sense, is best defended and served by minimal statist intervention at the level of the individual and at the level of regulatory oversight of markets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532708612453004">4</xref></sup> The proto-neoliberal-neoliberals appropriated a discourse about democracy and pushed for competitive free markets in the same breath as speaking about political freedom and autonomous individualism. Neoliberalism as economic doctrine was justified at its political and philosophical core by populous recourse to individual freedom of choice as the ends of modern democratic societies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1532708612453004">Marx’s (1848/2005)</xref> critique of bourgeois notions of freedom is important here and finds its modern corollary in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453004">Wendy Brown’s (2011)</xref> analysis of neoliberal ideologies and policies that reduce “the political substance of democracy to rubble,” and then appropriates democracy “for its own purposes, with the consequence that ‘market democracy’—once a term of derision for right-wing governance by unregulated capital—is now an ordinary descriptor for a form that has precisely nothing to do with ruling themselves” (p. 48).</p>
<p>This marketization of democracy announces the “domination of politics by capital” and foregrounds an economic rationality over a political one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453004">Wendy Brown, 2011</xref>, p. 48). Citizens are reduced to homo economicus: “unattached individuals supposedly making rational choices in an unfettered market [that will] ultimately lead to a better society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612453004">Apple, 2005</xref>, p. 211). Neoliberals argue that markets, unfettered by big government, will solve social and economic problems that government now produces or exacerbates. As an on-going hegemonic process, neoliberalism either infantilizes communitarian and collective ideals or commodifies them by resignifying freedom, choice, liberty, and justice through a market-based vocabulary. The market becomes the arbiter not only of economic life, but of social life as well.</p>
<p>The ideological gestation for neoliberalism within U.S. educational policy is usually dated around 1955 with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612453004">Friedman’s (1962/2002)</xref> “The Role of Government in Education.” Using individual freedom as an alibi, Friedman argues that, insofar as democracy and citizenship require a certain set of core values and a baseline of literacy, the government has a vested interest and obligation to fund public education and perhaps set some standards. However and despite this obligation, Friedman argues, “competitive private enterprise is likely to be far more efficient in meeting consumer demand than either nationalized enterprises or enterprises run to serve other purposes” (p. 91). Foreshadowing a mix of vouchers and charter schools, Friedman concludes that parents should be given
<disp-quote><p>a specified sum to be used solely in paying for his general education [vouchers]; the parents would be free to spend this sum at a school of their own choice, provided it met certain minimum standards laid down by the appropriate government unit [charters] . . . Government would serve its proper function of improving the operation of the invisible hand without substituting the dead hand of bureaucracy. (p. 91)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Though this brand of educational market orthodoxy failed to win over the hearts and minds of mainstream America, a seed had certainly been planted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612453004">Henig, 2009</xref>, pp. 41-42).</p>
<p>Scholars usually cite two historical moments that led to the rise of the neoliberal world order. The first was the crisis of overaccumulation that began emerging in the mid-1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532708612453004">5</xref></sup> Though primarily caused by the vulnerability of fixed capital and uneven global development, blame for the slowdown was placed on labor (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612453004">Brenner, 2006</xref>). In 1973, with an OPEC induced oil crisis and stagflation slowing down the U.S. economy, the conditions were set for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532708612453004">Naomi Klein (2008)</xref> refers to as a “shock doctrine” of radical political and economic change. “Capitalism,” Robin Hahnels reminds us, “is the manic-depressive patient. Exuberance, unbridled optimism and euphoria—followed by gloom, listlessness and depression—are the natural state of capitalist economies” (p. 3). Keynesian policy pills “worked” on capitalism for a while to keep profits from flowing only upward and providing some social safety nets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532708612453004">6</xref></sup> Becoming resistant to the medicine, “neoliberal think tanks at the margins of public policy stepped forward to put forward their economic, political, and ideological prescriptions: Societies function best when individuals are free to pursue their interests in the market without government intervention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612453004">Lipman, 2011</xref>, p. 8). The second epicenter represents the institutionalization of these policies that occurred between the years 1978-1980, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532708612453004">Harvey (2005)</xref> calls the “revolutionary turning point in the world’s social and economic history” (p. 1). For the purposes of this paper, this meant the election of Ronald Reagan and his ideological entourage of Paul Volcker and Milton Friedman taking residence at the White House and subsequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</p>
<p>Having run with campaign promises and educational policies that included “prayer in schools, vouchers for private school tuition, tuition tax credits, [and] the abolition of the Department of Education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532708612453004">Graham, 2005</xref>, p. 153), the election of Reagan was also fundamental in advancing the neoliberal agenda in education. Reagan’s federally commissioned <italic>A Nation At Risk</italic> report set the stage for changing the discourse about public education: <italic>failure</italic>. Using the Cold War as a backdrop and colored with militaristic rhetoric, <italic>A Nation at Risk</italic> “charged that . . . failure reflected systematic weakness in our school programs and lack of talent and motivation among American educators” (Berliner &amp; Biddle, 1996, p. 3). The report blamed public education for the economic recession and intuited that if the U.S. did not fix the system we would lose our standing as the economic leaders of the free world. The authors of the report offer several remedies to this situation, all of which have become well-worn sound bites: “standards, accountability, pluralism, competition, and choice” (Jackson, 2007, p. 225).</p>
<p>The role of the state in neoliberal doctrine became institutionalized through what is referred to as <italic>The Washington Consensus</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612453004">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612453004">Gamble, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532708612453004">Peck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532708612453004">Peterson, 2003</xref>). In close collaboration with Washington, the IMF and the World Bank created what were called Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPs) for countries looking for development loans. SAPs were created to assist in “modernizing” poor countries’ economies through neoliberal policies that would primarily help to deal with overaccumulated capital. The disbursal of the loans was contingent on accepting a prescription that Steger and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1532708612453004">Roy (2010)</xref> term D-L-P: Deregulation, Liberalization, and Privatization (p. 14). Under the auspices of market efficiency and comparative advantages, a country’s borders were opened to global competition creating what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612453004">Harvey (2003)</xref> calls “spatio-temporal fixes” for capital (p. 139). D-L-P created profitable investment for the private and wealthy class by opening new markets to buy from and sell to, by making the world’s resources open to the highest bidder (or the largest military), and by turning the world’s population into a global labor reserve army of workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532708612453004">7</xref></sup> Many people in these countries were dispossessed of previously state or publicly owned businesses and were now at the will of transnational corporations fixated on profit. Capital, now free to move about the globe at will, could invest and then pick up and leave whenever it needed new quick fixes for capital accumulation. Despite the theory of minimal or small government, neoliberal policies needed a strong friend in the state to “dismantle Keynesian policies and institutions and create new institutional arrangements, political coalitions, and policy infrastructure conducive to privatization and capital accumulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612453004">Lipman, 2011</xref>, p. 9). As the state withdraws from offering public services, entrepreneurial individuals are “empowered” to take responsibility for the success and failures of attaining services once provided by the state (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612453004">Burchell, 1996</xref>). Failure to attain services is seen as a personal flaw or a neglect of personal responsibility as opposed to being related to social realities of inequitable circumstances.</p>
<p>It was the Clinton administration’s “Third Way” and “globalization with a human face” rhetoric that primed the American public for the shifts to come on the education front by making neoliberal policy safe for liberals, many of whom were getting wealthy from the stock bubbles of the 90s. Clintonian rhetoric hedged that transnational globalization was the best possible program to ensure “prosperity, peace, and democracy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532708612453004">Rupert, 2000</xref>, p. 64), but that also “government should be involved in the provision of goods and services such as education and health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612453004">Arestis &amp; Sawyer, 2005</xref>, p. 177). However, and in tension with older social democratic models, the Third Way saw that within the government provision of social goods “there should be some mimicking of the market through, for example, competition between schools for funding and pupils” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612453004">Arestis &amp; Sawyer, 2005</xref>, p. 177). Whereas Friedman’s rhetoric of freedom and liberty sounded self-serving, Clinton, with his cool and reassuring demeanor, convincingly married neoliberal policy with social justice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532708612453004">Muppidi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532708612453004">Rupert, 2000</xref>). He did this in part by framing his arguments about economic policy decisions not as political but as scientific (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532708612453004">Peterson, 2003</xref>). The value-free benevolence of positivism was once again called on to be a trope for rational and modern thinking. Opponents or critics of neoliberal globalization were positioned as “unscientific [and] the product of delusional thinking and irrational fears” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532708612453004">Rupert, 2000</xref>, p. 59). Markets and business models worked to bring about better lives and the government was going to start running public goods programs and institutions based on those same “successful” models.</p>
<p>As such, a corporatist ethos of standards and responsibility/accountability were part and parcel of Clinton’s 1994 reauthorization of ESEA. Justified through a global competition rhetoric introduced in <italic>A Nation At Risk</italic>, the business model approach to education reform would attempt to standardize practice and make individuals accountable for their successes or failures. Standards, supposedly objectively determined, would establish the various subject-related skills for which teachers would be held accountable.</p>
<p>Teachers and administrators would be accountable for making sure students learn. And, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532708612453004">David Hursh (2007)</xref> writes about the ideological windfall of the standards movement, standardized tests would “provide a valid and reliable means of assessing student learning” (p. 298). Gone was any language hinting at social inequality, inputs, or education as a relational practice centered on democratic citizenship and ethics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532708612453004">Johnston, 2006</xref>; Rose, 2010). What prevailed was what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453004">Biesta (2010)</xref> calls “learnification”: a term that represents the “transformation of the vocabulary used to talk about education” as a measurable utility of human-capital acquisition and outputs (p. 18). Clinton basically outlined the underlying foundation for <italic>No Child Left Behind</italic> (NCLB) and stabilized bipartisan support for it. The only thing missing from his act was provision for the federal government to administer rewards and punishments, which would have given accountability some teeth. Clinton though, with reelection in mind, knew he would be unable to give the federal government that much power without major pushback from those unwilling to concede that much local control to the state. NCLB is the legislation that did give the federal government control (to administer rewards and punishments); much has been much already written about NCLB as a product of neoliberal ideology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453004">Apple, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453004">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532708612453004">Hursh, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532708612453004">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532708612453004">Lipman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532708612453004">Saltman, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1532708612453004">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532708612453004">2010</xref>). Though I will not detail the nuts and bolts of the legislation, I do want to briefly consider thinking about NCLB as an SAP for public education.</p>
<p>SAPs are invoked with a kind of selective amnesia with regard to the history of oppression and colonialism. Left in a state of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532708612453004">Walter Rodney (1974/1981)</xref> has called <italic>underdevelopment</italic>, many colonized nations have needed loans from the IMF and World Bank. However, instead of addressing the vestiges of history and focusing on long-term investment, SAPs use a familiar moralizing discourse about civilization and progress to recreate the very dependency and profitable dehumanization fostered by colonization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612453004">Cèsaire, 1972/2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612453004">DuBois, 1920/2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The same kind of selective amnesia is evident with NCLB, which fails to address the ways poor communities and many communities of color have been underdeveloped by a legacy of oppression and slavery. As opposed to seeing the achievement gap as a “symptom of a cumulative history of oppression and racial discrimination,” NCLB treats it as a matter of failed effort and operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453004">Brown, 2007</xref>, p. 128). NCLB does not address the ways a discourse of colorblindness has resegregated most public schools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532708612453004">Orfield, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1532708612453004">Wells &amp; Frankenberg, 2007</xref>). NCLB does not talk about racial housing segregation, gerrymandering, and the drastic infrastructural inequalities we see between school districts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532708612453004">Kozol, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532708612453004">Orfield, 1996b</xref>). NCLB does not engage with any of the literature about the relationship between social class and test scores (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532708612453004">Rothstien, 2004</xref>). Instead of addressing these larger, structural impediments suffocating traditional schooling, NCLB uses a moralizing rhetoric about failure and social justice to dispossess schools of local control over curriculum and to legislate a normative mode of assessing intelligence and achievement. The biopolitics of NCLB include individuating teachers and students into test scores and holding them as sole proprietors of their success and failure—no excuses and no soft bigotry of low expectations, as President Bush liked to say. Personal responsibility is the mandated ethos and so we don’t have to focus on all the social variables factoring into the equation.</p>
<p>SAPs push for markets and privatization through a D-L-P formula. As development and the economy are <italic>failing</italic> and neoliberal ideology <italic>blames</italic> the inefficiency on the regulatory state, the market emerges as the common sense mechanism to address social issues. Although NCLB similarly exploits D-L-P, it first invokes F-T-F-B, or <italic>Failure, Testing, Failure, Blame</italic>. Taking a publicity cue from <italic>A Nation at Risk</italic>, NCLB begins by exaggerating the crisis of failure: <italic>all</italic> public schools are leaving children behind and this is disastrous for our standing in the global economy. To solve this crisis, we are going to test students at every juncture. These tests are going to be linked to a set of standards. Given the reality that many socially marginalized students are not going to pass these tests and be proficient by 2014 (without, of course, gaming the system, cooking the books, and having rampant cheating (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453004">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532708612453004">Goldstein, 2011</xref>; <italic>The Wire: Season Four</italic>)), the hopelessness of the project of public education is reinforced.</p>
<p>Numbers and their relationship to discourses about effectiveness tie all of this together. The public is coerced to thinking that standardized test results tell us something about what we value about education. The trope of effectiveness frames these numbers vis-à-vis valuation. High numbers are good, low numbers are bad. The realist weight of positivism legitimizes this way of thinking. As test scores come back and are made “transparent” to publics, a compelling argument that supports claims of bureaucratic ineffectiveness and labor’s unwillingness to implement <italic>real</italic> reform emerges. These numbers then set the precedent for the broad based support from the left, the right, and the disenfranchised for neoliberal policies like charters and choice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612453004">Apple, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612453004">Brill, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612453004">Henig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612453004">Pedroni, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1532708612453004">Stulberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612453004">Wells et. al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The portrait of failure, that I’ve argued is part and parcel of NCLB, sets the stage for D-L-P. Punitive punishments applied to schools that don’t achieve AYP create big profits for private tutoring services (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532708612453004">Koyama, 2010</xref>), textbook companies (e.g., Leistya, 2007), and for-profit education management companies taking over failing and turnaround schools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612453004">Lipman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532708612453004">Saltman 2005</xref>, 2009). Further, the second part of the failure and blame equation has opened the deregulatory door for charter schools and alternative certification floodgates. Backed by a mix of Wall St. money (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612453004">Gabriel &amp; Medina, 2010</xref>) and the celebrity venture philanthropists (Gates, Broad, and Walton), charters and alternative certification programs have been constructed as socially just/entrepreneurial solutions to inner city educational problems (e.g., Kovacs, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612453004">Lipman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532708612453004">Ravitch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532708612453004">Saltman, 2010</xref>). As student performance on tests is causally linked to teacher performance despite the weight of historical evidence that poverty is the more appropriate target, unions and colleges of education have come under intense scrutiny. In the non-nuanced argument of the neoliberal chorus, unions protect bad teachers from being fired and prevent the competitive push of performance pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532708612453004">Klein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532708612453004">Klein &amp; Rhee, 2010</xref>), while schools of education focus exclusively on democracy and social justice and fail to train teachers in the management techniques that would magically produce high achievement and test scores (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612453004">Giroux, 2010</xref>). This additional narrative about accountability failure opens up a marketplace for alternative certification programs, whose curriculum reinforces the same selective amnesia with regard to underdevelopment. These programs leave teachers uneducated about the issues they are actually facing in the classroom. Invoking a notion of choice that has more in common with consumption than an active participation in the curricular and institutional decision-making, “public” charter schools use a mantra “autonomy” and “freedom” (Liberalism) as a form of consensus building (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532708612453004">Rofes, 2004</xref>). Just as Clinton easily positioned dissenters from market ideology as non-scientific and delusional, the neoliberal chorus dismisses oppositional voices as reaffirming the unsatisfactory status-quo, while neoliberal policies get signified as <italic>real</italic> reform (enter <italic>WFS</italic>). Parents and community members, who correctly observe that charter schools are displacing their neighborhood schools, historically the backbone of their communities, are dismissed as irrational along with university researchers.</p>
<p>In terms of the logical of capital, both charters and alternative teaching certification programs can be thought of as spatio-temporal fixes, offering new outlets for capital in ready-made markets. Broad, Walton, and Gates have been using the money they’ve made in the private sector, in many cases in exploitative ways, to push for privatization in the domestic educational sector. Opening the public schooling market would be lucrative for private companies as they would be able to find possible profits as they dispossess communities of their public schools and run them for profit. Far from withdrawing, the role of the state (federal) in the creation of charters and alternative teaching depots has basically been that of blackmail. <italic>Race To The Top</italic> dangled much needed federal aid to states if and only if they raised their charter caps, moved to deregulate certification programs, and made testing count for a larger percentage of teachers’ evaluations.</p>
<p>The effects of neoliberalism and neoliberal educational policy become significant shapers of the ways we experience personal and social life. In discussing the ascendency of the dystopian culture of neoliberalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612453004">Giroux (2002)</xref> writes that one of the consequences “is that civic discourse has given way to the language of commercialism, privatization and deregulation. In addition, individual and social agency are defined largely through market-driven notion of individualism, competition, and consumption” (p. 426). A collective-political imaginary by way of something called <italic>the public</italic> takes on a pejorative and often racialized notion of bad, broken, and lazy. Being “informed” by media companies, with holdings in everything from the standardized testing market to the military market, leaves most people without access to information that might make political action possible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612453004">Hind, 2011</xref>). Uninformed, acquiescent, and without alternative imaginaries, democracy has become
<disp-quote>
<p>a class ideology justifying systems that allow . . . a very small number of people to govern—and to govern without the people, so to speak; systems that seem to exclude any other possibility than the infinite reproduction of their own functioning. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532708612453004">Ross, 2011</xref>, p. 97)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because neoliberal discourse has so thoroughly insinuated itself into public school cultures, their basic historic mission, teaching young people how to participate in democratic deliberation, has been completely usurped.</p>

<title>Thinking About How the Critique I Performed Is Also Performative</title>
<p>If this is all right, if all the critiques we studied were correct, then why were we crying? To think about crying, we need to shift from thinking about <italic>what</italic> we learned above, to thinking about <italic>how</italic> the above critique educates us. In other words, I performed the critique of neoliberalism. I now want to think about the ways that the critique is performative, as a way of knowing, and also how <italic>the way</italic> it performs knowing affects a reader. How is it that we were so completely seduced by the emotional manipulation of the performance of the very neoliberal chorus we invalidated?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612453004">Sedgwick’s (2003)</xref> “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading, Or, You’re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You,” in her <italic>Touching Feeling</italic>, lays out an argument to help us think through this question. The essay begins by suggesting that what she calls paranoid readings—”New Historicist, deconstructive, feminist, queer, and psychoanalytic criticisms” (p. 125)—have become something of a normative moral injunction in contemporary theory. To do scholarship, you must be in the business of demystification and ideology/false consciousness critique. However, she argues, <italic>only</italic> using these modes of inquiry, the progeny of the suspiciously hermeneutical Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche, has “impoverished the gene pool” of critical tools and “the trouble with a shallow gene pool . . . is its diminished ability to respond to environmental (e.g., political) change” (p. 144).</p>
<p>The problem in these theories for Sedgwick, who throughout the essay acknowledges her own use of them, lies in paranoia as a mental/textual environment for knowing. Paranoia is marked by a defensive alertness, which affects its ways of knowing and the things in which it offers as knowledge. Sedgwick argues that paranoia is anticipatory, reflexive and mimetic, a strong theory, full of negative affects, and faithful to exposure (p. 130). First, as paranoia is averse to surprise, it anticipates surprise by knowing always and already. Even before engaging with a text or policy, that policy is already marked by the thing one is paranoid about (e.g., neoliberalism). Second, to be understood, paranoia must imitate itself. The criticisms paranoia generates tend to sound alike and absorb the entire field of attention. This is why, above, I interspersed the paragraphs about neoliberal education policy and neoliberalism in order to conflate them. It’s the same story about different things (e.g., neoliberalism). Sedgwick’s third point is that paranoia is strong because of the vast topography it can digest and control. It can conflate any phenomenon with its formulation. It gains strength and legitimacy by proving the assumptions it already believes. Everything is understood as such (e.g., neoliberalism). Fourth, the pleasure, if any, gained from paranoid reading is a pleasure derived from being protected by paranoia’s anticipatory and strong disposition. Suspicion is a negative affect (e.g., everything is neoliberalism, and this is bad). The cynicism thus produced blocks positive affects that could incite movement towards caring and social repair. Last, paranoia works to expose hidden meanings in texts for what they really are (e.g., neoliberalism). Sedgwick argues that faith in exposure becomes the foundation for inciting social change. An “ah-ha” or “I told you so” that results from demystification is not the best means of mobilizing and collectivizing political bodies.</p>
<p>Sedgwick charges, and I agree with her, that doing the type of critique as I have above affects readers not as a result of content, but as a result of its affective position as paranoid, or the ways a/the critique comes to know, which affects what it knows. Paranoid temporality, topography, affective register, and inevitability leave little room for hope, save for a token paragraph or two at the end of an article or book that uses words like democracy, organizing, reclaiming, or hope. Sedgwick offers a method for addressing these problems that I will return to in the end of this paper. And now, and with the critique of the critique in mind, let’s go back to the movie theater and revisit our tears.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1532708612453004">
<title>Wah</title>
<p>But let’s start in the classroom. The critique of neoliberalism above introduced some of the texts I taught and how I taught them. My students and I started with what neoliberalism is, where it came from, and how it perverts out conception of democracy and democracy itself. Then we focused on specific neoliberal educational policy: NCLB; Choice, Charters, and Markets; Teachers’ Unions, Teach For America, and Alternative Certification; and For-Profit Higher Education. The narrative worked, so to speak, and by about half way through the semester, the students were adept at launching these critiques on their own. They had taken ownership/gotten good at <italic>imitating</italic> the language (mimesis) and could <italic>anticipate</italic> how a policy could be critiqued as being part of the neoliberal world order. At some point, critiques seemed to run on suspicious autopilot. I would walk in and say something like <italic>Race To The Top</italic>, and then, like Linda Richman on the <italic>Saturday Night Live</italic> sketch “Coffee Talk,” I would say, “Discuss.”</p>
<p>An unflattering, but possibly realistic hypothesis as to why my students were crying was because in the class, in discussions and on papers, they were merely being students. They knew what I wanted to hear and they got good at saying it because they had so many examples. Maybe they wanted to please me as the teacher. Perhaps they thought that the critiques we were doing in class were correct. And they did. . .I think. However, and this is commentary on my own pedagogy, without positive affects or alternative visions, the critique fails to break the “There Is No Alternative” realism of late capitalism. Instead, a class on critiques of neoliberalism functions within the logic of neoliberalism itself as performing anti-capitalism/anti-neoliberalism is part of capitalist/neoliberal logic.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453004">Fisher (2009)</xref> illustrates this point in a reading of Disney/Pixar’s film <italic>Wall-E</italic>. The film shows an earth no longer inhabitable as a result of consumer capitalism and corporations. People of this time period are “infantile and obese, interacting via screen interfaces, carried around in large motorized chairs, and supping indeterminate slop from cups” (p. 12). Critics, he notes, condemned the film as a satire of its own audience. But if it was satire, it was satire that functioned not as a wake-up call, but as a form of “interpassivity” (p. 12)—in other words the critique that is performed in the film allows the audience to “continue to consume with impunity” (p. 12) The audience knows that consumer capitalism and corporations are destroying environments—they believe the representation—but their belief doesn’t affect their behavior. Instead, the film performs their anti-capitalism for them. <italic>Knowing</italic> that capitalism destroys the earth, and knowing this is bad, allows one to further engage in harmful practices without guilt as there are no other options.</p>
<p>Žižek argues that this is telling at the level of how ideology works today. Moving beyond the Satrean paradigm of false consciousness, he argues that it’s no longer “we know not what we do” but that we know (consumer capital and corporations are pillaging the earth; that charter schools are quick fixes), and do anyway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532708612453004">Žižek, 1989</xref>, pp. 28-30, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1532708612453004">1994</xref>, p. 8). Ideology critique, paranoid readings, and demystification have been incorporated into the logic of capitalism, as knowing itself becomes a type of buffer that keeps a safe distance between belief and action. “So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is bad,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453004">Fisher (2009)</xref> writes, “we are free to continue to participate in capitalist exchange” (p. 13). So long as we believe (in our hearts and in our essays and in the classroom) that neoliberal educational policy is bad, we are free to participate in neoliberal sentimentality because we’ve already disavowed it. This is what some refer to as “cynical reason” or “enlightened false consciousness.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1532708612453004">Carolyn Veldstra (2011)</xref> argues, many authors suggest that it marks an “end of politics—a moment where an activist approach based on unveiling the misdeeds of dominant structures of power no longer functions.” If cynicism was once used to propel political activism by piercing holes in hegemonic culture, modern cynicism is merely a disposition without recourse to actual politics or actions. We <italic>know</italic>, and yet this allows us to <italic>do</italic> and <italic>feel</italic> as if we didn’t. My class could have functioned as a space of interpassivity—it provided an intellectual alibi for the students to know what they were watching was rubbish, but to feel and maybe believe otherwise.</p>
<p>Further, it’s possible to see how capital and corporations have taken advantage of this cool, cynical reason. When corporations offer consumption as a means to address global issues (“Proceeds From This Shirt Supports ______”), not only are they taking advantage of “knowing but doing anyway”, but they also have found a way to turn this transaction into a positive, ego-boosting experience. The shopper is cynical of consumption or knows how consumption is linked to slave labor, yet will do it anyway because shoppers must somehow purchase things and quench social desires, and now they can do so in such a manner that feels socially just. Thinking about Bono’s Product Red brand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453004">Fisher (2009)</xref> recalls that the slogan was: “Philanthropy is like hippy music, holding hands . . . Red is more like punk rock, hip hop, this should feel like hard commerce” (p. 15). The act of individualistic consumption itself is the thing that is linked to social justice. There is no mention of political factors, no mention of how capitalism is linked to the issues commerce is attempting to address, no need for systemic change. Instead status quo actions are given an immediate ethical imperative, which then are supposed to count as politics. Such is the life of the citizen in neoliberalism—politics reduced to consumption and voting booths (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532708612453004">Munck, 2005</xref>). Kathleen Stewart, in her beautiful book <italic>Ordinary Affects</italic> (2007), calls the process of gathering around these types of campaigns “swarming” (p. 70). The energy and buzz from these campaigns provide a “hint of energy” that momentarily mitigates our typical hopelessness within neoliberalism. They represent “something to do” in a world where doing feels all but impossible (p. 70).</p>
<p>The logic of <italic>Waiting For “Superman”</italic> works well within this framework: charter schools, positioned as a radical break, do not radically change the structural and systemic issues that plague society and public education. The superhero trope in the film is telling on this front. Superheroes like Batman and Superman and Captain America hold a special discursive place in the American imaginary. They save innocent, everyday, normal folks—especially vulnerable women and children—from the evils that lurk in metropolitan/public spaces. However, they are not public servants in the democratic sense, but rather individuals taking justice into their own hands in order to restore and reaffirm traditional law and order. In this sense, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453004">Umberto Eco (1972)</xref> has argued, superheroes are actually conservative figures who merely restore rather than transform society or challenge social norms. In relation to democracy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532708612453004">Van Heertum and Hinton (2010)</xref> write that superhero films
<disp-quote>
<p>fall under the rubric of the American monomyth . . . an escapist fantasy where a generally solitary, violent individual, or small group saves a community from some great evil—betraying the ideals of democratic responsibility and participation, of reasoned and intelligent debate and of reins on power. (p. 27)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Crying, then, was about both the inability of paranoia to really work as form of protest and critique <italic>and</italic> about the way anti-capitalism/anti-neoliberal critique functions as a means to reaffirm status quo politics. The critiques of neoliberalism worked as a classroom exercise, worked as a pleasant mode of communication, worked in terms of grade inflation, and worked insofar as the students might actually have believed it. However, the film, picturing charter schools performing miracles, superheroes, and beautiful children with caring families, provided a type of neoliberal Utopian space. This space allowed my students to know their critiques and yet feel the ahistorical safety to play out their desires for choice and freedom from public depravity. Crying was a manifestation of cynical distance, a manifestation of There Is No Alternative, a manifestation of the seduction of a positive, funded by big business, affect. They swarmed to the movie as it managed to cultivate a sense of “we,” as it organized people around its tragic narrative.</p>
<p>That’s one way to interpret the crying, a way that has some theoretical cachè and is sufficiently cynical in its own right. But I’m not sure if I completely buy it. Working from Ngai’s <italic>Ugly Feelings</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532708612453004">2005</xref>), I instead want to consider crying not as cynical reason or enlightened false consciousness, but as feelings of what Ngai calls “obstructed agency” (p. 3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532708612453004">8</xref></sup> Instead of reading crying as a manifestation of cynicism, I instead want to consider crying as yearning or desire for the positive affects that don’t get represented in contemporary debate or culture. If, as Williams suggests in his notion of “structures of feeling,” affects are related to social institutions that structure social life, and as Williams suggests, the relationship between structure and subject is fluid, then those structures/ideologies that influence affect are changeable. However, and in direct relation to Sedgwick’s critique of paranoid readings above, my own pedagogy failed to engage with alternative/Utopian/reparative visions of possible futures. In doing so, and in spending so much time being paranoid, I lost the opportunity to provide my students spaces to imagine alternative futures and to study concrete examples of democratic schooling. Crying, then, represents an obstructed agency to imagine something of what Marcuse called a new sensibility or an outside or alternative Utopian space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532708612453004">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crying was, simply, a cry for help. A cry not of the critique of neoliberalism, but from what the critique of neoliberalism left behind: paranoia, negative affects, and a faith in demystification as a means of moving forward. Crying was not about buying the film’s Utopian melodrama, but about the recognition about how un-Utopian the picture was and the lack of representations of their collective desires for a positive affect that could help articulate their own Utopian wishes for public education. In this sense, crying can be seen as an ambivalent intimation of betrayal between our feelings for some<italic>thing</italic> and our heads’ recognition that was being represented was not that <italic>thing</italic>. Disconnect between what we saw and what we felt forced us to confront the grim reality that our strong, paranoid critiques did not provide recuperation for our own desires. With our dissent of the cognitive or manifest aspects of the film we, were sent into a state of mourning for our own desires and hopes that the film withheld form the screen. We wanted the positive kernel. We wanted a happy ending. But we didn’t want it like this. We wanted something that was being withheld from representation, something that our strong critiques never quite provided. In other words, crying was a manifestation of obstructed representations of hope that are difficult to see in popular culture and critical literature and are difficult to necessarily believe in whence one is so thoroughly paranoid.</p>
<p>To flesh out this hypothesis, we might briefly want to discuss here how Sedgwick’s critiques of paranoid readings as being strong theories and full of negative affects lead to obstructed agency. In terms of the first, the critique I performed is a grand narrative that pays little attention, at the level of performance, to detail and lived experience. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532708612453004">Heather Love (2010)</xref> suggests,
<disp-quote>
<p>strong theory can organize vast amounts of territory and tell big truths, [but] it misses the descriptive richness of weak theory. Weak theory stays local, gives up on hypervigilance for attentiveness; instead of powerful reductions, it prefers acts of noticing, being affected, taking joy, and making whole. (p. 238)</p>

<p>Similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612453004">Best and Marcus (2009)</xref> call surface reading—“what is evident, perceptible, apprehensible in texts; what is neither hidden nor hiding; what, in the geometrical sense, has length and breadth but no thickness, and therefore covers no depth” (p. 9)—weak and local theories de-abstract the thing in focus into smaller parts. It is not that local or surface readings aren’t interested in analysis and critique. Instead, supporters of these alternative readings recognize the impasse that traditional ideological demystification faces. Starting from somewhere else, with a different set of tools, someplace buoyed up by describable phenomenon, might help get a different perspective on the thing in which one is interested (e.g., neoliberalism) and inaugurate new forms of social collectivity. If we can use close description to illuminate overlap in affect or feeling, then a move to politicizing those feelings, or analyzing them as part of a larger systemic structure, is possible. Assembling people to see their experiences as political recognizes Williams’ bridge between structure/ideology and feelings: listening to the ways in which affects find overlap within social situations and structures, can aid in collectivizing and mobilizing those affected to work to change the structures from which affects emanate. As strong theories, paranoid readings provide little in terms of things to hold on to. In this way, they obstruct the types of political action they most likely set forth to achieve.</p>
<p>A second and related reason for obstructed agency is paranoid readings’ lack of positive affects. Sedgwick and Love both argue that paranoia is averse to surprises, which is why it is anticipatory. The paranoid is always trying to protect herself from humiliation by constantly trying to expose that which presents the possibility of humiliation. As the paranoid person is thought of as an immovable personality type, it is locked into a mode of looking at the world that is on constant prowl for <italic>it</italic> (e.g., neoliberalism). Good feelings come only as the paranoid exposes another iteration of <italic>it</italic> (e.g., neoliberalism). There is no escaping or treatment for the paranoia, so the future becomes obsessed with keeping surprises at bay.</p>
<p>As I started sketching above, there are alternative ways of going about approaching texts, some of which are not averse to surprises and positive affects. Using Melanie Klein’s notion of a psychological <italic>position</italic> to juxtapose the immovability of the paranoid <italic>type</italic>, Sedgwick argues that positions are relational postures that can oscillate between various stages of repair and disrepair (p. 128). Unlike the rigidity of strong paranoia, alternative readings can move from a depressed to a more positive position given one’s relationality to various social and textual structures. One does not shift out of paranoia. Instead, to be stronger, one becomes more paranoid, shutting off other modes of experiencing the world. However, beginning from a different, less anxiety ridden, starting point, alternative ways of experiencing the world and being affected by that world emerge. Most notably for both Love and Sedgwick, is that non-paranoid readings leave open the possibility to be surprised. And, Sedgwick argues, “there can be bad surprises, however, there can also be good ones” (p. 146). But the paranoid, shut down to all surprises, never reaches the good ones. Sedgwick argues that these good surprises can, in some instances, be the traumatic surprise of hope, a positive affect that can facilitate an oscillation toward a more repaired, collective, and politically engaged position. Strength and negative affect feed on each other for the paranoid reading, leaving little room for weaker modes of engagement and positive affects. There might be a token paragraph about “taking back public education” or about “democratic futures,” but this rhetoric fails at some baseline level to empower, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612453004">Elizabeth Ellsworth (1989)</xref> has argued, students in a sustained and daily register.</p>
<p>Within this hypothesis, my students’ tears are about the inability to oscillate from There Is No Alternative to a different psycho-socio-politico position. It’s not that they believed the positive charge of the film, or that they weren’t fully committed to the critique of the neoliberal policies represented. It’s that they couldn’t respond with anything but a paranoid reading of the film, facilitating more negative affects without having a countering realistically positive vision for democratic life. Feeling obstructed from agency, from collective thought, and from positive affects, crying was result of a desire to feel some repair, but instead, still feeling paranoid.</p>

<title>From Suspicious Minds to Educated Hope</title>
<p>The first part of the title of this paper is taken from a song titled “Suspicious Minds,” which has been most famously recorded by Elvis Presley. The song tells the story about two people in a relationship who seemingly love each other, and yet can’t move on from the plateau they are on to the next, possibly more intimate, plateau as one of them has a suspicious mind about the other. To do a normative assessment of the song, and to think that since Elvis is singing he is the first-person narrator, it seems like Elvis’ lady-friend is suspicious about his fidelity and they therefore can’t “build their dreams” because she has a suspicious mind. But the opening lines of the song are also interesting. He says, “We’re caught in trap/I can’t walk out/Because I love you too much baby.” And so despite her inability to trust him, despite her suspicion and what it’s doing to their relationship, he won’t walk about because he loves her too much, baby. He knows they have to move on from suspicion, but they can’t quite figure out how.</p>
<p>This, I think, is a good metaphor for my students and their crying. I think for a lot of these students they fell in love with the idea of social justice and wanting to go out into the world to help. And then they took my class and, on top of what they might have already taken in via osmosis from other classes, I drilled them with suspicious critique to a point where they may have lost some of their ability to figure out a way out of the present moment. It seems impossible. Everything seemed suspect; everyone out for personal gain. Somewhere in what I was calling <italic>critical education</italic>, they lost a certain kind of longing and hoping and replaced that with paranoia. And if we take The King at his word, which I’m assuming we should, he tell us, “We can’t build our dreams/On suspicious minds.” And so, synthesizing the two characters of the song, my students have suspicious minds and yet, like Elvis, are caught in trap because they won’t walk out on the issues that they see as important. They have fidelity to the issues and suspicion, but it’s hard to build their dreams on this foundation. The question is how can they move forward?</p>
<p>Here, Giroux’s notion of educated hope is terribly important, and yet I also think somewhat limiting. For Giroux, educated hope is the condition of possibility foundational for real social struggle and transformation. In conversation with Judith Butler, Ernest Block, Robin D.G. Kelley, and others, Giroux argues, rightly I believe, that educated hope “makes the leap for us between <italic>critical education</italic>, which tells us what must be changed; <italic>political agency</italic>, which gives us the means to make change; and the <italic>concrete struggle</italic> through which change happens” (p. 38; italics original; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612453004">Edmondson and D’Urso 2007</xref>). Educated hope is an enabling and activating social location, which emerges from a critical engagement with power, inequality, and injustices. It emerges from precisely the types of strong, paranoid critiques Sedgwick was warning us about. It allows us to understand and engage with the present with a historical, social, and political competency. In questioning the historical and the present, educated hope opens us spaces to think about and the horizons of possibility for different future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532708612453004">Jameson (2005)</xref> argues something similar in relation to the genre of science fiction when he claims that Utopian visions of other worlds both make “us more aware of our mental and ideological imprisonment” (p. xiii) and allow us to express our “relationships to a genuinely political future” (p. 232). Educated hope is one of the desired intellectual, political, and emotional outcomes of a class engaging in critical policy studies. Opposing the neoliberal illusion of escaping the social into our individual liberties, educated hope examines the social, is critical of the social, and also sees an engaged and justice-oriented social as the means toward liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612453004">Giroux 2004</xref>, p. 39).</p>
<p>If, though, critical education is the gateway to political agency and the concrete struggle, which, again, I agree with, I do think the content of critical education matters. In terms of teaching, Edmundson and D’Urso (2007), responding to a call from a then Dean and now President of a college of education to focus less on dreams (of justice or real democratic schooling) and more on reality, argue that critical policy studies “seek to locate the underlying causes of class exploitation and economic oppression [in order to] serve a broader purpose in determining better ways to address social problems in the classroom and community.” Critical policy studies are influenced and in conversation with various strains of libratory and emancipatory philosophies, which start with a notion that knowledge is always situated, always historical, and always related to power. This is where, for many of us, the hermeneutics of suspicion comes into play. And from this, from an intense encounter with the embeddedness of power/knowledge, one is then freed (from false consciousness) to critique, imagine, and become an agent of change. And here is where my story might create pause.</p>
<p>There is a difference, as Sedgwick wants us to see, between a paranoid type and depressive position. Without recuperation, without examples, without the pages of <italic>Rethinking Schools</italic> and other authors, activists, and publications that highlight the concrete struggles and provide examples of political agency, one runs the risk of creating paranoid types. This, I believe, is what happened in my own class. I was too excited about critique, too interested in making sure that they could, at any moment, find the thing to be suspicious of. As such, I left a mechanism to get from suspicion to educated hope at bay. It can’t always be critique and think that the critical will smoothly lead to agency and struggle. Agency and struggle, in their own respective multiplicities, also need classroom time and space.</p>
<p>“If hope is an impossible demand,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612453004">Judith Butler (2011)</xref> remarked visiting the Occupy Movement in Zuccotti Park, “then we demand the impossible. If the right to shelter, food, and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible” (p. 193). To build our dreams, however impossible sounding, to bring justice and democratic principles into being, one needs critique and one needs educated hope. The two are neither mutually exclusive, nor are they necessarily related by causation. The neoliberal critique is so fundamentally structural, so fundamentally global, and so fundamentally all-encompassing that real change does seem impossible. And yet we need to figure out ways to oscillate between the two, to suspend suspicion, even if merely for a moment, to make sure that hope and struggle find their ways in; to not create paranoid types, always on the neoliberal prowl; to also provide concrete examples of agency and struggle; to make our students deal as closely with those recuperations as they do with the critiques. Dreams should always remain and the impossible should always be something we ask our students to engage with for, as Derrida has pointed out (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532708612453004">Malabou &amp; Derrida, 2004</xref>), it is the impossible that creates the conditions for possibility. The suspicion of the present will and should always create the conditions for imaging another impossible future, a more just future, a different future. And finding other means, perhaps weak and locale theories, we might also set students off on their own acts and feelings of political agency and concrete struggle.</p>
