<abstract>
<p>In the past, there has been little research into leg length inequality (LLI) and its effect on hip arthroplasty bearing longevity. This investigation aimed to determine the effects of post-operative LLI on hip motions during gait and to postulate the subsequent influence on the wear of the artificial hip joint replacement. Motion data from a clinical gait analysis were processed with an in-house computational model to plot graphs showing the movement of loci of 20 points on the femoral head during one gait cycle for two cohorts: 19 LLI patients and 38 normal healthy patients. Loci paths were quantified by calculating the aspect ratio (AR) of the path shape. It was found that on average, LLI patients had a reduction in flexion/extension and abduction/adduction. Furthermore, the AR of LLI patients was found to be 8% smaller than the normal group. The shorter, more multidirectional, motion paths in LLI patients would suggest the potential for greater wear in a polyethylene bearing compared to an asymptomatic, non-LLI patient. The results have potential implications towards preclinical wear testing of joint replacements.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Introduced in 1962, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cups coupled with metal or ceramic femoral heads dominate the total hip replacement (THR) field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912453245">1</xref></sup> Articulation of the bearing surfaces leads to the release of UHMWPE wear debris that may lead to biological tissue reactions (osteolysis) that contribute to a loss of mechanical support and ultimate long-term failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912453245">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The motion of the hip is complex with flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation, resulting in a multidirectional motion path of the femoral head relative to the acetabular cup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912453245">3</xref></sup> When relative sliding of the bearing surfaces takes place, the polyethylene material exhibits surface strain hardening in the principal direction of motion and strain softening in the transverse direction leading to wear that is linked closely to the cross-shear or motion path. Studies by Turell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912453245">4</xref></sup> and Davey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912453245">2</xref></sup> have shown that as motion paths become longer and thinner, the aspect ratio (AR) (the ratio of the path length to breadth) increases with more linear motion, and the volumetric wear of UHMWPE decreases, demonstrating that wear rate is heavily influenced by motion. Therefore, the motion paths of the hip joint during gait may directly influence the wear of the prosthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912453245">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinically, some amount of post-operative leg length inequality (LLI) is common after THR, with variation in stem and cup position and a range of other preoperative and intra-operative factors affecting the resulting leg length. Significant residual LLI is one of the most common causes of litigation and patient functional dissatisfaction following THR although its consequences are poorly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453245">6</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to report gait characteristics for patients with symptomatic LLI and to compare these to the gait patterns of normal healthy people, commonly used as input into preclinical prosthesis testing, to explore the potential effects of such post-operative variation on possible implant wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912453245">7</xref></sup> The range of motion and AR are presented, with data derived from patients with symptomatic LLI being representative of overtly poorly functioning THR in order to enable discussions in relation to the potential effects of gait pattern on wear performance.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The study involved a rigorous patient selection process whereby patients with co-morbidities or other unrelated health complications or a history of orthopaedic care that may also influence gait were excluded. Patients were recruited into two cohorts: 19 patients attending a regional referral centre who had undergone unilateral THR and who were experiencing symptomatic LLI severe enough to be considered for revision surgery (‘LLI group’) and 38 normal healthy individuals with a fully functioning natural hip joint (‘normal group’). Patient anthropometric data for the two cohorts are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912453245">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Following ethical approval, all patients underwent a gait analysis after a minimum of 12 months post-operative recovery following THR. An eight-camera Vicon MX motion analysis system (Oxford Metrics, Oxford, England) was used to capture gait data at 120 Hz, using the ‘Plug-In-Gait’ marker set and a pelvic reference frame. The laboratory is a state-of-the art motion analysis facility, based within outpatients department of a large teaching hospital. Calibration is undertaken daily and prior to every session for the motion capture system and monthly for the force plates used in this study to capture gait events. The output data for the hip joint for one representative gait cycle were subsequently processed and output using the industry standard Visual 3D software (C-Motion, Germantown, MD, USA). Inherent assumptions built into the kinematic modelling were the same for both groups. To facilitate a comparative statistical analysis between trials, gait data were normalised to 101 centiles within a single gait cycle. For the LLI group, the femoral head was 28 mm diameter, and all bearings incorporated UHMWPE cups. As reported previously by others in this field, a standard protocol was employed for deriving motion paths in which 20 points on the femoral head surface were selected for the analysis of motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912453245">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912453245"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912453245">10</xref></sup> Each point was calculated using a Cartesian coordinate system relative to a reference point at the centre of the femoral head (0, 0, 0).</p>
<p>Relative hip surface motions were determined using an in-house computational analysis program that utilised the motion tracking matrices as published by Barbour et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912453245">11</xref></sup> and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912453245">Figure 1</xref>. The program applied the Cardan angle sequence of rotations: first, y: abduction/adduction; second, z: internal/external rotation; and finally, x: flexion/extension to each of the 20 input points (X<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>1</sub>) using the kinematic gait data obtained from the gait analysis. The resultant set of three-dimensional coordinates (X<sub>N</sub>, Y<sub>N</sub>, Z<sub>N</sub>) described the motion path of the input point over the femoral head surface through a single gait cycle. Validation of the computational analysis program was performed by comparing the actual relative motions occurring between the head and cup produced by a hip joint simulator (using implanted ink nibs) to motions predicted at the same points within the computational model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912453245">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>To determine the range of motion, inter-patient variability graphs (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation movement) were produced for each group using the mean of all patients in that group ±95% confidence limits. The shapes of the motion paths were additionally compared by quantifying the AR of the motion path for the 20 different points and then calculating the average AR for each patient. The AR of the two-dimensional motion paths was calculated using a modified version of the methods, as published by Davey et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912453245">Figure 3</xref>), that additionally took the curvature of the femoral head into account.</p>

<p>The range of motion of the THR patients with symptomatic LLI is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912453245">Figure 4</xref> where the angle of motion is plotted against the percentage of the gait cycle. The 95% confidence interval of the data is outlined by the lighter lines, which can be compared to the mean (darker line). A range of 33° flexion/extension, 8° abduction/adduction and 15° internal/external rotation was observed. While anthropometric data varied considerably between patients, the confidence intervals were within ± 4°, ± 2° and ± 6° of the mean flexion, abduction and rotation, respectively. In contrast, the normal group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912453245">Figure 5</xref>) had a range of 46° flexion/extension, 13° abduction/adduction and 11° internal/external rotation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is well known that gait patterns may change with age, obesity and with concurrent clinical problems such as in contralateral limbs (multiple joint involvement). However, these groups offer such great variability that drawing conclusions can be difficult. In the present study, a group of patients were carefully selected to have no other confounding factors except for symptomatic post-operative LLI following unilateral THR sufficient to warrant consideration for revision operation. True post-operative LLI occurs when actual leg length is changed. Lengthening is more common as surgeons attempt to reduce instability by tightening the soft tissues around the hip. The study assumes that the post-operative LLI in the patients investigated was responsible for the changes in gait observed as well as the presence of a THR itself. The patients in normal group were sex matched, had a younger mean age (45 years) and were taller, compared to those in LLI group (age, 59 years) who were shorter and predominantly female (common in patients with symptomatic LLI). The gait pattern used for preclinical testing of joint replacements is generally representative of a healthy person’s gait pattern, and the kinematics are comparable to the normal healthy patients used in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912453245">7</xref></sup> Therefore, the comparison of LLI to normal healthy patients in this study represents a comparison similar to those used in current testing standards.</p>
<p>The accuracy of motion data collected using the gait analysis is sensitive to the virtual joint centre produced within the gait analysis software about which the rotations of the hip are based. The Vicon MX motion capture analysis system utilised in this study incorporated a pelvic reference frame. Our LLI cohort was long on the femoral side; hence, the acetabular component remained broadly speaking in the anatomical position; thus, the hip centre was not significantly altered, and the pelvic reference frame provided an accurate representation of motion. Had cup placement been the cause of the LLI, then the hip centre would have changed along with the general assumptions of the gait analysis model within the Vicon system.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912453245">Table 2</xref> compares the mean range of hip motion for the LLI and normal group. Although there was a significant variation in the coping mechanisms employed by LLI patients, as a whole LLI patients demonstrated a decrease in the range of flexion/extension, a decrease in the range of abduction/adduction motion and an increase in the range of internal/external rotational motion of the hip joint compared to normal healthy individuals; these differences were found to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>Similar to Ramamurti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912453245">9</xref></sup> and Bennett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912453245">5</xref></sup> for THR patients, our motion path results for normal subjects showed mostly circular and quasi-elliptical shaped motion paths with some figures of eight, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912453245">Figure 6</xref>. The motion paths of LLI patients appeared shorter and more erratic than normal healthy individuals, resulting in a larger variety of motion path shapes over the entirety of the femoral head. The shapes of the motion paths have been quantified by calculating the average AR for each LLI patient and the overall average AR for each cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912453245">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, it is possible to assume that the post-operative LLI in the 19 patients investigated was responsible for the changes in gait observed and not the THR itself.</p>
<p>It is fundamentally difficult comparing the motion paths of THR patients from the literature. Bennett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912453245">5</xref></sup> found that patients with a THR had reduced sliding distances compared to normal patients; however, their patient group was older (72 years) and thus more likely to be affected by both age and multiple joint involvement. The average ARs of our LLI group (1.67) were 7% lower than in the normal cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912453245">Figure 8</xref>); the differences in ARs between the two groups were found to be statistically significant. This demonstrates that the motion paths of LLI patients are shorter and wider than normal healthy patients, indicating decreased anterior–posterior motion and increased medial–lateral motion. The ARs varied depending on the specific point on the femoral head surface, with a range of ARs from 0.16 to 7.87 in the LLI group compared to a smaller range of 0.29–6.75 in the normal group. This suggests that LLI patients have altered gait motions and additionally that there is a degree of variability between LLI patients.</p>
<p>The type of motion of the femoral head articulating against the acetabular cup during gait is known to have a large effect on the material properties and subsequent wear of the polyethylene acetabular cup. The calculation of the AR of the shapes of the motion paths has allowed the most prevalent motion for each patient and the average of all LLI patients to be quantitatively compared to normal healthy patients. As previously discussed, the polyethylene wear volume is related to the direction of sliding. During the linear motion, the molecules within the polyethylene will preferentially align causing a strain hardening effect, resulting in a decrease in wear volume. Conversely, during periods of multidirectional motion, a cross-shearing of the molecules will occur, resulting in a material softening effect and an increased wear volume. The average AR of the LLI patients was lower due to shorter, wider motion paths. This suggests that LLI patients have more multidirectional motion and less unidirectional motion compared to normal healthy patients, suggesting that, based on motion alone, and assuming an equal activity level, a patient with symptomatic LLI may also experience greater THR wear. These predictions are supported by the experimental findings of Davey et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912453245">2</xref></sup> who used revision implants to show that linear wear rate increases when the AR decreases.</p>
<p>Ultimately, polyethylene wear is a function of the motion between the head and cup and the sliding distance or activity level. While the computational analysis employed in this study allows motion to be examined in detail locally, it is important to note that wear is also directly related to sliding distance (activity) and that LLI may also lead to significant disability with a corresponding reduction in the global activity level. While the rate of wear is predicted in this model to increase, it is not yet known whether the changes in contact forces or reduced activity would interact with this effect, and further work is merited.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The motion path of the femoral head articulating against the acetabular cup varies with the gait pattern. Patients with symptomatic LLI following a single unilateral THR produce a wider and more multidirectional AR of motion compared to normal healthy individuals. As the rate of wear of polyethylene is largely affected by the degree of multidirectional motion of the femoral head articulating against the polyethylene acetabular cup, the corresponding increase in multidirectional motion that accompanies smaller ARs, as observed in LLI patients, may lead to an increase in bearing wear. This article illustrates the need to further investigate abnormal gait motions to ensure that preclinical wear performance testing of devices utilises clinically relevant gait motions.</p>
