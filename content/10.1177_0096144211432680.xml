<p>Since the 1970s, economic globalization has produced a new urban hierarchy. A small number of global cities—New York, London, Paris, Tokyo—that have the technology, infrastructure, and concentrated human capital to attract the headquarters of top multinational firms serve as command centers for the restructuring world economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211432680">1</xref></sup> The neoliberal economic policies crafted by political and economic elites in such centers have facilitated the movement of much manufacturing and service work to the Global South, producing unprecedented levels of human migration both to the hemisphere’s historic cities, which are rapidly growing, and to new urban formations. Meanwhile, deindustrialized cities in much of the Global North struggle to maintain the industrial tax base necessary to support infrastructure and social services for their remaining urban dwellers—a problem they share with the emerging cities of the “developing” world, which typically lack the established administrative structures and revenue streams to provide for their rapidly growing populations, many of them migrants, who in turn develop alternative methods of meeting their basic needs. Thus, a key feature of the new global economy is significant and growing inequality both between and within cities, manifest not only in earnings gaps but also in patterns of social, political, and spatial organization.</p>
<p>Urbanists generally agree that these shifts have fundamentally transformed the urban landscape. Encapsulated most fully in the fiery debates surrounding the so-called “Los Angeles school” of urbanism but implicitly assumed in much contemporary urban theory, the scholarly literature generally assumes a defining shift from the “modern” cities of the industrial period to the “postmodern,” postindustrial cities of the present. Analysts describe new urban forms such as “edge cities” and privatopias in U.S. and European cities, where the peripheries organize urban life and where consumption of both spectacle and security is a prominent feature of the urban landscape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211432680">2</xref></sup> In turn, observers of cities in Asia, Latin America, and Africa note that many new urban centers never experienced the spatiality associated with modernity, skipping over the paradigmatic form of industrial cities such as Manchester or Chicago to become vast, sprawling, multicentered metropolitan complexes such as those in China’s Pearl River and Yangtze River deltas.</p>
<p>What is the role of the urban public sphere in this global reality? Many commentators have reacted with alarm to the privatization of urban public space, the dominance of urban political processes by corporate capital, and the substitution of simulated, privatized experiences of consumption for what they regard as more democratic exchange across human difference. Geographer Don Mitchell, for example, argues that as cities compete with each other to attract capital, they embrace a vision of public space wherein security and order are paramount and where a politics of the aesthetic supersedes a politics of survival. This vision is made manifest in antihomeless laws (i.e., those prohibiting loitering, panhandling, or sleeping on sidewalks) and through the “permitting of protest,” in which those who oppose the dominant vision of the city as a space of aesthetics and consumption must gain the consent of the state to exercise their democratic rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and petition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211432680">3</xref></sup> Nor are such exclusions limited to material public spaces; they also operate in governance processes. Since the publication of Molotch’s influential essay on the city as a growth machine, urban political economists have recognized the ways in which business interests commandeer local political structures to ensure that urban fiscal, land-use, and other kinds of policy work in their favor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211432680">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Without denying the reality of growing urban inequality or the seriousness of challenges to democracy posed by neoliberal global policy, the three texts reviewed here challenge the temporal and geographical assumptions embedded in this narrative of urban transformation and its implications for the constitution of an inclusive, democratic public sphere. Prakash and Kruse’s <italic>Spaces of the Modern City</italic> challenges the periodization of globalization and the clean division that many urban theorists posit between “modern” and “postmodern” cities, instead investigating the relationships of global exchange and hierarchy that have <italic>always</italic> existed both between and within the world’s cities. Herzog’s <italic>Return to the Center</italic> and Kihato et al.’s <italic>Urban Diversity</italic> largely accept the periodization of spatial change put forth by scholars of global urbanism but question the corresponding implications for the urban public sphere and democracy, pointing to the diverse and often counterintuitive ways in which people are negotiating inclusion and belonging. All three texts foreground cities that have been overlooked or less studiously investigated, particularly in the Global South, and in doing so they shake up core assumptions of the field rooted in the experiences of cities in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>In his introduction to <italic>The Spaces of the Modern City</italic>, coeditor Gyan Prakash argues that scholarship that presents modern cities as bounded, unified, and coherent and postmodern cities as fragmented and discordant both misrepresents the experiences of life in modern cities and posits a false division between the postindustrial cities of the developed world and the industrializing cities of the developing world. Inherent in such a formulation, he argues, is an elitist bias that misremembers, with romantic nostalgia, the modern city as a place of unity and coherence—a portrait that was never the reality for immigrants, noncitizens, women, and the poor, even as these groups creatively negotiated their rights to the city. Strongly influenced by theoretical scholarship on the social production of space such as that advanced by Henri Lefebvre and Doreen Massey, the essayists share an approach that conceptualizes the city always—not merely in the “postmodern” or “postindustrial” period—as the product of networks and flows rather than as an inert container for social processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211432680">5</xref></sup> Crucially, however, they refuse to abandon the reality that cities are always, for their inhabitants, “decidedly local lifeworlds” shaped by sensory experiences of real physical places (p. 2). Organized into three sections—spatial imaginaries, spatial politics, and the spaces of everyday life—the essays nicely balance these theoretical convictions.</p>
<p>Three structural anchors—capitalism, empire, and globalization—serve as organizing frames, connecting all of the essays into an astute analysis of power relations within and among cities in a global world that they claim has existed much longer than urbanists have generally recognized. Exemplary essays devoted to unpacking the construction of global relationships among cities include Phil Ethington’s study of the relationships among Los Angeles, northern Mexico, and East Africa structured by Los Angeles’s oligarchy in the 1920s and ’30s through their activities in cinema, oil extraction, and suburban housing development; and Sheila Crane’s investigation of French architect Fernand Pouillon’s housing project designs in Marseille and Algiers, with attention to how developments in both cities were transformed in the postcolonial era. Two essays that examine the contested nature of the public sphere in modern cities, both past and present, are Cristina Jimenez’s astute analysis of how poor, nonliterate, and noncitizen Mexicans in Morelia claimed their rights as street vendors, even amid the modernizing campaigns of local and national government, by working with public scribes in the city’s central plazas from the 1880s through the 1920s; and Jordan Sand’s intriguing study of Tokyo’s Street Observation Science movement of the 1980s, which involved fieldwork to document vernacular landscapes that did not seem to belong to anyone or serve any practical purpose, thereby subtly critiquing the consumerism and speculation—especially in land development and real estate—on which Japan’s collapsing economy had been based.</p>
<p>Against this rich historical backdrop, Lawrence Herzog’s <italic>Return to the Center</italic> offers a provocative argument and detailed ethnographic data but sometimes suffers from the kind of sweeping generalizations about urban change, as well as a romantic nostalgia for a supposedly lost city of coherence and unity, that the Prakash and Kruse volume is keen to disrupt. Herzog contends that “there is a clear need for an alternative vision of American urban space, one that embraces the traditions that defined America’s urban evolution, while incorporating the best elements of inherited European urbanism.” For Herzog, this alternative vision “lies south of the border at the gateway to our Latin neighbors—that is, it lies in Mexico, and in Mexico’s connection to Europe through Spain” (p. 3). Providing detailed portraits of public spaces in Spain and Mexico drawn from his own observations and interviews with architects, designers, and users as well as urban planning documents, Herzog demonstrates that public space remains critically important to Spanish and Mexican people as a kind of cultural patrimony.</p>
<p>On this basis, Herzog rejects the arguments of the postmodern urbanists, implicitly critiquing their reliance on the experiences of middle-class, especially white, suburbanites in the United States, and centers instead the experiences of Latinos, both in Spain and Mexico and in the United States, from whom he claims other Americans can learn much about how to design and use public space in a globalizing world. He notes, “Not all forms of globalization are necessarily bad . . . the exciting long-term prospect of the U.S.–Mexico border is that it can become a living laboratory of discovery, a place to invent new hybrid forms of city building that merge the best elements of U.S. and Mexican design” (p. 222). The most directly relevant chapter for this argument is chapter 7, which examines urban public space in the U.S.–Mexico border region. Here the fusion of U.S. and Mexican traditions of spatial use, as well as their integration and interdependence in the global economy, is most apparent. For example, along the border, suburban shopping malls—not central plazas—are dominant arenas of public life, informed both by migrants’ experiences of consumption in the United States and by transnational investors’ desires to export American models of consumer capitalism to new markets. Yet this influence is not unidirectional: Herzog points also to the ways in which Latinos are reinventing public space in the U.S. Southwest. He argues that “Latinos regularly create vital public spaces through vernacular design” (p. 218), offering as examples East Los Angeles’s pedestrian-oriented avenues, with their plethora of small, immigrant-owned shops; the historic Broadway theater district in downtown Los Angeles, which, after decades of neglect wrought by suburbanization and decentralization, has become a major shopping and gathering space for Latinos; and Chicano Park in San Diego, where traditions of Latino displacement, protest, and community organizing are celebrated on the freeway pylons and in annual festivals.</p>
<p>Herzog is to be commended for his forward-thinking calls to articulate an optimistic vision of public space and for centering the vernacular spatial practices of U.S. Latinos, but he does not fully grapple with the relationships of power between the United States and Mexico and between Latinos and non-Latinos in the U.S. Southwest that would inevitably influence the implementation of his proposal. Since the turn of the twentieth century, city planners and elites in cities of the U.S. Southwest have deliberately incorporated aesthetic elements of Spanish and Mexican public space (such as the red-tile roofs and arched doorways of “Mission Revival” architecture), even as they have used urban political-economic processes to dispossess and disenfranchise actual ethnic Mexican people. These twin processes constitute the “Spanish fantasy heritage,” amply documented by urban historians, that has dominated the Southwest’s urban planning history, and which William Deverell has conceptualized as part of a larger process of “whitewashing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211432680">6</xref></sup> Such acts clearly persist into the present, and perhaps more viciously than ever, precisely because of the increasing stakes wrought by globalization. <italic>Return to the Center</italic> was published in 2006 and relies on data collected nearly a decade earlier. One wonders, therefore, whether and how Herzog might adapt his arguments in the context of the most recent spate of anti-immigrant, and especially anti-Mexican, sentiment and policy that has reached a crescendo in the years since the book’s publication. From federal House Bill 4437 (2006) and Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 (2010) to the countless state and local policies that restrict Latino day laborers from congregating on public street corners to pick up work or playing soccer in public parks, urban policy in recent years has explicitly sought to curtail Latinos’ movement through public space and the ways in which they are transforming vernacular landscapes. Perla Guerrero contends that such policies, and the nativist sentiments on which they are based, construct Latinos’ use of public space as “acts of spatial illegality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211432680">7</xref></sup> Less racially explicit acts of whitewashing occur even in the examples that Herzog cites as promising. In Los Angeles’s Broadway district, well-intentioned preservationists, most of them middle-class Anglos, have seized on the revitalization initiated by Latino shoppers, but as they work to preserve the historic theaters and attract middle-class suburbanites, they threaten to displace those Latinos who are using the space, contributing to a pattern of rampant gentrification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211432680">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>These are exactly the kinds of processes and tensions explored in Kihato et al.’s <italic>Urban Diversity: Space, Culture, and Inclusive Pluralism in Cities Worldwide</italic>, which takes a more nuanced approach to the constitution of the urban public sphere—one that centers relationships of power within and between urban centers and questions the role of the state and existing political structures for inclusion and democracy. The edited volume is the product of a multiyear collaborative research initiative cosponsored by the Center for Contemporary Culture of Barcelona, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the purpose of which was to examine how contemporary cities, particularly in the Global South, are adapting to the challenges of pluralism and diversity. Though it is not explicitly stated as a goal of the volume, many of the essays challenge the theoretical supremacy of urban models based on the experiences of postindustrial cities in the Global North. Loren Landau’s chapter on mobility and belonging in African cities makes this intervention most directly. Landau notes that dominant understandings of urban inclusion assume the presence of a dominant, settled host community–that the state is both the primary source of exclusion and the most potent tool for fostering inclusion; and that forms of inclusion and exclusion are mutually incompatible. Yet in African cities, none of these assumptions is consistently born out. Rather, new and highly mobile populations, “ethnic heterogeneity, enormous economic disparities, and cultural pastiche are the empirical norms, not exceptions” (p. 173). Moreover, an effective centralized authority has rarely governed the continent’s cities, as a result of postcolonial political consolidations and the state’s inability to effectively and consistently provide services. In addition, in many African cities, including in their slums, there exists a kind of “de facto inclusivity” in which most people are able to meet their survival needs, often in collaboration with others and in the informal economy, but where many people consciously self-exclude, choosing instead to identify with translocal and/or global networks of belonging that may actually be far more significant to them than membership or political participation in the locality where they reside (pp. 177-78). Landau concludes, “[R]eflecting a distinguished tradition of elite-led urban planning, in almost no instances do attempts to define inclusion begin by considering the heterogeneous desires, interests, and intentions of the world’s urban poor” (p. 170). When this bias is translated into policy, the effects on the well-being of marginalized urban dwellers in the Global South can be disastrous—a point best evidenced in Joseph Tulchin’s chapter on crime and violence in Latin American cities, in which he argues that “get tough on crime” policies imported from European and American urban politicians (most notably from Rudy Giuliani, who was hired as a consultant to reduce crime in Mexico City) have effectively undermined the democratic system where it is relatively new and far from consolidated, contributing to greater fear and social isolation among urban dwellers.</p>
<p>Thus, using the experiences of Latin American, African, and Asian cities as a launching pad, the key theoretical intervention of <italic>Urban Diversity</italic> is to question normative understandings of inclusion as desirable and exclusion as undesirable, as well as the processes through which an inclusive, democratic public is assumed to be constituted. Essays focus on three structures of the public sphere: physical space, digital networks, and governance structures. Ash Amin’s theoretically rich opening essay sets the tone. He notes, “[U]rbanists have long held the view that the physical and social dynamics of public space play a central role in the formation of publics and public culture. A city’s streets, parks, squares, and other shared spaces have been seen as symbols of collective well-being and possibility, expressions of achievement and aspiration by urban leaders and visionaries, sites of public encounters and the formation of civic culture, and significant locations of political deliberation and agonistic struggle” (p. 22). Amin then asks whether this assumption is still valid (the contributors to the Prakash and Kruse volume would likely query whether it was <italic>ever</italic> historically valid) but notes that even raising this question is heresy among most urbanists. His central argument is that “it is too heroic a leap to assume that [simply] making a city’s public spaces more vibrant and inclusive will improve urban democracy” (pp. 24-25). This point is echoed in John Hannigan’s chapter on two forms of heterogeneous urban public space—“ethnic precincts” and “neo-bohemias”—where significant diversity exists but does not result in significant exchange across difference; rather, these “contact zones” are likely to encourage stereotyping and exoticism; exacerbate existing racial, ethnic, and class tensions; and facilitate displacement and disempowerment of the urban poor. As a result, Amin advocates for a posthumanist approach to urban public space that considers more deeply “other inputs such as space, technological intermediaries, objects, and nature” (p. 26). In other words, deliberate, rational, and purposeful social interaction in public space is but one dimension, and perhaps not even the most important dimension, of urban public space’s promise for democratic inclusion. Other factors, such as symbolic projections of a populace’s commitment to pluralism (e.g., through public art) can cultivate the kind of “throwntogetherness” (here referencing Doreen Massey)—the relatively unconstrained circulation of bodies and things in space—that Amin argues is crucial to the potential development of an inclusive pluralism.</p>
<p>Two strong essays on digital networks amplify Amin’s call for a posthumanist approach to public space. Intervening in the debate about whether digital networks are replacing “real” public space, Mike Crang helpfully shows through three case studies of digital networks in Singapore, Amsterdam, and Seoul that there is a deep interaction between the digital sphere and the material urban sphere. He concludes, “Daily lives do not encounter a great divide of offline and online worlds; instead, the one feeds into the other, in subtle and continuous interplay. . . . This creates an entangled pattern where advantages and disadvantages from the social world are ramified by the affordances and distributions of new digital spaces and capabilities” (pp. 100-101). Pumla Dineo Gqola concretely illustrates this point in her study of gendered access to information and communication technologies in Johannesburg, pointing out that since women are the majority of the world’s poor, they are also the majority of the digitally impoverished and that strategies for increasing inclusivity will therefore need to integrate digital technology into women’s existing life patterns. As a successful example, she cites a South African nongovernmental organization (NGO) focused on women’s issues that works to make access to information possible beyond Johannesburg by creating short sound bites that can be downloaded from a website and broadcast to rural women by community radio stations.</p>
<p>Contributors likewise interrogate the idea and structure of governance and in doing so reconsider the normative role of the state in facilitating urban inclusion in the public sphere. As Ananya Roy argues in her excellent essay, which examines case studies of two NGOs in Mumbai and Beirut, increased public participation in governance does not inherently lead to a more just or inclusive city since “civic governmentality” produces willed, free, self-determining, and self-ruling subjects and physical spaces that are in turn more easily governable, thereby quelling dissent and reifying existing relations of power. So too are even the most hopeful and intentionally participatory processes constrained by the larger structures of the local and global political economy. In Edesio Fernandes’s intriguing evaluation of participatory budgetary processes in Brazil, a country that explicitly recognizes the urban poor’s “right to the city,” the author argues that, despite their promise, participatory budgetary processes “urgently need to reconcile mechanisms of popular participation with attempts to create a new land governance framework at the local level” (p. 284), since “they have not called into question the exclusionary nature of the overall land and urban development model,” which remains rooted in neoliberalism (p. 298).</p>
<p>Together, these three texts provoke deeper thinking about the changing nature of urbanization in a global context, both historically and in the present, and demand a provocative rethinking of core assumptions about the relationships among globalization, urbanism, and the public sphere. These are especially important intellectual tasks in this moment of widening global and urban inequality. They also provide important empirical data about cities, past and present, that have been less studiously examined by urbanists, particularly those in the Global South. In all respects they offer important lessons about urban spatial form and social organization in the global world that have the potential to redefine the field.</p>
