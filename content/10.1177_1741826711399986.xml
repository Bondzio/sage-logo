<p><bold>Background:</bold> Exercise test parameters (exercise ankle brachial index (ABI), walking distance and blood pressure response) separately are associated with long-term outcome in patients with known or suspected peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, the clinical value of the combination of these parameters together is unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 2165 patients performed a treadmill exercise test to diagnose or to evaluate their PAD. Resting ABI, exercise ABI, abnormal blood pressure response (hypotensive and hypertensive) and walking distance (impairment &lt;150 m) were measured. The study population was divided into patients with a resting ABI ≥ 0.90 and patients with PAD (resting ABI &lt; 0.90).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean follow-up period was 5 years (0.5–14 years). Long-term mortality rate and risks increases when more exercise parameters became abnormal (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.001). Patients with a normal resting ABI but with an abnormal exercise test had a higher mortality risk – HR 1.90 (1.32–2.73) – than patients with a normal exercise test. The highest mortality risk and cardiac death was observed in PAD patients with a walking impairment together with an abnormal blood pressure response – HR 3.48 (2.22–5.46).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Exercise tests give multiple parameters, which together provide important prognostic information on long-term outcome in both patients with normal resting ABI and PAD.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711399986" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the guidelines, an ankle brachial index (ABI) measured at rest (resting ABI) of less than 0.90 is defined as peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is related to a higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711399986">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711399986">4</xref></sup> However, a previous study observed that almost 30% of the patients with a resting ABI ≥ 0.90 were shown to have an ABI &lt; 0.90 after an exercise test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711399986">5</xref></sup> At these exercise tests, however, other parameters, such as walking distance and blood pressure, are measured in addition to exercise ABI. We previously demonstrated that a hypertensive or hypotensive blood pressure response (BPR) at a treadmill exercise test were both associated with a 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399986">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711399986">7</xref></sup> Also walking distance impairment was strongly associated with mortality and cardiac death in patients with ABI &lt; 0.90 and ≥0.90.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711399986">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711399986">10</xref></sup> However, it is not known if the combination of the different exercise parameters together adds additional prognostic information to the current known risk factors. Therefore, we performed a large observational study in our vascular laboratory to investigate the effects of the combination of treadmill exercise parameters together on long-term outcome in patients with suspected or confirmed PAD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711399986" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711399986"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Our study population consisted of 2165 patients, who were referred by general practitioners or physicians to the vascular laboratory of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, for a single-stage treadmill exercise test, between 1993 and 2006. Patients were referred by physicians to diagnose PAD, based on their presenting symptoms. Or patients, who already had a history of intermittent claudication or other symptoms of arterial insufficiency, were sent to evaluate their PAD. Patients were excluded if they were unable to perform the treadmill exercise test or if they had a resting ABI &gt; 1.30 (10 patients).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711399986"><title>Single-stage exercise test</title>
<p>Specialised trained personnel supervised the exercise tests, using a prescribed protocol. Patients were asked not to smoke before the test. The systolic blood pressure was measured with a blood pressure device (Maxi stable 3, presso stabl; Welch Allyn Inc, Skaneateles Falls, New York, USA) with 40% of the limb contour at both left and right arms in the supine position after 15 minutes rest. In addition, the blood pressure at the anterior tibial and posterial tibial arteries was measured at both sides, using a Doppler ultrasonic instrument with an 8-MHZ vascular probe (Imexdop CT+ vascular Doppler; Miami Medical, GlenAllen, Va). After these measurements all patients were asked to walk on a treadmill with a speed of 4 km/h for a maximum of 5 min. No inclining plane or graded inclines were used. Patients were encouraged to finish the whole test. Total walking distance was recorded. Immediately after the exercise the systolic blood pressure at the arm, as well as at the anterior tibia or posterial tibial artery, depending which was highest at rest, was measured in the supine position. ABI at rest and after the exercise test were calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the dorsalis pedis or posterial tibial arteries, depending which was the highest, by the highest systolic blood pressure at the arm. For the resting ABI, the interobserver and intraobserver agreement was 97% and 98%, and for the exercise ABI, 96% and 97%, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711399986">11</xref></sup> All variables were incorporated in a computerised hospital database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711399986"><title>Definition of treadmill exercise parameters</title>
<p>At the exercise test we measured three parameters: exercise ABI, abnormal BPR – either hypertensive or hypotensive BPR – and total walking distance.</p>
<p>As we described previously, we defined a hypertensive BPR as an increase in systolic blood pressure at the exercise test of ≥55 mmHg (the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile), the difference between the highest measured exercise systolic blood pressure and the highest measured resting systolic blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399986">6</xref></sup> Patients with an increase in systolic blood pressure of &lt;55 mmHg were defined as having a normal BPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399986">6</xref></sup> Subjects who experienced a decline in systolic blood pressure after the exercise compared to the resting systolic blood pressure were defined as having a hypotensive BPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711399986">7</xref></sup> For a detailed description and discussion about the definitions of the hypertensive and hypotensive blood pressure response, we referred to previously published articles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399986">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711399986">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The total walking distance was used as a continuous variable and was categorised into quartiles for the whole population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711399986">8</xref></sup> The lowest walking distance quartile (less than 150 m) was defined as a severe walking impairment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711399986"><title>Covariate assessment</title>
<p>Demographic and clinical information were collected from the medical records. The following definitions were used for the different covariates. Diabetes mellitus was documented when patients presented with the diagnosis, made by the referring physician, and required anti-diabetic medication, having a fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dl, a glucose level of ≥200 mg/dl after a oral glucose tolerance test or plasma non-fasting glucose levels of ≥200 mg/dl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711399986">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711399986">13</xref></sup> Hypertension was recorded if a patient had a blood pressure higher &gt;140/90 mmHg or was being treated with antihypertensive medication. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was classified as a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pulmonary medication use. Hypercholesterolaemia was noted when patients presented with the diagnosis, made by the referring physician, and received lipid-lowering medication or a plasma cholesterol level of 212 mg/dl or more. Renal dysfunction was defined as having a serum creatinine level of ≥2.0 mg/dl or receiving dialysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711399986"><title>Follow-up</title>
<p>The follow-up vital status, which was obtained by reviewing the civil registries, was completed for 99.4% of patients. The cause of death was obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics or from medical records. Of 62 patients (10%) no cause of death could be traced. Additionally, a self-reporting questionnaire about cardiac events was sent to all survivors, of whom 73% returned the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711399986"><title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>The study population was divided into patients with a resting ABI ≥ 0.90 and patients with PAD (resting ABI &lt; 0.90). After the variables were tested for normal distribution, we identified differences in baseline characteristics with student’s t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.</p>
<p>Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to investigate the additional value of the combination of the treadmill exercise parameters (exercise ABI, walking distance and BPR) on long-term mortality in both patient with resting ABI ≥ 0.90 and patients with PAD. The enter method was used, adding the different treadmill exercise parameters into the model, to investigate the additional prognostic value on long-term mortality. However, to confirm the proportional hazard assumption, first the proportionality of hazards was tested graphically based on visual inspection of log-log survival curves.</p>
<p>Next, based on the analyses above, the two groups were divided into six patient groups. Then Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the relationship between the different patient groups and long-term mortality, cardiac death and MACCE. MACCE consisted of cardiac or cerebrovascular death or major adverse cardiac events such as angina pectoris, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Additional adjustments were made for baseline medication use (statin, aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors) and time period of the exercise test. For all tests significance was defined as a <italic>p</italic>-value of ≤ 0.05. Analyses were performed in SPSS 15 for windows.</p>

<p>After adjustment for potential clinical risk factors, patients with a resting ABI ≥ 0.90 but an abnormal exercise test (Groups 2 and 3) had a two- to three-fold higher risk of all cause mortality, cardiac death and MACCE compared with patients with a normal exercise test (Group 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711399986">Table 4</xref>). The highest mortality risk was observed in PAD patients with both a walking distance impairment and an abnormal blood pressure response (Group 6, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711399986">Table 4</xref>). The results did not change when all analyses were repeated with additional adjustments for baseline medication use (aspirin, statins, beta-blockers and ace-inhibitors) or the time period of the exercise test.

<p>In this study we showed for the first time that the combination of the different treadmill exercise test parameters (exercise ABI, walking distance and BPR) together add prognostic information to the current known risk factors on long-term outcome in both patients with resting ABI ≥ 0.90 and PAD. The more the exercise parameters became abnormal the worse the long-term outcome became.</p>
<p>PAD is a manifestation of systemic arteriosclerosis, affecting millions of people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711399986">1</xref></sup> According to the guidelines, a resting ABI &lt; 0.90 is defined as PAD, which is related to a higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711399986">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711399986">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711399986">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711399986">14</xref></sup> In clinical practice, the resting ABI is used mostly. However, exercise tests may also provide other clinical data, such as exercise ABI, blood pressure response and walking distance, which we previously showed to be important and independent risk factors of long-term outcome in patients with known or suspected PAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399986">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711399986">9</xref></sup> However, the prognostic value of the combination of the different exercise test parameters together has not been investigated before. In this study we demonstrated that resting ABI, exercise ABI, walking distance and BPR all add additional prognostic information to the current known risk factors for long-term outcome. The more abnormal the exercise test results, the worse the long-term outcome.</p>
<p>In patients with confirmed or suspected cardiovascular disease, exercise tests are more often studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711399986">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711399986">16</xref></sup> One study investigated the additional value of exercise test parameters together with mortality. They observed that the mortality rate became higher when the number of abnormal exercise tests variables increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711399986">16</xref></sup> However, as far as we know, we are the first to investigate the association between exercise test parameters together with the long-term outcome in patients with confirmed or suspected PAD. Therefore, unfortunately, our results could not be compared with other researches. Also no other research has been performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms and treatment effects. However, it could be hypothesised that exercise test parameters together reflect systemic atherosclerosis better than one parameter individually. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, which occurs throughout the entire body with different symptoms at different sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711399986">17</xref></sup> We refer to our previous articles for detailed discussion about underlying mechanisms of the individual parameters. However, for example, hypertensive BPR is thought to be a result of generalised atherosclerosis, a hypotensive BPR is mostly explained by severe atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and walking distance impairment could be due to peripheral arterial stenosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399986">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711399986">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711399986">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711399986">27</xref></sup> Probably, the different parameters together give more information of the extensiveness of the disease and therefore important additional information on long-term outcome. Unfortunately, no studies so far have investigated this hypothesis in quantitative measurements. However, as a result of our study, good risk identification requires not only resting ABI measurements, but also exercise testing. However, further research is needed to investigate whether these mortality risks can be changed by adding additional treatments or giving different treatment regimes for each patient group.</p>
<p>Besides our study’s strengths such as the large population and long follow-up, our research has its limitations. The study is performed in a tertiary hospital, therefore it is unknown whether results can be generalised to the common population. However, other hospitals that do not have a vascular laboratory or general practitioners sent their patients to the Erasmus MC specifically for a treadmill exercise test. Therefore, our data is a representative mixture of a daily clinical practice in an average vascular laboratory.</p>
<p>In conclusion, combining different treadmill exercise test parameters together add additional prognostic information to the current known risk factors for long-term outcome in both patients with a resting ABI ≥ 0.90 and PAD. Therefore, exercise tests are important in that they identify patients with the worst long-term outcome. However, further research is needed to investigate which treatment is to be given when to improve long-term outcome in these patients.</p>
