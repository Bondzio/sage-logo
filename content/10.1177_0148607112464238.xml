<p><italic>Background</italic>: The purpose of this study is to establish a relationship between tolerance of enteral nutrition (EN) and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in critical patients, establish an objective measure for monitoring tolerance, and determine a threshold value for IAP. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: Prospective and observational study at the critical care unit. Seventy-two patients were recruited with an expected stay of more than 72 hours and scheduled to receive EN. We recorded IAP and clinical and laboratory variables to describe predictive ones for tolerance of EN at the start of nutrition. <italic>Results</italic>: The largest group was polytrauma patients (41.7%). Of the patients, 40.3% had undergone surgery prior to inclusion in the study. Most patients (87.5%) were fed via nasogastric tube. Physiological POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity) on admission was 26.4 ± 7.6, and surgical POSSUM was 22.4 ± 8.0. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was 13.6 ± 6.0. Mortality was 31.9%. In all, 70.8% tolerated EN. The univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant relation between tolerance of EN and surgical POSSUM, APACHE II, and baseline IAP. The multivariate analysis showed a relationship between APACHE II score, baseline IAP, and the tolerance of EN. So, on the basis of these 2 variables, logistic regression analysis can predict whether a patient will tolerate the diet with an overall precision of 80.3%. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: In critically ill patients, there is a relation between IAP values and the tolerance of EN. The baseline IAP with the APACHE II score can predict the tolerance of EN.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Nutrition support is indicated to correct or prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to tolerate oral intake. However, enteral nutrition (EN) is not without its problems. Gastrointestinal complications are common in critically ill patients and are associated with poor outcome. On the other hand, the monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is gaining popularity in everyday clinical practice. Approximately a third of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) develop intra-abdominal hypertension, which could be involved in the appearance of the complications associated with this diet. Establishing the relationship between tolerance of diet and IAP may help to avoid the failed attempts to introduce EN and reduce the incidence of complications that currently undermine the nutrition objectives at a crucial moment when energy demand must be supplied at all costs.</p>
<p>This prospective study was performed to determine the relationship between IAP and tolerance of EN in critically ill patients and to establish a threshold IAP value above which intolerance of the diet is highly probable. The results appear to support the initial hypothesis: there is a relationship between tolerance of EN and IAP, and patients with intolerance present higher IAP values. Currently and based on the results, the introduction of EN is avoided in those patients who are suspected of high-risk intolerance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most clinicians agree that nutrition support is indicated to correct or prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to tolerate oral intake. The saying “If the gut works, use it” remains entirely valid: in principle, the enteral route is preferable to the parenteral route.</p>
<p>However, enteral nutrition (EN) is not without its problems. Gastrointestinal (GI) complications are common in critically ill patients and are associated with poor outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112464238">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112464238">2</xref></sup> Reduced intestinal peristalsis, delayed gastric emptying, and diarrhea are present in more than half of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112464238">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Roughly 50% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) present intolerance of enteral feeding following a delay in gastric emptying, which is associated with poorer prognosis and a longer ICU stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112464238"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112464238">5</xref></sup> All this leads to nutrition deficiencies that may pass unnoticed, leaving critically ill patients at risk of malnutrition at a time of extreme metabolic lability.</p>
<p>The monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is gaining popularity in everyday clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112464238">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112464238"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112464238">8</xref></sup> Critically ill patients habitually need resuscitation with intensive fluid therapy, which may create retroperitoneal and visceral edema. This situation increases IAP and reduces the splanchnic flow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112464238">9</xref></sup> compromising gastric emptying and peristalsis and absorption in the gut; this distends the abdomen and increases IAP even further, thus creating a vicious circle.</p>
<p>An enteral diet is a fundamental part of the treatment of critically ill patients. Approximately a third of patients admitted to the ICU develop intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112464238">10</xref></sup> which may well be involved in the appearance of the complications associated with this diet. Establishing the relationship between tolerance of diet and IAP may help to avoid the failed attempts to introduce EN and reduce the incidence of complications that currently undermine the nutrition objectives at a crucial moment when the energy demand must be supplied at all costs.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the tolerance of EN and IAP in critically ill patients, in an attempt to establish an objective measure for monitoring tolerance and to define the IAP threshold value above which EN will not be tolerated.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0148607112464238">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This observational longitudinal descriptive study was carried out at the ICU at our hospital. The development of the protocol did not alter the medical or surgical treatment of the patients included in the study in any way. The study was approved by our hospital’s Ethical Committee for Clinical Research. The ethical principles for medical research involving humans laid out in the Helsinki Declaration were applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112464238">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first patient was included in February 2005, and the study finished in July 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112464238">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>We included patients admitted to the hospital’s critical care unit with an expected ICU stay of more than 72 hours, receiving EN, and admitted for the following reasons: postoperative care following abdominal surgery (elective or emergency), abdominal trauma in the context of polytrauma, medical pathology with shock (hypovolemic or septic), and severe acute pancreatitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607112464238">
<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Patients with the following variables were excluded: previous surgery on the bladder, neurogenic bladder, impossibility of applying a transurethral bladder catheter, hepatic ascites, pregnancy, or impossibility of monitoring IAP at the time when EN was indicated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607112464238">
<title>Study Variables</title>
<p>At the beginning of the study, physiological parameters were determined (sex, age, weight, and height), as well as baseline IAP (IAP just before start of EN), EN administration route, and physiological (and surgical) POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity). Each day, SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), need for mechanical ventilation (peak pressure), vasoactive drugs, antibiotics, motility stimulants, muscle relaxants, and fluid balance were recorded. IAP values were obtained every 8 hours until the patient tolerated the diet or not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607112464238">
<title>Determination of IAP</title>
<p>IAP was measured using the technique described by Kron et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112464238">12</xref></sup> and later modified by Sugrue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112464238">13</xref></sup> The bladder catheter was connected to a pressure transduction system after calibrating the 0 reference point at the level of the pubic symphysis. The IAP value was read on the monitor during expiration after instilling 50 mL of saline solution in sterile conditions, expressed on the monitor in mm Hg. The baseline IAP is the pressure obtained just before starting the EN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0148607112464238">
<title>Determination of Tolerance of EN</title>
<p>The type of nutrition and the calculation of the calorie requirement or energy expenditure at rest were indicated by the physician in charge of the patient, using the Harris-Benedict equation. The feed was infused at a constant velocity using an infusion pump, and the systems were replaced every 24 hours. The kilocalories calculated for EN every 24 hours were converted to milliliters per hour, according to the kilocalories per milliliter of each type of nutrition (standard, nutrition for renal disorders, hepatic disorders, hyperproteic nutrition, etc). Feeding was started at one-third of the final infusion rate, increasing one-third each 8 hours until the final infusion rate was accomplished.</p>
<p>Nurses judged gastric intolerance every 6 to 8 hours, considering intolerance when retention was higher than 200 mL. If treatable causes were detected, corrections had to be done. Infusion rates were adjusted according to tolerance, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112464238">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>We considered that the patient had tolerated the EN when nutrition requirements had been achieved 72 hours after the start of it. Patients were considered intolerant, thereby receiving &lt;80% of the prescribed diet in 72 hours, when they presented at least 1 of the following GI complications: abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting and/or regurgitation, high gastric residual (gastric residual was checked every 6 hours and considered high when the recovered volume was ≥200 mL), pulmonary aspiration, diarrhea, or constipation. Definitions of GI complications arising from the administration of the enteral diet were based on those established by Montejo’s group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112464238">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Absolute intolerance was considered when retention was higher than 400 mL, treating causes, if possible, or considering PN vs nasojejunal tube nutrition, if not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0148607112464238">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were recorded from the moment EN was indicated until the time when the patient was considered to have tolerated nutrition or not. Data were collected by a single researcher. We observed the Spanish legislation on the protection of data of a personal nature (15/1999, 13 December, LOPD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112464238">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0148607112464238">
<title>Statistical Study</title>
<p>In the descriptive analysis, data for continuous variables are presented as means in the case of normal distribution and as medians otherwise, and data for categorical variables are presented as percentages. When extrapolating the descriptive data to the general population, a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used.</p>
<p>Simple between-group comparisons were made with the Student <italic>t</italic> test if the continuous variables were normally distributed and with the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test otherwise. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables and the Mantel-Haenszel linearity test for ordered categorical variables. In all cases, an α error of 0.05 was assumed. No corrections were performed for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>Our aim was to obtain a predictive model able to identify in advance the patients who would not tolerate EN. To do so, we used logistic regression. Since we wanted to obtain an equation with a predictive purpose, we had to produce a multiple logistic regression model that allows prediction of the response of new subjects with the lowest error possible. Therefore, we had to select the subset of variables that minimizes the residual variance.</p>
<p>Hosmer and Lemeshow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112464238">15</xref></sup> suggest a process of preselection of the variables based on the results of logistic regressions with a single independent variable, selecting as potential variables the ones that obtain <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.25. However, following Domènech Massons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112464238">16</xref></sup> we decided against using this model because major contributions of relevant variables may be masked in situations with high levels of confusion.</p>
<p>The modeling was performed in accordance with the technique described by Domènech Massons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112464238">16</xref></sup> At all times, we followed the hierarchical norm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112464238">17</xref></sup> Starting with the maximum model, using sequential inclusion, sequential exclusion, and stepwise regression, we obtained several more parsimonious models. In the second stage, we introduced the variables shown by the prior analyses to be the most important and added the remaining variables in a controlled fashion to improve the fit. The decision to include or exclude variables was not based on the <italic>P</italic> value alone. Whenever a variable was included or excluded, the changes produced in the coefficients of the other variables in the model were checked, paying special attention to the theoretically relevant variables. Every variable that produced a relevant change in certain coefficients was left in the model for better fit, even if its regression coefficient was not significant. In the third stage, interaction terms were included, in this case always based on their statistical significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112464238">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, to assess the discrimination of the model, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112464238">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112464238">19</xref></sup> All the analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0148607112464238">
<title>Calculation of the Sample</title>
<p>The main independent variable was basal IAP. We assumed that the rest of the variables acted as modifiers or as confounders of the effect, or as interaction variables. In accordance with the model described above, we estimated that 1 or 2 final variables may be included in the model, and then we estimated that we needed 20 “events” (nontolerance of enteral diet), 10 for each relevant variable included in the model. We also calculated the number necessary to perform a univariate comparison, taking the basal IAP as a continuous independent variable and the tolerance of enteral diet as a dependent variable. Assuming a standard deviation of 5, a minimal size of the effect to be detected of 4 mm Hg, an α error of 0.05, and a β error of 0.2, we calculated that 25 subjects per arm were needed for the study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Eighty-two patients were recruited. We excluded 10 patients from the monitoring of IAP because the devices for its determination were not available. Seventy-two patients (87.8%) were evaluated, with a mean age of 57.7 years (range, 17–88 years). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112464238">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112464238">2</xref> display the descriptive variables of the sample.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This prospective study was performed to determine the relationship between IAP and tolerance of EN in critically ill patients and to establish a threshold IAP value above which intolerance of the diet is highly probable. The results appear to support the initial hypothesis: there is a relationship between tolerance of EN and IAP, and patients with intolerance present higher IAP values.</p>
<p>Roughly a third of patients admitted to critical care units develop IAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112464238">10</xref></sup> Our study assessed IAP in a group of patients with a high probability of developing IAH. Increased IAP causes a reduction in the mesenteric flow and intestinal mucosa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112464238">20</xref></sup> and ischemia of the gastric mucosa may appear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112464238">21</xref></sup>; these alterations compromise peristalsis and absorption in the gut, causing greater intraluminal distension and greater pressure inside the abdomen. It is logical to think that abdominal distension, vomiting and/or regurgitation, gastric retention, diarrhea, and even pulmonary aspiration, all recognized as complications of EN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112464238">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112464238">4</xref></sup> will appear more frequently in patients who have higher IAP and do not tolerate the diet.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that baseline IAP was significantly related to tolerance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112464238">Table 4</xref>) and may be clinically relevant. It shows that patients with a median APACHE score of 13–14 as well as an IAP of around 14 mm Hg prior to the initiation of the diet have a high probability of intolerance, whereas those with an IAP below 11 mm Hg will tolerate the diet. This finding may help to avoid failed attempts to introduce the diet and reduce the incidence of its complications, which undermine the nutrition objectives at a crucial time when the energy demand must be supplied at all costs.</p>
<p>It might be speculated that EN itself might increase IAP, but it has been established that there is no relation between the 2 parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112464238">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the prognostic scores studied, APACHE II and surgical POSSUM were associated with tolerance of the diet. Other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238">3</xref></sup> have found that patients who do not tolerate the diet are more severely ill and present higher APACHE II scores. In all likelihood, these patients are septic, hypovolemic, and hypoalbuminemic, conditions that increase capillary permeability and create retroperitoneal and visceral edema, and they have a greater tendency to develop IAH and diet intolerance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112464238">Table 4</xref>). We did not find significant differences with regard to SOFA scores, although they were higher in patients who did not tolerate the diet.</p>
<p>Patients who tolerated the diet had higher surgical POSSUM scores. This distortion may be due to the fact that this score includes physiological and analytical variables and surgical data. It is clear that the presence of cancer or the need for 2 procedures in the same surgery may not influence the tolerance of the diet but may increase the POSSUM score.</p>
<p>Most studies have found a relation between tolerance of the diet and prognosis. Our study shows that patients who are intolerant to EN (42.9%) have mortality rates similar to other studies. However, we obtained higher tolerance rates (71% vs 40%–60%) than previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112464238">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112464238"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112464238">5</xref></sup> Moreover our patients presented a mean (SD) APACHE II score of 13.6 (6), similar to the scores reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The definition of tolerance of EN still includes a large number of parameters, some of them based on highly subjective data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112464238">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112464238"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112464238">4</xref></sup> In our study, we based our criterion of tolerance on the most commonly used parameters. Establishing an objective, cheap, and easy-to-calculate parameter for predicting tolerance before starting EN treatment in critically ill patients may help to avoid complications and may aid the attainment of nutrition objectives. The best strategy for EN administration appears to be to start the diet with the precise volume required to reach the nutrition objectives promptly and without waiting for the patient to stabilize or for gastric emptying and peristalsis in the gut to return to normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112464238">23</xref></sup> However, some studies argue against the use of this strategy and even consider it dangerous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112464238">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112464238">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112464238">23</xref></sup> As mentioned before, our protocol indicates beginning the diet at one-third of the goal rate (see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112464238">appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>The vast majority of our patients (94.5%) were undergoing mechanical ventilation. Although it is known that mechanical ventilation may increase the number of complications related to an enteral diet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112464238">24</xref></sup> we were unable to relate ventilation to tolerance.</p>
<p>Following our center’s nutrition protocol (see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112464238">appendix</xref>), 63.9% of our patients required motility stimulants (metroclopramide). Although these drugs are habitually used in nutrition protocols, like other authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112464238">25</xref></sup> we were unable to relate tolerance to the use of motility stimulants.</p>
<p>Our multivariate analysis showed that the variables that were finally predictive of tolerance were baseline IAP and APACHE II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148607112464238">Table 5</xref>), with both parameters presenting notable sensitivity and specificity. Once the statistical model is obtained, it is important to give a clear, objective clinical message; with our data, a ROC curve can be constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112464238">Figure 1</xref>) that offers a high predictive accuracy. We can predict in 80.3% of cases if a patient with EN may tolerate the diet or not, provided we know the baseline IAP value and the APACHE II.</p>
<p>In this way, we can obtain values for baseline IAP that predict intolerance of an enteral diet for any APACHE II score, always bearing in mind that patients with low APACHE II scores will need higher baseline IAP to present intolerance, whereas more severely ill patients may not tolerate the diet even if their levels of baseline IAP are not particularly high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148607112464238">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the main limitations of the study was that we had few surgical patients. On the other hand, our patients had etiological and predisposing factors resulting in the development of IAH. We do not know how applicable the measurement of IAP may be in patients receiving EN who do not have IAH. However, we know that roughly a third of the patients admitted to critical care units develop IAH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112464238">10</xref></sup> and if we consider both the APACHE II score and baseline IAP, we can also venture a prognosis for these patients. A possibility for the future would be to study groups of patients with similar diagnosis and severity.</p>
<p>The inclusion of our patients was started before publication of the results of the World Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WCASC) in 2006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112464238">26</xref></sup> and 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112464238">27</xref></sup> For this reason, we used 50 mL of saline instead of 25 mL to measure IAP. To avoid bias, we decided not to change the monitoring technique of the IAP.</p>
<p>Our results show that there is a relationship between tolerance of EN and IAP in critically ill patients. The study provides an accurate predictive model of patients who will tolerate an enteral diet and may achieve their nutrition targets and can thus help to reduce the associated complications, morbidity, and cost.</p>
