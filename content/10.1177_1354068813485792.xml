<p>The crisis of social democracy, whether in policy practice or in electoral terms, has been a persistent theme in the political science literature on party politics for some time. The book under review represents a serious comparative stock-taking of European social democratic politics, including those in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the condition of the US Democrats. To its credit, it is more than a simple ‘snap-shot’ of the electoral trials and tribulations of the parties, and instead successfully investigates more fundamental issues related to the individual case studies and explores developments in policy issues such as social policy, immigration and the impact of European integration.</p>
<p>The chapter by Moschonas engages directly with comparative electoral analysis, and while there is some fluctuation in a few national cases, the overall verdict for social democratic parties in Western Europe is one of electoral erosion. Although not yet written off into the dustbin of history, Moschonas notes that any more electoral degradation and social democratic parties in many cases could no longer be considered ‘natural parties of government’. Three chapters deal with the US Democrats, and although they captured the White House in 2008, the party is experiencing significant change. Teixeira presents an analysis of secular trends among different groups in American society to paint a rather hopeful picture of Democratic electoral strength, partly by reassessing the ostensible strength of the Republican Party. Howard focuses on social welfare in America and, while conceding it is not in the same league as in Western Europe, there have nevertheless been efforts at alleviating poverty. Still, as he demonstrates, the Democrats have changed their approach, abandoning social insurance and instead embracing indirect forms of assistance through the tax system, a method that makes it unlikely to arrest the trend of growing inequality in American society. Finally, Shoch reviews the Democrats’ mixed sympathies for trade liberalization and draws attention to the developing position that free trade requires compensatory domestic spending. This is not surprising, as the blue-collar Democratic voter base has been especially hurt by the migration of jobs overseas, perceived by many to be the result of free trade agreements. Taken together, these three chapters present a mixed picture of the Democratic Party: on the one hand it may be stronger than some political commentators suggest, in relation to the rise of Tea Party Republicans, but on the other it has a changing voter base and policy toward the welfare state, leaving some of its historic – and poorest – constituents with little to celebrate.</p>
<p>On the European continent, there are certainly differences between older, Western European social democratic parties and those in post-communist countries. The chapter by De Waele and Soare on post-communist parties makes painfully clear that social democracy in Central and Eastern Europe is more apparent (in party programmes) than real (in public policy). Among other reasons, including the fate of communist successor parties, the weak organization of new parties and so forth, is the critical, if not fateful, decision to join the EU as soon as possible. Supporting EU-inspired neo-liberal economic policies may not have been exactly what these societies required so soon after regime change. This has weakened the ability of the centre-left in countries ranging from Poland to Bulgaria to mobilize a consistent voter base. In Western Europe, the book presents case studies of the Nordic countries (with some focus on Sweden), the UK and France. The chapter on the Nordic experience by Pontusson strongly suggests that, however ironic in light of the travails of the Social Democrats in Sweden, it is certainly not a decline in the attraction of the social democratic policy regime that accounts for the mixed electoral fortunes of parties in the region. The chapters on France and the UK have a more political and electoral focus, assessing the strategy and policies of the French Socialists and New Labour over the past twenty years. Both chapters end on a somewhat pessimistic note, as (at the time of writing, at least) both parties, for different reasons, appeared to have certain ideological and structural impediments to an electoral resurgence.</p>
<p>The book is also noteworthy for the inclusion of chapters on the policy challenges presented by immigration and ‘new social risks’. Immigration presents social democrats with a challenge between the defence of universal rights and domestic constituents’ economic welfare, although the author (Perez) rightly points out the variance in national conditions. Jenson’s chapter is on how Sweden, the UK and Germany, representing three models of welfare regimes, have responded to new social risks associated with family poverty and labour market exclusion, among many others, and how their response differed according to their traditional treatment of the old social risks of poverty and unemployment. A chapter on the impact of the EU on social democratic parties – a mixed fortune by any standard – by Ross rounds off the book, and the editors summarize well the material presented in a concluding chapter.</p>
<p>This book makes for an informative and timely, if sobering, read, especially for those centre-left parties in opposition. Not only is the path back to power uncertain, but the policy challenges and ability to provide something distinctly social democratic in many areas, constrained by globalization and European integration, are immense. One consideration that I found missing in this volume is attention to the ‘left of the left’, that is, those parties which have found a niche to the left of social democrats and, in some cases, have often appeared serious contenders in structuring the vote for the left in general, and can therefore influence the ability of social democrats to return to power. I refer to Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, and perhaps also to Germany, where the Greens and Die Linke have complicated the German Social Democrats’ electoral and coalition strategy.</p>
