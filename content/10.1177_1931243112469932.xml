But those were nearly the only positive numbers in the survey. Overall, the percentage of minorities in both radio and television fell for the third straight year, although the drop in TV was small.</p><p>Women in radio news rose slightly, but the percentage of women radio news directors went down, as did both the overall percentage of women in TV news and women TV news directors. The drop in women TV news directors was small and the percentage of women TV news directors stood at the second-highest level ever.</p><p>As far as minorities were concerned, the bigger picture remained unchanged. In the last 20 years, the minority population in the United States has risen 9.4%; but the minority workforce in TV news was up 2.4%, and the minority workforce in radio was actually half what it was two decades ago (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243112469932">Table 1</xref>). Still, TV news diversity remains far ahead of newspaper (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1931243112469932">Table 2</xref>), where the 2010 survey by the American Society of News Editors found that minority journalists make up 13.3% of newsroom employees at daily newspapers.

That was up slightly from the previous year’s 72%. Twenty percent were white; 3.5% were Asian American; 2.6% were African American. That was down for white and black and up for Asian American.</p><p>As usual, men outnumbered women for almost all groups except Asian Americans, where women outnumbered men 1.5:1 and Native Americans, which were even. Otherwise, differences among Hispanics 3.6% male to 2.2% female; whites: 48.6% to 31.2%; blacks 6.7% to 4.8%.</p><p>In radio, the percentage of minorities fell substantially. All groups dropped except Native American.</p><p>The overall percentage of minority news directors in TV increased by almost 2% in 2009–2010 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1931243112469932">Table 5</xref>). It was still below the all-time high, but it was certainly among the highest percentages I have seen. Much of that was fueled by a jump in Asian American news directors. Historically, minority news directors have been concentrated in the largest markets. It was still highest in markets 1–25, but the percentages were in double digits for all market sizes except 51–100. That was a first. The percentage was still lowest at the largest stations—just 2.8% minority in newsrooms of 51+ staffers. Fox affiliates had the highest percentage at 15.8%, followed by CBS at 10.8%. Both ABC and NBC affiliates were between 6 and 7%. Still, the big four network affiliates, overall, had 9.7% minority news directors. That is up from 6.9% the year before. As usual, minority news directors were most common in the South and West and least likely in the Midwest.</p><table-wrap id="table5-1931243112469932" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Broadcast News Directors . . .

It was still the second-highest percentage ever. It’s also worth emphasizing that the percentage of women TV news directors in the RTNDA/Hofstra University Annual Survey was based on a complete station census—not projected from a smaller sample.

In 2009, the number edged up to 41.4%, but in 2010 it went back down to 40.0%. That could indicate that women in TV news lost their jobs at a higher rate than men, but it could also just be an anomaly in the numbers. Perhaps, I will have the answer after next year’s survey.</p><p>Readers with sharp eyes might wonder how women can be in all stations based on staff size but in smaller percentages based on market size. That is because I have all market sizes for all stations, but quite a few stations did not tell me exact staff size. All the stations that supply staff size reported having women in the news department, but that was not the case for all stations that returned the survey. That kind of disparity does not happen often, but it is one of the hazards in survey research.</p><p>A mixed picture for women in radio news in 2010 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1931243112469932">Table 8</xref>). The percentage of women in the radio workforce stayed essentially the same (up by 1.0%). The percentage of stations with women rose by 10%, but the percentage of women radio news directors fell by 9%.

In 2009–2010, under 2% of those GMs were minorities. The overall percentage of minority went up slightly because minorities at independent stations went up. Among the network affiliates, ABC and NBC stations were much higher than CBS or Fox—but all were low.</p><p>At non-Hispanic stations (which run local news), minority GM numbers were cut by one third from the year before . . . which was down two thirds from the year before that. Minority GMs at non-Hispanic stations have gone from 9.8% to 3.1% to 2.6% in this survey. Most of those are black. Seventy percent of the GMs at Hispanic stations were Hispanic; the rest were white.</p><p>Both minority and women GM numbers in radio went up in this survey (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1931243112469932">Table 12</xref>).

The median was 44 and the average was 45. Overall, the age ranged from 28 to 69. Generally, news directors were a little older in the largest markets and the largest stations, but the differences were quite small. Network affiliation and region made no difference.</p><p>News directors appeared to be getting a lot less nomadic. The typical TV news director had been at his or her station for just over 6 years (although not necessarily as news director). The average tenure at that station for the news director was 8½ years. One news director had been at the same station for 48 years. The numbers did not vary a lot by market size, although news directors in the very smallest markets tended to have been there a little less than for other markets. Overall, news directors were a little more stable in the Midwest and Northeast than in the South and West.</p><p>In radio, the median age for news directors was 48 and the average was 45. Interestingly, the average and median ages for news directors at commercial stations was about 10 years older than for those at noncommercial stations.</p><p>Radio news directors are even less nomadic than TV news directors.
