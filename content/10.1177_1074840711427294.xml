<abstract>
<p>Based on a review of 64 published reports, this article addresses the implications of current research for the further development of the Family Management Style Framework (FMSF). Articles are published in 46 different journals, including 13 in nursing and 12 in interdisciplinary outlets. Most studies are based on samples of less than 50 individuals. The review provides continuing support for the 8 dimensions of the framework, with between 8 and 16 reports supporting the relevance of each. Changes to the sociocultural component of the framework are proposed as well as wording changes to reflect the broader applicability of the framework. The family’s social network, health care and education professionals, and resources predominate as key influences on family management.</p>

<body>
<p>the Family Management Style Framework (FMSF) is one of multiple frameworks that have been used to describe family response to health-related challenges. The FMSF was developed to enhance understanding of how families incorporate the work of managing a child’s chronic condition within family life, with the most recent version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840711427294">Figure 1</xref>) being published in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>). In a 2008 article summarizing the conceptual, empirical, and methodological efforts that have contributed to the development of the FMSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840711427294">Knafl, Deatrick, &amp; Gallo, 2008</xref>), the authors described the framework as a “conceptualization of key elements of family members’ efforts to manage a child’s chronic condition and incorporate condition management into everyday family life” (p. 2). The FMSF directs investigators’ and clinicians’ attention to the intersection of condition management and family life. As such, it is narrower in scope than frameworks addressing overall family functioning or family coping and adaptation to a stressor. On the other hand, the FMSF is broader in scope than conceptualizations of family response addressing a specific chronic condition or a single aspect of family response such as decision making.</p>

<p>The FMSF is recognized as a useful framework for furthering knowledge of family response to childhood chronic illness as evidenced by its inclusion in major texts on families and health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1074840711427294">Van Riper, 2010</xref>) and the recently published <italic>Encyclopedia of Family Health</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840711427294">Deatrick &amp; Beacham, 2011</xref>). It has provided the conceptual underpinnings for studies of family life in the context of childhood chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840711427294">Alderfer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1074840711427294">Sullivan-Bolyai, Knafl, Deatrick, &amp; Grey, 2003</xref>), and clinicians have addressed its potential relevance for nursing practice (Ogle, 2006). The initial focus of the FMSF was on family management of a child’s chronic physical condition. However, researchers have used it to study family management of other conditions and family contexts such as breastfeeding a premature infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840711427294">Krouse, 2002</xref>) and end-of-life decision making for an adult family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1074840711427294">Weigand, Deatrick, &amp; Knafl, 2008</xref>), and the articles in this special issue report additional new applications.</p>
<p>In the most recent description of the FMSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>), we anticipated the need for further development through incorporation of new research on family response to childhood chronic conditions and new applications of the framework. We continue to see the FMSF as work in progress and welcome efforts to further delineate its major components, adapting them as needed to be applicable to new family contexts and situations. In this article, we address the implications of current research for the further development of the FMSF. The remaining articles in this special issue of <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic> present results of new applications of the framework and their implications for its ongoing development.</p>
<p>Since the 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>) description of the framework, further development efforts have been focused on additional empirical and methodological work. Gallo and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840711427294">Gallo, Knafl, &amp; Angst, 2009</xref>) used the FMSF as the conceptual underpinnings for a study of family management of genetic information and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840711427294">Knafl and colleagues (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840711427294">2007)</xref> developed a structured measure of family management, the Family Management Measure (FaMM). Subsequently, Deatrick and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427294">Deatrick, Mullaney, &amp; Mooney-Doyle, 2009</xref>) verified the applicability of the FaMM for use in a study of families whose adolescents and young adults survived brain tumors, as the study assessing the psychometric properties study of the FaMM excluded children with cancer.</p>
<p>In this article, we again turn our attention to conceptual refinement. Our purpose is to continue the development of FMSF by further elaborating the eight dimensions comprising its three components (Definition of the Situation, Management Behaviors, Perceived Consequences) and the sociocultural factors that influence family management. Further development of the framework was based on a review of research reports of family response to childhood conditions that was guided by two broad questions. Regarding the eight dimensions of the FMSF, we asked: What evidence is there for modifying the current dimensions or adding new ones? Regarding the sociocultural context of family management, we asked: What factors have been identified as major influences on family management? We were especially interested in addressing the second question, as we recognized that sociocultural context is the least developed aspect of the FMSF.</p>
<sec id="section1-1074840711427294" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Research reports were included in the review if they met the following criteria: (a) published between January 1998 and June 2010 in an English-language journal, and (b) reported data on some aspect of family system response to a child’s chronic condition. Studies focusing on end-of-life conditions were excluded, but there were no other limitations on chronic conditions included in the sample. Because the most recent version of the FMSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>) is based on research reports published between 1988 and 1998, we chose to focus the current review on more recent research works. In addition, we broadened the search to include families of children with developmental delays as well as chronic physical conditions. Although the research had to be reported in an English-language journal, studies conducted outside North American were included. We knew from our prior review of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>) that studies with diverse conceptual underpinnings could have relevance for the continued development of the FMSF and, therefore, did not limit our review to studies based on the FMSF. Our intent was to identify a broad array of studies with regard to family and child characteristics, chronic conditions, aspects of family response studied, and disciplinary origins.</p>
<p>With guidance from a university librarian, we used a combination of hand and computer searches (Sociological Abstracts, Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, ERIC, Academic Search Premier, Social Work Abstracts, and Family &amp; Society Worldwide) using the following search terms: (<italic>Famil* or parent* or mother* or father* or caregiv*</italic>) <italic>and</italic> (<italic>Child* or adolesc*</italic>) and (<italic>Disab* or chronic*</italic>), <italic>and</italic> (<italic>Adapt* or adjust* or cop*</italic>). The initial search yielded 1,928 references that were reduced to 156 after eliminating clearly irrelevant reports. Review of the abstract of these 156 articles reduced the list of articles to 64, with most articles being eliminated because they either were not research reports or reported only findings related to individual family members and not the family system as a whole. Data in the articles were reported from 62 different studies.</p>
<p>To assure the systemic review of articles, we completed two summary grids. The first, completed by the third author and a research assistant with guidance from the first and second authors, summarized the characteristics of each article (purpose, conceptual underpinnings, sample, design, measures). The second, completed by the first two authors, summarized data relevant to sociocultural context (factors supporting or impeding family management) and the framework’s three major components and their underlying dimensions: Definition of the Situation (child identity, illness view, management mindset, parental mutuality), Management Behaviors (parenting philosophy, management approach), and Perceived Consequences (family focus, future expectations). Our review of results pertinent to each dimension was focused on evidence supporting the salience of the dimension and evidence for refining it. We also noted any evidence for the addition of new dimensions to the framework. Since relatively few studies were based on the FMSF, results were judged to be related to the dimension if they were consistent with the current definition of the dimension. For example, the author might not use the term <italic>Management Mindset</italic>, but present data on parental reports of the ease or difficulty associated with carrying out the treatment regimen. Evidence for a new dimension came from reports of aspects of Definition of the Situation, Management Behaviors, or Perceived Consequences not included in the FMSF that were identified in multiple reports. Using a summary grid format, the first two authors independently summarized the results of three articles. On the basis of a comparison of these three independently completed summaries, we further specified guidelines for what information to extract from articles and how much detail to include in each summary. The first two authors shared the work of summarizing results reported in the remaining 61 articles. The methods grid was used to provide an overview of the research reports included in the review. Our analysis was focused on a review of the results grids, using a constant comparison approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1074840711427294">Patton, 2002</xref>) to identify evidence for confirming the relevance or for modifying the FMSF.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Following a description of the studies included in the sample, we report evidence supporting the ongoing relevance of the components of the FMSF and their underlying dimensions. In addition, we identify aspects of the framework in need of modification, either through further refinement of the definition of current dimensions or the addition of new dimensions. Based on this review, we did not find evidence of the need to add additional dimensions to the framework.</p>
<sec id="section3-1074840711427294">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The 64 reports included in the sample were published in 46 different journals. Thirteen articles were published in nursing journals and 12 in interdisciplinary journals. Disciplines represented in the remaining journals included education, family science, occupational therapy, physical therapy, psychiatry, psychology, and sociology, each with 1 to 4 articles. Fifteen journals had a pediatric focus and 5 had a family focus. The 64 reports included in the sample were based on varying research designs and samples. Forty-two were based on data from studies using qualitative methodologies, 16 were based on quantitative studies, and 6 reported results from mixed-methods designs. Fifty-seven reports were based on results from a cross-sectional study, 6 used a longitudinal design, and 1 reported data collected both longitudinally and as a cross-section. Across all studies, data were collected from 3,107 individuals, representing a total of 2,637 families. Across studies, the number of participants ranged from less than 10 to more than 200, with most (<italic>n</italic> = 34) having between 11 and 50 participants. Ten studies included only mothers, 6, only nonmothers, and the remainder included multiple family members, with mothers comprising the majority of respondents.</p>
<p>Reports were evenly divided between those focusing on a single condition (<italic>n</italic> = 29) and those including multiple conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 30). Five reports were limited to families of children who were technology dependent. The conditions represented in the sample were varied and included both chronic illnesses (e.g., asthma, Type 1 diabetes) and disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, spina bifida). Twenty-four reported data from samples from Asia, Australia, Europe, or South America. Six studies referenced the FMSF or our work on normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840711427294">Deatrick, Knafl, &amp; Murphy-Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1074840711427294">
<title>Sociocultural Context</title>
<p>Consistent with how the sociocultural context of family response to childhood chronic conditions is addressed in the literature, it is conceptualized in the FMSF as influences on family management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427294">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>). Our current analysis supports this conceptualization of sociocultural factors as contextual influences on family members’ Definition of the Situation, Management Behaviors, and Perceptions of the Consequences of the child’s condition for family life. In the current analysis, we examined the nature of those influences more thoroughly than we had in the past.</p>
<p>Despite a focus on family system response to childhood chronic conditions, 65% (<italic>n</italic> = 42) of the articles also reported data on factors outside the immediate family that contributed to the ease or difficulty of family management. Consistent with the predominantly qualitative design of the research reports, most of these reports (80%) reported data from parents’ narrative accounts of factors influencing family management, with relatively few reporting quantitative or demographic data (i.e., socioeconomic variables) related to family management. Taken together, these articles provide evidence of the continued importance of situating family management within a broader sociocultural context.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed three groups of factors that have been identified repeatedly as contributing to the ease or difficulty of family management: the family’s social network, healthcare and education professionals and systems, and resources. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840711427294">Table 1</xref> summarizes the factors identified as influencing family response in 10 or more articles. Twenty-three articles reported data on the importance of others in the family’s social network in supporting or hindering family response. Although some authors described the positive contributions of extended family and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840711427294">Alexander, Rennick, Carnevale, &amp; Davis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840711427294">Canary, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711427294">Cashin, Small, &amp; Solberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840711427294">Chen &amp; Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840711427294">Kelso, French, &amp; Fernandez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1074840711427294">Murray, Kelley-Soderholm, &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1074840711427294">Robinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1074840711427294">Wong &amp; Heriot, 2008</xref>), others reported that those outside the family and society’s devaluation of the ill and disabled impeded families’ management efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840711427294">Barbosa, Chaud, &amp; Gomes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711427294">Craig &amp; Scambler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427294">Esdaile, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427294">Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840711427294">Fisher &amp; Goodley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840711427294">Gannoni &amp; Shute, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840711427294">Larson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840711427294">Lemanek, Jones, &amp; Lieberman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840711427294">Mawn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840711427294">McKeever &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1074840711427294">Morse, Wilson, &amp; Penrod, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1074840711427294">Olson &amp; Esdaile, 2000</xref>) or reported a variable—influence on family’s social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840711427294">Lewis, Kagan, &amp; Heaton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840711427294">Marshall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1074840711427294">Ogden, Van Eyk, Armstrong, &amp; Witt, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1074840711427294">Table 2</xref> lists articles reporting results related each of the eight FMSF dimensions. There is support for the continued relevance for each dimension, with between 8 and 22 reporting content related to the dimension. These articles contributed further insights into these aspects of family management and to the modification of two dimensions: parenting philosophy and family focus dimensions. In addition, we now define each using the term <italic>condition</italic> rather than <italic>illness</italic> to reflect the broader applicability of the framework and currently preferred terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1074840711427294">Perrin, Bloom, &amp; Guttmacher, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Definition of the Situation</title>
<p>The literature supports both the salience and current definitions of the child identity, illness view, management mindset, and parental mutuality dimensions. The only change in these dimensions is to substitute the term <italic>condition</italic> for <italic>illness</italic> in the <italic>illness view</italic> dimension.</p>
<p>Child identity and view of condition remain the foundation for family management. Parents’ beliefs about the child’s capabilities are tied closely to their understanding of the condition and its associated demands and limitations. The literature reports that parents focus on the likely impact of the condition with regard to the normalcy of the child’s development, daily life, and future possibilities, with variation across parents in the extent to which they equate the condition with limitations and vulnerabilities. In several reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840711427294">Bedell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840711427294">Canary, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840711427294">Graungaard &amp; Skov, 2007</xref>), authors highlight the challenge faced by parents when it is difficult to distinguish normal from condition-related behaviors and characteristics. Moreover, as noted in the following discussion of Parenting Philosophy, some parents are highly critical of the social value attributed to normalcy and distinguish their view of their child’s capabilities from how they feel about and value the child. In other words, parents may view their child as very different from other children, but emphasize the extent to which the child is loved and viewed as making a valued contribution to family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427294">Esdaile, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427294">Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840711427294">Larson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840711427294">Marshall et al., 2003</xref>; Roy &amp; Chatterjee, 2005). Other authors report that parents’ views of the predictability of the condition related to its course and daily management are other important aspects of their view of the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840711427294">Bedell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711427294">Burke, Kauffmann, LaSalle, Harrison, &amp; Wong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840711427294">Case-Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840711427294">Graungaard &amp; Skov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840711427294">Larson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1074840711427294">Nolan, Camfield, &amp; Camfield, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Grounded in their understanding of the child and condition, parent’s management mindset reflects their assessment of the unique demands they are likely to face as parents and their ability to meet those demands. Across studies, parents vary in the extent to which they view the demands of managing the condition as achievable extensions of their parental role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711427294">Cashin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840711427294">Gannnonni &amp; Shute, 2010</xref>), an all-consuming, and at times overwhelming, responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840711427294">Barbosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840711427294">Case-Smith, 2004</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840711427294">Cimete, 2002</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711427294">Heiman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840711427294">Kelso et al., 2005</xref>), one that fluctuates depending on the child’s health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427294">Esdaile, 2009</xref>). For partnered parents, the extent to which partners have a shared or differing view their child, the condition, and approach to condition management (parental mutuality) also has implications for overall family management. The articles relevant to this dimension all reported data from families in which parents had a shared perspective, though not always a shared division of labor, noting that this shared perspective contributed to the family’s ability to manage the challenges of their child’s condition. In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840711427294">Cimete, 2002</xref>), the author reported that initial disagreements and discrepant views had been resolved over time.</p>

<title>Management Behaviors</title>
<p>Current research supports the continued importance of the two Management Behavior dimensions—parenting philosophy and management approach—and also provides evidence for further refinement of the parenting philosophy dimension. The literature indicates that parents’ overarching beliefs about disability as well as religious or spiritually grounded beliefs, in concert with their goals, priorities, and values, serve to guide their view of their child and approach to family management. Accordingly, the word <italic>beliefs</italic> has been added to the definition to highlight an aspect of parenting philosophy that may also shape parents’ management efforts. Researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427294">Esdaile, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427294">Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840711427294">Marshall et al., 2003</xref>; Roy &amp; Chatterjee, 2005) have found that some parents view living with a child with a chronic condition, especially one associated with severe developmental delays, as a different way of being in the world, and they come to value that difference in their child. These parents also may question the social value attributed to normalcy and emphasize their child’s worth as a special human being who engenders their love and contributes in positive ways to their family life. Grounded in their religious beliefs, parents may view caring for their child as a special trust or divine gift. The definition of management approach remains unchanged. It is interesting to note, however, that some studies have found that an important aspect of developing a usual routine for managing the condition is knowing when and how to modify the routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840711427294">Case-Smith, 2004</xref>). Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840711427294">Bedell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711427294">Cashin et al., 2008</xref>) have noted the importance of involving siblings in the routine and making sure the child with the condition also has a usual routine for fulfilling any condition-related responsibilities, especially those done outside the home.</p>

<sec id="section8-1074840711427294">
<title>Perceived Consequences</title>
<p>The literature also supports the continued relevance of the <italic>family focus</italic> and <italic>future expectation</italic> dimensions of the “Perceived Consequences” component of the FMSF and provides direction for modifying the definition of the former. The family focus dimension has been expanded to include parents’ satisfaction with the balance between condition management and other aspects of family life as well as their assessment of the extent to which there is an appropriate balance. Particularly in families where the child is severely impaired, there may be considerable focus on condition management. Nonetheless, parents reported having developed a satisfactory routine to manage care, in some cases describing how the routine has entailed a new way of being a parent or a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840711427294">Barbosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840711427294">Brinchmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427294">Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1074840711427294">O’Brien, 2001</xref>). Parents’ expectations for their child’s and their family’s future also influence current management efforts. Depending on the condition, the future may be viewed as an extension of the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840711427294">Alexander et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840711427294">Brinchmann, 1999</xref>) or as uncertain and the source of ongoing concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840711427294">Barbosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711427294">Cashin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840711427294">Cimete, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427294">Esdaile, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711427294">Heiman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840711427294">Kelso et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840711427294">McLaughlin &amp; Goodley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1074840711427294">Todd, Welsh, &amp; Moriarty, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This review provided additional evidence for the salience of the FMSF dimensions and contributed to the further refinement and elaboration of how these dimensions shape family life in the context of childhood chronic conditions. In this review we went beyond the relatively small number of research reports based explicitly on the FMSF in order to situate the framework within family science by including research that was implicitly related to the FMSF. This meant that we inferred the relevance of these research reports to both the components of the FMSF and to the framework as a whole. To strengthen the rigor of this approach, we developed a structured template for systematically summarizing the reports, taking care during the summarization process not to infer nonexistent linkages. We also consulted with one another when in doubt as to whether content was relevant to the framework or its components and came to consensus about any modification to either.</p>
<p>Based on this review as well as beginning interest in applying the FMSF to families managing other than childhood chronic conditions, we propose two changes to the model depicting the framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1074840711427294">Figure 2</xref>). First, rather than retaining the current conceptualization of sociocultural context as perceived influences, we are adopting the label <italic>contextual influences</italic>. Several colleagues have noted that the term <italic>perceived</italic> gives the impression that these influences are not real, and that is not our intent. Our choice of the term was meant to emphasize the importance of taking parental perceptions into account, which may also have been a source of confusion. Hopefully, this change will avoid such confusion in the future. The revised framework also names the three primary contextual influences identified in this review (social network, access to resources, and interchanges with healthcare and school systems).</p>

<p>Revised Family Management Framework</p>

<p>As reflected in some of the articles in this special issue, the framework is providing the conceptual underpinnings for a broader array of family management situations than initially anticipated. We fully endorse the application of the FMSF to new contexts when investigators are addressing how families incorporate the demands of a health care challenge into everyday family life. However, we also caution investigators to consider carefully the FMSF’s appropriateness by assessing the fit between the aims of their study and the focus of the framework. To reflect the broader relevance of the FMSF, we have removed the specification of family members as child, mother, father, and sibling and now use the more general terminology of <italic>person with the condition</italic> and <italic>individual family members</italic>. Investigators may choose to use these generic terms or substitute terminology that is specific to their sample (e.g., caregiver, care recipient)</p>
<p>There are no other changes in the depiction of the FMSF, but we also would like to clarify our view of family management style. The dimensions of the framework are the key elements—the building blocks—of the family’s management style. We would expect that styles would vary considerably across families, conditions being studied, and cultures. In our early work, we identified five styles or patterns of response (thriving, accommodating, enduring, struggling, floundering; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840711427294">Knafl, Breitmayer, Gallo, &amp; Zoeller, 1996</xref>). Other investigators have identified other patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840711427294">Krouse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1074840711427294">Weigand et al., 2008</xref>). We would anticipate that future studies would identify other patterns and encourage investigators not to assume that patterns found in one sample would apply to others.</p>
<p>The newly developed FaMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840711427294">Knafl et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840711427294">2007</xref>), whose six scales are based on items derived from all eight of the FMSF dimensions, provides a tool for identifying patterns of management, based the configurations of parents’ scores across its six scales. The statistical technique of cluster analysis can be used to identify configurations (i.e., clusters) of scores. The instrument development study pointed to the interrelated nature of the components underlying family management, since four of the six FaMM scales include items from multiple components and all included items from multiple dimensions. The FaMM also furthers our ability to examine the relationship between different aspects or patterns of family management and the functioning of individual family members and the family system as a whole. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that how these dimensions are manifested in the family is likely to vary across family members and over time, and the nature and extent of that variation is a fruitful area for future research.</p>
<p>The FMSF directs our attention to internal family processes and family members’ efforts to incorporate condition management into everyday life. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind the sometimes pivotal influence of contextual factors on family management. As reported in this review, the family’s social network, access to resources, and interchanges with healthcare and school professionals and systems can either support or hinder their efforts to meet the challenges presented by condition management. A full understanding of the intersection of family life and chronic conditions requires knowledge of both internal family processes and the contextual factors that influence those processes, and researchers are encouraged to include both in future studies. Although the studies reviewed for this article reported data on how society in general and the family’s social network could support as well as hinder family management, the literature on the role of professionals has focused on negative interactions and unsupportive relationships. Research or integrative reviews examining the key aspects of developing and sustaining effective family–professional relationship is needed to advance knowledge of this important contextual influence.</p>
<p>We concluded our 2003 presentation of the FMSF stating, “As we continue our work related to the study and measurement of family management, we encourage other family researchers to contribute to the further development of the FMSF by applying it to a diversity of families and situations and identifying a fuller array of family management style themes and patterns” (p. 252). This challenge still has currency as we recognize major challenges faced by families who have a member with a chronic condition. One of the reviewers of this manuscript noted the FMSF is an “evolving heuristic, which should be carefully evaluated, critiqued, and refined over time.” We couldn’t agree more.</p>
