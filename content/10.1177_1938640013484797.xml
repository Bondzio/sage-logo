<abstract>
<p>Bone wax has been used for years by surgeons as a hemostatic agent to prevent bleeding from bone surfaces. Though the effectiveness of bone wax as a hemostatic agent while acting as a tamponade is well known, it is not without its complications. It has been documented in the medical literature that bone wax may remain in the body for many years as a foreign body and in some cases cause a giant cell reaction at various surgical sites. However, to the authors’ knowledge, there has not been a reported case of a foreign body giant cell reaction secondary to the use of bone wax in the current podiatric literature. Two case studies are described to bring attention to the fact that bone wax can interfere with bone healing while remaining attached to bone as a foreign body and induce a giant cell reaction and local inflammatory effects in the human foot.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone wax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640013484797">Figure 1</xref>) is a sterile mixture of beeswax, paraffin, and isopropyl palmitate. It has been indicated for the control of bleeding bone surfaces and is commercially available from several manufacturers. Bone wax acts as a mechanical barrier to achieve hemostasis from bleeding bone. Bone wax history dates back to 1850 in sinus surgery and popularized by Sir Victor Horsley in 1892 in neurological surgery for hemostasis of bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484797">1</xref></sup> Reviewing the package insert for the product, the only contraindication noted was osseous regeneration and fusion. Adverse reactions listed include only mild inflammatory reactions in tissues “adjacent” to the site of application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484797">2</xref></sup> Widely used for bone hemostasis, other applications, particularly in small joint surgery, include the prevention of capsulodesis after surgical procedures such as cheilectomies, ostectomies and debridement procedures adjacent to joint structures. We present 2 cases where bone wax caused a violent reaction to the patient raising concern about the general usage of this product.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>A review of the literature found only 3 articles concerning bone wax complications in the foot/ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484797">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013484797"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484797">5</xref></sup> Interestingly, however, the literature is replete with concerns regarding bone wax in spinal, sternal, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>The literature on bone wax consistently reveals 3 main complications:

<p>Studies have proven that where bone wax is present no osteoblasts are found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484797">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013484797"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484797">8</xref></sup> Likewise, there are studies that show impaired bacterial clearance in bone due to bone wax.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484797">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013484797"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013484797">11</xref></sup> Also noted was the formation of foreign body giant cell reaction and local inflammation at the site of bone wax application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484797">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013484797">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640013484797">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report 1</title>
<p>A 16-year-old male presented to our emergency department with pain, redness, swelling, and an open draining wound to the lateral side of his left foot. The patient was 18 months status post–left foot calcaneonavicular coalition resection with subtalar joint arthroereisis. Bone wax was used in this procedure for hemostasis and to help prevent boney regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640013484797">Figure 2</xref>). Physical exam found a paste-like substance draining from the wound. An incision and drainage was performed in the emergency department and a thick, white, clumpy substance resembling wax was noted within the wound.</p>

</fig>
<p>Subjectively, the patient stated that he had been experiencing discomfort with swelling, stinging, and burning for several months. However, the patient noted, that only in the past week had he noticed the wound formation with active drainage. Following his coalition resection, the patient had discovered he was allergic to many substances, including iodine, peanuts, bees, beeswax, and honey. The patient was otherwise healthy and extremely active.</p>
<p>Three days following his presentation to the emergency department, the patient was taken to the operating room for irrigation and wound debridement with all residual bone wax removed from the surgical site. The patient was seen 3 days postoperatively and noted immediate relief of his symptoms. The patient has since been followed up and relates no recurrence of symptoms or problems.</p>

<title>Case Report 2</title>
<p>A 51-year-old woman presented to clinic complaining of sudden pain and swelling to the first metatarsophalangeal joint 7 months status postcheilectomy for hallux limitus where bone wax was applied to the ostectomy site. X-rays revealed no complications and only clinical swelling and pain was noted. The patient was placed on an oral anti-inflammatory medication and referred to physical therapy for iontophoresis treatment. Two months later, x-rays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640013484797">Figures 3 and 4</xref>) confirmed osseous changes to the head of the first metatarsal. This was concerning for potential osteomyelitis or fracture and a magnetic resonance imaging scan was subsequently ordered.</p>

</fig>
<p>The magnetic resonance images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640013484797">Figures 5 and 6</xref>) noted an abnormal appearance of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with possible septic arthritis or osteomyelitis of the first metatarsal and proximal phalanx. Severe destructive changes were noted to the first metatarsal head with a complex signal fluid noted dorsal to the joint space.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient was taken back to the operating room 10 months status postcheilectomy for an irrigation and debridement with bone biopsy of the first metatarsal head. Bone biopsy pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640013484797">Figures 7 and 8</xref>) found a benign bone and fibroconnective tissue with focal foreign body giant cell response and a refractile polarizable foreign material with fibrosis. The soft tissue biopsy revealed focal keratinaceous debris and a foreign body giant cell response suggesting the possibility of a previously ruptured epidermal inclusion cyst. The patient has been followed in our clinic and symptoms have since been noted to have resolved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the presence of bone wax causing a foreign body giant cell reaction, granuloma formation, and increased infection rates is well documented in spine surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, dental surgery, neurosurgery, and the general surgical literature; to our knowledge, case reports in the foot and ankle are very limited. We cannot conclude whether this is because of a lack of reporting or the less frequent use of bone wax in foot and ankle surgery. At our program, bone wax is used frequently for various foot and ankle procedures. Within the past year we have now seen 2 cases of foreign body reaction/granuloma following the use of bone wax. It is now our practice and recommendation that bone wax not be used regularly in foot and ankle surgery. Although it may have its application, the complications may outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>There are alternative materials available; however, long-term studies and data are lacking. Several products appear promising: Ostene is a water-soluble alkylene oxide copolymer used for bone hemostasis. Unlike bone wax, Ostene is not metabolized but is eliminated from the body over time and shows decreased instances of infection and tissue reaction. Hemasorb, an absorbable bone hemostatic matrix putty, is noted to have better handling characteristics, which allows for more accurate application and control than standard bone wax. Hemasorb putty contains neutral sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is reported to increase hemostasis, provide excellent biocompatibility, and allow strong bone adhesion while being water resistant. Another option, Surgifoam, is an absorbable, porcine gelatin sponge composed of a sodium chloride solution from oxidized regenerative cellulose noted for its rapid hemostasis and large absorbing ability. It is water soluble and malleable for ease of handling.</p>

<sec id="section6-1938640013484797" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Review of the literature and analysis of our own patient cases suggest that the use of bone wax is not without its inherent risks and increased complications. Alternatives for bone hemostasis include Ostene, Floseal Hemostatic Matrix, Hemasorb, Gelfoam, Surgicel, Avitene, and topical thrombin. Further evaluation of these products, particularly in foot/ankle surgery, will ultimately determine their safety.</p>
