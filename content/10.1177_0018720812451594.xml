<title>Objective:</title>
<p>This study was aimed at examining team communication during postoperative handover and its relationship to clinicians’ self-ratings of handover quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720812451594">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Adverse events can often be traced back to inadequate communication during patient handover. Research and improvement efforts have mostly focused on the information transfer function of patient handover. However, the specific mechanisms between handover communication processes among teams of transferring and receiving clinicians and handover quality are poorly understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018720812451594">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional observation study using a taxonomy for handover behaviors developed on the basis of established approaches for analyzing teamwork in health care. Immediately after the observation, transferring and receiving clinicians rated the quality of the handover using a structured tool for handover quality assessment. Handover communication during 117 handovers in three postoperative settings and its relationship to clinicians’ self-ratings of handover quality were analyzed with the use of correlation analyses and analyses of variance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018720812451594">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>We identified significantly different patterns of handover communication between clinical settings and across handover roles. Assessments provided during handover were related to higher ratings of handover quality overall and to all four dimensions of handover quality identified in this study. If assessment was lacking, we observed compensatory information seeking by the receiving team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0018720812451594">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Handover quality is more than the correct, complete transmission of patient information. Assessments, including predictions or anticipated problems, are critical to the quality of postoperative handover.</p>

<title>Application:</title>
<p>The identification of communication behaviors related to high-quality handovers is necessary to effectively support the design and evaluation of handover improvement efforts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patient care is an inherently communicative activity. It is therefore not surprising that communication errors are frequently found to contribute to adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812451594">Bogenstätter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812451594">Catchpole, Giddings, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812451594">Greenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812451594">Lingard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451594">Manser &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>). Communication processes are particularly vulnerable at organizational interfaces, such as handovers from the operating room. Thus, handover research with a human factors focus has been identified as key to improving patient safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812451594">Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812451594">Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812451594">Harvey, Schuster, Durso, Matthews, &amp; Surabattula, 2007</xref>). Although research on patient handover is rapidly growing, systematic studies of handover practices and their relationship to indicators of handover quality remain sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451594">Manser &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812451594">Riesenberg, Leitzsch, Massucci, et al., 2009</xref>). This is in stark contrast to other industries in which handover has received considerable attention from human factors research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812451594">Patterson, Roth, Woods, Chow, &amp; Gomes, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Patient handover has been defined as the transfer of professional responsibility and accountability for some or all aspects of care for a patient, or groups of patients, to another person or professional group on a temporary or permanent basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451594">British Medical Association, National Patient Safety Agency, &amp; NHS Modernisation Agency, 2005</xref>). The primary goal of any handover is the accurate transfer of information necessary for continuing safe patient care. This goal has led to the dominant view of patient handover as one-way transmission of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812451594">Patterson &amp; Wears, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018720812451594">Wears &amp; Perry, 2010</xref>). This focus often neglects the multiple functions of handover (e.g., training, socialization, building and maintaining trustful relationships and clarification of roles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812451594">Haggerty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812451594">Patterson et al., 2004</xref>), the active role of the receiving clinicians in shaping effective communication processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812451594">Foster &amp; Manser, 2012</xref>), and most importantly, that patient handover is a team activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451594">Manser &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-0018720812451594">
<title>Patient Handover as a Team Activity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720812451594">Salas, Dickinson, Converse, and Tannenbaum (1992)</xref> define <italic>team</italic> as a “distinguishable set of two or more people who interact dynamically, interdependently, and adaptively toward a common and valued goal/object/mission, who have each been assigned specific roles or functions to perform, and who have a limited life span of membership” (p. 4). By this definition, patient handover clearly is a team activity beyond information transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451594">Manser &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This notion is supported by research conceptualizing patient handover as an episode of shared cognition and sensemaking between clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720812451594">Perry, 2004</xref>) that provides opportunities for collaborative cross-checking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812451594">Patterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720812451594">Patterson, Woods, Cook, &amp; Render, 2007</xref>). Shared cognition enables team members to have more accurate expectations and a compatible approach for task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812451594">Cannon-Bowers &amp; Salas, 2001</xref>). From this perspective, handovers are important “audit points” that are essential for potential recovery from failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812451594">Clancy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720812451594">Perry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith, Pope, Goodwin, &amp; Mort, 2008</xref>), and it can be assumed that team performance decreases and errors increase when team cognition “fails.”</p>
<p>Patient handover is a complex cognitive task. Effective handover should contribute to a broad knowledge base that helps individual team members to better understand the priorities for patient treatment, to anticipate future events, and to plan accordingly. Clinicians’ mental models of a patient’s condition, including the rationale for treatment decisions, uncertainties, and anticipations of problems, have to travel with the patient across care transitions. However, research shows that handovers often fail to optimally support receiving clinicians’ anticipation and planning. In a survey study, 31% of residents indicated that something had happened during a shift that the handover had not prepared them for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812451594">Borowitz, Waggoner-Fountain, Bass, &amp; Sledd, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In various complex work environments, a team cognition approach has been employed for the understanding of multiple elements of effective teamwork (e.g., team knowledge, communication, and coordination). It has been argued that team cognition is best defined and measured at the team level, particularly emphasizing team member interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812451594">Gorman, Cooke, &amp; Winner, 2006</xref>), and that this emphasis allows for diagnosing deficiencies and designing targeted interventions. However, patient handover has rarely if ever been studied with the application of this approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018720812451594">
<title>Handover Communication</title>
<p>Research on patient handover highlights the idiosyncratic nature of clinicians’ handover practices. However, specific team process behaviors, such as communication, that have been linked theoretically and empirically to team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451594">Burtscher, Wacker, Grote, &amp; Manser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812451594">Foushee, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018720812451594">Stout, Salas, &amp; Carson, 1994</xref>) have rarely been studied for patient handover. Instead, most studies, especially those on postoperative handover, focus on the transfer of accurate, complete information.</p>
<p>For example, observers of postoperative handovers have found that a considerable proportion of critical information (e.g., allergies, comorbidities, intraoperative problems, postoperative plan) was not communicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812451594">Nagpal, Vats, Ahmed, Vincent, &amp; Moorthy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018720812451594">Schwilk, Gravenstein, Blessing, &amp; Friesdorf, 1994</xref>). This finding is in line with research assessing recovery nurses’ perceptions of handover quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451594">Anwari, 2002</xref>). Only one third of handovers attained maximum scores for quality of verbal information. In 14% of handovers, anesthetists failed to communicate any of the five required information elements and gave all five in only 33%.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith et al. (2008)</xref> found that anesthetists and recovery nurses often had different expectations concerning content and timing of information transfer. Furthermore, handover communication was observed to be largely informal, and intraoperative problems were frequently underreported. Some authors highlight safety-relevant aspects beyond information transfer, such as negotiation of responsibility and voicing of concerns by receivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018720812451594">Smith &amp; Mishra, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the evidence on information loss and idiosyncratic handover practices, suggested improvements focus on standardization of content and sometimes on handover structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451594">Catchpole, De Leval, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451594">Manser &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>). A notable exception is one complex, multicomponent intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018720812451594">Weinger et al., 2010</xref>). Most interventions have been evaluated only on the basis of adherence to protocols and error rates. The effectiveness of handover standardization still has to be established in systematic outcome studies, and the specific mechanisms behind these connections have to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812451594">Foster &amp; Manser, in press</xref>). This goal requires an improved understanding of the communication process. Detailed analyses of the actual handover communication process are rare. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451594">Apker et al. (2010)</xref> coded handover communication between emergency physicians and hospitalists. These handovers were dominated by information giving, whereas information seeking occurred only sporadically and information verifying was almost absent. Another study showed that handover content changed as a function of uni- versus multiprofessionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812451594">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, in handovers involving nurses and physicians, patient goals emerged as a means for integrating the different professional perspectives.</p>

<sec id="section10-0018720812451594">
<title>Objective and Research Questions</title>
<p>Despite initial promising studies, knowledge of the role of team communication in handover quality is very limited. Empirical results linking detailed analyses of handover communication processes with measures of handover quality, and ultimately, with patient outcomes, are urgently needed for the future development of effective interventions.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim at advancing handover research by linking detailed descriptions of team communication processes with handover quality ratings. This link will allow for identifying performance critical communication behaviors and will improve our understanding of the team processes supporting effective patient handover. To achieve this goal, we (a) developed and applied a method for the structured observation of handover activities, particularly, communication, and (b) related these observations to clinicians’ self-ratings of handover quality.</p>
<p>Although the limited knowledge on handover communication processes did not allow for the formulation of specific hypotheses, we expected differences in the distribution of communication behaviors for transferring and receiving clinicians, for transferring consultants versus trainees, and between different postoperative handover settings.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section12-0018720812451594">
<title>Research Setting</title>
<p>Our study focused on postoperative patient handover, specifically from operating room (OR) to either recovery room (RR) or intensive care unit (ICU). Patients undergoing surgery are especially vulnerable to handover errors because of the number of transitions occurring throughout their care. Although communication during the pre- and intraoperative phases has received considerable attention in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812451594">Lingard, Reznick, Espin, Regehr, &amp; DeVito, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812451594">Manser, 2009</xref>), almost no in-depth information is available on the communication processes during postoperative handover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451594">Catchpole, De Leval et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812451594">Nagpal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Postoperative handovers are critical episodes because they take place in an environment that is event driven, time pressured, and prone to concurrent distractions while the patient is in an “at-risk” state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith et al., 2008</xref>) and because they involve clinicians across professional groups, each with his or her own skill set and priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812451594">Nagpal et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812451594">
<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section14-0018720812451594">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were clinicians involved in postoperative handovers from one large Scottish teaching hospital. We obtained approval from the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (Protocol-No. 10/S0801/14) and the School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen (PEC-No.1112091345). All potential clinical participants were informed about the study goals. Written informed consent was obtained from clinicians at the start of their shift and from the patients involved in this study at preoperative assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720812451594">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>All data were collected between July and August 2010 and included a broad spectrum of surgical specialties. We intended to observe 50 handovers from OR to RR (OR-RR), 50 from RR nurse to ward nurse (RR-W), and 25 from OR to cardiac ICU (OR-CICU). To minimize the influence of individual handover styles reported in the handover literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812451594">Raduma-Tomas, Flin, Yule, &amp; Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812451594">Riesenberg, Leitzsch, Massucci, et al., 2009</xref>), we observed a maximum of 5 handovers per transferring OR clinician. Because we did not have ethics committee approval for collecting experience levels of nurses, no such restriction was applied for receiving clinicians.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section17-0018720812451594">
<title>Observation of handover communication</title>
<p>Prior to formal data collection, the observer, a researcher with extensive experience in observing clinicians (TM), spent several weeks in all three clinical settings. This time allowed her to become familiar with the patient care processes and the clinicians to become accustomed to the presence of the observer.</p>
<p>Observations focused on the handover performed verbally at the bedside immediately after patient arrival into the RR or CICU or at arrival of the ward nurse to the RR and ended when the handover was complete. The observer recorded all handover activities and who performed these activities (i.e., work role) using a PDA-based data recorder that logged start and end times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812451594">Held &amp; Manser, 2005</xref>). This method, which allows for recording of concurrent activities, had been successfully applied in previous studies involving observation of health care teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812451594">Manser, Howard, &amp; Gaba, 2008</xref>; for details, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018720812451594">Appendix A</xref>). A subset of 10 audio-recorded handovers was transcribed to assess rater reliability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0018720812451594">
<title>Taxonomy of handover activities</title>
<p>We coded observations using a structured taxonomy of handover activities that we developed on the basis of a review of existing systems for assessing handover practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451594">Apker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451594">Catchpole, De Leval, et al., 2007</xref>), descriptions of clinicians’ handover behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812451594">Lawrence, Tomolo, Garlisi, &amp; Aron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018720812451594">Wears, Perry, Shapiro, Beach, &amp; Behara, 2003</xref>), interviews, and field notes. A prototype was piloted for a period of 2 weeks and was refined with a focus on completeness and usability.</p>
<p>The final observation system comprised 31 descriptive codes allowing for continuous coding of handover behavior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812451594">Table 1</xref>). The majority of codes describe handover communication with the main categories: information giving, information seeking, information verification, acknowledgment, assessment, planning and decision making, and handover management. Additionally, we coded use of patient documentation, social communication, clinical tasks, and interruptions (i.e., when it occurred, the source, and duration).</p>

<title>Handover quality assessment</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to link handover behaviors to handover quality. Thus we used a recently developed structured handover assessment tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812451594">Manser, Foster, Gisin, Jaeckel, &amp; Ummenhofer, 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0018720812451594">Appendix B</xref>) consisting of 21 items rated on a 4-point scale (<italic>yes</italic> = 4, <italic>rather yes</italic> = 3, <italic>rather no</italic> = 2, <italic>no</italic> = 1). Of these items, 16 describe patient handover in terms of information transfer and teamwork, and a single item assesses overall handover quality. Additionally, 4 items (i.e., time pressure of transferring and receiving team, case complexity and uncertainty) were collected as control variables. Immediately after handover completion, all clinicians involved rated handover quality using this tool. Because team composition was quite variable, only the ratings of the main transferrer and receiver were used in the data analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0018720812451594">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Observational data were prepared for statistical analysis in PASW Statistics (Version 17; SPSS) with the use of customized software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812451594">Held &amp; Manser, 2005</xref>). The proportion of time spent on each observation category was calculated in relation to handover duration overall, for transferring and receiving clinicians, and for the three handover settings. Note that the overall time on handover activity exceeded handover duration because we observed a team activity wherein multiple activities occurred simultaneously. All aggregate data are shown as mean with standard deviations in parentheses. Comparisons of communication behaviors between handover settings and handover roles were calculated with MANOVA to test for an overall difference in several communication behaviors and with ANOVA for single communication behaviors. In addition, we used the <italic>F</italic> test of the equality of two variances to compare the variances of different groups.</p>
<p>We investigated the relationships between the relative amount of handover time spent on specific handover behaviors and quality ratings using Pearson correlations.</p>
<p>Differences between consultants and trainees in the distribution of communication behaviors during OR-RR and OR-CICU handovers were analyzed qualitatively because of limited sample size and statistical power.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0018720812451594" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 117 patient handovers were observed at three postoperative care transitions: OR-RR (<italic>n</italic> = 50, 3.9 min ± 1.4), RR-W (<italic>n</italic> = 42, 3.0 min ± 1.9), and OR-CICU (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 6.0 min ± 2.9). A total of 21 recovery room nurses, 31 anesthetists, 36 OR nurses, 31 ward nurses, and 12 CICU nurses participated in this study. For the anesthetists, most OR-RR handovers were consultant led (<italic>n</italic> = 38), and 12 were performed by a trainee. All but 4 OR-CICU handovers were performed by consultants. Of the 31 transferring anesthetists, 23 were observed more than once. Of those who were studied repeatedly, the number of observations was 2.7 ± 1.3 (median = 3). Only three transferring clinicians were observed five times.</p>
<p>None of the observed handovers was conducted with an identical team of transferring and receiving clinicians. Thus, the dependency in our data and the potential for bias from individual handover styles are very limited.</p>
<sec id="section22-0018720812451594">
<title>Character of the observed handovers</title>
<p>Across the clinical settings, participating clinicians judged most handovers as routine with low levels of case complexity (1.7 ± 1.0), uncertainty (1.4 ± 0.7), and time pressure for the transferring (1.3 ± 0.7) and receiving clinicians (1.3 ± 0.6).</p>

<title>Coding reliability for handover communication</title>
<p>Comparison of codings from 10 handover transcripts by the main observer and a second coder (a psychologist experienced in coding verbal data obtained in acute care settings) yielded a Cohen’s Kappa of .84, and comparison of the main observer’s transcript and live codings yielded a Cohen’s Kappa of .76, suggesting good rater reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812451594">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>). Although the content categories of the newly developed coding system were the focus of our reliability analysis, the comparison of live versus transcript coding showed excellent agreement (.96) for unitizing (i.e., identification of relevant coding units).</p>

<title>Distribution of Handover Communication Behaviors</title>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812451594">Figure 3</xref> gives an overview of communication behaviors during OR-RR and OR-CICU handovers by consultants versus trainees. Because of limited sample size, we performed a qualitative comparison of handover communication patterns. Although there appeared to be no difference between trainee and consultant handovers for information giving (i.e., the transfer of the medical facts about patient and procedure), the qualitative analysis suggests that more time was spent on assessment and planning and decision making during consultant handovers. Also, information seeking tended to be more prominent during trainee handovers. These differences were more pronounced during OR-CICU handovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812451594">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>When we broke this analysis down into the four dimensions of handover quality, assessment was significantly related to three dimensions for receiver ratings and to two dimensions for transferrer ratings. Quality ratings of handover organization were positively related to assessment and acknowledgement for both clinician groups. These two communication behaviors were also positively correlated with ratings of shared understanding for transferring clinicians and negatively correlated with ratings of conduct for receiving clinicians.</p>
<p>The negative correlations of receiving clinicians’ quality ratings of patient care information with information seeking and of ratings of handover organization with information seeking and handover management suggest that these behaviors may be compensatory. Interestingly, receiving clinicians’ quality ratings of patient care information were negatively related to information giving.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we were able to establish a first empirical link between team communication during postoperative handovers and clinicians’ self-ratings of handover quality. More specifically, we found that assessment was associated with higher ratings of overall handover quality by the receiving clinicians and correlated with all four dimensions of handover quality identified in this study. Interestingly, no clear picture emerged regarding communication behaviors and transferring clinicians’ ratings of handover quality. This variation in what transferring clinicians think makes a good handover corresponds to the large variability in handover communication found in this study and is in line with research indicating idiosyncratic handover practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812451594">Raduma-Tomas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812451594">Riesenberg, Leitzsch, Massucci, et al., 2009</xref>). That assessment was not correlated to transferring clinicians’ quality ratings may also be interpreted as a lack of understanding what the receiving team needs and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451594">Carroll, Williams, &amp; Gallivan, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720812451594">Smith et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, the observation system we have developed is sensitive enough to distinguish handover roles (i.e., transferring and receiving) and different handover settings. This system is a methodological contribution because detailed descriptions of handover communication can improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying effective team performance and, thus, is a foundation for designing handover interventions and evaluating their effectiveness.</p>
<sec id="section30-0018720812451594">
<title>More Than Facts and Figures</title>
<p>The finding that assessment was positively related to handover quality is consistent with previous research on coordination in anesthesia crews that identified provision of situation assessments as a performance-critical aspect during a simulated medical crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812451594">Manser, Harrison, Gaba, &amp; Howard, 2009</xref>). Research in nonclinical settings has also highlighted the importance of verbalizing situation assessments to maintain good coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812451594">Salas, Prince, &amp; Baker, 1995</xref>) and the performance-enhancing effects of discussing threats and errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018720812451594">Sexton, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Providing information on the patient history, comorbidities, procedures already performed, and so on helps the receiving team to get clear about facts and figures. This aspect of handover communication is the focus of many studies and interventions aimed at assuring completeness and accuracy of information transfer. However, providing assessments is about more than that. It is also about feelings and hunches, options, predictions, anticipations, and uncertainties and thus is in essence the fullest range of what is known about the patient. This tacit knowledge about a patient is rarely documented, and unless verbalized during handover, this information will not be available to the clinicians continuing to care for that patient.</p>
<p>We found the receiving team to show more information-seeking behaviors, such as requesting explanations for certain parameters and asking for predictions or anticipated problems, if assessments were not provided by the transferring team. This finding further highlights the importance of assessments and the active role of the receiving team in assuring handover quality. It is in contrast to the implicit assumption in the literature that information transfer during handover is a one-way street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451594">Manser &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>). Handover studies in nonclinical settings have previously stressed the importance of interactive handover strategies, such as a “question-and-answer period,” to detect errors in assessments and plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812451594">Patterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720812451594">Patterson &amp; Woods, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The relevance of assessment is further supported by our exploratory analyses indicating that consultant anesthetists spent more time on assessments than do trainees, particularly during OR-CICU handover. For cardiac cases, trainees stated that they felt less confident in predicting the course of the patient’s recovery and about the expectations of the receiving clinicians. These qualitative findings point at a need to systematically investigate expertnovice differences in handover communication to identify training needs with a focus on verbalizing assessments.</p>

<title>Implications for Handover Improvement Efforts</title>
<p>The findings presented here have practical implications for effectively supporting and training health care teams. First, they support the connection between specific communication behaviors and handover quality. Assessments seem to play a central role in assuring handover quality, and it does not suffice to standardize the handover content to assure completeness of information transmission. Instead, structuring aids should support the team communication process during handover by providing room for assessments. This recommendation is in line with the frequently applied communication format SBAR (situation, background, assessment, recommendation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812451594">Haig, Sutton, &amp; Whittington, 2006</xref>) that clearly acknowledges the importance of assessments, as do some other handover structures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451594">Catchpole, De Leval, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another aspect highlighted by SBAR is recommendation, which corresponds to planning and decision making in our study. We did not find a significant relationship of planning and decision making with handover quality. However, our qualitative comparison of consultant versus trainee handovers showed that during consultant handovers in CICU, more time was spent on assessment and on planning and decision making. Empirical examinations of the communication formats recommended in the literature and of their effects on patient care are rare and not conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812451594">Foster &amp; Manser, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720812451594">Riesenberg, Leitzsch, &amp; Little, 2009</xref>). Observational studies, such as the one presented in this article, could support the evaluation of such interventions.</p>
<p>Second, our results highlight the active role of the receiving clinician in assuring handover quality and thus emphasize a view of patient handover as a team activity. This finding has implications for the design of handover formats that encourage interactive questioning and discussion. Also, training interventions can help the receiving clinicians to develop strategies to speak up and assure that they get the information they need, especially during physician-to-nurse handovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018720812451594">Weinger et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, differences in the handover communication behaviors associated with higher handover quality ratings of transferring versus receiving clinicians’ (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812451594">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812451594">3</xref>) point at a need to establish a shared understanding of the receivers’ needs. Cross-training has been shown to improve team performance through increasing interpositional knowledge (i.e., promoting understanding of other team members’ roles and responsibilities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812451594">Cooke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812451594">Marks, Sabella, Burke, &amp; Zaccaro, 2002</xref>). For patient handover, a training intervention focusing on an understanding of the respective work roles and their interdependencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812451594">Blickensderfer, Stout, Cannon-Bowers, &amp; Salas, 1993</xref>), highlighting a teamwork orientation, and targeting specific communication behaviors aligned with the handover role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018720812451594">Volpe, Cannon-Bowers, Salas, &amp; Spector, 1996</xref>) seems most appropriate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018720812451594">Weinger et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent study demonstrated differences in the expectations of transferring and receiving clinicians even during shift handovers within the same professional group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451594">Carroll et al., in press</xref>), indicating the need to understand more about the working conditions and the specific pressures associated with different roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0018720812451594">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has limitations, some of which were a consequence of observing professionals in their actual work environment, which is also a strength of this study. Particularly, the fact that this study was a prospective observational field study limited the sample size and thus reduced the statistical power. Also, the study design did not allow for control of factors potentially influencing handover practices (e.g., information passed on before the actual handover), and we did not consider the actual content of the handover communication. Another critical aspect is the potential dependency of our data, given that individual participants were studied multiple times. Without ethics committee approval to collect identifying information on individual receivers, assessment of the effects of their demographic attributes on handover quality was precluded. Countermeasures were taken when collecting and analyzing our data. Although 23 transferring anesthetists were observed multiple times (mean = 2.7 ± 1.3; median = 3; only three transferring clinicians were observed five times), the composition of the entire handover team was unique for all observations. Furthermore, an additional analysis of only the first handover from each transferring clinician showed similar (albeit nonsignificant) patterns of results.</p>
<p>The statistical analyses performed in this initial study do not allow for causal interpretation of the relationships identified. Our aim was to uncover potential relationships rather than to test a specific hypothesis on individual relationships. Therefore, we have analyzed our data without multiplicity adjustment on the basis of recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812451594">Bender and Lange (2001)</xref> for exploratory studies. Our exploratory results may inform future hypothesis-based empiric research. Also, future studies with much larger sample sizes will allow researchers to use hierarchical linear modeling to explore influences at the level of hospitals, units, or teams.</p>
<p>Because there are no validated standardized measures for handover quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812451594">Patterson &amp; Wears, 2010</xref>), we assessed handover quality using structured clinician self-ratings by the transferring and receiving clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812451594">Manser et al., 2010</xref>). Handover quality ratings were all rather high, making statistical analysis difficult. The fact that these were self-ratings and that clinicians had not received any training in how to use the rating scale may have affected results. However, we believe that this restricted range issue is not an effect of the rating scale itself, but rather, it reflects the fact that clinicians’ subjective perception of the handover is very positive (e.g., they may be used to a practice that an outside observer judges as suboptimal). Having an independent external rater would have been valuable, as self-assessments are often inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812451594">Davis et al., 2006</xref>), but a second observer was not possible for practical reasons. We used a trained observer with years of experience, but it was impossible for her to both attend to the coding task and reliably rate the handover quality.</p>
<p>Because we did not have ethics committee approval for videotaping of handovers, intercoder reliability for handover communication could be assessed only on the basis of handover transcripts, which is different from live coding. Reliability analysis of live versus transcript coding showed slightly lower but good intrarater agreement. Together with the excellent unitizing reliability (i.e., identification of relevant coding units), these results indicate that the observation system can reliably be used to code the handover communication process.</p>
<p>Finally, our results derive from a single hospital. However, we included three types of patient handover (i.e., handover to RR, to CICU, and to the ward), providing some evidence that the observation categories are applicable in different postoperative settings and that our results may generalize to postoperative handovers in other hospitals. A systematic investigation of the external validity would require a much broader application in a variety of handover settings across multiple hospitals. These studies should also include possible confounds (e.g., patient complexity, surgical specialty, and duration) not included in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812451594">Burtscher, Kolbe, Wacker, &amp; Manser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812451594">Cooke, Gorman, Duran, &amp; Taylor, 2007</xref>), our study illustrates that the underlying mechanisms of team performance in a complex cognitive task can be better understood if one considers associated team processes, such as communication and coordination. Without this knowledge, standardization efforts may be premature. Detailed descriptions of communication processes related to high-quality handovers will further the understanding of this safety-critical task and support the design and evaluation of handover improvement efforts.</p>

<title>Procedure for Recording Observational Data</title>
<p>Observing a complex activity, such as patient handover, in the clinical work environment without the benefits of video recording requires a highly trained observer and adequate technological support for the data recording. The PDA-based data recorder used in this study (FIT-System) has successfully been applied in previous studies involving observation of clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812451594">Manser, Harrison, Gaba, &amp; Howard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812451594">Manser, Howard, &amp; Gaba, 2008</xref>) and is described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812451594">Held and Manser (2005)</xref>. In the following, we provide information on (a) recording of start and end times of handover activities, (b) recording of concurrent handover activities, and (c) calculation of the relative amount of time spent on the various handover activities.</p>
<list id="list2-0018720812451594" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Recording of start and end times of handover activities.</italic> The observer recorded all handover activities and who performed these activities (i.e., work role) by activating buttons on the interface of the FIT-System that automatically logs start and end times for each event. This system allows for continuous coding of behavioral processes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Recording of concurrent handover activities.</italic> For recording concurrent events (i.e., handover activities of different clinicians or multiple handover activities performed by a single clinician simultaneously), an additional function of the FIT-System allows for entering these events sequentially and then activating a delimiter for processing these events in “packages” of concurrent events.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Calculation of the relative amount of time spent on the various handover activities.</italic> Because patient handover is a team activity and multiple handover activities may occur simultaneously, the overall time on handover activity can exceed handover duration. Overall handover activity was defined as the combined duration of all handover activities in relation to the handover duration. The relative amount of each observation category was defined as the time spent on a certain category in relation to overall handover activity. For example, if a nurse spent 50 s of a 1-min 40-s handover on information giving, his or her information giving score would be 50%.</p></list-item>

<title>Dimensionality of Handover Quality Ratings</title>
<p>We analyzed ratings of handover quality using factor analysis to establish the dimensionality of the rating tool.

Factor 2 (handover organization) focuses on aspects that may support effective communication between clinicians (i.e., allowing for enough time, following a logical structure, having complete patient documentation, and establishing good contact at the beginning of the handover). Factor 3 (establishing a shared understanding) deals with the means for establishing a shared understanding between transferring and receiving clinicians through active clarification of questions and ambiguities and assuring completeness of the handover.
