<abstract>
<p>This article summarizes characteristics of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project, using data from 816 participants (56% female; 89% White). Contrasting four developmental periods (childhood, 5.0–12.9 years of age; adolescence, 13.0–17.9; emerging adulthood, 18.0–23.9; adulthood, 24–30), we examine MDD incidence/recurrence, gender, comorbidity, duration, and suicide attempts across periods. MDD first incidence was lower in childhood compared to subsequent periods and higher in emerging adulthood than in adulthood. Cumulative incidence was 51%. Recurrence was lower during childhood than remaining periods, which did not differ. Female gender predicted first-incident MDD in all four periods but was unassociated with recurrence. Comorbidity rates were comparable across periods. MDD duration was greater in childhood than in remaining periods. Suicide attempt rates were significantly higher during adolescence than during either emerging adulthood or adulthood. Depression research should focus on MDD during emerging adulthood, adolescent suicidal behavior, the continuing role of gender into adulthood, and the ubiquity of MDD.</p>

<body>
<p>It is now well established that major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in older adolescents at levels comparable with levels in adults, with point prevalence rates of approximately 2% in childhood and between 5% and 8% in adolescence and adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167702612457599">Birmaher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2167702612457599">Costello, Erkanli, &amp; Angold, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167702612457599">Kessler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Clarke, Seeley, &amp; Rohde, 1994</xref>). Estimates of lifetime MDD prevalence in adolescents and young adults vary widely (a contentious issue that we discuss in detail later), ranging from less than 9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2167702612457599">Tanner et al., 2007</xref>) to more than 30% (MDD and/or the much less common dysthymia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167702612457599">Hankin et al., 1998</xref>). Nationally representative surveys of adults suggest that the majority of individuals who will experience MDD do so by early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167702612457599">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>). In clinical populations, earlier onset of MDD is associated with greater functional impairments, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2167702612457599">Zisook et al., 2007</xref>). Within 5 years of MDD onset, approximately 70% of child and adolescent patients will experience a recurrent episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167702612457599">Kovacs, Feinberg, Crouse-Novak, Paulauskas, Pollock, &amp; Finkelstein, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167702612457599">Rao et al., 1995</xref>). The majority of depressed adolescents appear to have lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, with rates of comorbid anxiety disorders being among the highest (30%–80%); longitudinal studies estimate that 20% to 30% of depression adolescents will develop a substance use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167702612457599">Birmaher et al., 1996</xref>). MDD is one of the most potent risk factors for suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, &amp; Seeley, 1994</xref>), and approximately 5% to 10% of depressed adolescents commit suicide within 15 years of their first MDD episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2167702612457599">Weissman et al., 1999</xref>). Although large longitudinal studies with children and adolescents have been conducted—several of which have followed research participants into adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167702612457599">Copeland, Shanahan, Costello, &amp; Angold, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2167702612457599">Fergusson, Boden, &amp; Horwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167702612457599">Moffitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2167702612457599">Tanner et al., 2007</xref>)—questions remain regarding the degree to which MDD episodes vary across these developmental stages. The goal of this article is to summarize the key characteristics of MDD episodes beginning in childhood through 30 years of age, using data from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Hops, Roberts, Seeley, &amp; Andrews, 1993</xref>). Given the time frame of data collection in the OADP, we examine and contrast the key parameters of MDD across four developmental periods: childhood, 5.0–12.9 years of age; adolescence, 13.0–17.9; emerging adulthood, 18.0–23.9; and adulthood, 24–30. To our knowledge, this type of analysis has never been reported across this broad an age span with the same sample of individuals.</p>
<p>Regarding our third developmental category, the term <italic>emerging adult</italic> was coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2167702612457599">Arnett (2000)</xref> and was proposed to represent a developmental period that is theoretically and empirically distinct from both adolescence and adulthood. This period is conceptualized as one of numerous choices and possibilities, in which the young person has much greater independence than in adolescence but has not yet assumed more long-standing responsibilities and commitments related to relationships, work, and even worldviews associated with adulthood. The period is proposed to have five unique features: identity exploration, trying out possibilities in love and work, instability, self-focus, and feeling in between adolescence and adulthood. As Arnett clearly notes, this developmental conceptualization of the life span is culturally constructed and probably applies most directly to young people in North America.</p>
<p>Data for this report come from the OADP, which began in the mid-1980s as a large, randomly selected cohort of high school students who were assessed at two points over a period of 1 year (T1 and T2). Based on questionnaires and structured diagnostic interviews, the project assessed the lifetime occurrence of psychiatric disorders at T1 and the occurrence of psychopathology since the first interview at T2. A large subset of participants completed a third diagnostic interview (T3) after their 24th birthday, and a fourth diagnostic interview (T4) occurred after participants turned 30 years of age.</p>
<p>A great deal of our previous research has focused on MDD, most extensively during adolescence, including data on prevalence, incidence, and recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Hops, et al., 1993</xref>); onset age, duration, and time to recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Clarke, et al., 1994</xref>); psychosocial risk factors for MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Roberts, et al., 1994</xref>); and psychiatric comorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, &amp; Hops, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2167702612457599">Rohde, Lewinsohn, &amp; Seeley, 1991</xref>). We have reported on the natural course of MDD from adolescence to age 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, Klein, &amp; Seeley, 1999</xref>) and the psychosocial predictors of MDD recurrence to age 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, Klein, &amp; Gotlib, 2000</xref>). Gender differences in the development and presentation of MDD among OADP participants were examined extensively in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2167702612457599">Essau, Lewinsohn, Seeley, and Sasagawa (2010)</xref>. In that report, we found that over the entire T1–T4 period, female participants had higher incidence rates of MDD and a greater total number of lifetime episodes than male participants. Gender differences in the duration of depressive episodes were marginally significant, with females having somewhat longer but not significantly earlier episodes. Given its clinical significance and strong association with MDD, a major interest area of ours has been suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, &amp; Seeley, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167702612457599">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2167702612457599">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, &amp; Baldwin, 2001</xref>). The OADP has been the source of a large number of publications, but the present study is the first OADP article to examine and contrast core aspects of MDD episodes across these four key developmental periods. It is also the first OADP report to examine in detail MDD in childhood. Although this report does not aim to provide a comprehensive review of the large body of research on early-onset MDD, we believe that the OADP has implications for understanding how the phenomenology, assessment, etiology, treatment, and prevention of depression might vary or remain constant across these developmental periods. Research suggests that MDD has generally similar clinical manifestations in children and adolescents, including duration, severity, recurrence, and comorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2167702612457599">Birmaher et al., 2004</xref>) and that the clinical presentation, course, and familial aggregation of MDD in children, adolescents, and adults may have numerous similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2167702612457599">Kovacs, 1996</xref>). However, research also has suggested noteworthy differences among depressed children, adolescents, and adults in neurobiological correlates (e.g., basal cortisol, corticotropin-releasing hormone, serotonin probes), the individual’s response to tricyclic antidepressant medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2167702612457599">Kaufman, Martin, King, &amp; Charney, 2001</xref>), and risk factor profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2167702612457599">Jaffee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167702612457599">Shanahan, Copeland, Costello, &amp; Angold, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The specific goals of this report are to compare and contrast the presentation of MDD in childhood, adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood, as expressed by (a) rates of occurrence (first incidence, recurrence, total incidence), (b) the impact of gender on occurrence, (c) rates of comorbidity with anxiety disorders and substance use disorders (unadjusted and controlling for disruptive behavior disorders, which may reduce or eliminate associations with depression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167702612457599">Compton, Thomas, Stinson, &amp; Grant, 2007</xref>), (d) duration of episodes, (e) degree to which MDD in a prior developmental period predicts subsequent MDD, and (f) rates of suicide attempts. We also provide lifetime rates of these phenomena through age 30. We conclude by extrapolating from the current findings and by posing critical questions and research directions to advance the understanding of depression in young people.</p>

<title>Brief description of the OADP</title>
<p>Participants were randomly selected in three cohorts from nine senior high schools representative of urban and rural districts in western Oregon. Data collection was completed at four time points. We summarize data collection across the entire study; additional details regarding the OADP are reported elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Pettit, Joiner, &amp; Seeley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, Klein, &amp; Gotlib, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2167702612457599">Pettit, Lewinsohn, &amp; Joiner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2167702612457599">Rohde et al., 2007</xref>). A total of 1,709 adolescents completed the T1 interview and questionnaires between 1987 and 1989; the overall participation rate was 61%. About half of the T1 sample (53%) was female, with an average age of 16.6 years (range, 14–19; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.2). A total of 9% were non-White or Hispanic, and 53% were living with two biological parents. Approximately 1 year later (<italic>M</italic> = 13.8 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.3), all T1 participants were invited to complete a second assessment (T2). A total of 1,507 participants (88%) returned for a readministration of the questionnaire and interview assessments.</p>
<p>Between 1994 and 1999, as participants reached their 24th birthday, a third wave of questionnaires and interviews (T3) was obtained from 941 participants with a history of psychopathology at T2 (<italic>n</italic> = 555; 315 with depression, 240 with other psychopathology) and a randomly selected subset of participants with no history of mental disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 386; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Rohde, et al., 2003</xref>). Eighty-five percent of participants invited for the T3 assessment participated. Finally, as participants reached their 30th birthday, a fourth wave of questionnaires and interviews (T4) was conducted with all who completed T3; 816 participants (87% of the 941 at T3) completed the T4 assessments, and this group comprises the sample for the present report.</p>
<p>Of these 816 individuals, 480 (59%) were women. Most participants were White (89%); others were African American (1%), Hispanic (3%), American Indian (3%), Asian (3%), and “other” (2%). Slightly more than half (53%) were married, and 41% had a bachelor’s degree or higher. Participants’ mean T4 age was 30.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.6). Written informed consent was obtained from participants (and guardians, if applicable).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2167702612457599">
<title>Diagnostic interviews</title>
<p>At T1 and T2, participants were interviewed with a version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167702612457599">Orvaschel, Puig-Antich, Chambers, Tabrizi, &amp; Johnson, 1982</xref>), which combined features of the Epidemiologic and Present Episode versions and included additional items to derive diagnoses from the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, third edition revised (<italic>DSM–III–R</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167702612457599">American Psychiatric Association, 1987</xref>). The T1 interview probed for the occurrence of lifetime psychopathology, which was defined as occurring no earlier than 5 years of age; subsequent interviews probed for psychopathology occurring since the previous interview. Follow-up assessments at T2 and T3 were jointly administered with the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation (LIFE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2167702612457599">Keller et al., 1987</xref>). The K-SADS/LIFE procedure provided information regarding the onset (recorded in months of age) and duration (recorded in weeks) of all major psychiatric disorders since the previous interview: MDD, dysthymia, bipolar, anxiety (panic, agoraphobia, social phobia, simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive, separation anxiety, overanxious), disruptive behavior (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct, oppositional defiant), substance use (abuse and dependence, all major psychoactive substances), eating, and adjustment. MDD recovery was defined using LIFE criteria of 8 or more consecutive weeks of no or minor symptoms, and recurrence was defined as meeting full MDD criteria following recovery; both of these terms follow consensus definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167702612457599">Frank et al., 1991</xref>). The T4 interview consisted of a joint administration of the LIFE and the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM–IV</italic> (SCID; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2167702612457599">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>) to probe for new or continuing episodes since T3. Diagnoses for T1–T2 were based on <italic>DSM–III–R</italic> criteria and, for T3–T4, criteria of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition (<italic>DSM–IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167702612457599">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). Interviews at T3 and T4 were conducted by telephone, which, as we previously found, yielded results comparable to those based on face-to-face interviews for major depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders, although with poor agreement for adjustment disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167702612457599">Rohde, Lewinsohn, &amp; Seeley, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Diagnostic interviewers were carefully selected, trained, and supervised. Interviewers had degrees in a mental health discipline and completed a 70-hour course in diagnostic interviewing. Interviewers were required to demonstrate a minimum kappa of 0.80 across all symptoms for at least two consecutive training interviews and on one videotaped interview of a participant with evidence of psychopathology before conducting interviews. Interviewer performance was carefully monitored to maintain reliability. We previously reported that interrater reliabilities (<italic>n</italic> = 263 at T1, <italic>n</italic> = 162 at T2, <italic>n</italic> = 190 at T3, and <italic>n</italic> = 124 at T4) indicated good to excellent agreement for both MDD (<italic>k</italic> = .81–.86) and nonmood disorders (<italic>k</italic> = .76–.89; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167702612457599">Rohde, Lewinsohn, Klein, &amp; Seeley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167702612457599">Seeley, Kosty, Farmer, &amp; Lewinsohn, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Suicidal behavior was assessed via the depression section of the K-SADS and SCID. We did not, however, record in the K-SADS/SCID the specific ages at the time of suicide attempts. Therefore, we report suicide attempts as a function of their occurrence during a specific study assessment: adolescent attempts occurring prior to T2 (mean T2 age = 17.8 years), emerging adult attempts occurring between T2 and T3 (mean T3 = 24.6 years), and adult attempts occurring between T3 and T4 (mean T4 age = 30.6 years). To determine whether suicide attempts reported at T1 had occurred in childhood versus adolescence, we reviewed the clinical writeups that accompanied the K-SADS interviews for the subset of participants who had both childhood MDD and a lifetime suicide attempt at T1 to ascertain whether the attempt had occurred prior to age 13 (present for 5 participants). During the period prior to T2, 230 suicide attempts were reported by 86 participants; at T3, 63 were reported by 35 participants; and at T4, 59 were reported by 23 individuals.</p>

<title>Statistical procedures</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to describe rates of MDD (first incidence, recurrence, and total incidence), duration of MDD episodes, and rates of suicide attempts during the four developmental periods. Binary logistic regression models with odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs were used to test gender as a predictor of rates of MDD and to test for differences in period comorbidity of MDD with anxiety and substance use disorders during the four developmental periods. Given the high comorbidity between substance use disorders and disruptive behavior disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2167702612457599">Armstrong &amp; Costello, 2002</xref>) and the possibility that controlling for disruptive behavior disorders eliminates an association between MDD and substance abuse/dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167702612457599">Compton et al., 2007</xref>), we examined comorbidity with substance use disorders both unadjusted and controlling for the lifetime presence of disruptive behavior disorders (diagnosed in 6% of the sample). As participants with no history of psychopathology were undersampled in the T3 follow-up, participants were weighted as a function of the probability of selection at T3 in all analyses comparing outcomes across the four developmental periods. Design weights were used and analyses with robust variance estimator run using software that accommodated samples not randomly selected (i.e., STATA). Effect size conventions for ORs greater than 1.0 are as follows: 1.48 = small, 2.48 = medium, and 4.28 = large. For ORs less than 1.0: 0.68 = small, 0.40 = medium, and 0.23 = large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167702612457599">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2167702612457599">Table 1</xref> illustrates three categories of MDD incidence, which were examined in each developmental period. <italic>First incidence</italic> indicates the proportion of the first episode of MDD per developmental period. The denominator for the child period (5.0–12.9 years of age) was all 816 participants; for the adolescent period (13.0–17.9 years), 763 participants (816 minus the 53 first-incidence cases of childhood); for the emerging adult period (18.0–23.9 years), 562 participants (816 minus the 254 previous first-incidence cases); and for the adult period (24–30 years), 410 participants (816 minus the first-incidence cases in the three earlier periods). <italic>Recurrence</italic> represents the proportion of participants with a history of MDD in a previous developmental period that developed a new episode of MDD in a subsequent period (or the proportion that experienced two MDD episodes during the child period). The denominator for the child and adolescent periods was the number of first-incidence cases at the 5.0- to 12.9-year period (the denominator for the remaining two periods was the total number of first-incidence cases in the previous developmental periods). <italic>Total incidence</italic> represents the number of cases in a developmental period with either a first incidence or a recurrence.</p>

<p>As can be seen by comparing CIs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2167702612457599">Table 1</xref>, significant differences emerged for the three incidence measures across the four developmental periods. Rates of MDD first incidence were significantly lower in childhood compared to all subsequent periods. Rates in adolescence were comparable to those in emerging adulthood and adulthood, with higher first incidence in emerging adulthood compared to adulthood. Parenthetically, the first-incidence MDD cases in childhood did not occur solely near the end of that developmental period: 38% of episodes occurred between 5 and 9 years of age, 13% at age 10, 23% at age 11, and 26% at age 12. Regarding MDD recurrence, rates were significantly lower during the child period compared to all subsequent periods, which did not differ. Finally, the total incidence rate of MDD was significantly lower in the child period than in the adolescent period, which was in turn significantly lower than that of the emerging adult and adult periods.</p>
<p>The total cumulative weighted incidence of MDD through age 30 for the study sample was 51% (<italic>n</italic> = 477), 95% CI [47.1, 54.5]. Among participants who had ever experienced MDD, the total cumulative MDD recurrence rate was 53%, 95% CI [47.9, 57.4]. Among the entire (unweighted) T4 panel, 42% did not experience MDD; 32% had MDD during a single developmental period; 17% had MDD episodes in two developmental periods; and 9% experienced MDD in each developmental period.</p>

<title>Effects of gender on MDD across developmental periods</title>
<p>We next examined whether the three incidence rates of MDD (i.e., first incidence, recurrence, and total) in the four developmental periods were associated with gender (56% of the sample was female). Univariate logistic regression models were used to test whether gender (1 = female, 0 = male) predicted the rates of MDD in the child, adolescent, emerging adult, and adult periods. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2167702612457599">Table 2</xref> shows the associated OR and 95% CIs for first incidence, recurrence, and total incidence. As can be seen, female gender was consistently associated with first-incidence MDD in all four developmental periods. This effect was medium in magnitude and comparable across developmental periods. The pattern of gender for total incidence paralleled results for first MDD incidence. Regarding recurrence, although the odds of MDD recurrence in adolescence was higher for women (OR = 6.08 vs. less than 1.3 for remaining periods), female gender failed to predict recurrence in any developmental period, and the direction of the association was reversed in the child period relative to other periods.</p>

<title>Comorbidity with MDD across developmental periods</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2167702612457599">Table 3</xref> illustrates the period prevalence of comorbidity of anxiety and substance use disorders with MDD episodes occurring in the child, adolescent, emerging adult, and adult developmental periods. Unadjusted associations of MDD with substance use disorders were examined first, followed by associations controlling for the lifetime presence of a disruptive behavior disorder. As can be seen, significant comorbidity with both anxiety and substance use disorders occurred in each of the four periods. Interestingly, the magnitude of comorbid associations across all four periods was quite comparable; odds of anxiety disorders during a developmental period were approximately 4 times greater given MDD and did not significantly differ across periods. The odds of a comorbid substance use disorder were significantly greater given MDD during childhood relative to the adolescence and emerging adulthood periods in the unadjusted associations, presumably due to the very low prevalence of substance abuse/dependence among children who did not have MDD. Controlling for disruptive behaviors disorders, the magnitude of comorbidity between MDD and substance use disorders remained highly significant but no longer differed across the four developmental periods. Based on total lifetime comorbidity rates given any occurrence of MDD through age 30, MDD exhibited significant comorbidity with lifetime anxiety disorders (32% given MDD vs. 9% given no MDD), OR = 4.65, 95% CI [3.09, 7.01], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and substance use disorders (48% given MDD vs. 32% given no MDD), OR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.43, 5.62], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<title>MDD in adolescence, emerging adult, and adult periods as a function of prior MDD</title>
<p>We next examined the degree to which experiencing an MDD episode during an earlier developmental period affected the risk of an MDD episode during a subsequent developmental period. We examined rates of MDD in adolescence as a function of MDD in childhood; emerging adulthood as a function of MDD in either childhood or adolescence; and adulthood as a function of MDD in childhood, adolescence, or emerging adulthood. As expected, a previous MDD episode significantly increased the risk of having an MDD episode in future periods. During adolescence, the probability of MDD given childhood MDD (i.e., recurrence) was 38%, compared to a first-incidence MDD rate of 19%, OR = 2.23, 95% CI [1.29, 3.97], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. During emerging adulthood, the probability of MDD given an MDD episode during childhood or adolescence was 46%, compared to a first-incidence MDD rate of 24%, OR = 2.67, 95% CI [1.90, 3.65], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. During adulthood, the probability of having an MDD episode given a prior MDD episode during the child, adolescent, or emerging adult period was 43%, compared to a first-incidence rate of 16%, OR = 3.88, 95% CI [2.76, 5.45], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Thus, a prior MDD episode more than doubled the likelihood of having an MDD episode in adolescence and emerging adulthood and increased the probability of an MDD episode in adulthood almost fourfold, which is consistent with the significant decrease in first incidence rates after age 24.</p>

In this article, we focus on differences in the occurrence of suicide attempts given MDD in the four developmental periods. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2167702612457599">Table 4</xref>, rates of suicide attempts were significantly higher during the adolescent period compared to the emerging adult and adult periods, which did not differ.</p>

<p>Among participants with a history of MDD through age 30, 19%, 95% CI [16.0, 22.9], had at least one suicide attempt by the T4 interview.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we present data from an important longitudinal study of depression that has made a significant contribution to our understanding of adolescent depression by providing critical information about prevalence, duration, course, patterns of comorbidity, and longer-term sequelae of early depression as the sample was followed into adulthood. Strengths of the OADP include its rigorous methodological design, strong retention of participants, and lengthy follow-up period. We contrasted the core indices of MDD across four markedly diverse developmental periods. This has never been done with the OADP data set or, to our knowledge, any other longitudinal data set. Numerous data are presented in the present report. Rather than review all results, our goal in this discussion is to highlight what we believe are the most novel and important findings and resulting critical directions for future research.</p>
<p>Probably the first factor in this study that warrants discussion is the apparent ubiquity of MDD; over half of our sample by age 30 had experienced an episode of MDD. This rate is markedly greater than estimates from cross-sectional retrospective studies (e.g., 17%–19%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167702612457599">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167702612457599">2005</xref>). However, it is more consistent with several prospective, multiwave studies that began in childhood or adolescence—for example, 41% by age 32 in the Dunedin Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167702612457599">Moffitt et al., 2010</xref>), 31% by age 20 in the Simmons Longitudinal Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2167702612457599">Tanner et al., 2007</xref>), 26% by age 34 in the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167702612457599">Beesdo et al., 2009</xref>)—although other multiwave studies have reported lower lifetime MDD prevalence rates, such as 12% by age 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167702612457599">Wittchen, Nelson, &amp; Lachner, 1998</xref>) and 14% by age 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167702612457599">Copeland et al., 2011</xref>). There are four factors that may account for the high lifetime MDD prevalence rate in the OADP: the use of repeated assessments, the full review of past periods, the use of semistructured rather than structured interviews, and K-SADS and SCID definitions for MDD symptom thresholds.</p>
<p>As noted above, lifetime prevalence rates of psychopathology are much higher when aggregated across multiple assessment waves in prospective longitudinal studies compared to cross-sectional studies with a single retrospective assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167702612457599">Moffitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167702612457599">Olino et al., 2012</xref>). Differences are particularly pronounced for episodic conditions such as MDD compared to more chronic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167702612457599">Olino et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that cross-sectional studies probably underestimate prevalence due to underreporting of past psychopathology, particularly briefer and milder episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167702612457599">Moffitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167702612457599">Olino et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Two other factors that might account for the lower rates in previous research are the lack of complete coverage of the life span and the use of structured diagnostic interviews. For example, participants in the Dunedin Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167702612457599">Moffitt et al., 2010</xref>) were assessed at 18, 21, 26, and 32 years of age, but the reporting period at each assessment point was only the past 12 months, which left fairly large gaps in the assessment windows and probably underestimated cumulative prevalence. Other studies have also not attempted to assess the entire period at repeated assessments, such as the Great Smoky Mountain Study, which likely resulted in underestimates of lifetime prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167702612457599">Copeland et al., 2011</xref>). Regarding the nature of the interview, the K-SADS and SCID interviews are semistructured diagnostic procedures, which allow the interviewer to probe for understanding and accuracy, whereas all other multiwave studies of depression in young people appear to have used structured diagnostic interviews. Long-term prevalence estimates from structured interviews are often conservative relative to estimates from semistructured interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2167702612457599">Haro et al., 2006</xref>). The ability to verify understanding and interpretation of diagnostic probes may be more important when assessing internalizing disorders such as MDD in adolescents than adults.</p>
<p>The last factor that may have contributed to differentially higher rates of depression in the OADP is how the diagnostic criteria for MDD were operationalized. Although diagnostic interviews are often based on the same criteria (e.g., <italic>DSM–IV</italic>), the criteria may be operationalized differently. For example, the <italic>DSM–III–R</italic> and <italic>DSM–IV</italic> MDD core symptom of depressed mood requires “depressed mood most of the day nearly every day.” This is operationally defined in the K-SADS as “depressed mood most days (at least 4/week), over 50% of awake time.” Other interviews may use higher thresholds to assess this item, resulting in lower prevalence rates. While we often assume that studies are comparable because they use similar diagnostic criteria, we may overlook the fact that minor differences in the wording of probes and anchors can have a substantial influence on prevalence rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2167702612457599">Pilkonis, Heape, Ruddy, &amp; Serrao, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The frequency of MDD has far-reaching implications. For one thing, it suggests that one-shot retrospective assessments typical in most research studies are probably erroneous. Most important, a significant proportion of participants classified as “nondepressed controls” in lifetime retrospective studies of adults probably have a history of depression. Thus, there is a pressing need for more sensitive assessment and for more intensive assessment designs. From a conceptual perspective, the high prevalence rates raise critical questions about how we conceptualize psychopathology (e.g., is it really “abnormal” from a statistical perspective? Are the diagnostic criteria for MDD too liberal?).</p>
<p>Based on MDD episodes across the entire 30-year period, the median duration was 11 weeks, which is consistent with large nationally representative adult samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167702612457599">Eaton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167702612457599">Kessler et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that a large number of MDD episodes in community samples resolve relatively quickly, generally without intervention. It was intriguing that the longest MDD durations in this article were reported for childhood episodes, which were based on reports obtained in mid- to late adolescence. Indeed, these are the only rates that were based on reports from a different developmental period. Childhood MDD episodes may truly tend to be longer, or it may be that shorter MDD episodes in childhood were forgotten by the T1 assessment. Consistent with this second possibility, although not statistically different, the median duration for MDD episodes in adolescence—which was the only developmental period in which we conducted two assessments and hence covered shorter reporting periods—appeared somewhat shorter than episodes in both emerging adulthood and adulthood (i.e., 8 vs. 12 weeks).</p>
<p>One response to the possible concern of “overdiagnosis” would be to increase the duration and/or threshold for MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167702612457599">Klein, Shankman, &amp; McFarland, 2006</xref>). However, we know from numerous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Shankman, Gau, &amp; Klein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Solomon, Seeley, &amp; Zeiss, 2000</xref>) that subthreshold conditions are associated with significant problems in functioning and increased risk for future pathology. Again, it may be that it is persistent or recurrent subthreshold depression, rather than subthreshold depression in general, that accounts for most of this impairment and risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2167702612457599">Klein, Shankman, Lewinsohn, &amp; Seeley, 2009</xref>). Rather than changing the diagnostic criteria, another method for narrowing the focus to more severe cases of MDD would be to limit study to the subset of depressed adolescents who receive treatment. Compared to community samples, clinical samples of depressed children and adolescents have an earlier age of onset, longer episode duration, higher rates of recurrence, sustained impairments across a broad range of life domains, and greater likelihood of psychiatric comorbidity and suicidality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2167702612457599">Dunn &amp; Goodyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2167702612457599">Harrington, Fudge, Rutter, Pickles, &amp; Hill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167702612457599">Kovacs, Feinberg, Crouse-Novak, Paulauskas, &amp; Finkelstein, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167702612457599">Kovacs, Feinberg, Crouse-Novak, Paulauskas, Pollock, et al., 1984</xref>). Although there are restrictions and selection biases on who seeks and has access to mental health treatment, the study of patient samples probably has the most direct relevance to the clinicians who are interested in providing care to this population.</p>
<p>A fairly novel aspect of the present report was the examination of emerging adulthood as a unique developmental period. The occurrence of MDD appears to be markedly associated with this developmental period, with first-incidence rates still as high as in adolescence (and significantly higher than the subsequent adulthood period) combined with a high MDD recurrence rate. Thus, we recommend that a primary focus of MDD research be on the period of emerging adulthood, with a goal of (a) reducing first incidence rates and (b) reducing recurrence rates, most likely through the use of selective or indicated prevention strategies. Using a slightly different age period classification strategy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2167702612457599">Hammen, Brennan, Keenan-Miller, and Herr (2008)</xref> found youth who experienced both initial MDD prior to age 18 and recurrence prior to age 20 to be a particularly high-risk group, with more severe and chronic depressive episodes, more frequent suicidality and comorbid anxiety disorders, and poorer psychosocial functioning, compared to participants who experienced a single MDD episode in either adolescence or the emerging adult period.</p>
<p>The concept of emerging adulthood is somewhat controversial, and some contend that it is better conceptualized in terms of economic conditions rather than a psychological developmental period per se (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2167702612457599">Côté &amp; Bynner, 2008</xref>). Regardless, it is a period in which there are significant stressors that may in part explain the elevated rates of MDD (e.g., lack of structure, relationship instability, lack of economic independence, uncertainty about the one’s competence and future). In addition, this period is hypothesized to involve increased self-focus. In the integrative theory of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Hoberman, Teri, &amp; Hautzinger, 1985</xref>), a heightened state of self-awareness was thought to break through an individual’s self-protective, self-enhancing cognitive schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167702612457599">Alloy &amp; Abramson, 1979</xref>), leading to self-denigration and behavioral withdrawal.</p>
<p>The present findings suggest that the field of depression research may have overemphasized the importance of adolescence in understanding the onset of depression and neglected the arguably more important period of emerging adulthood. For example, although there is currently a great deal of interest in the neurobiology of adolescence, trajectories of neural development often continue well into young adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167702612457599">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2167702612457599">Tamnes et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, a detailed exploration of the neurobiology of young adulthood is also warranted. In addition, there is a growing focus on active outreach efforts to prevent and treat depression on college campuses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167702612457599">Garlow et al., 2008</xref>). Our data strongly support these efforts.</p>
<p>Our next recommended area of research focus is to understand suicidal behavior in adolescence. The present results are the first time that we have contrasted rates of suicide attempt across the four examined developmental periods, and findings illuminate a markedly elevated rate of attempts during the adolescent period compared to the emerging adult and adult periods. Suicidal behaviors in association with MDD are exceptionally frequent during this developmental period, with one fifth of depressed adolescents reporting a suicide attempt, which was 2 to 4 times higher than the rates of attempts given MDD occurring in either emerging adulthood or adulthood. Suicide attempts among female adolescents were primarily driving this effect: Rates of attempt were significantly higher for female adolescents compared to women in later developmental periods. Adolescence in general is known to be a high-risk period for suicide attempts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167702612457599">Kessler, Borges, &amp; Walters, 1999</xref>), and a few studies of patient samples have found that, compared with adult-onset MDD, MDD during adolescence is more strongly associated with suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2167702612457599">van Noorden, Minkenberg, Giltay, van der Wee, &amp; Zitman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2167702612457599">Zisook et al., 2007</xref>). However, others have reported with patient samples that the association of suicide attempts increases with age from adolescence to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2167702612457599">Goldston et al., 2009</xref>) or is more strongly associated with recurrent MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2167702612457599">Witte, Fink, Smith, &amp; Joiner, 2009</xref>), which is more likely to occur later than adolescence. Research should study the long-term consequences of adolescent attempts and distinguish attempts from nonsuicidal self-injury (i.e., intentional and nonsocially sanctioned self-inflicted damage without suicidal intent), which has been proposed as a new disorder for the fifth edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>.</p>
<p>Our last recommended research focus is gender. First-incidence MDD rates are roughly 2.5 times greater in women from childhood through age 30. Interestingly, that association pertained to first incidence (significant in all four periods) but not recurrence. Gender differences in the rate of depression among adults have been reported many times, with a typical ratio of 2:1 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2167702612457599">Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Girgus, 1994</xref>), and other studies of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167702612457599">Hankin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167702612457599">Kovacs, 2001</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167702612457599">Eaton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167702612457599">Kessler et al, 1994</xref>) have reported higher rates of first incidence for females than males. In addition, most studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167702612457599">Eaton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167702612457599">Hankin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167702612457599">Kovacs, 2001</xref>) find no significant gender effect for MDD recurrence, although a few studies with adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2167702612457599">Dunn &amp; Goodyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167702612457599">McCauley et al., 1993</xref>) and adult patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2167702612457599">Mueller et al., 1999</xref>) have found greater depressive recurrence for women. Definitively answering the question of whether female gender increases the risk for MDD recurrence at any developmental period or for any subgroups of the population is a critical gap in our knowledge base. The most novel aspect of the present study is to highlight the fact that the increased incidence of MDD is not exclusively an issue of early to midadolescence, as is generally assumed. While the MDD gender difference may emerge in adolescence, it persists well into adulthood. Hence, research on gender differences in depression needs to expand its focus. It is important to explore whether there are gender differences in stable vulnerability factors even before adolescence that may help to explain why risk continues to persist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2167702612457599">Kujawa et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, given the preponderance of women experiencing first-incidence MDD, gender-specific prevention interventions through adulthood, rather than simply focusing on adolescence, are necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167702612457599">Le, Muñoz, Ippen, &amp; Stoddard, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>MDD has been variously conceptualized as an episodic/remitting condition and as a chronic/recurrent condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167702612457599">Keller &amp; Boland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167702612457599">McCauley et al., 1993</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2167702612457599">Monroe and Harkness (2011)</xref>, our data suggest that it is actually both. Among OADP participants who had ever experienced MDD, the total cumulative MDD recurrence rate was 53%. The high recurrence rate has implications for prevention efforts. A strong case could be made that there needs to be a greater emphasis on depression recurrence prevention, as opposed to the prevention of first-incidence onset. However, given the heterogeneity of MDD, course patterns may provide clues to different subtypes. For example, there is evidence that etiological influences may differ for single-episode versus recurrent depression and remitting versus chronic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2167702612457599">Klein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167702612457599">Uher et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Before concluding, study limitations should be acknowledged. Although based on a large sample of community-residing adolescents, several factors may limit the generalizability of our findings. First, the sample was restricted to a single geographical location of the United States. The extent to which different findings might have emerged from a national probability sample or from samples from other regions of the United States or world is unknown. Second, and related to the first limitation, the sample was predominantly of European-American descent. Although the racial and ethnic composition of the OADP was comparable to the region from which participants were recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167702612457599">Lewinsohn, Hops, et al., 1993</xref>), the sample was not representative of the ethnic and racial composition of the entire United States. As there are differences in prevalence and course of MDD in different ethnic groups, the generalizability of our findings may be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2167702612457599">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). A third limitation is that we did not collect Tanner stage data to ascertain pubertal timing or status, which may have provided a more relevant classification of early MDD episodes than age per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2167702612457599">Angold, Costello, &amp; Worthman, 1998</xref>). Fourth, the sample suffered some attrition at each assessment.</p>
<p>When data collection in the OADP began in 1987, almost all of the available information on adolescent depression came from small patient samples or questionnaire-based surveys. Partially as a result of the OADP, the pervasiveness and significance of MDD in adolescence are now well established. The present article took the entire data set and expanded our focus to compare and contrast MDD across four markedly diverse developmental periods. Results suggest that MDD in childhood is unique in terms of a lower occurrence but possibly greater episode duration. Adolescent MDD is unique in its high rates of suicide attempts, although it is possible that many of these episodes may be of short duration. Emerging adulthood warrants further study as a separate developmental period for depression researchers, given its elevated rates of MDD relative to adults, but the presentation of MDD in this age period (e.g., gender associations, psychiatric comorbidity, duration, and rates of suicidality) is generally comparable to adults 24 to 30 years of age. Longitudinal studies of community samples that continue into adulthood, such as the OADP, have provided essential information. However, this review also points to the kinds of future research topics and designs that are needed to make further progress.</p>
