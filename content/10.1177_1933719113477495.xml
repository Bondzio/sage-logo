Endometriosis has estimated annual costs of US $12 419 per woman (approximately €9579), comprising one-third of the direct health care costs with two-thirds attributed to loss of productivity. Decreased quality of life is the most important predictor of direct health care and total costs. It has been estimated that there is a mean delay of 6.7 years between onset of symptoms and a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis, and each affected woman loses on average 10.8 hours of work weekly, mainly owing to reduced effectiveness while working. To encourage and facilitate research into this debilitating disease, a consensus workshop to define future directions for endometriosis research was held as part of the 11th World Congress on Endometriosis in September 2011 in Montpellier, France. The objective of this workshop was to review and update the endometriosis research priorities consensus statement developed following the 10th World Congress on Endometriosis in 2008.<sup>1</sup> A total of 56 recommendations for research have been developed, grouped under 6 subheadings: (1) diagnosis, (2) classification and prognosis, (3) clinical trials, treatment, and outcomes, (4) epidemiology, (5) pathophysiology, and (6) research policy.

The format for the meeting was 6 sessions covering different endometriosis-related topics with expert moderators responsible for each session. Each moderator was asked to briefly review what progress has been made for their topics in the last 3.5 years, discuss whether the 2008 recommendations needed updating, and make suggestions for and lead the discussion on new/revised recommendations. Each moderator was responsible for producing a written summary listing and justifying research recommendations for their session which was then incorporated into this final report. The workshop was attended by 58 participants from 19 different countries representing a wide spectrum of interests and expertise from clinical through fundamental research to patient advocates and women with endometriosis.</p><p>Given the complex and multidisciplinary nature of endometriosis, the philosophy of the workshop was to be as inclusive as possible in adopting recommendations for research. Although by no means proscriptive, it is hoped that these recommendations will act as both a guide and a stimulus to the international research community as well as the many funding agencies that may provide support for endometriosis research. A total of 56 recommendations for research have been developed, grouped under 6 subheadings: (1) diagnosis, (2) classification and prognosis, (3) clinical trials, treatment and outcomes, (4) epidemiology, (5) pathophysiology, and (6) research policy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719113477495">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-1933719113477495" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of the key areas addressed in Endometriosis Research Directions international consensus workshop.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1933719113477495-fig1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section2-1933719113477495"><title>Background</title><p>Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disorder that is defined as estrogen-dependent lesions containing endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. It occurs on the peritoneum and ovaries, in the rectovaginal septum, and in other sites within and outside the pelvis. It may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of pain and/or infertility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113477495">2</xref></sup> Endometriosis affects an estimated 6% to 10% of women in the reproductive age group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477495">3</xref></sup> This prevalence increases up to 30% in women with infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719113477495">4</xref></sup> and to 50% in infertile women with a normal cycle whose partner has normal sperm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719113477495">5</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, through the WERF, the first ever prospective study investigating the direct and indirect costs of endometriosis in 10 countries estimated annual costs of US $12 419 per woman (approximately €9579), comprising one-third of the direct health care costs with two-thirds attributed to loss of productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719113477495">6</xref></sup> Decreased quality of life (QoL) was the most important predictor of direct health care and total costs. This study confirmed that the economic burden associated with endometriosis treated in referral centers is high and is similar to other chronic diseases (diabetes, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis). These results are in agreement with an earlier prospective study of 1418 women with and without endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113477495">7</xref></sup> This work showed that there was a delay of mean of 6.7 years, principally in the primary care, between onset of symptoms and a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis, and that endometriosis caused a significant impact on health-related QoL (HRQoL). Each affected woman lost on average 10.8 hours of work weekly, mainly owing to reduced effectiveness while working. Loss of work productivity translated into significant costs, ranging from US $208 in Nigeria to US $23 712 in Italy per woman per year.</p><p>Between the 2008 and 2011 WCE meetings, a total of 3176 new scientific publications on endometriosis were recorded on PubMed. This represents a 21.5% increase in the total number of scientific papers published prior to 2008 in the field, an indication that significant research effort exists around this problem. The vast majority of the publications were in established areas of endometriosis research, including etiology, surgery, histology, pathology, pain, cancer, and fertility, although a number of emerging endometriosis research fields had significantly increased publication rates including stem cells, proteomics, genomics, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, genetics, and inflammation.</p><p>Although it can sometimes be difficult to predict the future impact of scientific publications at the time they first appear, there were some publications over the past 3 years that could readily be identified as major contributions. These include the first 2 genome-wide association (GWA) studies for endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719113477495">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719113477495">9</xref></sup> and ongoing work in the area of nerve fibers and endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719113477495">10</xref></sup> Undoubtedly there are others.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1933719113477495"><title>Diagnosis</title><p>In patients with clinical suspicion of endometriosis, diagnostic laparoscopy has been shown by subsequent histopathological testing to confirm the diagnosis in 78% to 84% of the patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719113477495">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719113477495">12</xref></sup> although significantly lower rates than this have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719113477495">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719113477495"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719113477495">15</xref></sup> Diagnostic laparoscopy is an excellent tool for direct visualization of the pelvis and may help identify the etiology of the patients’ pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719113477495">16</xref></sup> and surgical ablation of disease can occur in the same procedure. However, the quality of the available literature on the efficacy of diagnostic laparoscopy as it relates to patient outcome is limited, as almost all of the available studies are retrospective studies from single institutions. Furthermore, there is a paucity of data on long-term outcomes and little data on cost-effectiveness and QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719113477495">16</xref></sup> Procedure-related complications from laparoscopy include bowel injuries, bleeding, urological injuries, vaginal cuff wounds, peritonitis, and pelvic pain. The risk of complications is related to the complexity of surgery and the experience of the laparoscopist. In a large multicenter French study (n = 29 966), diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy were found to be associated with a 3.3 per 100 000 mortality and a 4.6 per 1000 morbidity risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719113477495">17</xref></sup></p><p>A noninvasive test for the reliable diagnosis of endometriosis, and in particular early endometriosis, remains a priority. Specificity and sensitivity of any diagnostic test are key issues, with many patients having comorbidities, such as adenomyosis, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis, which can all contribute to the symptomatology. Because of the likely variable etiology of endometriosis, different subsets of biomarkers may be required for different stages and/or clinical classifications of endometriosis. A recent systematic review of 182 relevant articles that assessed over 200 potential biomarkers identified several reports of endometrial differences which have the potential to be biomarkers for endometriosis. However, the authors concluded that larger studies in well-defined populations are required to determine their true usefulness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719113477495">18</xref></sup> More recently it was reported that in plasma samples obtained during menstruation, multivariate analysis of 4 biomarkers (annexin V, VEGF, CA-125, and sICAM-1/or glycodelin) enabled the diagnosis of endometriosis undetectable by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 81% to 90% and a specificity of 63% to 81% in independent training and test data sets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719113477495">19</xref></sup> Peptide fingerprinting using proteomic analysis of plasma may also have utility as a noninvasive or semi-invasive diagnostic for endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719113477495">20</xref></sup> Taken together, these data suggest that endometriosis biomarkers can be developed using a panel of “known” biomarkers or by the discovery of new biomarkers based on proteomic, microarray, metabolomic analysis, or other systems biology approaches.</p><sec id="section4-1933719113477495"><title>Recommendation</title><p>Discovery and identification of new and validation of existing endometriosis-associated biomarkers is required to develop an accurate, noninvasive method to diagnose endometriosis.</p><p>The different clinical classifications of endometriosis need to be taken into consideration as part of the evaluation of predictive and diagnostic biomarkers.</p><p>Different techniques for diagnostic and preoperative imaging of endometriosis are being explored, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719113477495">21</xref></sup> From a clinical point of view, the ideal is a test with high sensitivity that does not miss any individuals with endometriosis or other pelvic conditions that might benefit from diagnostic or operative laparoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719113477495">22</xref></sup> Although the resolution of imaging techniques continues to improve, their current diagnostic accuracy remains significantly inferior to direct laparoscopic visualization. Other issues associated with imaging of endometriosis are the training required to achieve acceptable sensitivity and specificity rates, and the cost of these procedures if used as a screening tool.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1933719113477495"><title>Recommendation</title><p>Advances in imaging techniques should be monitored for application to diagnosis of endometriosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-1933719113477495"><title>Classification and Prognosis</title><p>In the broadest sense, classification may be related to the risk of endometriosis, the etiology of the disorder (including genetic and environmental factors), disorders associated with endometriosis, targeting therapies, and designing inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials to evaluate diagnostics and therapeutics. The revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) classification of endometriosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719113477495">23</xref></sup> and the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification of endometriosis, 1996 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719113477495">24</xref></sup> have been the most widely used classification criteria for endometriosis. However, these classifications are restricted to a limited number of criteria and are not particularly valuable for predicting many of the parameters needed for clinical management, including pain or fertility outcomes. A refinement of the rAFS/rASRM criteria is the ENZIAN classification system, developed to describe more severe disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719113477495">25</xref></sup> However, this classification system does not appear to be widely used. Currently, The American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists is developing a categorization system that will be more focused on pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719113477495">26</xref></sup></p><p>There has been recent progress in the development of a prognostic algorithm for fertility following surgery for endometriosis.

However, the extent and duration of the therapeutic benefit are still poorly defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719113477495">33</xref></sup> Methodological drawbacks limit considerably the validity of observational, noncomparative studies on the effect of laparoscopy, identifying the need for prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trials. Based on a review of best available evidence, pain recurrence and reoperation rates after conservative surgery for symptomatic endometriosis are high and probably underestimated. Clinicians and patients should be aware that the expected benefit is also operator dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719113477495">33</xref></sup></p><p>A number of research questions developed at the WCE research directions workshop in 2008 remain valid today, including (1) whether effective medical adjuvant therapies exist to prevent or limit the recurrence of lesions and symptoms following surgery, (2) whether laparoscopic ablation or excision of endometriosis is more effective in women with pain, (3) whether the introduction of advanced operative laparoscopy techniques have resulted in an increase in adverse outcomes relating to long-term bladder, bowel, or ovarian dysfunction, and (4) whether such techniques are superior to more conservative surgery in preventing long-term recurrence of endometriosis.</p><p>It was also noted that surgical and clinical trials offer an excellent opportunity to obtain well-characterized tissue samples for collaborative studies on the pathophysiology of endometriosis.</p><sec id="section10-1933719113477495"><title>Recommendation</title><p>There is a need for more well-designed, adequately powered, multicenter randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up studies comparing different endometriosis treatment options against defined outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="section11-1933719113477495"><title>Recommendation</title><p>Clinical trials in endometriosis should focus on outcomes of high relevance to women, that is, quality of life and key fertility outcomes including live births.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1933719113477495"><title>Recommendation</title><p>We need to transform our clinical study design to integrate treatment failure for the first agent, with subsequent rescue agents in a phased, organized, and stratified manner.</p><p>Major advances in improving understanding and alleviating pain in endometriosis will likely occur if the focus changes from lesions to pain.
