<abstract>
<p>We propose Social Learning Theory as a theoretical foundation for understanding the ethical standards of future business leaders. Using data drawn from students from 115 four-year undergraduate institutions in 36 different countries, the relationships among role models, capitalism, and laws were examined. The data suggest that future business leaders educated in environments espousing all moral philosophies except virtue ethics are influenced by their role models. However, differences in unethical behavior are found as related to the social influences of capitalism and laws.</p>

<p>Reports of scandalous behavior have long dominated the popular press, with current business pages reporting everything from an increase in earnings restatements to fraudulent business behavior. In an increasingly interconnected world, the fragility of the global marketplace has been evidenced time and time again. From the Enron and WorldCom scandals to the Wall Street banking scandals to the U.S. government bailout of American auto manufacturers, today’s future business leaders are confronted early in their academic careers with history-making events that have had a profound impact on their country’s economic system. These business students are maturing in a digital age in which they do not have to read about historical scandals; rather, today’s business school students are exposed to behaviors as they unfold and, as such, may be developing professionally by modeling the behaviors of both ethical and unethical business leaders.</p>
<p>In a study commissioned by the American Management Association, experts attributed the rise in unethical behavior to pressure to meet unrealistic business objectives and deadlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475312474279">Business &amp; Legal Reports, 2006</xref>). The actions exhibited by too many managers in today’s global marketplace may not be those which we would like our future business leaders to be mimicking. There is a real danger that these observed actions in response to business pressures are influencing future actions of our future business leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312474279">V. L. Crittenden, Hanna, &amp; Peterson, 2009b</xref>). To explore this possibility, we examine the role of various potential influences in the formation of ethical standards in the global workplace.</p>
<p>We propose Social Learning Theory (SLT) as a theoretical foundation for understanding influences on the ethical standards of future business leaders across various cultures and to pursue explanatory constructs for unethical standards worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475312474279">Cullen, Parboteeah, &amp; Hoegl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475312474279">Martin, Cullen, Johnson, &amp; Parboteeah, 2007</xref>). SLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312474279">Bandura, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312474279">1977</xref>) explains human behavior in terms of continuous reciprocal interaction between cognitive, behavioral, and environmental influences. Consistent with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312474279">Davis and Luthans (1980</xref>, p. 282) further suggested, “The person and the environment do not function as independent units but instead determine each other in a reciprocal manner.” Recognition of this reciprocal interdependency is critical for understanding the potentially conflicting signals that our future business leaders receive as they develop their own standards for unethical decision making. Observing the behavior of others may result in future business leaders who are learning to inextricably combine morally questionable actions with the best way to conduct business. In doing so, these future business leaders may be learning that the outcome is more important than the process.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. We first discuss SLT with respect to the theory’s origin and theoretical expansions. We then propose a series of research questions using SLT as a framework for understanding unethical behavior. Using data drawn from students from 115 four-year undergraduate institutions in 36 different countries, we conduct a regression analysis to determine the influences on unethical behavior among our students of business—many of whom are our future business leaders (referred to as “future business executives” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475312474279">Jones &amp; Gautschi, 1988</xref>; “prospective managers” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475312474279">Preble &amp; Reichel, 1988</xref>; “tomorrow’s business professionals” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475312474279">Stevenson &amp; Bodkin, 1998</xref>). We then present the results of the data analysis and discuss the implications.</p>
<sec id="section1-0273475312474279">
<title>Social Learning Theory and Unethical Standards</title>
<p>SLT depicts the interaction of an individual’s knowledge and experiences, the environment (i.e., those stimuli that the person is aware of), and the individual’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312474279">Bandura, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312474279">1977</xref>). The underlying premise of SLT is that behavior is a result of both person and situation and does not result from either factor alone. There is both a cognitive and operant view of learning in SLT. In the four-step pattern as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312474279">Bandura (1977)</xref>, an individual notices something in the environment, the individual remembers what was noticed, the individual produces a behavior, and then the environment delivers a consequence (e.g., reward or punishment) that changes the probability the behavior will appear again. Within the management literature, SLT has been offered as a theoretical foundation for organizational behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312474279">Davis &amp; Luthans 1980</xref>), strategic management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475312474279">Ginter &amp; White, 1982</xref>), sales management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475312474279">Onyemah, Swain, &amp; Hanna, 2010</xref>), and classroom instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312474279">W. F. Crittenden, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>SLT proposes that individuals learn much of their behavior by observation and imitation of others. Within the context of ethics, the SLT framework offers considerable guidance with respect to how future business leaders actually learn to make business decisions. Academically, business schools have spent considerable time and energy incorporating ethics into the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312474279">Ferrell &amp; Ferrell, 2008</xref>). Curriculum issues fit neatly into the environmental component of the SLT framework. Curriculum alone, however, ignores the interaction that takes place among various other constructs that might affect the future business leaders’ attitudes toward unethical behavior. While educators can provide the academic grounding for understanding ethical issues, curriculum is only one component and, unfortunately, a component that may be elusive once the future business leader is placed in the work environment.</p>
<p>Within the context of observing and imitating, there are numerous influences on the future business leader. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475312474279">Pfarrer (2005)</xref> suggests that unethical behavior is manifest in organizational actions that are deemed immoral or unacceptable according to societal norms or general standards of conduct. Such norms or standards of conduct may be reflective of the legal ramifications of actions. Thus, in addition to mimicking the actions of leaders faced with profit pressures, our future business leaders likely have a keen focus on the environment they work in as influenced by the rules of capitalism and the legal aspects of business actions. This suggests three critical influences with respect to learning and ethics: role models, capitalism, and laws.</p>
<sec id="section2-0273475312474279">
<title>Role Models</title>
<p>Leading by example has become a dominant theme as related to ethical concerns. Students have watched as high-profile business executives and world leaders (e.g., Ken Lay, Martha Stewart, Bill Clinton) have been chastised by the press and, oftentimes, convicted and sentenced to federal prison. While much attention is focused on top executives with respect to the ethical tenor of an organization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312474279">Rich (1997)</xref> suggested that leadership by example is critical even within the lower level management ranks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475312474279">Weaver, Treviño, and Agle (2005)</xref> pursue leadership by example even further and suggest that coworkers and immediate supervisors are the ones who truly serve as role models for ethical behavior at work.</p>
<p>Role modeling to enact socially desirable behavior is distinguished from mentoring by the fact that a role model may have no awareness of the observation, while a mentor is a formal relationship in which the mentor knows that she or he is being observed. Modeling promotes social learning via an interaction in which neither party may be consciously aware of the exchange. For example, Person A observes Person B perform a particular action and subsequently enacts the action that was observed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475312474279">Papa et al., 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the observed party will engage in ethical actions. Our students of business (today’s future business leaders) may believe, via what they have seen from prominent business executives, that their future managers will act unethically and, thus, that they themselves will also act unethically. Thus, the first research question examines the perception business students have of managers.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Do perceptions that managers engage in unethical behaviors lead to increases in unethical behavior in different cultures?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475312474279">Malanga (2009)</xref> reinforces the possibly negative impact of role modeling when he offers an example in which unethical actions resulted in a publishing contract for the party who had possibly committed mortgage fraud. Thus, the mimicked action (e.g., lying on financial documents) may be deleterious, yet profitable overall (e.g., making money from a publishing contract for detailing the fraudulent actions). This leads to the second research question as related to the importance of role modeling.</p>

<sec id="section3-0273475312474279">
<title>Capitalism</title>
<p>In early 2008, Bill Gates suggested that the world’s biggest problems could only be fixed by free market or creative capitalism via both social contributions and financial gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475312474279">Koehn, 2008</xref>). Gates’s thinking about creative capitalism is not far afield from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475312474279">Schumpeter (1950)</xref> espoused when he suggested that the fundamental evolutionary force within capitalism was psychosocial and that capitalism would ultimately be defined by the cultural values and social attitudes embodied within the general population.</p>
<p>On the contrary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475312474279">Callahan (2004)</xref> appeared to detest capitalism when he suggested that today’s economic climate fostered unethical behavior, and he attributed an increase in unethical actions (particularly as related to cheating) to the capitalist climate in which American students of business are matriculating. Callahan’s thinking is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312474279">Ellis (1968)</xref>, who, decades ago, insinuated that people did not have the inner rationality to control the tendencies to take advantage of others and that capitalism actually encouraged various kinds of cheating and coercion.</p>
<p>The capitalism debate leads to the third research question examined in the current study.</p>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0273475312474279">
<title>Laws</title>
<p>Another interesting debate exists in the relationship between the law and ethics. The post–Enron era has seen a considerable emphasis on external regulation. Most notably, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is an attempt by the U.S. Congress to impose stiff penalties for corporate misconduct in an effort to restore confidence in large corporations. With respect to whether legislated ethics implies that legal is ethical, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312474279">Beggs and Dean (2007)</xref> suggest that managers and academicians would agree that legal is not always ethical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475312474279">Di Lorenzo (2007</xref>, p. 275) agrees and says, “Business corporations are increasingly cognizant of ethical obligations beyond literal compliance with law.” Thus, the fourth research question examines the perception that actions that are legal are also ethical.</p>

<sec id="section5-0273475312474279">
<title>Cultural Groupings</title>
<p>The impact of cultural variables, particularly East versus West, has been studied somewhat extensively in the business literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312474279">Hofstede (1980</xref>, p. 21) defined culture as “the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one human group from another.” This definition of culture has been widely accepted by cross-cultural researchers who have long argued that national identity, via East–West culture, has a significant influence on individual ethical values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312474279">Bailey &amp; Spicer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475312474279">V. L. Crittenden, Hanna, &amp; Peterson, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475312474279">England 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312474279">Lu, Rose, &amp; Blodgett, 1999</xref>). Extending this thinking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312474279">Ralston, Holt, Terpstra, and Kai-Cheng (1997)</xref> proposed the inclusion of economic ideology along with the East–West dyad. Researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475312474279">Robertson and Crittenden (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312474279">Axinn, Blair, Heorhiadi, and Thach. (2004)</xref> suggest that moral philosophies, which include both economic ideology and national culture, affect both values and ethic. Given we operate in a global economy, it is critical that we understand whether the impact of social influences vary across cultures. Thus, in this research, we incorporate a cultural perspective for each of our research questions by considering the moral philosophies of the region.</p>
<p>While researchers have attempted to examine the relationship between moral philosophies and ethical intentions, the data are not clear on the country division among the various moral philosophies, thus making it difficult to test multiple countries simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312474279">V. L. Crittenden et al., 2009b</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312474279">W. F. Crittenden, Robertson, and Crittenden (2007)</xref> offer a cross-cultural map of software piracy, a popular and dominant form of unethical behavior. Culture and economic ideology are the two major entities that establish the domain of cross-cultural societal ethics. Using culture as the horizontal axis (Western/Eastern) and economic ideology (capitalism/socialism) as the vertical axis, the authors mapped the six regions of the world onto five major moral philosophies and provided accompanying software piracy data. These moral philosophies are the following:</p>
<list id="list5-0273475312474279" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Egoism</italic>—World defined in terms of own self-interest (North America)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Formalism</italic>—Focus on rights and associated moral intentions (Western Europe)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Relativism</italic>—Defining acceptable ethical behavior in the context of certain key individuals or in-groups (Latin America)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Virtue ethics</italic>—Set of virtues, such as trust, self-control, empathy, fairness, and truthfulness, that is deemed morally valid regardless of the actions or outcomes (Asia-Pacific)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Utilitarianism</italic>—Goal is to seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people (Middle East/Africa &amp; Eastern Europe)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Using this mapping, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312474279">V. L. Crittenden et al. (2009b)</xref> found that moral philosophy played a significant role in the development of a cheating culture. Differences were found among students matriculating within each of the five moral philosophies when it came to tolerance of cheating behavior, belief in the need to cheat to achieve a goal, and the perception that everyone around them was cheating in order to succeed. Essentially, this socioeconomic environment, defined as moral philosophies, sets the tone for generally accepted business practices in individual countries (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475312474279">Robertson &amp; Crittenden, 2003</xref>). Using this same mapping, the countries and students in the future business leaders’ database were segmented as follows (the number in parentheses denotes the sample size within each of the five groups):</p>

<title>Research Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0273475312474279">
<title>Sampling Procedure</title>
<p>We employed a two-stage sampling design in the initial data collection process. Our sample consisted of 4-year colleges and universities from various points around the globe. In the first stage, we selected potential candidate schools, and in the second stage, we obtained a cluster sample of business students in each of the Stage 1 locations.</p>
<p>Sixty-four professors in business schools at the 4-year institutions were identified as contact points. These professors were approached and asked if their research/teaching assistant could administer about 50 questionnaires, which would take no more than 5 minutes to complete, to undergraduate business students in an in-class setting at the beginning of the next academic term. Professors who agreed to participate were sent 60 blank questionnaires; a preaddressed, postage-paid return envelope; and an honorarium of US$20 to be given to the administering assistant as a token of appreciation.</p>
<p>In total, 6,331 future business leaders from 4-year institutions in 36 countries were represented in the sample. Only four professors were unable or unwilling to assist in the data collection process. One professor only had access to graduate students, one was away on sabbatical, and two did not respond to the request. As a result of the data collection approach, approximately 650 additional students completed questionnaires that were unusable due to a number of factors (graduate students taking an undergraduate course, nonbusiness majors in course, foreign exchange students to the university), and almost 40 students did not respond to a sufficient number of questionnaire items to be included in the analysis. The usable sample of future business leaders was deemed sufficiently representative of undergraduate business students globally, albeit represented strongly by students and institutions in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475312474279">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The entire questionnaire consisted of 27 Likert-type items (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 6 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) that were derived from a multitude of sources, 6 demographic questions, and 3 screening questions (academic classification, major field of study, citizenship). The questionnaire and individual items were modeled after previous studies targeting business students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475312474279">Beltramini, Peterson, &amp; Kozmetsky, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475312474279">Peterson, Beltramini, &amp; Kozmetsky, 1991</xref>). The survey was pretested on a sample of 25 undergraduate business students in the United States, along with a qualitative evaluation of statement understandability and an assessment of administrative ease. Additionally, the longitudinal stability (test–retest reliability) of the items was evaluated within three samples of students from France, Spain, and the United States. The median (2 week and 1 month) test–retest correlation measuring longitudinal stability was acceptable at &gt;.50.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was developed in English and subsequently translated into Chinese, French, German, Spanish, and Vietnamese, usually by professors in the countries where the data were collected. In countries in which potential respondents spoke English or one or more of the languages into which the questionnaire was translated (e.g., Filipinos speak Spanish, Tunisians speak French), the questionnaire was not translated. The lack of need to translate was confirmed by the proctoring professor and has been established in previous cross-national ethics research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475312474279">Husted, Dozier, McMahon, &amp; Kattan 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0273475312474279">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable in the current research is future business leader’s belief in the need to compromise one’s ethics to succeed in business. Measured on a 6-point Likert-type scale, respondents were asked to indicate the extent of their agreement to the following statement:</p>
<list id="list7-0273475312474279" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>In order to succeed in business, it is often necessary to compromise one’s ethics.</p></list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="section10-0273475312474279">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>As discussed previously, role models, capitalism, and laws are considered relevant constructs within the context of SLT and ethical standards and were the basis for the research questions driving the current research. These three independent variables were depicted in the data via five Likert-type statements.</p>
<p>Role model as an independent variable was included via student responses to the following two Likert-type items:</p>
<list id="list8-0273475312474279" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Business managers often engage in behaviors that I consider to be unethical.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Within a business firm, the ends justify the means.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Capitalism was assessed via two Likert-type items:</p>
<list id="list9-0273475312474279" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Efficient management can only be achieved through capitalism.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Capitalists are entitled to the reward of profits because they assume the risk of loss.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Laws as the guiding influence on ethical standards were measured via the following Likert-type statement:</p>

<p>Additionally, we included measures of gender (1 = <italic>male</italic>, 2 = <italic>female</italic>) and religiosity (1 = <italic>very religious</italic>, 3 = <italic>not very religious</italic>) as control variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312474279">Albaum and Peterson (2006)</xref> reported that females were more ethically inclined than males and that the more religious were more ethically inclined than the less religious. As such, gender and religion were included in the analysis to see if either of these two demographic characteristics were influences in the ethical standards examined in the current study.</p>

<p>The relationships among role models, capitalism, and laws were examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Correlations and overall means are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312474279">Table 1</xref>. Due to the heterogeneity among cultures, a separate regression was run for each moral philosophy so as to have a better understanding of the drivers of unethical behavior across cultures. Given the large sample size, a <italic>p</italic> value of .001 was used as a threshold for determining statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312474279">Albaum &amp; Peterson, 2006</xref>). We tested for multicollinearity by calculating the tolerance and VIF scores for each coefficient. All tolerances were above 0.875 and VIF scores range from 1.01 to 1.14 and were within acceptable ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312474279">Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312474279">Table 2</xref> shows the regression model results, standardized beta coefficients, and <italic>t</italic> values by the five moral philosophies. For each moral philosophy, the model explains a significant amount of variance in the dependent variable (all <italic>F</italic>s significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Our first research question addressed whether manager engagement in unethical behavior increased unethical behavior across different societies. Indeed, we find that, with the exception of virtue ethics–driven cultures, manager behavior is a significant driver of unethical behavior. Our results show that manager engagement in unethical acts is the biggest driver of unethical behavior in formalists societies (<italic>b</italic> = .249, <italic>t</italic> = 9.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the second largest driver of unethical behavior in egoists societies (<italic>b</italic> = .179, <italic>t</italic> = 10.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), relativist societies (<italic>b</italic> = .209, <italic>t</italic> = 4.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and utilitarianism societies (<italic>b</italic> = .152, <italic>t</italic> = 3.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Our second research question addressed how perceptions that “the ends justify the means in a business” influence unethical behavior. In virtue ethics societies, this was the largest driver of unethical behavior (<italic>b</italic> = .229, <italic>t</italic> = 5.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Similarly, this was also the largest (though not the only) driver of unethical behavior in egoist (<italic>b</italic> = .274, <italic>t</italic> = 14.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), relativists (<italic>b</italic> = .262, <italic>t</italic> = 5.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and utilitarianism (<italic>b</italic> = .170, <italic>t</italic> = 3.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) societies and the second largest driver for formalist societies (<italic>b</italic> = .215, <italic>t</italic> = 7.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Our third research question addressed the influence of capitalist motivations on unethical behavior. The belief that efficient management can only be achieved through capitalism was significant for formalist societies (<italic>b</italic> = .097, <italic>t</italic> = 3.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and marginally significant for virtue ethic societies (<italic>b</italic> = .104, <italic>t</italic> = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Interestingly, the belief that capitalists deserve the profits for taking the risks had a significant (and negative) impact on likelihood to compromise one’s ethics in egoist societies only (<italic>b</italic> = −.077, <italic>t</italic> = −4.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In all cases, the relative impact of capitalistic motivations was much smaller than the impact of a manager’s behavior or perceptions that the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>Finally, our last research question addressed the perceptions of what is legal is ethical. This perception was significant for egoist societies only (<italic>b</italic> = .104, <italic>t</italic> = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and marginally significant for formalists (<italic>b</italic> = .079, <italic>t</italic> = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and utilitarianism (<italic>b</italic> = .121, <italic>t</italic> = 2.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Again, this has a weaker impact on unethical behavior relative to a manager’s behavior or perceptions that the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in virtue ethics societies, the ends justify the means and the belief that efficient management can only be achieved through capitalism were the only drivers of unethical behavior. Moreover, for all the societies, either manager unethical behavior or the perceptions that the ends justify the means was the largest driver overall relative to the other potential drivers of unethical behavior. With respect to the control variables, gender and religiosity only played a role in egoist societies. Specifically, males were more likely than females to compromise their ethics, and religion was a significant predictor with those who are less religious more likely to compromise their ethics.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The data suggest that future business leaders educated in environments espousing all moral philosophies except virtue ethics are influenced by their role models. That is, students educated under cultural norms of egoism, formalism, relativism, and utilitarianism who perceive that managers engage in unethical acts are significantly more likely to compromise their ethics. Also, students who perceive that the ends justify the means in business are more likely to compromise their ethics and this is consistent across all moral philosophies. These findings suggest that potential unethical behavior of future business leaders is highly susceptible to what is observed in the work place, which is consistent with SLT.</p>
<p>However, differences in ethical behavior are found as related to the social influences of capitalism and laws. Capitalism as a social influence varied across the moral philosophies. For example, students educated in the formalism and virtue ethics societies who believe in the relationship between efficient management and capitalism are more likely to compromise their ethics. However, within the capitalism construct, profit entitlement due to risk assumption is negatively related to the need to compromise ethics in all moral philosophies (although only significantly so within the egoist group). Additionally, students of egoist, formalist, and utilitarianism societies are more likely to compromise their ethics if they perceive that anything that is legal is ethical. Thus, the moral compass for these societies appears to be the legal domain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it appears that students’ likelihood to compromise their ethics is consistently predicted by the behavior of their role models. As well, especially in egoist societies (which includes the United States), using what is legal as a barometer for what is ethical plays a major role. Interestingly, beliefs about capitalism only have influence in Western societies and perhaps not in ways one would expect. Thus, it would appear that capitalism by itself cannot be blamed for future business leaders’ potential for unethical behavior.</p>
<p>It is imperative that we, as educators, better understand the unethical influences on our undergraduate students of business since they are the future of our business society. Based on this study, business educators are not contravening ethical behavior by continuing with a focus on capitalism. The hand of capitalism may even emerge eventually as a positive influence on ethical behaviors. Important, however, is the fact that educators need to be cognizant of presenting positive role models to their students. The digital society has not reached into the depths of business to locate the role models who are behaving in an ethical manner—yet it is these role models that our students need to view. Additionally, although educators (and students) may find the discussion of laws to be less than exciting, our future business leaders do appear to rely on these laws to guide their actions.</p>
