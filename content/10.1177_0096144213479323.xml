<abstract>
<p>A housing restoration trend—called “brownstoning” in New York, and urban pioneering or the back-to-the-city trend in other cities—had a noticeable impact in several major U.S. cities from the late 1950s onwards. Nowhere was the trend more influential than Washington, D.C. In key “intown” residential areas such as Georgetown, Capitol Hill, and Dupont Circle, the popularity of housing restoration was catalyzed by a very active set of neighborhood preservation and restoration groups. Focusing on the Capitol Hill area, this paper explores the organizational and publicity apparatus that drove the restoration process as well as the cultural politics and racial tension that accompanied it.</p>

<p>In 1960 Roberta McCain, the wife of Admiral John S. McCain Jr. and mother of the future Senator and presidential aspirant John McCain, opened the family’s rowhouse for the Capitol Hill Restoration Society’s annual house and garden tour. Mrs. McCain told a neighborhood newspaper reporter on the day of the event that she had fled her house for the duration of the tour, but “instructed her maid, stationed strategically at home, to report any comments she happened to hear.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479323">1</xref></sup> Unfortunately, there is no record of what the maid heard that day and consequently no way of knowing exactly how visitors to the family home reacted to Mrs. McCain’s house, her choice of furnishings, or her standards of housekeeping. Nevertheless, Mrs. McCain’s concerns provide a clue to the cultural assumptions and social character of the restoration movement in Washington half a century ago. As the bulldozers moved into Southwest Washington and the highway builders contemplated which streets and houses to excise from inner-city residential districts, Mrs. McCain, and others like her, were opening their houses to show the ways in which fashionable taste might stand outside the maelstrom of modernization and provide a bulwark against immiseration in aging, inner-city residential districts.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1960, <italic>Evening Star</italic> real estate editor Robert J. Lewis claimed that the scope and quality of restoration activity in Washington’s central area neighborhoods “is unmatched anywhere” and makes “Washington undoubtedly the country’s leading city in the field of neighborhood restoration through private means.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479323">2</xref></sup> It is difficult to verify this claim, but there is little question that housing restoration efforts in a series of Washington’s “intown” residential districts were very active in this period and at least as well organized and resourced as comparative groups in other major cities in the United States. Consequently, the neighborhood-based restoration movement had a major impact on perceptions of the city’s physical condition and social composition in the period. This in turn underpinned a significant reevaluation of inner-city real estate in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s and the accompanying social transformation that affected central city neighborhoods in that period.</p>
<p>Despite the extensive research dedicated to aspects of the restoration movement, much of it remains unpublished or buried within analyses of other urban issues. Furthermore, house and garden tours in the inner city, which were the key mode of publicity for neighborhood restoration and historic preservation, and central to their success, have been overlooked entirely. Neil Smith has noted that “demand for gentrified housing can be and is created, most obviously through advertising.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479323">3</xref></sup> Yet more than fifteen years after Smith’s observation, urban researchers have largely neglected this vital form of advertising. This paper begins to redress that situation by examining the restoration culture in Washington as it evolved from the late 1950s onwards. The paper proposes that tours of restored houses and their gardens are evidence of an organized publicity system that evolved in Washington and underpinned the neighborhood restoration process. The tours played a crucial part in encouraging further restoration and preservation and in doing so they promoted the desirability of inner-city neighborhoods as areas of choice for middle and upper middle class whites. The article also examines the strong critical reaction from incumbent blacks who questioned the motivations of restoration groups and the legitimacy of the outcomes they achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144213479323">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479323">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>In addition to documenting an important social and physical process in Washington, this paper fills a noticeable gap in the larger history of historic preservation in the United States. Until the 1990s, that story was dominated by the efforts of a single scholar, Charles Hosmer, whose work focused on major landmarks in legislation, the administration of federal programs, and nationally prominent preservation initiatives. Consequently, the preservation literature did not address the range and depth of preservation activity taking place in towns and cities across the country. While Washington preservation advocates mingled closely with those who framed the national policy response throughout this period, the story of what they were trying to achieve locally, by what means and in whose interest, is not narrated in Hosmer’s book or elsewhere. Indeed the local Washington story is much less well known than local efforts in Charleston, Boston, New York, Providence, Savannah, and Pittsburgh, to name just a few cities where innovative preservation efforts have been documented in some detail in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479323">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the 1990s, beginning with Mike Wallace’s contribution to the field, there has been a growing body of historical research that has provided a richer, more critical and realistic picture of restoration and preservation efforts from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Yet, the compelling narrative woven by Mike Wallace, and reiterated in a range of subsequent scholarship, has tended to overlook the threads that linked the period of intense preservation activity pursued by cultural elites in the 1920s and 1930s to the period of populist antidevelopment of the 1970s. In this article, I suggest that in Washington, and it was true also in Brooklyn and Boston, the 1950s and early 1960s saw significant organized neighborhood restoration activity that was a premise for the great popular expansion of preservation in the 1970s and 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479323">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>House and Garden Tours</title>
<p>In Washington, D.C., discussions of neighborhood restoration and preservation were almost entirely focused on Georgetown between the 1920s and 1940s. By 1952, however, the Capitol Hill Southeast neighborhood was acknowledged as a restoration area, and by 1960 restoration activity was well advanced in several central city neighborhoods, including Foggy Bottom and Kalorama. The main reason for this was that the late 1950s and early 1960s witnessed rapid growth in the organizational apparatus dedicated to restoring the buildings and reputations of (some) central city neighborhoods. New neighborhood-based preservation and restoration groups such as the Capitol Hill Restoration Society and the Foggy Bottom Restoration Association (both founded in 1955) emerged in the period, and their activities became locally prominent. House and garden tours, in particular, were a central feature of the activities of such groups, catalyzing interest in several central city neighborhoods. By looking at what the McCain family and others like them put on display allows us to glimpse the cultural assumptions and patterns of taste that reshaped expectations and ideals related to domesticity, neighborhood, and the city. While the headlines of the 1960s focused on the potential and the problems of large-scale urban renewal efforts, in the pages of the weekend lift-out sections a fine-grained pattern of urban change became evident. This arguably had as great an impact on the perceptions and trajectory of Washington’s central area neighborhoods in the last third of the twentieth century as the story of urban renewal and outward conflict playing out on the front pages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479323">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The neighborhood restoration movement in the United States in the latter decades of the twentieth century did not spring from nothing. That is, it was not the awakening of a fundamentally new consciousness and moral vision as proponents in the 1970s implied. Rather, the movement required careful tending and promotion and a dedicated organizational infrastructure. In Washington, D.C., between the 1950s and the 1970s house and garden tours became the most publicly visible aspect of organized restoration activity. Aside from showcasing individual houses, the tours raised money for local preservation and citizens groups and created a wide awareness of the activities of such groups throughout the metropolitan area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479323">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with other markers of what Dennis Gale has called the “the culture of restoration” in Washington, Georgetown was the model. The first Georgetown house and garden tour was conducted in 1927 and the event has been held almost every year since. But in the 1950s and 1960s other sources of inspiration besides Georgetown appeared and the house and garden tour idea began to spread to other sections of the city where restoration activity was just getting underway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479323">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regular house and garden tours held in the suburban and rural counties surrounding the District of Columbia in the 1950s and early 1960s undoubtedly influenced the inner-city groups that rose to prominence at this time. The <italic>Evening Star</italic> and <italic>Sunday Star</italic>’s “Society-Home” section frequently publicized such events, illustrating the “gracious houses” and manicured gardens that were their highlights. The Maryland House and Garden Pilgrimage, the Potomac Country House Tour (first held in 1956), the House and Garden Tour of McLean, Virginia, the house tour of the Alexandria Association, and the Northern Virginia Garden Tour all focused on grand houses and the historical worthies who had built or inhabited them. Articles that publicized the events implied that the tours would provide a glimpse of the world of the “gentry” in Washington’s nearby hinterland. For example, Habre de Venture in Charles County, Maryland, the house of Thomas Stone, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was opened by its owners for a 1961 tour as was Hickory Hill, Robert and Ethel Kennedy’s house in McLean, Virginia, that dated from the early nineteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479323">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The property owners who opened their houses for these events viewed their property in patrimonial terms, and this patrimony was composed not just of the architecturally distinguished houses but also their landscape settings and their contents: books, antique collectibles, and furnishings. These individual objects and the properties as a whole linked the owners to the federal era and early republic and the mythologized figures associated with the period. In this way, the rural properties opened for these tours complemented the growing reputation of Georgetown, where restoration advocates in the 1950s highlighted links to historical luminaries such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, William Thornton, Francis Scott Key, General LaFayette, Thomas Corcoran, and John Quincy Adams. Exhibiting such connections through house tours seems to have been intended as exemplary, a way of demonstrating to a middle-class audience how places and objects could make tangible links to a valorized past. The patrimonial idea of history that was enacted in these tours, with its authoritative cultural tradition, and focus on a period of intense patriotic interest, was different from the focus on self-discovery and identity that become a central theme of restoration culture by the late 1960s and 1970s, as Richard Ernie’ Reed’s book <italic>Return to the City</italic> (1979) attests. Yet a wider view of the continuities of the restoration movement also reveals that these patterns of display, with their patrimonial ideological underpinnings, mixed quite easily with the growing focus on self-discovery and self-expression that was part of the restoration movement in the 1960s. The negative ideal against which urban pioneers and the restoration movement of the late 1960s and 1970s contrasted itself was not the propertied elite but the suburban middle class. Elite urbanites in Washington and their properties in the rural hinterland actually formed part of the picturesque diversity of the region as construed by restoration advocates in the 1960s and 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479323">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Capitol Hill Restoration Society House and Garden Tours</title>
<p>The Capitol Hill Restoration Society (CHRS) began running an annual house and garden tour in 1958, and by 1960 organizers sold more than seven hundred tickets to the event. This level of interest is clear evidence of a burgeoning restoration constituency and highlighted the fact that urban residential neighborhoods, not just the hamlets of the rural hinterland, were of growing historical interest and cultural prestige to nonspecialists. The effort to foster interest in the neighborhoods immediately to the east of the U.S. Capitol involved a deliberate and sophisticated publicity campaign. Aside from distributing artfully produced flyers and posters around the metropolitan area, promoters persuaded the editors of the city’s major newspapers, several weekly magazines, and neighborhood newspapers to publicize the event with short pieces and/or pictorial spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144213479323">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144213479323">4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479323">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Typically held during spring, when gardens were at their best and the residential real estate market picked up, the house and garden tours were a showcase for individual renovations and for private market-led neighborhood revitalization. For organizations such as the CHRS and later for the Dupont Circle Citizens Association (DCCA), the tours were the equivalent of the commercial builder’s display homes. They created increased interest in the neighborhoods, which in turn helped to sell houses to potential “restorers” and “remodelers.” An article published in the neighborhood newspaper the <italic>Intowner</italic> in the early 1970s, promoting a Dupont Circle house tour, was typical of the way the tours were publicized across the whole period. It noted that the tour “is especially recommended for those of our readers looking for ideas in remodeling their homes or apartments.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479323">13</xref></sup> The active participation of local real estate agents was also a prominent aspect of the events. Among the staunchest supporters and most significant financial contributors to the Capitol Hill Tours in the 1960s was local realtor Barbara Held Reich.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144213479323">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rather than enumerating the standard features of houses in the manner of a typical real estate advertisement, the promotional and interpretive material that accompanied the tours focused on the distinctive ways in which the inhabitants had furnished and decorated the houses and cultivated their gardens. In some cases, efforts were made to identify the period in which houses were built, but during the 1950s and 1960s there was little evidence of systematic research into the history of the individual buildings. C. Dudley Brown, who had a long involvement with restoration projects on Capitol Hill and in other parts of Washington, has recalled that at that time there were a lot of efforts to “early them up”—meaning that Victorian-era houses were given new shutters, doors, and other details in historical styles that broadly evoked colonial or federal-era domestic architecture and had little or no basis in the history of the building. The studied historicism that became associated with historic preservation in later decades was not yet a pronounced value. Instead, old houses were generally treated as an opportunity and site of inspiration for the expression of taste in the decorative arts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479323">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Descriptions published in tour brochures focused on interior details such as fireplaces and mantels as well as furnishings and collectibles and the ways in which inhabitants restored and incorporated these elements into functionally modernized interiors. A marked feature of the Capitol Hill house and garden tours in the 1960s was the value placed on eclecticism and exoticism. The 1964 tour brochure vividly illustrates the point. The huge living room in the Claiborne house, we learn, was “a blending of Victorian and modern styles, complemented by Chinese sculptures, lithographs and Oriental rugs.” Mrs. Hendricks’ house was “filled with magnificent pieces from many countries and periods. An urn more than a thousand years old is displayed in an early American cabinet on top of a 17th century Italian buffet.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479323">16</xref></sup> Attendees at the 1964 tour also saw the interior of the Hogan house with its “collection of old family watches from Ireland . . . a crystal chandelier from Czechoslovakia in the dining room and a 1780 Sheffield Coffee Urn.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144213479323">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is unclear if these descriptions reflect a conscious revival of Victorian habits of collecting and decorating. But it seems fairly certain that the Capitol Hill tours, like the new appreciation for Victorian architecture that became evident in the 1960s, were an index of the shift away from an idea of good taste as restraint. Like British Victorians, Washington’s 1960s remodelers nurtured a somewhat romantic idea of remote places that equated those places, almost elegiacally, with the past. Likewise, regional and historical styles were not an authoritative guide to restoration and decoration. Rather, the past and foreign places were more like a treasure trove that provided the raw materials for personal expression, for the creation of a kind of interiorized universe. As Walter Benjamin noted of the nineteenth-century, middle-class parlor, “For the private individual the private environment represents the universe. In it he gathers remote places and the past. His drawing room is a box in the world theatre.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144213479323">18</xref></sup> This ideal of private life and the private environment was manifestly part of the self-identity of Washingtonians who opened their properties, and thereby their “universe,” for public display in house and garden tours in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Restoration efforts in Georgetown had long been associated with prominent figures in the State Department, many of whom had spent a great deal of time outside the United States, and some of whom became standard bearers of worldliness and cultural sophistication in Washington. The same group, as David Johnson has pointed out, were also stereotyped and disparaged in some quarters in the 1950s as “rich, red and queer” and liable to be found, according to tabloid journalists Lait and Mortimer, “prancing behind the walls of their restored townhouses.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144213479323">19</xref></sup> Even though the social dynamics of the Capitol Hill neighborhoods were quite different to Georgetown—the area to which Lait and Mortimer were referring—house and garden tours for Capitol Hill and other restoration publicity also highlighted the taste of those who had spent time outside the United States. For example, local newspaper <italic>The Capitol Hill Spectator</italic> highlighted the purchase of a rowhouse by “Mr. and Mrs. Richard Conroy of the State Department, who have just returned from a tour in Vienna.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144213479323">20</xref></sup> Indeed, such reports included a wide range of prominent people, from congressmen and their families to artists and intellectuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144213479323">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with restoration and historic preservation in other American cities, women and gay men seem to have played a disproportionately large role in establishing and promoting such activity in Washington. Two women, Leila Smith and Terry B. Moreton, were instrumental in establishing the city’s leading preservation advocacy organization, “Don’t Tear It Down,” in the early 1970s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Charles Robertson and Ernie Harper, both openly gay, were among the most influential neighborhood preservationists in Washington as they shaped the agenda and activities of the Dupont Circle Conservancy and the city’s Joint Committee on Landmarks, respectively. Such efforts were not necessarily connected in any direct way to feminism or gay liberation. Women had long been involved in historic preservation, first via patriotic societies such as the Mount Vernon Ladies Association and later through progressive reform activities in groups such Progressive Citizens’ Association of Georgetown. So the activism and organizational work of Smith and Moreton and others like them can be read as part of a long tradition of women being involved in civic housekeeping and the promotion of sentimental ties to the past, as much as an assertive new role for women aligned with social movements of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>The question of gay involvement in preservation is more complicated still, especially in the period before gay liberation became a political force. The leading “restorationist” in the Capitol Hill neighborhoods was Curly Boswell, who worked closely with Barbara Held Reich to restore many houses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Boswell and C. Dudley Brown, another prolific restorationist and interior decorator who undertook a lot of restoration work in the Capitol Hill area in the period, both seem to have possessed those qualities—“gender atypicality,” “<italic>domophilia</italic>,” “romanticism,” and “aestheticism”—that researcher Will Fellows describes as definitive of the affective investment of gay men in the preservation enterprise. Yet the available sources simply do not confirm that either man was gay. Confirmed bachelors perhaps, but not necessarily gay. To the extent that restoration and preservation activity was a form of urban political activism undertaken by gay men, that activism was never articulated to issues of gay identity and visibility in Washington in the 1960s or 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144213479323">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, in the early Capitol Hill Restoration Society house tours, it was retired military leaders—paragons of conventional masculinity—and their families who were most prominently represented. The prominence of military families reflected the ongoing links between the residential community in Capitol Hill, SE, and the Washington Navy Yard in this period. The 1960 tour included the McCain house as well as the residences of another admiral and a retired colonel, and in the following few years there was always at least one tour house on display that was occupied by a high-ranking, retired military person. One might assume that the decorative tastes of these tour participants would be more conservative than others. But tour information from these years highlighted the provenance of the very eclectic range of objects that the military men and their wives had collected while overseas, much as for other participants. The 1961 Capitol Hill tour information described Brig. General and Mrs. Thomas J. Betts’s house and its “many curios, including two beautiful jade ducks from Shanghai . . . a Japanese wall screen describing an amusing story . . . a Coromandel screen from the Indian Ocean area . . . a Polish candelabra,” and numerous other collectibles from Europe and Asia. A pictorial spread in the <italic>Sunday Star</italic> in 1960 showed the interior of Colonel Robert Burns’s house, which included his “400 year old Spanish castle warmer table . . . bull fight plaques he picked up in Spain” and his antique brass Punch and Judy set that he used as bookends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144213479323">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not everyone who was active in housing restoration in the early 1960s was socially or professionally prominent in Washington. It is obvious, however, that those who organized the tours and otherwise promoted housing restoration felt it was useful to highlight the presence of notable people in the inner city. Jacqueline Kennedy, who lived in restored houses in Alexandria, Virginia, and Georgetown before moving into the White House, was undoubtedly the best known preservation advocate in the Washington area in the early 1960s, but many other politically and socially prominent people lived in remodeled houses in the inner city around that time. As early as 1949 it was reported that Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas had purchased a “historic house” in the southeast section of Capitol Hill. The restoration effort of former attorney general Francis Biddle and his wife, the poet Katherine Garrison Chapin, was generously publicized in the <italic>Washington Post</italic> in 1960. While in 1961 the <italic>Star</italic> reported that economist and diplomat Eleanor Lansig Dulles, member of the Dulles diplomatic dynasty that included Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, was a major catalyst for restoration activity in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, where she had purchased and remodeled five houses. The confidence exhibited by such prominent figures in the economic health, social life, and cultural patterns of the inner city was viewed by groups such as CHRS as a valuable means of promoting the safety and desirability of the intown environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144213479323">Figure 5</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144213479323">24</xref></sup></p>

<p>However, there were potential pitfalls in emphasizing elite leadership in restoration publicity. By the late 1960s, focusing on the cosmopolitanism and the air of international sophistication of prominent restorationists could have been perceived as inconsistent with the focus on community building and participation. As the appeal of the restoration movement broadened, organizations such as the CHRS emphasized the importance of investing financial, cultural, and personal resources in the city’s intown neighborhoods and pointed to the qualities of vigilant homeownership and community participation as desirable objectives. Tony Wrenn of the National Trust highlighted these themes in a speech he delivered to the CHRS in 1961, warning his audience that they must “be alert” and “willing to work” if they are to protect the qualities of the residential environment on Capitol Hill. So on the one hand there was the charisma of the natural aristocracy, those for whom good taste apparently came effortlessly. On the other hand, there was the increasing focus on the need to work hard and be vigilant so as to maintain the beauty and increase the value of urban neighborhoods by preserving their architectural and environmental qualities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0096144213479323">Figure 6</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144213479323">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>While such social distinctions were not explicitly addressed by restoration advocates at the time, efforts were made to manage the possible contradictions in the quickly evolving restoration movement. In the context of the Capitol Hill neighborhoods, there was at least one attempt to describe the harmony of interests between incumbent residents of “good taste” and enthusiastic pioneers. A 1960 booklet about the Capitol Hill area included a section on restoration, which described the CHRS in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>After getting off to slow start a few years ago it began to attract a much larger membership, and now for the last three years has been conducting spring house tours which arouse a good deal of interest and enthusiasm and draw many new residents to the Hill.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144213479323">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The author went on to note, however, that new residents drawn into the restoration trend “have sometimes been unaware that this eastern arrondissement had never been entirely abandoned by its old families.” These families, we learn, who have “good taste and the money to gratify it,” as well as “a sense of civic responsibility,”<disp-quote>
<p>stayed on quietly, maintaining their houses gardens and church memberships and keeping for themselves a sense of continuity. Then, when reinforcements came, so to speak, they were encouraged to burnish and furbish as never before. The results are good and getting better.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144213479323">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the early 1960s, therefore, the story of revival and renewal was tempered by a clear acknowledgment of the importance of continuity. The pioneers who saw themselves as carving out new communities were encouraged to recognize existing communities, at least those considered worthy of recognition by the all white citizens’ association.</p>
<p>This specific concern to mediate between pioneers and incumbents in the Capitol Hill neighborhoods reflected a wider effort within the restoration movement to strike the correct balance between local identification and stronger community ties on one hand and heightened social prominence and cultural distinction on the other. Yet despite this concern with balancing different objectives and agendas, there were several notable shifts in the tone and content of the promotional brochures and press coverage of the house and garden tours during these years. Those shifts speak to the changing social character of the restoration movement.</p>
<p>The embrace of the Victorian period became more pronounced as the years passed and as the tours spread to other intown neighborhoods in Washington. The Dupont Circle Citizens’ Association inaugurated a house tour in 1968 highlighting Gilded Age mansions such as that built for Christian Heurich and at that time occupied by the Columbia Historical Society (later the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.). It was probably the best-known Victorian landmark in Washington and signaled the growing architectural and historical credibility of the Victorian era. Just a few years later CHRS president Thomas B. Simmons noted with satisfaction that Victorian architecture now enjoyed widespread “acceptability,” which covered the spectrum from “real estate parlance to the serious and scholarly attention being paid it by the Victorian Society.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144213479323">28</xref></sup> Washington restorationists joined the Victorian Society of America and forged links with other restoration groups working in Victorian-era neighborhoods such as the Brooklyn-based Brownstone Revival Committee. The Victorian theme became most explicit in the house and garden tours when the Logan Circle Community Association began to run its own tour in 1978. Held in December, the tour was called “A Victorian Christmas,” a theme the organizers maintained in subsequent years. They focused, as the other tours did, on restored houses, as well as antique furnishings, and on the decorative Victoriana used in Christmas displays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144213479323">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The changes in taste that led to a more widespread acceptance of the architecture and urban patterns of the late nineteenth century accorded with the broader cultural atmosphere in the 1960s and 1970s in which older hierarchies of taste and canons of value were persistently questioned. The house tour materials reflect the trend toward the valorization of personal taste, which was widely promoted as an ideal in the consumer marketplace during this period and was adopted by those who rejected expert arbiters of taste and the idea of universally accepted standards. Housing remodelers did not abandon the idea that some places and some periods of building were intrinsically more worthy than others. The sense, however, that older buildings and environments were rapidly being destroyed promoted a broadening of existing assumptions about cultural and historical value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144213479323">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new of air of inclusivity in architectural taste was paralleled by a noticeable shift in the social tone of the restoration movement. The promotional apparatus associated with the restoration trend focused by the late 1960s on diversity as a structuring value for their enterprise. The 1968 Capitol Hill house and garden tour brochure articulated this emerging ideal. “Hill residents are fascinating in their variety of backgrounds, skills and attainments: rich and poor, the highly educated and the straightforward working man, some who have returned from far corners of the earth and some who have been right here all their lives.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144213479323">31</xref></sup> The author of the brochure went on to say that the built environment of the Capitol Hill neighborhoods—which was described as intimate, varied, and human in scale—provided an apt context for this social variety. Real estate agent Barbara Held distributed a newsletter throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her thanksgiving edition from 1970 included the following characterization of the Capitol Hill residential community.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is FRIENDLY, it is a YOUNG community, it is a WALKING or better still a BICYCLING community. It is DIVERSIFIED—Groups and cultures mingle and mix and the result is a livable, vibrant, URBAN experience. The “Hill” offers the opportunity of really CARING—of GETTING INVOLVED so deeply in community groups, in projects—that the “Hill” becomes you and “you” an integral part of the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144213479323">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In an introduction to a CHRS tour brochure from 1964, the historian of Washington, Constance McLaughlin Green, a resident of Capitol Hill herself, touched on similar themes. She asserted, “The rigid conformity that critics of modern America attribute to suburban living does not exist on the Hill.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144213479323">33</xref></sup> According to this idea, the choice to live in the inner city distinguished one as an individual and at the same time involved such residents in a more authentic form of social life. Indeed, such promotional material in this period emphasized the authenticity of place again and again. It was contrasted with an image of suburban conformity and inauthenticity that was roundly criticized by William H. Whyte, Jane Jacobs, Betty Friedan among others in very influential books published in the late 1950s and early 1960s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0096144213479323">Figure 7</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144213479323">34</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0096144213479323-fig7.tif"/></fig>
<p>This emphasis on diversity and authenticity was also accompanied by a tendency to erase overt expressions of class privilege from the promotional material associated with the house and garden tours. By the late 1960s, the “society page” image was eschewed by restoration advocates in Washington and they cultivated a far more democratic idea of its representatives. If domestic arrangements like those of the McCain family, which still presumed maid-service as a norm, remained prevalent in the late 1960s, evidence of them was carefully excised from the promotional literature for the house and garden tours. This change reflected the changing social character of organized housing restoration with the entry of many young, liberal “pioneers” who moved into houses in areas previously considered “marginal” to the restoration effort. It was a change that also mirrored the shift in tone of the small local newspapers in the area. While the jauntiness of <italic>Roll Call</italic> and <italic>The Capitol Hill Spectator</italic> had set the tone in the early 1960s, new papers with a different outlook appeared during the late 1960s, including the <italic>East Capitol Examiner</italic>, with its much more earnest and politically committed tone. Neighborhood politics and cultural identity thus underwent a shift that placed social diversity and cultural inclusiveness as its center.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144213479323">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the house and garden tours in Capitol Hill and other parts of inner-city Washington continued to highlight the expenditure of substantial sums of money on the remodeling of houses and to promote the social change that was required to further that process. The rhetoric of urban revival in the late 1960s and 1970s focused on individuality, authenticity of place, and liberal social values, but the activity of remodeling houses that underpinned one major aspect of that revival was premised on a set of hierarchically structured, social distinctions. Those distinctions clearly privileged the <italic>choice</italic> to live in the inner city over simply being there, and the capacity to marshal the physical resources needed to first purchase a house and then undertake the labor of restoration.</p>
<p>Criticism of restoration organizations and what they represented became more vociferous from the late 1960s onwards. The need for new recreational facilities or neighborhood infrastructure sometimes came into conflict with efforts to preserve and restore as many old dwellings as possible. Moreover, city efforts to enforce building code violations were sometimes criticized as an illegitimate use of local authority on behalf of the restoration trend, where property value was seen to be the object of government action ahead of the welfare of existing inhabitants. In the Capitol Hill neighborhoods, such local government actions produced strong reactions and organizing efforts via local newspapers such as the <italic>Capitol East Gazette</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144213479323">36</xref></sup> In fact, between 1968 and 1970 the Capitol East Community Organization (CECO), an umbrella group that advocated for the needs and interests of the area’s African Americans, garnered national attention with its sustained attack on the restoration movement. The director of the organization, Linwood Chatman, described the agents of the restoration movement in the real estate business as “scavengers” and claimed that black renters had already been “flushed out” of restoration areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144213479323">37</xref></sup> Sam Smith, the activist editor of the <italic>Capitol East Gazette</italic> and a strong supporter of CECO was quoted in the same article as saying that the restoration movement was “strip mining” the area and that the CHRS was, in effect, a major impediment to social justice aims. “Exploiters moved in quickly,” he said, “made a fast buck, and drove out blacks in an attempt to fashion another Georgetown.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144213479323">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some whites who had moved to Capitol Hill and restored houses there in the 1950s and 1960s, however, felt slandered by the idea that they were benefiting from a deliberate displacement of African Americans. For example, in February 1968, resident Josephine Turner defended the CHRS in the <italic>Capitol Hill News</italic>, arguing that its members consistently promoted the good of the whole neighborhood and fought to protect its population from slum conditions and inappropriate proposals such as the inner-loop freeway, a plan that had been defeated by a wave of resident opposition in the early 1960s. Sarcastically deploying the tropes of progressive-era muckrakers Turner mocked the idea that the CHRS was an exploitative force in the neighborhood, remarking that the author of an anonymous, anti-restoration flyer had selected, with no substantiating evidence, “one of the older, established combines of the Hill” (the Restoration Society) for the role of ‘White Octopus.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144213479323">39</xref></sup> Phillip Ridgely’s letter to the editor of the national magazine <italic>City</italic>, where an in-depth article on the conflict between CECO and the CHRS was published in its August–September issue of 1970, pursued a similar theme. Ridgley described CECO and Sam Smith as “bomb-throwers” who “have accomplished nothing for the community, black or white.” He went on to describe his own position in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>I have been resident on the Hill since 1964 and find that it is probably the most liberal group in the metropolitan area. That’s why I get so disgusted when I read articles about those who have done so much to renew this urban area, depicted as some sort of white conspiracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144213479323">40</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While some of those who had sympathy for the restoration trend and its aims also acknowledged some of its negative unintended consequences, most of those active within the restoration and preservation societies were generally unable or unwilling to link the success and goals of the movement to a culturally specific set of values based in private property. Yet there is little doubt that such concerns lay behind many of the activities pursued by the CHRS and like-minded groups. The difficulty for self-conscious liberals such as Ridgely was in accepting that their good intentions and good work might imply something quite different for other groups. On the other hand, activists in groups such as CECO were not satisfied to criticize the system of private land tenure and its often perverse incentives, which were at the heart of the problem they identified. They also fingered the villains who they believed were deliberately exploiting that system for their own gain. It was a clash of perspective and social position that resulted in mutual incomprehension. Misunderstanding across this political and cultural divide acted as an impediment to the development of the inclusive and diverse community that many had hoped for around 1960 as the neighborhood embarked on the process of transformation and renewal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144213479323">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>So even as the culture of restoration adopted a more forthright, liberal posture as time went on, the sense of social privilege and the naturalization of propertied entitlement remained imprinted within the movement. In 1970, a decade after Mrs. McCain’s turn at displaying her home, the kind of unselfconscious privilege that she exuded in her comments to the newspaper reporter would not have found its way into the publicity material for the event. Nevertheless, the imprint of political and cultural elites was strong in the restoration and preservation movement and would not easily be displaced. In fact, the elite lineage was quite easily incorporated into an admiration for picturesque social diversity. After all it was not privilege that urban pioneers, brownstoners, and other back-to-the-city types of the late 1960s and 1970s were against. It was standardization, technical rationality, and mass society that they disapproved. Adherents of the restoration trend reviled two images of modern life in particular: the mass-market, middle-class suburb and the modernist, high-rise urban renewal project. A taste for the past and for the exotic was what distinguished restorationists in Capitol Hill, and elsewhere in inner-city Washington, from their functionally oriented urban and suburban contemporaries who embraced what critics such as Jane Jacobs at the time referred to as the “mass way of life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144213479323">42</xref></sup> A shared distaste for this supposedly homogenized “mass way of life” bound the inner-city restoration movement into a coherent whole and underpinned its great success even though its constituent parts were complex and varied. At the same time, that sense of cultural difference from suburbanites did not necessarily bring the restorationists any closer to their mostly black, urban neighbors. Many poorer blacks either did not own property or could no longer afford to keep it when it was located in or near the most “successful” restoration districts. Over time, the line between the propertied and the propertyless expressed itself in Capitol Hill and a handful of other central city districts as a race line, just as it had in Georgetown. One implication of this has been that the entitlements of history, at least in so far as they are conceived by the restoration and preservation societies, today belong disproportionately to prosperous whites.</p>
