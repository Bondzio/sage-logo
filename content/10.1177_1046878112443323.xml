<p>Playing video games has become a very popular form of entertainment. Besides fun, games may also offer players a chance to take on new roles and experience worlds in which they can (collectively) learn to solve problems. Having recognized the power of video games as an instructional medium, designers are now increasingly creating games for educational purposes. Very different from the brightly packaged drill-and-practice software of the past, these games offer something new to learners: entire worlds in which they can actively participate, where what they know is directly related to what they are able to do and who they become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046878112443323">Gee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878112443323">Gee &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>). Their deployment enables social interaction and role-play, personalized and experiential learning, and learner empowerment through increased interactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046878112443323">Scopes, 2009</xref>). This game genre holds potential for lifelong learning as it <italic>can</italic> support the acquisition of higher order skills in a more effective, efficient, and attractive way when compared with common alternatives like excursions or classroom teamwork. Such alternatives usually offer less freedom of time, place, and pace, and demand a high tutor load during exploitation with large student numbers. The development of contemporary serious games is more costly than is the case for these alternatives, but adequate instrumentation for game development could largely resolve this inefficiency. When we talk about multiuser immersive learning scenarios (ILS), we refer to serious games that are centered around authentic tasks, that provide artificial and/or real environments that challenge and make learners curious, that have appropriate and unambiguous outcome goals, and provide learners with clear, constructive, and encouraging feedback. Authentic tasks are immersive in nature and enable the acquisition of higher order skills in higher education (HE), often involving collaboration between learners.</p>
<p>Many developers choose general purpose software to downsize the costs of multiuser ILS-development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046878112443323">Kapp &amp; O’Driscoll, 2010</xref>). However, existing virtual worlds, game development platforms, and game engines appear to only partly cater for the proliferation of multiuser ILS. As software engineers tend to overemphasize technical utilities that can only be used by software experts, the resulting game frameworks are often inadequately tuned toward learning. In addition, they often have steep learning curves for both learners and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878112443323">De Freitas, Rebolledo-Mendez, Liarokapis, Magoulas, &amp; Poulovassilis, 2010</xref>). Most attempts by software engineers to develop instrumentation for fast and easy development of multiuser ILS are still in the requirements analysis stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878112443323">Hu’s (2010)</xref> recent work seems more dedicated toward multiuser ILS, using Unified Modeling Language (UML) to illustrate the structure and intrinsic relations of the various subsystems. Nevertheless, his rather abstract, high-level perspective toward suitability for all game genres and its systems engineering approach might prevent an easy uptake by educational experts. Furthermore, as existing game frameworks often lack logging facilities, they impede research on the actual effects of multiuser ILS. Aforementioned shortcomings hinder the uptake of multiuser ILS. An easy to use and adapt, as well as extendible assembly of software components will be needed to develop affordable multiuser ILS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046878112443323">Law &amp; Kickmeier-Rust, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046878112443323">Michael &amp; Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1046878112443323">Moreno-Ger, Burgos, Martínez-Ortiz, Sierra, &amp; Fernández-Manjón, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is a challenge to define and assemble a flexible architecture to cater for the fast and easy development of multiuser ILS. Such development entails pedagogical and game design, content authoring, and multiuser ILS-deployment. Developing multiuser ILS often requires interdisciplinary teamwork to balance pedagogical and gaming principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046878112443323">Killi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046878112443323">Salen &amp; Zimmerman, 2004</xref>). The architecture requires authoring and deployment of mechanisms for personalization and contextualization. Furthermore, it should enable evidence-based research into guidelines for designing and developing effective and efficient multiuser ILS.</p>
<p>This study describes software architectures that fulfill three aims:</p>
<list id="list1-1046878112443323" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>to develop multiuser ILS,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to swiftly and easily develop multiuser ILS, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to enable research into multiuser ILS.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The article is structured as follows: First, considerations and characteristics of multiuser ILS are clarified (“Multiuser ILS—Characteristics and Considerations”). Next, the method for this study is described (“Method Identifying Suitable Multiuser ILS-Architectures”): requirements, selection criteria, blue print, and a mapping for multiuser ILS-architectures. These architectures also enable research into multiuser ILS. Finally, the concluding section (“Conclusion and Discussion”) resumes the method and its limitations, sketches the current state of the art in multiuser ILS-development, and includes some suggestions for multiuser ILS-research.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the method described in this study can be applied for another set of ILS or different genre of serious games. Of course, this would lead to a different set of game genre characteristics, to a different blue print and other outcomes for adequate software architectures. Indeed, before actually starting to develop and deploy specific games, one should critically examine what kind of games one wants to use and in which specific contexts. Although a lot of taxonomies for game genres exist, these are heavily disputed; categories tend to blur as new genres include characteristics from several others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878112443323">Aldrich, 2005</xref>). It is recommended to articulate own characteristics and link them to existing research. The next section describes this process for <italic>our</italic> definition of the ILS-genre in which authentic tasks play a key role.</p>
<sec id="section1-1046878112443323">
<title>Multiuser ILS—Characteristics and Considerations</title>
<p>Multiuser ILS enables participants to learn by experiencing, exploring, practicing, and reflecting when actively engaged in collaborative and playful learning. In this, they can have huge, but manageable learner control. Educational content should be at the heart of serious game-play, so that learners can use knowledge and apply skills while playing in a carefully designed learning environment. This concurs with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046878112443323">Driscoll’s (2005)</xref> view on effective instruction in virtual worlds. According to this view, learning should take place through exploration and reflection, be embedded in an environment where learners interact through role-play, and be proactive and collaborative with learners testing and comparing multiple perspectives, and simulates real life in authentic contexts (through real world activities, behaviors, actions, and events). By including collaboration in the learning scenario, multiuser ILS will transform learners and learning in three ways:</p>
<list id="list2-1046878112443323" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>transforming a participant from a passive recipient to an empowered actor,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>transforming content from information that learners have to remember to a tool that learners can apply to reach certain targets, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>transforming context from an assurance that “this knowledge will be relevant in the future” to an actual reality where learner’s actions have immediate consequences.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Important learning theories that justify multiuser ILS are <italic>experiential learning</italic> and <italic>inquiry-based learning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046878112443323">Dewey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046878112443323">Kolb, 1984</xref>). Both emphasize the need for (simulations of) realistic experiences within inspiring learning environments while executing authentic tasks. Exploring and reflecting on phenomena, testing hypotheses and constructing objects, and learning by doing and reflecting are basic characteristics of these learning experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046878112443323">Dewey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046878112443323">Kebritchi &amp; Hirumi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046878112443323">Kolb, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>A central concept in <italic>our</italic> definition of multiuser ILS is <italic>authenticity</italic>. This concept is represented in authentic tasks and their characteristics: dealing with real world problems, necessity to collaborate and reflect, offering competing solutions and diversity of outcomes, involving different perspectives, and being complex and ill defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046878112443323">Herrington, Oliver, &amp; Reeves, 2003</xref>). Authenticity in ILS is foremost determined by the fidelity of the tasks themselves and not by the fidelity of the task environment. Authenticity largely depends on the <italic>suspension of disbelief</italic> involved. The poet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878112443323">Coleridge (1817)</xref> suggested that if a writer could bring “human interest and a semblance of truth into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgment concerning the implausibility of the narrative.” In other words, authenticity is largely determined by its recipients, and their opinion should be that they are indeed dealing with authenticity. Learners solve authentic problems in an environment that might need high fidelity to invoke adequate and meaningful learning experiences.</p>
<p><italic>Fidelity</italic> refers to how something relates to its real counterpart: How close does the experience resemble real life? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046878112443323">Stone (2008)</xref> proposes a fidelity model with three areas: environment (3D), task, and user interactivity. How lifelike an environment appears does not seem that important, except for simulations of phenomena. Many multiuser ILS can do without such simulations. ILS-tasks need high fidelity: They are authentic. Finally, the lifelikeness of user interactivity is important if acquiring motor skills is essential, which is rarely the case within multiuser ILS. Although the lifelike of the environment is often unimportant, 2D/3D can easily simulate the Virtual World (VW) in which the user is a key player. Positioning learners in VW-alike settings with the possibility to change camera position and orientation will enhance their presence and increase vividness of the experience.</p>
<p><italic>Vividness</italic> describes the impact of the environment on our senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1046878112443323">Steuer, 1992</xref>). Incorporating more senses intensifies the experience and may influence retention of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1046878112443323">Wood, 2004</xref>). Little evidence of learning benefits is available that can be attributed specifically to 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046878112443323">McFarlane, Sparrowhawk, &amp; Heald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878112443323">McLellan, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878112443323">Dalgarno and Lee (2010)</xref> intended to isolate the distinguishing characteristics of 3D in Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and their potential learning benefits. They argue that representation fidelity (3D) along with interactivity will lead to more immersion, and consequently a strong sense of (joint) presence. Nowadays, 3D becomes more affordable and better matches the users’ expectations who now experience 3D leisure games. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878112443323">De Freitas et al. (2010</xref>, p. 78) point out that “There is evidence that regular gamers find the graphics of virtual worlds too low level, and can experience negative transfer as a result,” and as a consequence, 2D/3D seems indispensable for multiuser ILS. VWs provide a rich space for constructivist learning, facilitating more learner engagement than most online courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878112443323">Cheal, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned before, authentic tasks in multiuser ILS often need to contain elements of collaboration through communication affordances. Richer and more effective collaborative learning can be facilitated by text, voice, emoticons, and gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878112443323">Dalgarno &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>). Different levels of ILS-communication are (a) within ILS (influencing ILS-flow and learning flow within ILS), (b) alongside ILS (influencing learning flow within ILS), and (c) about ILS (influencing “off-topic” learning flow).</p>
<p>Central to the concept of <italic>immersiveness</italic> is the level of involvement and commitment: active and interactive <italic>participation</italic> in learning through affordances for increased <italic>interaction</italic>. ILS are preferably deployed in a VW-alike manner since this offers rich opportunities for interaction and community sense, which both enhance learning engagement and reduce negative feelings to drop out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1046878112443323">Wallace &amp; Maryott, 2009</xref>). Immersion is the state where you cease to be aware of your physical self. It is often accompanied by intense focus, distorted sense of time, belief in the (fantasy) context, and effortless action. Participation means acting with objects or—more often—with a group of learners who communicate and negotiate together as they would do in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046878112443323">Hummel et al., 2011</xref>). Such virtual collaboration often results in artifacts (e.g., business plan, product design, film). Interaction refers, for example, to communication, and control of environment and objects. Interaction is conditional for engagement that in turn is conditional for immersion. The optimal learning state is that of being in <italic>flow</italic>: a mental state of immersion and clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878112443323">Csikszentmihalyi, 1990</xref>). Please note that immersiveness and flow are not sufficient for characterizing multiuser ILS. Just to mention a few examples, really immersive—but not ILS because it does not deal with authentic tasks—might be using a first-person shooter for the automation of multiplication tables or playing Tetris® to practice mental rotation. It is of utmost importance to orchestrate adaptation of separate ILS-elements so that learning goals can be reached by continuous flow (i.e., the optimal learning state).</p>
<p><italic>Adaptation</italic> can foster transfer through immersed higher order learning. Learner preferences, learning style, presentation diversity, and more contextualization are supposed to lead to deeper and more meaningful learning. Improved transfer of knowledge and skills to real situations can be achieved through contextualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878112443323">Clark &amp; Mayer, 2008</xref>). Motivation is the fuel to maintain self-directed learning. Several studies have shown that three factors contribute to motivation: autonomy (self directed), mastery (the urge to get better), and purpose (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046878112443323">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in line with the previous paragraph, ILS often nurture users’ <italic>identity</italic>: How does the user present and see himself through embodied actions and social actions within the learning environment? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878112443323">Gunter, Kenny, &amp; Vick, 2008</xref>). Social presence is thought to make learning more of a human experience. The use of avatars for representation can increase a learner’s sense of social presence and allows them to engage with immersive experiences with a greater sense of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878112443323">De Freitas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046878112443323">Nowak &amp; Biocca, 2004</xref>). In such a context, learners learn how to investigate and pose solutions, and learn what it means to <italic>be</italic> a scientist, historian, and so on when resolving meaningful dilemmas. Rather than working on problems in which they must imagine the implications of their decisions, learners actually experience the consequences of their own actions themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046878112443323">Barab, Gresalfi, &amp; Arici, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The opportunity to create learning environments being safe, ethical, and not possible in real life hints at the enormous potential of multiuser ILS. Studying cell behavior, walking inside a volcano, abstractions in microworlds can be part of multiuser ILS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878112443323">Cheal (2009</xref>, p. 1) contests, “Students in a virtual world can actively create their own projects as three-dimensional environments without the restrictions of gravity, scale, economics, identity, or distance.”</p>
<p>Aforementioned multiuser ILS-characteristics and affordances (i.e., multiuser ILS-qualities that allow a user to do specific actions) can be summarized as:</p>

<p>This study consists of six steps and results in several candidate architectures for multiuser ILS. First, the characteristics of multiuser ILS determined the requirements for architectures for multiuser ILS. Second, these requirements were condensed into a blueprint of a multiuser ILS-architecture. Third, 10 selection criteria for multiuser ILS-architectures were identified. Fourth, a first sifting of candidates removed technically nonviable candidates. For this sifting, documentation on websites, manuals, and studies about the candidates were used. Fifth, the four most important selection criteria, aforementioned documentation, and the blueprint were used to evaluate remaining candidates (about 90). The goal was a second sifting of candidates that would be subjected to a more detailed inspection by having them installed and tested. Preferred candidates could cover a range of the blueprint. Sixth, the four most promising combinations for multiuser ILS-architectures were chosen. Steps 7 and 8 can further constrain these to one architecture to be used within research, but these steps were not yet conducted.</p>
<p>While mapping candidates onto the components of the blueprint, we gained more insight about the extent to which they could cover the whole architecture. Not surprisingly, during mapping, several gaps were identified either because no candidate did meet the criteria or—even worse—because there were no easy-to-integrate candidates for some components at all. Interchangeable alternatives could also be identified.</p>
<sec id="section3-1046878112443323">
<title>Step 1: Requirements Multiuser ILS-Architecture</title>
<p>Requirements can be functional or nonfunctional (e.g., performance, quality standards). Three generic requirements were identified. A first generic requirement is to focus on a technically reliable, easily extendible <italic>components-based</italic> architecture with adequate performance. Using services for integrating candidates seemed a better option than starting from scratch. We accepted that candidates might not already meet all requirements, but that it would be feasible to adapt them accordingly. A second generic requirement is to look for a single architecture that integrates various technical approaches, and preferably is also usable for mobile platforms. Software developers often prefer to do the technical setup via dedicated installers: Which components are needed, and how should these work together? Finally, a third generic requirement was that the architecture should support data robustness. Existing content should be safeguarded from future technology changes. Preferably, all that needs to be created after such changes is a new interface or, at worst, an export and translation of the XML-definition of the ILS into a new format.</p>
<p>Hereafter, the implications of the three aims of this study toward more specific requirements for the ILS-architecture are given.</p>
<sec id="section4-1046878112443323">
<title>Aim 1: Development of multiuser ILS</title>
<p>Evidently, the resulting architecture should enable to produce and procure ILS. These requirements are nurtured by looking at the earlier described characteristics for multiuser ILS (see “Multiuser ILS—Characteristics and Considerations,” last paragraph). Here, the requirements are restricted to ILS-deployment as ILS-authoring requirements will be treated later (see Aim 2).</p>
<p>Most salient requirements for an architecture for multiuser ILS-architecture are that it:</p>
<list id="list4-1046878112443323" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>should support various means of communication and collaboration,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>should enable a variety of adaptation (personalization and contextualization) means, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>should include VW-alike functionality (2D) and might sometimes need 3D.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1046878112443323">
<title>Aim 2: Swift and easy development of multiuser ILS</title>
<p>The architecture in itself is to a large extent pedagogic-agnostic. It should be flexible and enable swift and easy usage by pedagogical experts. Development of multiuser ILS encompasses different stakeholders that use several editors for authoring. Subject matter experts might model their domain and identify domain assets (resources). Instructional designers might use a story-editor and level-editor to specify learning flow for various ILS-roles (playing or nonplaying characters). Furthermore, they might specify pedagogical rules for several kinds of (embedded) learner support or emergent learner support (Artificial Intelligence rules [AI rules]). Other adaptation rules can incorporate storyline assets (in-world artifacts), probably produced by graphical designers. Subject matter experts and instructional designers often work closely together as multiuser ILS are interspersed with pedagogy and domain assets. It should be possible to integrate different types of authoring output. Authors should be able to deploy, test, and modify a multiuser ILS-scenario with various ILS-roles. Software developers are preferably not needed during authoring. However, they should be able to derive and built scenario templates from existing ILS to further streamline the authoring. This will be based on logging data. In addition, authors should be able to easily repurpose, maintain, and reuse existing ILS. In sum, various high-level editors are needed in which multiuser ILS-content can be produced, enriched, tested, and examined for improvements.</p>

<title>Aim 3: Enable research into multiuser ILS</title>
<p>Although some research shows multiuser ILS-capabilities to improve learning outcomes, it is often unclear <italic>why</italic> (and how) multiuser ILS do achieve this. A comprehensive and systematic overview of mechanisms that drive multiuser ILS-effectiveness is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1046878112443323">Ritterfeld, Cody, &amp; Vorderer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046878112443323">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). Because of this, there is too much uncertainty regarding transfer effects: Does better within-multiuser ILS-performance also lead to equivalent real-world behavior (outside ILS)?</p>
<p>Users’ actions (overt or covert) should be traced and subjected to analysis of logging data. This can inform design and provide feedback to optimize the flow and learning within multiuser ILS. The architecture needs various means to gather such personal user data without interfering or even disturbing the user experience. In sum, the architecture should enable gathering user data for research into multiuser ILS.</p>

<sec id="section7-1046878112443323">
<title>Step 2: Blueprint for Multiuser ILS-Architecture</title>
<p>The requirements are reflected in the architectural blueprint for multiuser ILS. This is <italic>not</italic> a static picture, but evolves over time if new insights and functionalities become available. The blueprint is used for searching candidates and mapping. Different stakeholders will use the ILS-architecture: end users (learners-teachers), authors, administrators, and software developers. The ILS-architecture entails three main parts: (a) ILS-deployment, (b) authoring, and (c) authorization and matchmaking (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1046878112443323">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1046878112443323">3</xref>). ILS-deployment is divided into (1a) representation, (1b) communication (interaction between end users), and (1c) ILS-engines (calculating adaptation). The depicted sizes of all aforementioned parts are only meant to present a basic graphical structure.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1046878112443323-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>The three main parts of the ILS-architecture and their users are described below.</p>
<p><italic>ILS-deployment</italic> aims at end users actually involved in learning and will support activities in one or more ILS-roles.</p>
<p>The part <italic>authoring</italic> constitutes of components that can be used by various authors, like instructional designers, subject matter experts, or graphical designers. End users during deployment can often also do some “authoring”. Theoretically, ILS-deployment could even encapsulate all authoring. However, this seems unlikely to happen soon, which is reflected by the dotted arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1046878112443323">Figure 2</xref> from “ILS-deployment” to “authoring,” indicating a rather weak relation.</p>
<p>The part <italic>authorization and matchmaking</italic> is used by administrators who define which end user can access which ILS-instance, in which ILS-role(s), in which time frame, and so on. If learners themselves can choose or change ILS-roles, a connection from “ILS-deployment” to “authorization and matchmaking” is needed. Administrators can also have tasks like system maintenance by creating backups, monitor system stability, and examining error log files.</p>
<p>Finally, software developers should have a negligible role during ILS-development, but are crucial in developing, configuring, maintaining, and improving the ILS-architecture. Several components support them in doing this. For example, an ILS might need different engines for doing computations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1046878112443323">Figure 3</xref>). A (interpreting) programming language can enhance various engines, and even combine or sequence them using data on user’s progress.</p>
<sec id="section8-1046878112443323">
<title>Technical setup—requirements</title>
<p>In the multiuser technical setup, users can connect by means of a hosting server or location service for matchmaking (i.e., who plays with whom). Users can also interact by communication means like chat. The (mobile) device for ILS-deployment is a simple player, whereas major components controlling the ILS are server located. This eliminates portability issues as one can control the server type independent of connected client types.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1046878112443323">Figure 3</xref> shows a more detailed ILS-architecture. For reasons of brevity and simplicity, only one authoring component is illustrated and described in more detail: the “model-editor.” This example also clarifies the approach and possible issues at specific component requirements. With the model-editor, an author specifies the simulation model(s) that learners can use. The model-editor results (i.e., resources) are transferred to the component “resource management,” from which it will be consumed and interpreted by the component “model-solver” in the ILS-engines-part. This can induce triggers at other ILS-engines (e.g., state machine). Model solvers usually contain the core calculation model that could range from a complex set of (partial) differential equations down to simple calculations. Ideally, such a component could solve an external set of (textual) formulas like in MathCAD®. Using a component to solve externally defined sets of equations prevents the need to fully program the model and makes model changes much easier. Fruitful approaches could be using Mathematica, .Net/Link of J/Link bridges between, respectively, .Net and Java, or to use Matlab Builder NE that compiles Matlab programs into .NET components. Alternatively, using discrete simulations will allow learners to participate more easily and to understand the underlying models through visualization. Unfortunately most of them (e.g., SimQuest, Powersim, and NetLogo) are stand-alone applications and are therefore not suited to be embedded within programming languages such as C# or Java enabling dynamic models.</p>

<sec id="section9-1046878112443323">
<title>Step 3: Selection Criteria for Multiuser ILS-Architecture</title>
<p>As a third step in the method, literature, (generic) requirements, and about a dozen experts were consulted to derive a first set of selection criteria for a blueprint ILS-architecture using existing candidates. These criteria were subsequently presented to another small group of experts (<italic>n</italic> = 6, equal number of software developers and instructional designers) at the Open University of the Netherlands (OUNL). They were asked to individually rank the criteria provided and to mention some additional criteria themselves. Criteria are shortly described before presenting their ranking results.</p>
<list id="list5-1046878112443323" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>a. supports multiuser ILS</p></list-item></list>
<p>ILS were typified by keywords mentioned in the last paragraph of the section “Multiuser ILS—Characteristics and Considerations.” ILS for each domain (topic) should be feasible. This criterion equals the first aim of this study: development of multiuser ILS.</p>
<list id="list6-1046878112443323" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>b. supports (personalized and contextualized) learner support</p></list-item></list>
<p>Learner support can be embedded, provided by peers or self (e.g., via monitoring, awareness). Strictly speaking, this criterion is covered by criterion (a), but as adequate learner support is seen as the educational glue of ILS, it seemed worthwhile to mention it apart.</p>
<list id="list7-1046878112443323" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>c. technical openness</p></list-item></list>
<p>Technical openness is dealt with by software developers and indicates that the architecture is easy to integrate, and adapt or extend by appropriate testing and debugging facilities, control-variables configuration, or user management, for example, easy integration with existing VLE’s/Learning Management Systems (LMSs). This criterion encapsulates the third aim of this study: enable research into ILS.</p>
<list id="list8-1046878112443323" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>d. easy authoring</p></list-item></list>
<p>Authoring is primarily done by pedagogy experts (e.g., instructional designers and subject matter experts). They should be able to specify pedagogical adaptation rules, author simulations (either model, or world), have easy authoring-preview for multiuser scenario development and testing. This criterion equals the second aim of this study: swift and easy ILS-development.</p>
<list id="list9-1046878112443323" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>e. user experience</p></list-item></list>
<p>The criterion of user experience was considered to involve (a) usability (easy to use by end users), (b) performance (acceptable), and (c) scalability (till 50 end users simultaneously); (a), (b), and (c) are dependent. This criterion confirms with the first generic requirement.</p>
<list id="list10-1046878112443323" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>f. standards compliant</p></list-item></list>
<p>SOAP, REST, Web-based. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) provides access to remote objects. SOAP provides the envelope for sending Web Services messages over the Internet. Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. This criterion confirms with the first and third generic requirement.</p>
<list id="list11-1046878112443323" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>g. high sustainability</p></list-item></list>
<p>The architecture technology should have a broad range of implementations and offer good support for software developers and authors, for example, through large and active communities (developers-authors), good documentation, workshops, and so on. There should be made use of proven technology (stability). Mentions further developments involving large and active communities/partners. This criterion is common sense.</p>
<list id="list12-1046878112443323" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>h. development platform—technical framework</p></list-item></list>
<p>Preferably C#, not C, C++, or other less common programming languages. The target platform at least PC, preferably also PDA/Smartphone. This criterion confirms with the second generic requirement and shows a preference for somewhat easier and more common programming languages.</p>
<list id="list13-1046878112443323" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. sources available (not necessarily open source)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Adequate resources are needed to assist software developers understand the configuration, maintenance, and improvement. This criterion confirms with several generic requirements.</p>
<list id="list14-1046878112443323" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>j. costs</p></list-item></list>
<p>Total cost of ownership: licenses, support, professionalization—recurring or not.</p>
<p>Respondents did not add other selection criteria. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046878112443323">Table 1</xref> presents group ranks of aforementioned criteria. This outcome might be representative for institutions already inclined to apply and research ILS in their educational offerings. However, other institutions in HE might use different weights or even different criteria because their ILS-policy and staffing is quite different from the OUNL.</p>

<title>Step 4: Search Candidates and First Sifting</title>
<p>A first sifting of candidates enabled us to remove the technically nonviable candidates. Documentation on websites, manuals, and studies were used to search and sift candidates for this fourth step (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046878112443323">De Freitas, 2008</xref> and the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1046878112443323">appendix</xref>). Installing and testing all candidates (more than 500) was clearly unfeasible. It was decided that candidates were technically nonviable if there (a) was not yet a 1.0-version, (b) was not a recent question-answering discussion, (c) was an outstanding unanswered question for a long time, (d) were no recent bug fixes, or (e) was made use of an atypical—seldom used—programming language. Furthermore, it seemed that several candidates had been acquired by other companies. Such candidates were also judged as technically nonviable, although they would better be qualified as “not existing anymore.” Finally, if candidates could only cover a very small part of the blueprint, it seemed too time-consuming and costly to make them technically viable.</p>

<p>Although no candidate had a satisfying score on goodness of fit on the blueprint, some combinations resulted in acceptable scores. Most candidates could not ideally cover the part “authorization and matchmaking,” but this can easily be covered by existing LMS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1046878112443323">Figure 4</xref> shows a mapping from EMERGO on the blueprint. Rastered rectangles indicate that a candidate does not ideally cover components’ functionality. Filled rectangles indicate that the candidate ideally covers—some parts of—components’ functionality. The picture should not be seen in a strict sense in that filled rectangles exactly cover the underlying sub components, but as a rough indication for the size of the part for which the underlying component is ideally covered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1046878112443323">Figure 5</xref> adds all other chosen candidates showing their strengths and weaknesses, and—maybe even more important—identifies the gaps that justify new software development for certain components.

Taking the equal criteria scores from this quartet into account, 3D-Gamestudio and DX-studio are crossed out. Caspian Learning is crossed out as this cannot address multiuser ILS and hardly offers technical openness.

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>This study followed the first six steps of the method described, showing the potential of components-based architectures for both swift development of multiuser ILS and enabling ILS research. After applying the characteristics of multiuser ILS to determine requirements for multiuser ILS-architectures (Step 1), such requirements were used to identify a blueprint for a multiuser ILS-architecture (Step 2). Ten selection criteria for multiuser ILS-architectures were identified (Step 3). We used these criteria for a first sifting of candidates by using documentation on websites, manuals, and studies about the candidates, removing technically nonviable candidates (Step 4). The four most important selection criteria, aforementioned documentation, and the blueprint were used to evaluate the remaining candidates for a second sifting using a more detailed inspection by actually installating and testing them (Step 5). Preferred candidates were required to cover all the components of the blueprint. While mapping candidates onto blueprint components, interchangeable alternatives, but also several gaps, were identified either because no candidate met the criteria, or—even worse—because no easy-to-integrate candidates were available for some components. In the final step, the four most promising combinations for multiuser ILS-architectures were identified as (a) Unity, EMERGO, (b) Unity, EMERGO, Blender, (c) SecondLife/OpenSim, EMERGO, and (d) SecondLife/OpenSim, EMERGO, Blender (Step 6).</p>
<p>Although current solutions are not yet ideal, they provide a proof of concept to guide further articulation of a flexible multiuser ILS-architecture. A follow-up to the current study is needed to gradually develop ILS-examples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1046878112443323">Figure 1</xref>). Such examples can be used for extending and improving the multiuser ILS-architecture and could ultimately lead to a single multiuser ILS-architecture. Alternatively, one could first aim at a single multiuser ILS-architecture by performing Steps 7 and 8 (Phase II). Furthermore, research pilots focusing on multiuser ILS-learning outcomes where learners will use such ILS-examples are needed (Phase III). The outcomes of such design-based research will influence further development of the multiuser ILS-architecture. In the future, new and easy to embed technological developments (like smart objects, emotion detection, speech-to-speech translation) will be incorporated in these architectures.</p>
<p>A first limitation of the current study is that it will not lead to longstanding and generic solutions. On the one hand, development of software for multiuser ILS-architectures will continue, whereas on the other hand future societal-technical developments are somewhat unpredictable. In our view, a solution should have a minimal life span of 3 years to justify investment in development, licenses, and training costs. It is recommended to use various means for scouting ILS-software development (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1046878112443323">appendix</xref>) and consult forecasts by main trend watchers (e.g., Gartner, The New Media Consortium).</p>
<p>A second limitation of the study is that its method and main findings might be partly biased by its respondents (all from OUNL), and their context and view on multiuser ILS. However, the method can be repeated and applied by others taking their context and view on ILS into account. In fact, the main findings from Step 6 are regarded less important than the way in which they were derived. When applying the method from this study, it is recommended to involve different stakeholders (e.g., game and software developers, game and instructional designers, researchers, teachers and trainers, learners and players) as this offers an excellent way of exchanging their expertise and sharing costs in their division of work. A drawback might be that it takes considerable time to gain mutual understanding.</p>
<p>A third limitation of the study is that its method for sifting candidates might lightly favor commercial software over open-source alternatives. Commercial software sometimes pays more attention to their promotion through documentation and helpdesks than open-source software. However, the availability of documentation and helpdesks remains important when searching for easier and faster ILS-development, so as such their availability stays important when sifting alternatives. A recommendation for sifting is that one should not exclude open-source alternatives too early because of sparser documentation than their commercial counterparts.</p>
<p>A final limitation for the findings in this study might be that its respondents were more or less familiar with EMERGO (its development started in 2006). Although it cannot be ruled out that this might have influenced their responses, the findings demonstrate that EMERGO could only partly meet respondents’ own criteria and could only partly cover the blueprint. As mentioned earlier, it should be acknowledged that EMERGO explicitly aims at easy authoring. Other criteria for its development were quite implicit as it should serve many different Dutch educational institutes not specifically interested in or active in serious games development, but working in a broader HE area where acquiring higher order cognitive skills using IT solutions is key.</p>

<p>ILS-design and -development often require a multidisciplinary approach. Especially, game design and instructional design need to move ahead from some misconceptions in both disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878112443323">Gunter et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046878112443323">Kebritchi &amp; Hirumi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878112443323">Shelton &amp; Wiley, 2007</xref>). Creating ILS requires considerable balanced thought and planning at every stage of design and production to match media with appropriate content, integrate and intertwine content closely with game-play, and support learning through carefully crafted feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878112443323">Gunter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046878112443323">Harteveld, Guimarães, Mayer, &amp; Bidarra, 2010</xref>; Law &amp; Kickmeier-Rust, 2009). Developers of educational games contend that immersiveness might ask for more frequent adaptation than on a task-by-task level. ILS have a very strong focus on narrative, and authentic learning tasks are intricately embedded in the game’s narrative. Reordering of tasks would therefore result in a, most probably, implausible rearrangement of narrative plot elements. This needs further research as was conducted in the 80 Days project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eightydays.eu">www.eightydays.eu</ext-link>). Combining ILS-engines for adaptive and interactive digital storytelling seems necessary. This might also improve reusability of ILS-resources, an additional boost for minimizing ILS-development costs.</p>
<p>More and better researched frameworks and more mature easy to use tools will become available to support teachers in applying ILS as part of their daily pedagogical repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878112443323">Aldrich, 2009</xref>). Indeed, this might have a real impact on the current paradigm of organizing formal learning and finally take advantage of the available educational technology. This might lead to more effective and more efficient learning, lower costs, and higher involvement of all stakeholders.</p>

<title>Suggestions for Research of ILS-Applications</title>
<p>The kind and amount of learner support in ILS need optimization to warrant continuous flow. Few is known about how to reach a balance between structured activities and more open-ended explorations. In addition, the social power of ILS needs further exploration (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878112443323">De Freitas et al., 2010</xref>). Research should focus on the rate and efficiency to which within ILS–learned skills are transferred to practical situations. Although there is some face validity that doing something “virtually” will bare relation to this in reality, there appears to be ample room for researching transfer issues when applying knowledge and skills in different, not previously encountered settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046878112443323">De Freitas, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>ILS seem to offer a potentially powerful alternative for the acquisition of higher order skills in an effective, efficient, and attractive way that justifies investment for improving ILS-architectures. One might have higher initial setup costs to enable the execution of activities virtually, but in the long-term repetitive exploitation costs can be minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878112443323">Aldrich, 2009</xref>). Indeed, the motive for using ILS could even be stronger when the initial setup costs could be dramatically reduced. Please note that ILS-deployment can involve some running costs, but can also be a free 24/7 resource for learning.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046878112443323">Bardon and Josserand (2009)</xref> shows that the pedagogical benefits are a prerequisite rather than the core motivation for adoption or implementation of games. This exemplifies that we should argue for multiuser ILS from a combination of various motives (both economic, pedagogical, and for evidence-based research). We feel this would improve the chances for a major breakthrough of ILS. We are looking forward to provide our contribution in this direction, for instance as partner of the recently started Games and Learning Alliance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.galanoe.eu">www.galanoe.eu</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<sec id="section16-1046878112443323">
<title>Examined Alternatives for Second Sifting in Step 5</title>
<p>About 500 alternatives were examined on their suitability for inclusion in the blueprint ILS-architecture by applying the four criteria ranked highest (Step 3). Those alternatives were selected from searches in databases of scientific literature and by searching the web. We used several combinations of search terms, like “architecture,” “games,” “serious games,” “video games,” “virtual worlds,” “game engine,” “game platform,” “game framework,” “educational games,” “instructional games,” “learning games,” ”social games,” “systems,” ”edutainment,” “simulations,” “simulation engine,” “modelling.” Furthermore, visits at various (inter)national conferences addressing serious games, informal talks, attending demo’s, and personal experience with some alternatives could sometimes complement the information from the searches. Additionally, several popular books and magazines about (serious) games development were skimmed for alternatives. Finally, (inter)national mailing lists and newsgroups on serious games were consulted for finding alternatives. Documentation on websites, manuals, and studies were used to examine candidates. Documentation that included rubrics as (a) listed functions and features, (b) demonstrators, and (c) user experiences (from various stakeholders) enabled a faster decision than documentation that missed one or more of such rubrics. In a couple of cases, documentation was very sparse or even completely missing. If there was no documentation, the alternative was excluded for further examination as these alternatives were regarded highly unlikely to pass a second sifting round. Please note that the downsides of this approach are mentioned in the “Conclusion and Discussion” section.</p>
<p>Only 90 of all alternatives are included in this <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1046878112443323">appendix</xref> as the others had at least one “not applicable score” on one the four criteria. It was not always possible nor needed to score all four criteria. Sometimes, information was missing to apply a criterion, or the application of one criterion already indicated that other—already evaluated and similar—candidates were clearly superior to the one under evaluation (indicated by *). Each candidate was examined by, minimally, two reviewers (one technical, one pedagogical).</p>
