<sec id="sec5-1741134312436784"><title>SPC Update</title>
<sec id="sec6-1741134312436784"><title>Medeva/Georgetown (C-322/10 &amp; C-422/10)</title>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312436784"><title>Overview</title>
<p>The issues raised in the decisions of the Court of Justice for the European Union (‘CJEU’) in Medeva/Georgetown relate to supplementary protection certificates (‘SPCs’) on combination medicinal products. In particular, they address situations in which a patent discloses and claims one or more components of an authorised multi-component product, but not all the components of that product. National courts in Europe have not always granted SPC protection to patentees in this situation. It had been argued by vaccine producers, in particular, that they were unfairly penalised by such an approach, as the requirement to provide multi-component products was driven by public health issues rather than any inherent scientific need to combine components together for efficiency. Indeed the Referring UK Court of Appeal noted that: ‘the [vaccine] market is dictated by governments who are continually seeking to combine vaccines where possible. So, there is no market for the patented vaccine if provided on its own and the research costs may not be recovered’.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312436784"><title>Background</title>
<p>Taking Medeva as an example of the scenario, Medeva were granted a European patent for a method for the preparation of an acellular vaccine against <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (whooping cough agent), also known as ‘Pa’. This preparation consisted of a combination of two antigens as active ingredients – pertactin and filamentous haemagglutinin (‘filamentous haemagglutinin antigen’). Medeva filed five SPC applications with the UKIPO, seeking supplementary protection for DTPa-IPV/HIB vaccines covering diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), whooping cough (Pa), poliomyelitis (IPV) and/or meningitis (<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, also known as ‘HIB’). In support of those applications, Medeva submitted marketing authorisations (MAs) granted for a range of medicinal products each of which contained, in addition to the combination of pertactin and filamentous haemagglutinin, multiple other active ingredients.</p>
<p>The UKIPO refused to grant the SPCs. In the case of four of the applications, the SPC application specified a product with more active components or ingredients than were identified in the wording of the claims of the basic patent. The product as a whole was not considered to be protected by the basic patent under Article 3(a) of Regulation 469/2009. As for the fifth application, while the active components or ingredients identified in the patent were the same as those specified in the SPC application (i.e. a combination of pertactin and filamentous haemagglutinin), the MAs submitted in support of that application were not considered to fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 3(b) of the same Regulation since they related to medicinal products containing nine active ingredients, that is to say, vaccines which did not contain only the active components or ingredients specified in the SPC application and in the patent claims.</p>
<p>The CJEU was essentially asked to consider two main issues.
<list id="list1-1741134312436784" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The scope of Article 3(a) of the SPC regulations, namely, what are the criteria for determining whether a product is ‘protected' by a basic patent in force? Is the grant of an SPC precluded if the active ingredient defined in the SPC application is not mentioned in the wording of the claims of the basic patent?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The scope of Article 3(b) of the SPC regulations, namely, what is a ‘valid authorisation' to place the Product on the market as a medicinal product? Can the authorisation of a multi-component product be used as basis for an SPC to a single component of that combination?</p></list-item>
</list></p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134312436784"><title>Judgement</title>
<p>In summary, the CJEU answered the questions above as follows.</p>
<p>For an SPC to be granted to a combination of active ingredients, the active ingredients must be ‘specified in the wording of the claims’. The court, therefore, rejected the so-called ‘infringement test’.<disp-quote>
<p>(C-422/10, ruling): ‘<italic>Article 3(a) of Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products must be interpreted as precluding the competent industrial property office of a Member State from granting a supplementary protection certificate relating to active ingredients which are not specified in the wording of the claims of the basic patent relied on in support of the application for such a certificate’.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, SPCs can be granted for single active ingredients that are authorised for use with other active ingredients.<disp-quote>
<p>(C-422/10, ruling): ‘<italic>Article 3(b) of Regulation … 469/2009 must be interpreted as meaning that, provided the other requirements laid down in Article 3 are also met, that provision does not preclude the competent industrial property office of a Member State from granting a supplementary protection certificate for a combination of two active ingredients, corresponding to that specified in the wording of the claims of the basic patent relied on, where the medicinal product for which the marketing authorisation is submitted in support of the application for a special protection certificate contains not only that combination of the two active ingredients but also other active ingredients’.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Georgetown decision C-322/10 confirms that this principle also allows SPCs to be granted to a single active ingredient where the approved medicinal product is a combination including that active ingredient.</p>
<p>In addition, the CJEU also discussed, as part of its decision, the question of infringement covered by Articles 4 and 5 of the SPC Regulations, namely whether an SPC on a single active would be infringed by sale of a multi-component product containing that active component. The CJEU clarified that an SPC for a single active ingredient will be infringed by sales of a combination drug that contains that same active ingredient.<disp-quote>
<p>[C-422/10 paragraph 39]: ‘<italic>In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation No 469/2009, a SPC thus granted in connection with such a product confers, upon the expiry of the patent, the same rights as were conferred by the basic patent in relation to the product, within the limits of the protection conferred by the basic patent, as provided for in Article 4 of the regulation. Accordingly, if, during the period in which the patent was valid, the patent holder could oppose, on the basis of his patent, all use or certain uses of his product in the form of a medicinal product consisting of such a product or containing it, the SPC granted in relation to that product would confer on the holder the same rights for all uses of the product, as a medicinal product, which were authorised before the expiry of the certificate</italic>’.</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134312436784" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>This decision is notable for the following reasons:
<list id="list2-1741134312436784" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The decision allows a patentee with an SPC on a single active component to prevent sale of a combination product containing that active component.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A patentee can now rely on the marketing authorisation of a combination product to support an SPC application to a single active part of that combination.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is ambiguity in the wording ‘specified in the wording of the claims’, which represents the new requirement under Article 3(a) of the SPC Regulations. Does this test require specific disclosure of the specific active, or will a disclosure of the class of compound be enough? If exact disclosure is required, then there may be a large number of invalid SPCs, granted in situations in which the active is only generically referred to in the claims, or specifically disclosed but not specifically claimed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Medeva decision [para 41] states that ‘<italic>where a patent protects a product, in accordance with Article 3(c) of Regulation No 469/2009, only one certificate may be granted for that basic patent (see Biogen, paragraph 28)’</italic>. It is unclear whether this is a complete prohibition on more than 1 SPC per patent, or whether (as has been the practice after Biogen C-181/95), this limits a patentee to one SPC per product per patent.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec11-1741134312436784"><title>UK supreme court finds neutrokine-A patent does have industrial applicability</title>
<sec id="sec12-1741134312436784"><title>Human Genome Sciences Inc. v Eli Lilly and Co [2011] UKSC 51</title>
<sec id="sec13-1741134312436784"><title>Overview</title>
<p>A recent decision of the UK’s highest court, the Supreme Court (previously the ‘House of Lords’) has given new guidance on the requirement that an invention must have industrial applicability in order to be patentable. It clarifies that where the information in the patent application and common general knowledge combine to show a ‘plausible’ practical use, the requirement of industrial application will be satisfied.</p>
<p>The court allowed Human Genome Science’s (‘HGS’) appeal against the revocation of its patent describing a novel human protein named ‘Neutrokine-a’. Overturning the lower courts, it held that HGS’s patent did satisfy Articles 52 and 57 of the European Patent Convention, which require a patent to be ‘susceptible of industrial application’ which could be of use in ‘any kind of industry’. The court applied the approach of the European Patent Office (EPO) Technical Board of Appeal (TBA) and concluded that the disclosure of the existence and structure of Neutrokine-a and its gene sequence satisfied Articles 52 and 57 since sufficient information was provided in the patent that, when taken with common general knowledge, a plausible practical use could be identified. Neutrokine-a, as a member of the Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) ligand superfamily of cytokines, could be expected (amongst other things) to co-stimulate T-cell proliferation in the same way as all other known members of the family; the family’s effect on inflammation and immune responses was already well known and Neutrokine-a could be expected to share it.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741134312436784"><title>Background</title>
<p>In October 1996, HGS applied for a patent describing the encoding nucleotide, amino acid sequence, and certain antibodies of a novel human protein named Neutrokine-a. The patent was granted by the EPO’s Examining Division in 2005. Eli Lilly and Co opposed the grant in the EPO’s Opposition Division, which duly revoked the patent on the grounds that although it described the encoding for a novel protein, that protein had no known specified function and that HGS’s suggestions for industrial applicability were merely speculative. HGS appealed to the TBA, which referred the case back to the Opposition Division with a directive that the patent be maintained.</p>
<p>In the meantime however, Eli Lilly brought a parallel procedure in the High Court for revocation of the UK part of the European patent. Kitchin J held the patent was invalid. On HGS’s appeal, the Court of Appeal agreed with Kitchin J and upheld the revocation. HGS then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the TBA’s decision had been correct and that their patent should not be revoked.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly's case was that, while HGS had found Neutrokine-a and identified it as a member of the TNF ligand superfamily, this was not sufficient to pass the bar of industrial applicability. Although general knowledge suggested that the protein might be expected to play a role in regulating the activities of B- and T-cells, and play a role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses, no solution to any particular problem was presented. No disease or condition which Neutrokine-a could be used to diagnose or treat, nor any concrete functions, had been identified. Kitchin J commented that the fact that HGS had suggested such a high number of possible uses for their patent suggested that they were not aware of any specific use, and that the patent’s functions were ‘at best, a matter of expectation and at far too high a level of generality to constitute a sound or concrete basis for anything except a research project’.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741134312436784"><title>Judgement</title>
<p>Lord Neuberger noted that the primary issue in the case was ‘the way in which the requirement of industrial applicability … extends to a patent for biological material’.</p>
<p>In the judgement, it was noted that, although the established jurisprudence of the EPO was not binding, national courts should normally follow it unless there was a very strong reason to the contrary; and that while there is little domestic guidance on the application of Articles 52 and 57 for patents in biological material, the TBA has made several decisions on the topic. It was held that in this case, the lower courts had not decided the issue consistently with the EPO’s approach.</p>
<p>Lord Neuberger gave a concise summary of the EPO’s approach to Article 57 in relation to biological material in order to consider this point. He applied in particular the EPO principles that, in the case of a patent disclosing a new protein and its encoding gene, a ‘plausible’ or ‘reasonably credible’ use can suffice for a finding of industrial applicability; that such a finding can be assisted by later evidence; and that the requirements of a plausible and specific possibility of exploitation can be at the biochemical, cellular or biological level. In addition, where that protein is a member of a superfamily all of which have similar specified roles as in this case, then assigning such a role to the protein in question may suffice. Further, the ‘problem to be solved’ by the patent can then be that of isolating a further member of the family, and if the disclosure is important enough for the pharmaceutical industry, then this may suffice for Article 57 even though the protein’s role has not yet been clearly defined.</p>
<p>Lord Neuberger noted that in this case the above principles were applicable. HGS’s patent did disclose a new protein which was a member of a superfamily, all members of which had pleiotropic effects. It could be anticipated that Neutrokine-a would relate to T-cells and be a co-stimulant for B-cell production, as Kitchin J had also noted. Subsequent research on the patent had revealed that this was indeed the case; and finally new members of the superfamily were of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>In the light of the EPO’s principles and taking into account common general knowledge, the court unanimously concluded that the disclosure of Neutrokine-a’s existence and structure, and its membership of the TNF ligand superfamily, should have been sufficient to satisfy Article 57.</p>
<p>Lord Neuberger acknowledged that the findings of the High Court and Court of Appeal had been reasonably based. However, he emphasised that the view he had taken, consistent with the EPO’s jurisprudence, was likewise sensible because it would be wrong to set the burden for patentability too high, as this would ‘cause UK bioscience companies great difficulty in attracting investment at an early stage in the research and development process’.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741134312436784" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>This decision appears to have effectively lowered the bar for satisfaction of Article 57 (although it was noted in the judgement that the matter was fact-sensitive and therefore may be of limited use in other cases). Where new proteins are found, patents can now be applied for at an earlier stage, so long as the patent information combined with common general knowledge shows a plausible possibility of commercial use.</p>
<p>It could be argued that almost any research and development in bioscience will entail some plausibility, and thus that Article 57 will serve only to filter out those applications for patents which are entirely implausible, such as those which break natural laws. Patentability has in either case become a degree more achievable, which will be good news for the biotech industry.</p>
<p>The decision also gives a higher degree of clarity to the amount of detail which a successful patent application requires in terms of the uses the patent may be put to, and confirms the approach of the UK courts in following the lead of European patent law, barring any strong reasons to the contrary.</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1741134312436784"><title>High court grants declaration of non-infringement where infringing product used in the manufacture of imported product</title>
<sec id="sec18-1741134312436784"><title>Ranbaxy (UK) Limited v. AstraZeneca AB, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, London, UK, 15 July 2011, [2011] EWHC 1831 (Pat)</title>
<sec id="sec19-1741134312436784"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This case concerned AstraZeneca’s patent EP 1 020 461, which is to the proton pump inhibitor marketed by AstraZeneca as Nexium. The active ingredient of Nexium is magnesium esomeprazole, and the patent is to magnesium esomeprazole having an optical purity of ≥99.8% enantiomeric excess (e.e). Ranbaxy intended to launch a generic magnesium esomeprazole product. Ranbaxy’s product is manufactured starting from magnesium esomeprazole (≥99.8%), but the final finished product intended for import no longer contained magnesium esomeprazole with that optical purity. The High Court of England and Wales found that Ranbaxy’s product, if imported, would not infringe the patent.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec20-1741134312436784"><title>Background</title>
<p>Ranbaxy wished to import generic magnesium esomeprazole into the UK, and was successful in its application, made in October 2010, for a speedy trial to assess whether its generic product infringed the patent. The trial, which took place in June 2011, examined the issue of infringement only.</p>
<p>There was no dispute that the process for the manufacture, in India, of Ranbaxy’s product, begins with magnesium esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8% e.e. There was also no dispute that the process involved the addition of a quantity of omeprazole racemate such that the finished product no longer contained magnesium esomeprazole of that optical purity, i.e. the pure product enantiomeric product was ‘doped’ with the racemate. In these circumstances, AstraZeneca contended that claim 1 of the patent would be infringed. Claim 1 reads:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>The use of a magnesium salt of (-)-5-methoxy-2[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole ((-)-omeprazole) with an optical purity of ≥99.8% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the manufacture of a medicament for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The claim is what is known as a ‘Swiss-type’ claim, as it follows the form ‘<italic>the use of substance X for the manufacture of a medicament to treat disease Y</italic>.’ Swiss form claims were introduced under the European Patent Convention 1973 to address the exclusion from patentability of methods of treatment of humans or animals.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca relied on the Swiss form claim to argue that the product which Ranbaxy wished to import would be the direct product of a process in which magnesium esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8% e.e. was used to make a medicament for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. AstraZeneca’s case was that the claim was not limited to the manufacture of specific products (i.e. those containing magnesium esomeprazole ≥99.8% e.e.) but extends to the use of the claimed process to make any product used for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Claim 1 describes a process which is used if a magnesium salt of esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8% e.e. is used for the manufacture of a medicament for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion irrespective of whether or not the medicament contains magnesium esomeprazole of the specified purity, or at all.</p>
<p>Ranbaxy, on the other hand, contended that claim 1 was not infringed. Ranbaxy submitted that, construed properly, claim 1 was directed to the process of making a medicament containing magnesium esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8% e.e. and the teaching of the patent is to this effect. Moreover, the skilled person would recognise that claim 1 is a Swiss form claim and that such claims are in substance directed to the protection of a new therapeutic use of a medicament containing a known active compound and it follows that the medicament must contain that compound. The product Ranbaxy wished to import would not contain magnesium esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8 % e.e. The use of magnesium esomeprazole with the claimed purity, as an intermediate during the course of manufacture outside the UK, was irrelevant to infringement.</p>
<p>The matter of infringement therefore depended upon the court’s interpretation of claim 1 of the patent.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec21-1741134312436784"><title>Judgement</title>
<p>The Judge relied on a fundamental principle of English patent law: the question of what the skilled person would have understood the language of the claim to mean, adopting a purposive construction of the claim in the context of the specification. The Judge examined the language of the specification of the patent, and the legal development of Swiss form claims (accepting Ranbaxy’s submission that the skilled person would recognise claim 1 to be a Swiss form claim).</p>
<p>Against this background, the Judge found that the skilled person would generally understand a Swiss form claim to mean that the medicament must contain the active ingredient for which the new and inventive use has been found. This may not always be the case, and will depend upon the construction of the claim. In this case, the skilled person would consider the meaning of claim 1 of the patent to be clear. Recognising the teaching of the specification that magnesium esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8% e.e. was new, the skilled person would nevertheless understand claim 1 to be directed to the use of such magnesium esomeprazole to manufacture a medicament which contains that active ingredient. The Judge noted that there was no suggestion anywhere in the specification of the use of any analogue or derivative of magnesium esomeprazole with an optical purity of ≥99.8% e.e., nor any other active ingredient. The whole teaching of the specification is about the production of optically pure magnesium esomeprazole, its use in particular therapies and its formulation with a conventional carrier.</p>
<p>The Judge further stated that the skilled person’s understanding that the medicament should contain the active ingredient would be reinforced by: (1) their appreciation of the way that patent claims are structured, essentially affording protection for the product claims (if they were to be found invalid for lack of novelty) by including products for use in any therapy claims and Swiss form claims; and (2) their understanding of the word ‘medicament’.</p>
<p>The Judge therefore held that the generic magnesium esomeprazole product that Ranbaxy intended to import would not infringe the patent, and granted Ranbaxy the declaration of non-infringement which they requested.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec22-1741134312436784" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>AstraZeneca’s argument that the Swiss form of claim should be construed to cover the use of the compound as an intermediate was certainly creative. It also had force on the plain meaning of the claim taken in isolation. However, the Judge reached a sensible result by reading the claim in context.</p>
<p>The recent amendments of the European Patent Convention and EPO Guidelines suggest the old Swiss form style of claim should not be used. However, there are likely to be situations in which the patentee is justified in protecting the use of an intermediate during the process of manufacture, in a Swiss-style format.</p>
<p>This case is also notable in that Ranbaxy was able to have the issue of infringement tried quickly in an expedited trial on the basis that it expected to receive marketing authorisation sooner than a normal trial would occur. The English courts are willing to accommodate the commercial realities of generic companies, particularly where the generic company has been proactive in ‘clearing the way’.</p></sec></sec></sec>
