<p>The purpose of this paper is to move beyond the rhetoric of espousing the importance and timeliness of palliative care for the neonatal population, and to explore how what is known can influence health and social policy. A recent Commonwealth of Australia Senate enquiry into palliative care raised concerns about the current lack of specialist perinatal and neonatal palliative care in Australia. Inherent to the difficulties of moving a neonatal palliative care model forwards are the identified barriers to palliative care practice in the clinical setting, which have been well defined. To inform policy, it is imperative that health professionals in the neonatal discipline are knowledgeable about legislative priorities and the public concerns regarding palliative care for neonates. This paper argues that there are several priorities for moving this model of care forwards, which include legislation that supports access to care such as development and funding support of perinatal hospices, continuity of care, caregiver support, research and in particular education for the health care professionals caring for dying babies and their families. To achieve this, we need to set national research priorities that reflect a truly collaborative partnership. It is time to move beyond the rhetoric.</p>

<p>This paper aims to move beyond the rhetoric of espousing the importance and timeliness of a model of palliative care for the neonatal population, and to explore how what is known can influence health and social policy. While this paper is informed by recent events at Australian Government level, the research – empirical and otherwise – and the strong societal voice that informs the need for neonatal palliative care transects borders and nations and therefore has relevance to all westernised countries.</p>
<p>Whilst there have been remarkable achievements in newborn survival and these advances have increased the possibility of sustaining life, there is much that is unknown about both the needs and the care of these critically ill newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987113490713">Field and Behrman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent Commonwealth of Australia Senate enquiry into palliative care in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1744987113490713">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>) invited a submission regarding neonatal palliative care, bringing this neglected aspect of neonatal care to the forefront for the first time in our country. The inquiry received a number of submissions relating to the palliative care needs of foetuses and newborn infants with life-limiting conditions. These submissions raised concerns about the current lack of specialist perinatal and neonatal palliative in Australia. The Senate report recognised this need, and noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Care Recommendation 27: The committee recommends that the Australian government give increased attention to the need for improved research, education and services to support the perinatal and neonatal palliative care needs of health professionals, pregnant women and their families and newborn infants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987113490713">Commonwealth of Australia Senate, 2012</xref>)</p></disp-quote>In recent years, there has been increasing awareness regarding the need for evidence-based neonatal palliative care; yet, despite literature supporting neonatal palliative care practice, and the availability of protocols to inform practice, neonatal palliative care in the clinical environment remains ad hoc.</p>
<p>There are three broad categories of newborns that would benefit from this model of care: newborns born at the limits of viability; newborns born with a lethal anomaly and/or malformation and newborns who have received intensive care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) but for whom this model of care has become inappropriate. These categories of newborns have low rates of survival and high morbidity on the occasions that they do survive, and palliative care may be the best approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113490713">Carter, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987113490713"><title>Locating neonatal palliative care in contemporary practice</title>
<p>‘Together for short lives’ define neonatal palliative care as: ‘ …  an active and total approach to care from the point of diagnosis or recognition, throughout the child’s life, death and beyond. It embraces physical, emotional, social and spiritual elements and focuses on the enhancement of quality of life for the baby and support for the family. It includes the management of distressing symptoms, provision of short breaks and care through death and bereavement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113490713">ACT, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal, therefore, is to facilitate a so-called ‘good death’. A ‘good death’ is defined as one that is ‘ … free from avoidable distress and suffering for patients, families, and care-givers; in general accord with patients' and families' wishes; and reasonably consistent with clinical, cultural, and ethical standards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987113490713">Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2003</xref>, p.39).</p>
<p>In recent years, palliative care for the neonatal population has become increasingly topical and part of the lexicon of contemporary neonatal practice. A protocol has been available for a decade to inform this model of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987113490713">Catlin and Carter, 2002</xref>), yet in reality, provision of palliative care to newborns is ad hoc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987113490713">Cignacco and Zeitschrift-Für, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987113490713">Maginnes, 2002</xref>), and components of this protocol have been difficult to implement. The barriers to a neonatal palliative model of care, however, have been well defined to the point where this knowledge can inform policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987113490713">Kain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987113490713">Kain et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Neonatal palliative care involves active treatment aiming to ensure that newborns receive care in a comfortable environment, free from pain and distressing symptoms, with emotional and practical support for both parents, and health care professionals. When the decision to withhold resuscitation, discontinue resuscitation or forgo other life-supporting treatments are made, compassion for the family and their needs become paramount. This humane and compassionate care should include careful handling of the newborn, maintaining warmth, avoiding invasive procedures and unobtrusive monitoring – such care is sometimes called ‘comfort care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987113490713">MacDonald, 2002</xref>) and this term is used synonymously with palliative care by some authors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987113490713"><title>Moving beyond rhetoric: The difficulties</title>
<p>Inherent to the difficulties of moving a neonatal palliative care model forward are the identified barriers to palliative care practice in the clinical setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987113490713">Kain, 2011</xref>), and include inadequate staffing, an unconducive physical environment, technological imperatives and their judicious use, and unrealistic parental expectations. Although our current health care environment may present significant barriers to neonatal palliative care, these barriers could be overcome if all the health care team were fully committed to a palliative model of care.</p>
<p>Death is a part of life in the NICU, and any health care service provider associated with labour and delivery and the care of newborns would inevitably experience perinatal death and bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987113490713">Leuthner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this, palliative care principles are difficult to apply to neonatology. The social stigma of denying neonatal death coupled with the apparent paradox of providing palliative care in a curative setting present a compelling practical problem. However, it is possible for palliative care to coexist with curative treatment modes because palliative care has become an area of expertise within many other health disciplines, such as in adult intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113490713">Curtis et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, advances in palliative care have not yet been integrated effectively into standard paediatric/adolescent clinical practice, and even less so into neonatal clinical practice. Therefore, the precepts of palliation should be a basic component of the attitudes, knowledge base and practice skills of all health care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987113490713">National Association of Neonatal Nurses 2005</xref>). The previous section suggests that the clinical application of palliative care should be seemingly straightforward. However, when one explores these clinical ideologies in the context of contemporary neonatology, the notion of neonatal palliative care raises a myriad of issues and controversies.</p>
<p>Thirty four per cent of all childhood deaths occur within the neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113490713">Carter, 2004</xref>). It would be a reasonable assumption, then, that when death becomes inevitable for a marginally viable and critically ill newborn, that decisions to prolong suffering be reassessed and a transition to palliative care at least be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113490713">Carter, 2004</xref>). Again, such a rationale is not straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987113490713">Fajardo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113490713">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). This notion necessitates that aggressive, curative treatment be withheld, or withdrawn: yet how does this translate into actual practise? When is it appropriate to withhold or withdraw curative care and, in doing so, what are the needs of the dying newborn, the family and the staff to provide a humane and compassionate death? The literature suggests that confusion exists about what palliative care constitutes, and when – if ever – it is appropriate to withhold aggressive, curative care. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113490713">Catlin’s (1999)</xref> research of neonatologists’ resuscitation practices of extremely low-birth weight (ELBW) preterm newborns, one-fourth of participants stated that withholding resuscitation attempts was not an option for them. Emotive terms such as ‘executing’, ‘killing’ and ‘pulling the trigger’ were used to describe the practice of ‘doing nothing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113490713">Catlin, 1999</xref>, p.271). Attempting resuscitation even on the smallest ELBW foetal-newborns was described as a neutral action for which they were simply trained to do: there was no training in terms of when ‘not to do’. One neonatologist recalled: ‘there’s no one telling you the rules, because there aren’t any rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113490713">Catlin, 1999</xref>, p.271).</p>
<p>There is often difficulty in accepting a palliative model of care in contemporary health care. There is a focus upon curative treatment regimens, with a drive to offer aggressive interventions. This may be because the serious nature of disease is still evolving or perhaps to postpone the acceptance that death has become inevitable. Health care needs to consider when no potentially curative intervention exists, or their benefits have become exhausted. This can lead to a feeling of hopelessness that there is nothing left to offer the newborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987113490713">Craig and Goldman, 2003</xref>). There is a notion of curing at all costs, and it is stated that in acute care settings the purpose of treatment is generally to cure, and it is for this reason that facing the death of a patient and providing palliative care can be ‘uncomfortable’, and engender a sense of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113490713">Davies et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113490713">Hartline, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987113490713">Lo et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Intensive care can be an unpleasant, uncomfortable experience for newborns even when it is appropriate. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1744987113490713">Yu (2005)</xref> a ‘proactive policy to initiate intensive care must take into consideration that a decision to withdraw intensive care might have to be made in selective newborns at a later stage in the course of the newborn’s treatment. In the event that the newborn’s subsequent clinical course indicates that further curative efforts are futile or lack compensating benefit, intensive care should be discontinued and palliative care, which provides symptomatic relief and comfort, should be introduced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1744987113490713">Yu, 2005</xref>, pp.746–747).</p>
<p>At a societal level, death and dying in infancy is driven by high emotional content because the death of a newborn is considered a life that has ended too soon: illness and death are unexpected for a newborn and are devastating and life-altering events for the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744987113490713">Romesberg, 2004</xref>). Society in general does not know how to respond to the death of a newborn, and therefore have few established social norms to help a family cope with such loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987113490713">Contro et al., 2004</xref>). Society more readily accepts deaths of adults and even of children. Complicating these ethical concerns is the notion that the death of a newborn in this highly curative environment is a failure of medical science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987113490713">Lo et al., 1999</xref>). Whilst this highly technical environment saves the lives of newborns, health care needs to provide for the needs of newborns who will die before they leave the hospital. Due to a lack of coordinated interdisciplinary services, dying children are often deprived of the benefits of palliative care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987113490713">Carter et al., 2004</xref>), yet evidence of an increasing societal demand for palliative care provision to the neonatal population is reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987113490713">Conway and Moloney-Harmon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987113490713">Maginnes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987113490713">Romesberg, 2003</xref>;).</p>
<p>Newborns and infants have the highest death rate in the paediatric population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987113490713">Pierucci et al., 2001</xref>). In Australia, 4 out of every 1000 infants die before their first birthday (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113490713">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011</xref>). This is equal to almost 1200 deaths across Australia each year. In the United Kingdom in 2010, the infant mortality rate was 4.3 deaths per 1000 live births. For very low-birth weight babies (under 1500 g) and low-birth weight babies (under 2500 g), mortality rates were 164.9 and 36.8 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987113490713">Office for National Statistics, 2010</xref>). In United States data from 2009, the infant mortality rate was higher, with 6.39 deaths per 1000 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987113490713">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>). Even in developed countries, infancy remains one of the most dangerous periods of human life, and according to one source, the death rate in the first year of life is only exceeded by those over the age of 55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987113490713">Maternal Perinatal and Infant Mortality Committee, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the data sources above, the infant mortality rates are marginally decreasing. However, increasing survival rates are balanced by increasing morbidity issues. Since the escalation of technology and medical advances – including antenatal corticosteroids and postnatal surfactant treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744987113490713">Walther, 2005</xref>) – treatment options for newborn infants have increased, thus enabling health care professionals to provide care to newborns who previously would not have been intubated, or were presumed to be dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987113490713">Pierucci et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Advances in life-sustaining medical technology present ethical concerns with a strong emotional component, including when it is appropriate to withhold or withdraw intensive care therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744987113490713">Walther, 2005</xref>). In Australian children’s hospitals, 85% of deaths occur in intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744987113490713">Stark et al., 2008</xref>), and most have life-sustaining treatment limited or withdrawn in the time leading up to the child’s demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987113490713">Moore et al., 2008</xref>). The figures are similar in newborn intensive care units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744987113490713">Wilkinson et al., 2006</xref>) and the proportion of deaths that follow end-of-life decisions has increased over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987113490713">Moore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987113490713">Ramnarayan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1744987113490713">Weiner et al., 2011</xref>). Despite technological advances, increases in the margins of viability, and highly skilled health care delivery, some newborns will still die in the NICU, often as a result of extreme prematurity and other complex medical problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987113490713"><title>How can what is known inform policy?</title>
<p>To inform, it is imperative that health professionals in the NICU are knowledgeable about legislative priorities and any public concerns regarding palliative care for neonates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987113490713">Childs et al. (2009)</xref> argue that health care professionals cannot function either safely or effectively without an awareness of legislation, meaning that they need to be abreast of the codes of professional conduct from which they operate in their country of practice. There are several priorities for moving this model of care forwards, which include awareness of legislation that supports access to care such as development and funding support of perinatal hospices, continuity of care, caregiver support, research and in particular education for the health care professionals caring for dying babies and their families.</p>
<p>Neonatal palliative care is emotionally and ethically laden: when considering moving this model of care forward from an evidence base, it is useful to remember that health care requires that practitioners speak in ‘two different languages—the language of science with its quantifiable outcomes … as well as the language of people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987113490713">Leight, 2002</xref>, p.109).</p>
<p>The strong societal voice is at the epicentre of social care policy when considering palliative care models for the neonatal population. Opinion in the literature suggests that society perceives medicine as entering an age of ‘miracles’ and ‘wonder’, and this is all upon public display in the NICU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987113490713">Levy Guyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1744987113490713">Tisdale, 2003</xref>). Given these influences, parents often have unrealistic expectations with what can be offered to their child in terms of medical intervention. This may lead to the belief in the ‘medical miracle’ to explain a technological solution for everything (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987113490713">Levy Guyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987113490713">Paris et al., 2000</xref>). Due to reports of these so-called ‘miracle babies’ the public may expect more from the NICU now that some newborns born at 22 weeks gestation have survived. It is expected that modern medicine can save every newborn born beyond this milestone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987113490713">Levy Guyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987113490713">Paris et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987113490713"><title>Recommendations to inform policy</title>
<p>Previous research by one of the authors regarding the barriers to neonatal palliative care as identified by nurses proposed several recommendations to influence policy makers in terms of curriculum development, protocol development and the integration of a palliative model of care into routine neonatal clinical practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987113490713">Kain (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>The recommendations should include:
<list id="list1-1744987113490713" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Involvement of the multidisciplinary team, and not exclusively medical staff, in ethical decision making requires strengthening and team agreement for palliative care would be better facilitated through mediated consensus with such dialogue occurring for each individual case when palliative care is considered a treatment option. This recommendation would assuage much of the conflict that arises due to a lack of consensus at the caregiver level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Staffing levels may be inadequate to recognise the labour intensive aspects and highly specialised needs of providing a palliative model of care. Patient dependency tools should be available to accurately reflect the acuity of babies who are dying, taking into account the psychosocial needs of their parents and family members. These tools need to recognise the labour intensive aspects and specialised needs of providing care to these babies, as well as the emotional support required by parents and families.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Guidelines in use to support the care of dying babies are not necessarily evidence-based. It is recommended that palliative care guidelines for clinical use within Australian neonatal units are based upon evidence, and reflect best practice standards. This is a burgeoning model of care, and an opportunity exists for neonatal clinical leaders and their professional bodies to collaborate and develop nationally endorsed palliative care guidelines for the Australian neonatal population. These should draw upon existing evidence relating to adult and paediatric palliative care, but should also reflect the unique needs of this population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Formal counselling support needs to be made available to caregivers, provided discreetly and without prejudice. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary team should receive organisational support to develop coping skills in providing care to dying babies, thus acknowledging caregiver grief and suffering.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The injudicious use of technological, and pharmacological, support is inhibitory to a palliative model of care, particularly when its use is not clearly delineated. Therefore, recommendations need to be developed that clearly outlines the appropriate use of medical technology when caring for marginally viable and critically ill newborns. Incorporating the parameters of judicious use into evidence-based clinical guidelines will help delineate what interventions constitute a palliative approach, and when such interventions become inappropriate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Parents require additional support to assist them in their decision making role. Evidence-based clinical guidelines need to include information about communicating with the parents of marginally viable and critically ill newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987113490713">Janvier et al., 2012</xref>). Written information for parents, as an adjunct to consistent verbal information, provide a useful platform from which health care professionals can initiate and discuss palliative care options, particularly for individuals who may find the instigation of such dialogue with parents uncomfortable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987113490713">Muthusamy et al., 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Such verbal and written communication should be culturally sensitive and anticipate the questions that parents will have. The unique insight and wisdom of parents who have experienced neonatal death should be involved in the development of this information, as they can provide a unique perspective that would increase the veracity and credibility of such information. Furthermore, providing parents with candid and consistent information allows informed decision making that may mitigate the demands of parents made upon health care staff that everything possible be done to maintain the life of baby who may not survive. However, clinical staff also require organisational support when they are ethically opposed to treatment directions for dying babies. They should be permitted to opt out of taking part in treatment to which they are ethically opposed where this is feasible and does not compromise the care of the newborn and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987113490713">Catlin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744987113490713">Savulescu, 2006</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>Policy directives in the area of caring for marginally viable and critically ill newborns need to be informed by the multiple paradigms and perspectives that inform this area of neonatal practice. This includes an understanding of the psychological, social, cultural, ethical and political dimensions of caring for marginally viable and critically ill newborns. This approach generates breadth of knowledge and a depth of understanding of both nursing and societal perspectives of caring for these babies. The discourse of these perspectives makes an important contribution to the development of our knowledge about palliative care in a neonatal context. The context of providing care to marginally viable and critically ill newborns is emotive, and controversial. Regardless of decisions made on behalf of these newborns, and by whom, there are a myriad of stakeholders affected by these decisions. Ultimately, these stakeholders are represented within society as parents and families, and are buoyed, influenced and even encumbered by the greater influences of societal mores, public opinion and the media.</p>
<p>Health care professionals in the NICU need to continue to strive to improve care for those who are most vulnerable in society, in this context dying babies and their families. Health care professionals and policymakers need to work together to make a difference in the lives of the babies they care for who are approaching the end of life.</p>
<p>By collaborating with families who have experienced neonatal loss in the NICU and engaging with the available research in this area – empirical and otherwise – we can achieve a great deal in moving a model of neonatal palliative care forward.</p>
<p>The health care team in the NICU across settings – clinical practice, education, administration, and research – need to fully embrace neonatal palliative care as a viable option for babies with life limiting conditions who are not expected to survive.</p>
<p>To fully achieve this, we must collaborate with families not only in the direct patient care area, but also in designing curricula for educational programs for the health care team, creating and planning a supportive institutional environment that is conducive to a palliative model of care, and setting national research priorities that reflect a truly collaborative partnership. It is time to move beyond the rhetoric.</p>
