<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433303">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433303"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511433303">3</xref></sup> According to the clinical phenotype, the spectrum may be characterised by a single neurological episode suggestive of MS, when most are considered as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), with a high probability to convert to relapsing–remitting (RRMS), recurrent relapses and primary (PPMS) or secondary progression (SPMS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433303">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433303">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433303">4</xref></sup> Both genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to the behaviour of the disease. Demyelination, as well as the destruction of oligodendrocytes, neurons and their axons, plays an important role in the pathology of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433303">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433303">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433303">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511433303"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511433303"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433303"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511433303">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>MS has differing clinical subtypes, which may transform from one subtype to another over time depending on the pattern of progression and presentation of symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511433303">9</xref></sup> The complex nature of the disease requires reliable diagnostic tools to identify and characterise its subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511433303">10</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine and oligoclonal band formation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflect the inflammatory and demyelinative nature of the disease and are important tools in the diagnosis of MS. However, their value in differentiating between MS clinical subtypes and predicting disease progression is limited. Currently, there are no further laboratory markers to strengthen the diagnosis and predict transitions between MS subtypes. However, some protein markers have been studied to investigate their potential predictive role in the differentiation of subtypes and progression of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511433303">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, proteomics studies have focused on finding protein biomarkers in bodily fluids of patients with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511433303">12</xref></sup> Accordingly, some proteins differentiating the course and the MS subtypes have been identified in the CSF and serum of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511433303">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511433303">14</xref></sup> Among such proteins are αB-crystallin, neurofilaments, calprotectin and CXCL13 chemokine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511433303">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511433303"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511433303"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511433303">18</xref></sup> Nevertheless, these studies require validation and they have not yet yielded a specific and sensitive diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for MS.</p>
<p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein (MBP) are functional elements in the myelination of nerves, and proteins such as tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NFL) are known to be associated with neuronal damage. Most studies in which these proteins were investigated had limitations because these proteins were studied either independently or only in some forms of the disease.</p>
<p>The aim of this current work was to study whether these candidate biomarkers have potential diagnostic value and whether they can be used as potential predictors of transitions between disease subtypes and clinical outcome. Several computational methods can be used in this context. Computational methods are also needed to reduce biological variation so that only significant and relevant proteins are validated by biological methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511433303">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511433303">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here, we describe our combined clinical, laboratory and computational analyses of tau, GFAP, NFL, MOG and MBP in CIS and clinically differing MS subtypes, including RRMS and PPMS, and discuss their potential role as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers.</p>

<title>Patient and control groups</title>
<p>CSF and serum samples were obtained during routine diagnostic or clinical evaluations of patients with CIS, RRMS and PPMS who were seen at the MS Clinic of the Clinical Neuroimmunology Division of Istanbul University, Cerrahpaşa School of Medicine, Neurology Department, between 1 May 2005 and 31 December 2010. CIS was defined as an episode of a neurological disturbance with an acute or subacute onset and a corresponding inflammatory-demyelinating CNS lesion with or without other silent MRI lesions suggestive of a first episode of MS. Patients with MS were diagnosed according to the revised McDonald criteria (2005).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433303">21</xref></sup> All patients had complete clinical evaluations, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and composite index. Other initial diagnostic studies were cranial and/or spine MRIs and CSF studies, including oligoclonal bands.</p>
<p>This study was in part a clinically prospective study because serum and CSF samples were collected from all patients at the time of entry into the study. Study subjects were enrolled according to their clinical diagnoses, which were CIS, RRMS and PPMS, and control groups. After enrolment, each patient group was followed clinically prospectively. The endpoints for patients with CIS were having either a second clinical attack or appearance of new MRI lesions on follow-up MRI studies fulfilling McDonald 2005 criteria for the diagnosis of MS. Patients with RRMS were followed for any change in their disability levels by EDSS and composite index and whether they converted to SPMS. The only retrospective data were the duration of the disease and EDSS to the time of enrolment. However, when the clinical type of the disease is considered, patients with RRMS and PPMS had to fulfil their diagnostic criteria before enrolment so they could be included. For the CIS group, serum and CSF samples were collected within 10 days of the neurological episode and prior to any treatment. The patients then were followed clinically prospectively until the end of the study. Additionally, patients with CIS were followed for the first 18 months by both clinical and imaging (MRI) examination every six months and then on a yearly basis or they were seen whenever they had a new clinical symptom or sign suggestive of a MS episode. Patients with CIS were followed during the study period and were subdivided to MS converters (CIS-MSc; <italic>n</italic> = 9) versus non-converters (CIS-nc; <italic>n</italic> = 37). In the final analysis, the CIS group consisted of two subgroups: the CIS-nc subgroup, remaining as CIS during the study period, and the CIS-MSc subgroup, showing a transition from CIS to MS (RRMS). The clinical course and disability progression were followed prospectively for the RRMS and PPMS groups.</p>
<p>Of the 67 patients with RRMS, five (7.5%) were already on a disease-modifying drug (DMD) at the beginning of the study. Thirty-six patients were admitted after a second attack; of them, 33 (49.3%) were started on a DMD at our MS clinic. In the remaining patients, long-term treatments were not given, either because of the patients’ reluctance or the primary physician’s decision. Of the RRMS cases, 16 (23.9%) had their spinal taps within the four weeks after an acute neurological episode. In patients with RRMS who were treated with IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) for a MS attack, the spinal tap was done either prior to the IVMP or at least three months after this treatment.</p>
<p>The control group consisted of 22 individuals with other neurological diseases (ONDs). Among those was a patient with neuro-Behçet’s disease, whose neurological involvement was 28 months earlier and who did not have active disease at the time of the spinal tap. Two other patients had idiopathic polyneuropathies, one had suspected Tolosa–Hunt syndrome, one had epilepsy and one had suspected sarcoidosis; their CSFs were found to be normal. The remaining controls were patients with acute headache seen in the emergency department in whom spinal tap was performed to rule out subarachnoid haemorrhage or other intracranial pathologies; in all of them, such probabilities were ruled out and they were found to have non-structural diseases, such as migraine, severe tension type or headache due to conversion disorder. Ages and genders of the control group (39.4±15.1) were matched with the patient groups.</p>
<p>A final correlation between the clinical subtype and disability level at the time of entry and the closure of the study with CSF and serum marker levels was done for each patient.</p>
<p>The protocol was approved by the ethics review committee of the Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul University for research ethics. Oral and written information was given to the patients and informed consent in writing was received before patients were included in the study.</p>

<sec id="section9-1352458511433303">
<title>Sampling and preparation of samples</title>
<p>CSF samples were collected from patients by spinal tap within 2 and 10 days of an acute attack in the CIS group. Spinal tap was performed in the RRMS group and in progressive patients when they were hospitalised and before medication. CSF (3 ml) was taken and centrifuged (800 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min); the supernatant was aliquoted into sterile microcentrifuge tubes that were kept at −80°C until analyses. Serum samples (5 ml) were collected at the same time that CSF was obtained using BD Vacutainer serum tubes, aliquoted into sterile microcentrifuge tubes and kept at −20°C until analyses.</p>
<p>Precipitation of proteins from CSF samples was performed following a trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone precipitation protocol, and samples were affinity-purified to remove albumin as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511433303">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511433303">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>An Albumin and IgG Removal kit (GE Healthcare code: RPN6300) containing affinity resins were used to purify the protein content from serum, removing albumin and IgG. Serum samples were also analysed by western blotting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511433303">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458511433303">
<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Differing protein expression levels between subgroups were compared using a western blot method. Although western blotting is semi-quantitative, it has the advantage of allowing detection of false-positive bands through identifying the molecular weights of proteins. Thus, it is a robust methodology to measure the protein concentrations as compared with other techniques such as ELISA. Total protein concentrations in samples were determined using the Bradford assay at 595 nm with a Microplate reader 3550-UV (Bio-Rad).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511433303">25</xref></sup> The sample volume was adjusted to 10 mg/ml total protein concentration in each blot by diluting or concentrating the sample. Diluted sample was mixed with 4× loading buffer and denatured at 95°C for 5 min. Each sample (20 µl) was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE (4–12%) gel. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 90 V. Then, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 4°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511433303">26</xref></sup> Transfer was performed in a semi-wet electroblotting system. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody [Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Tau46: sc-32274, GFAP (2E1): sc33673, MOG (H72): sc-66968, NF-L (H70): sc-25652), MBP (FL-304): sc-25665]-containing buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with Tween-Tris buffered saline (TTBS) washing buffer, 3 × 5 min, and incubated in secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. goat anti-rabbit IgG-AP: sc-2057, goat anti-mouse IgG-AP: sc-2058)- containing buffer at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes were washed again, 3 × 5 min, with TTBS. The blots were developed with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-idoxyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (BCIP/NBT; Sigma, Denmark) system for 15 min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511433303">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section11-1352458511433303">
<title>Semi quantitative protein concentration analyses</title>
<p>Protein bands on the membranes were scanned using a densitometer (Bio-Rad GSH 800 and the MagicScan32 V4.5 software). Scanned protein bands on the membranes were analysed using the ImageJ software (NIH) to obtain quantitative measurements. Quantities of proteins were assessed in colorimetric units (CUs). A CU is a numerical value showing the sensitivity of the protein band concentration, ranging between 0 (least) and 255 (most). Analysed values were linearised and normalised due to loaded total protein concentration. All samples were scanned and analysed with the same standard procedure. Since there is no certain housekeeping protein continuously expressing in CSF or releasing in CSF, housekeeping could not be studied. But, to confirm the standardisation of our analysis, the same randomly selected sample was analysed as an internal control in each run, and the accuracy of the measurement was validated. Standard deviations for the measurements were negligible.</p>

<sec id="section12-1352458511433303">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Clinical subtypes were compared with the control group, and the CIS-nc and CIS-MSc subgroups were compared. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare clinical subtypes and control group. Correlation of protein levels between serum and CSF was assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation. The SPSS software (v. 18.0) was used for all analyses. <italic>p</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1352458511433303">
<title>Classification methods</title>
<p>The <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbour (<italic>k</italic>NN) algorithm was used to assess the predictive use of these proteins for differential clinical subtype diagnoses. The <italic>k</italic>NN classification method is a frequently used method for classification purposes. The <italic>k</italic>NN algorithm takes the <italic>k</italic> nearest samples from a reference training set that are closest to the new sample, and determines the class of this new sample according to the labels of these closest samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511433303">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511433303">28</xref></sup> The value of <italic>k</italic> was 5 for all classification tests.</p>
<p>Data pre-processing methods were needed for the efficient use of information. In this work, the Weka 3.6 software was used for data pre-processing and the implementation of classification methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511433303">29</xref></sup> Data pre-processing was applied before classification methods. The pre-processing steps included data normalisation (the Normalise filter in Weka) and replacement of missing values (the ReplaceMissingValues filter in Weka 3.6).</p>
<p>A 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy and the area under ROC curve (AUC) analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511433303">30</xref></sup> The AUC curve is typically used as a performance measure for machine- learning algorithms, and higher AUC values correspond to better classification performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511433303">31</xref></sup> Each classifier was run 1000 times using 10-fold cross-validation to obtain a distribution of accuracy and AUC.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 46 patients with CIS (<italic>n</italic> = 9 CIS-MSc and <italic>n</italic> = 37 CIS-nc), 67 with RRMS, 22 with PPMS and 22 ONDs were studied. Only two of 67 RRMS cases converted to SPMS during the clinical follow-up (4.5 ± 4.7 years) period; these two patients were not subjected to separate subsequent analysis. Demographic data of patients and control subjects are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511433303">Table 1</xref>. The female:male ratio was 2.1:1 (91:43) in subject groups and 1.3:1 (13:10) in control groups. No significant correlation was observed among age of onset of the first neurological event, duration of the disease, oligoclonal band formation, EDSS or protein concentrations in the CSF in the different disease subtypes. However, comparison of protein concentrations between the subgroups revealed that tau, GFAP, NFL and MOG concentrations differed significantly in patients with CIS and each subtype of MS when compared with the control group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We showed that concentrations of tau, GFAP, NFL and MOG in CSF may be useful as biomarkers for MS prognosis and diagnosis. Here, our aim was not to show perfect classification results, but rather to demonstrate that the selected proteins may have some predictive value for the different subtypes of MS.</p>
<p>Tau is a major microtubule-associated protein, playing an important role in the stabilisation and assembly of microtubules in axons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511433303">33</xref></sup> Previous studies showed that the concentration of tau protein in CSF and serum is elevated in patients with MS versus control groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511433303">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511433303"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511433303">36</xref></sup>. Our results are consistent with these studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511433303">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511433303"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511433303">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, we showed that the concentration of tau protein in the CIS-MSc subgroup differed significantly from the CIS-nc group. Thus, tau protein results indicate that patients whose diagnosis changes from CIS to RRMS might be predictable based on the tau protein concentration in CSF.</p>
<p>When our finding of the tau difference between CIS-MSc converters (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and non-converters (<italic>n</italic> = 37) is combined with data on the relationship between tau protein and neurodegeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511433303">37</xref></sup> disease severity may correlate with the tau protein concentration in CSF. Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511433303">Figure 2(a)</xref>, the concentration of tau showed higher levels in the subtype of the disease, with higher levels from CIS to RRMS and then to the progressive forms, suggesting that CSF tau concentrations may serve as a marker for predicting conversion and prognosis in MS.</p>
<p>GFAP is an intermediate filament protein that is especially expressed in astrocytes and in other CNS cell types. As previously indicated, GFAP is important in glial activation and damage, and GFAP has a role in irreversible tissue degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511433303">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511433303">39</xref></sup> Additionally, the GFAP concentration increased in the progressive disease forms compared with RRMS and CIS (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Rosengren et al. showed that GFAP concentrations in the CSF were elevated in patients with MS compared with OND controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511433303">40</xref></sup> These findings confirm the correlation between protein levels and the extent of neurologic deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511433303">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1352458511433303">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, in an another study, although an elevated GFAP level in MS versus ONDs was found, conflictingly, the GFAP levels in CSF in patients with PPMS and SPMS were significantly <italic>lower</italic> than those in patients with RRMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1352458511433303">42</xref></sup> However, our findings were consistent with the previous studies, and concentrations of CSF GFAP correlated with the disease severity level and were higher in the progressive forms of the disease. Regarding blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage and glial activation in the pathogenesis of MS, our results are also consistent with the view that GFAP may be a biomarker for both BBB damage and astrogliosis.</p>
<p>Neurofilaments are the major cytoskeleton proteins of axons, and increased reactivity of neurofilament proteins in active MS lesions has been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511433303">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1352458511433303">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1352458511433303"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1352458511433303">45</xref></sup> They also play a role in intracellular transport to axons and dendrites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1352458511433303">45</xref></sup> In previous studies, elevated levels of NFL in patients with MS have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1352458511433303">46</xref></sup> We found that NFL protein concentration correlated with the subtype of MS. Similar to tau and GFAP, the NFL protein level was elevated in the progressive types of MS, as well as in RRMS and CIS, when compared with the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Thus, NFL protein may be an appropriate biomarker showing axonal damage in MS subtypes.</p>
<p>MOG is a functional protein in the myelination process of nerves in the CNS. It serves as an adhesion molecule, providing structural integrity, and functions in the formation of oligodendrocyte cells. Previous studies have shown that frequencies of anti-MOG levels in MS subtypes were higher than in controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1352458511433303">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511433303">48</xref></sup> Although not universally confirmed, Berger et al. showed that the presence of MOG and MBP in the serum of patients with CIS increased the conversion rate of CIS to RRMS significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511433303">48</xref></sup> Additionally, Reder and Oger suggested that the presence of anti-MOG antibodies indicated an elevated immune response in patients with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1352458511433303">49</xref></sup> Furthermore, as suggested by Antel and Bar-Or, this finding, suggestive of an ongoing immune mechanism, and a better understanding of the process or similar processes, may provide biomarkers for predicting conversion from CIS to MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1352458511433303">50</xref></sup> Notably, MOG findings in these studies correlated with our classification approach; the level of MOG showed a significant increase in the CIS-MSc subgroup, indicating the CIS to RRMS transition.</p>
<p>Regarding our findings and those in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1352458511433303">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511433303">48</xref></sup> the concentration of MOG in CSF may be helpful in assessing oligodendrocyte damage and myelination levels in patients with MS. Thus, MOG may be a biomarker of oligodendrocyte damage, and the level of MOG in CSF may indicate disease severity.</p>
<p>MBP is a major functional protein in the myelination process of nerves in the CNS. In our study, MBP showed no significant result. However, the number of MBP-positive samples was not large enough to compare with the controls. Various forms of MBP with alternatively spliced forms and post-translational modifications are found in the CSF and CNS space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1352458511433303">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1352458511433303"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1352458511433303">53</xref></sup> Post-translationally modified variants of MBP may be more abundant in CSF. Other MBP forms should be studied and their differences should be clarified in future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the major finding of this study was that the candidate protein biomarkers studied gave more significant results when they were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1352458511433303">Figure 5</xref>). Results of the classification method used to study the concentrations of tau, GFAP, NFL and MOG in CSF showed that each should be considered together as biomarkers in predicting the diagnosis of MS type and its prognosis. Furthermore, this classification approach was also significant in revealing the patients with CIS who remained as CIS from those who converted to RRMS during the follow-up period. However, significance was not achieved using ANOVA. This may have occurred due to the limited sample size or because at the time of CSF collection all patients had elevated levels of inflammatory proteins owing to an acute inflammatory attack. The sample size, CSF sampling time or a combination of the two can potentially limit the accuracy of the results. Thus, further research is necessary with more specific inflammatory markers and an increased sample size. We confirmed that patients whose diagnosis changed from CIS to RRMS, depending on new attacks and lesions in the brain (within the study period: mean of 4 ± 0.8 years), may be predictable by analysing tau, NFL and MOG levels in CSF using the classification method. Obviously, these results need to be confirmed in other and larger studies.</p>
