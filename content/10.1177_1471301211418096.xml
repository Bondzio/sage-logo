<abstract>
<p>The experiences of 10 spouses of people with dementia in long-term care were explored using semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) which resulted in four themes: ‘Identity: till death us do part’; ‘Making sense of change’; ‘Relationship with care provided: visiting as surveillance’; and ‘Relationship with the future: hope versus despair’. The findings highlighted the presence of conflicting feelings for the spouses, with positive feelings being voiced against a context of despair. Their perceptions of the care provided and the spousal relationship also highlighted the value of their views in supporting this group of people, improving dementia care and, hence, the importance of their involvement in implementing a ‘relationship-centred’ care approach.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211418096" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research has suggested that the role of carer does not cease following the admission of a relative with dementia into long-term care, but can take on a different form with continued involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211418096">Zarit &amp; Edwards, 2008</xref>). Hence, some quantitative research in this area has indicated little difference in the levels of psychological difficulties between individuals caring for a person with dementia at home and those whose family member resides in a care home (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211418096">Barber, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211418096">Lieberman &amp; Fisher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211418096">Pratt, Wright, &amp; Schmall, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211418096">Stephens, Ogrocki, &amp; Kinney, 1991</xref>). Quantitative research has also provided evidence that previous full-time caregivers can experience significant distress following their relatives’ admission to a nursing home (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211418096">Collin, Stommel, Wang, &amp; Given, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211418096">Elmstahl, Ingvad, &amp; Annerstedt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211418096">Grafstom &amp; Winblad, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211418096">Levesque, Ducharme, &amp; Lachance, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211418096">Matsuda, Hasebe, Ikehara, Futatsuya, &amp; Akahane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211418096">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211418096">Waltrowicz, Ames, McKenzie, &amp; Flicker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211418096">Zarit &amp; Whitlatch, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in some studies, spouses have even demonstrated higher levels of burden and psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211418096">Riddick et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211418096">Waltrowicz et al., 1996</xref>), poorer health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211418096">Lieberman &amp; Fisher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211418096">Novak &amp; Guest, 1992</xref>) and higher scores for anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211418096">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>) after the placement of a relative in a care home. However, on the other hand, some studies have indicated some improvements following placement, including stress related to role overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211418096">Zarit &amp; Whitlatch, 1993</xref>); improvements in the person’s social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211418096">Matsuda et al., 1997</xref>) and appraisal of burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211418096">Riddick, Cohen-Mansfield, Fleshner, &amp; Kraft, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211418096">Gaugler, Pot and Zarit (2007)</xref> also found that stress related to role overload and anxiety reduced in a group shortly after placement, though the same reductions were not seen in a separate group approached after a longer period of time. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211418096">Gold, Reis, Markiewicz and Andres (1995)</xref> found that relatives viewed placement optimistically for their own lives and for those with dementia.</p>
<p>On investigating the reasons why difficulties may occur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211418096">Harper and Lund (1990)</xref> found that the burden was more likely to be linked to the symptoms of dementia, support, care received and the relatives’ satisfaction with their lives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211418096">Stephens et al. (1991)</xref> also found that stress was linked with the symptoms of dementia and lack of support. Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211418096">Ritchie and Ledesert (1992)</xref> linked negative feelings related to ceasing caregiving with worry about the cost of care, poor familial relationships and relationships with care home staff and loss of responsibility for providing care. Similarly, Whitlatch, Schur, Noelker, Ejaz and Looman (2001) linked depression in relatives to factors associated with the nursing home as well as their age. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211418096">Schulz et al. (2004)</xref> found that psychological distress was more prevalent in those who visited most often and held negative views of care provided.</p>
<p>In attempting to explain the differences found between studies with regards to the presence of psychological difficulties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211418096">Tornatore and Grant (2002)</xref> found that increases in burden were more prevalent amongst the older relatives in the sample, those who had experienced a shorter period between caring and admission, and those who assisted more in the care of their relative. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211418096">Ritchie and Ledesert (1992)</xref> suggested that their results were unaffected by factors including length of stay and dementia severity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211418096">Lieberman and Fisher (2001)</xref> observed that positive changes were more likely to be found when looking at burden compared to when the focus was on health and well-being. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211418096">Zarit and Whitlatch (1993)</xref> concluded the importance of not viewing stress and burden as a single concept but as several processes. Consequently, although the presence of negative effects on family members with a person with dementia residing in long-term care are identified, their presence is shown to be mixed and variable.</p>
<p>The inclusion of qualitative methodology in this area has been acknowledged as potentially important in addressing the paucity of research exploring the lived experience of people whose relatives with dementia are admitted to care homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211418096">Chene, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211418096">Garity, 2006</xref>). However, examples of existing qualitative work have focused on the experiences of relatives of older people in long-term care not specific to dementia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211418096">Davies &amp; Nolan, 2006</xref>), the process of making placement decisions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211418096">Caron, Ducharme, &amp; Griffith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211418096">Davies &amp; Nolan, 2003</xref>) and experiences pending discharge from short-term care (e.g. a psychiatric unit) to long-term care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211418096">Chene, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, where experiences of having a relative with dementia in long-term care have been explored, the experience of spouses specifically is sparse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211418096">Tilse (1998)</xref> investigated the meaning of placing a spouse with dementia into long-term care, which was reflected as a comparison to spouses of individuals with a physical disability. However, in other studies where they have been included, their experiences are often amalgamated with other family carers and relevant others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211418096">Ducharme, Levesque, Gendron and Legault, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211418096">Garity, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211418096">Train, Nurock, Manela, Kitchen, &amp; Livingston, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, to address the gaps in existing research, this study will focus on the lived experience of spouses of those with dementia in long-term care to provide a more holistic understanding of this area. It is hoped that the use of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211418096">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>) as the specific qualitative methodology will allow an insight into carers’ reality and experience in order to aid understanding and help develop appropriate information and support for this group of people.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1471301211418096"><title>Design</title>
<p>The research was conducted using a qualitative methodology, informed by the philosophy of IPA and used semi-structured interviews as the method of data collection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211418096">Smith and Osborn (2003)</xref> have argued that the theory behind this method originates from phenomenology (experience of individuals from their point of view), hermeneutics (interpretation) and symbolic interactionism (focusing on meanings people associate with events).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211418096"><title>Recruitment of care homes</title>
<p>Care homes in the north-west of England were identified through the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.csci.org.uk">www.csci.org.uk</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211418096">1</xref></sup> following a search for care homes within the private sector with dementia care provision, a minimum quality rating of two stars (‘good’), within a 10 mile radius and a minimum capacity of twenty beds. The sample was therefore an opportunistic one. Of the 16 care homes contacted, 10 agreed to take part (four stated there were no spouses alive to contact; one care home did not want to take part and one felt they did not have enough contact with relatives).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211418096"><title>Recruitment of spouses</title>
<p>Potential participants were identified through information packs distributed via care home managers, which resulted in twelve responses from a total of six care homes (the recruitment strategy involved contacting care homes until 10−15 participants were identified). Potential participants were required to return a ‘consent to contact’ form, after which they were contacted via telephone by a researcher to arrange an interview. Out of the 12 people who agreed to take part, two later withdrew before the interview due to death and ill health of their spouses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211418096"><title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants were nine spouses and one long-term partner of individuals with dementia who had resided in a care home for at least one year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211418096">Table 1</xref> for further details).

<sec id="sec7-1471301211418096"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted on one occasion either at the person’s home address or the nursing home where their relative resided. An interview schedule was used as a guide with relevant prompts focusing on experiences following the placement of their loved one. This included questions around support, the spousal relationship, aspects relating to the care home and thoughts about the future.</p>
<p>The interviews, which lasted between 50 minutes and 1 hour 20 minutes, were recorded using a small digital dictaphone and transcribed verbatim. For purposes of confidentiality, audio copies of interviews were stored on a password-protected computer and deleted immediately following transcription. The transcriptions were also kept anonymous through the removal of any identifying information. Participants were given the opportunity to withdraw from the interview at any time and from the research up to two weeks after the interview had taken place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211418096"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Each interview was transcribed and then read over whilst listening to the interview for a second time to increase familiarization with the data and check for anomalies. The process of analysing the data was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211418096">Smith and Osborn (2003)</xref>. The goal of IPA is to explore what meanings individuals give to their experiences and their subjective views of these experiences and therefore the researcher’s role is to interpret the meanings given and essentially find out what it would be like to be in the participants’ situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211418096">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>). After initial note-taking on the transcripts to create a list of possible subthemes, the next stage involved listing these themes, finding relationships between them, rearranging or merging them together. These connected themes were then compared against the original data (what the person actually said) and verbatim responses were documented and connected with each theme. The themes were then arranged so that those that had been grouped together were also given a label and themes that were identified as weaker than the others were removed. This process was repeated for each of the transcripts, resulting in further rearranging, merging and removal of themes across all transcripts which produced the ultimate table of themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211418096"><title>Ethical issues</title>
<p>Ethical approval was given by the first author’s academic institution. Participants were informed of the voluntary nature of the study and written consent was gained. It was anticipated that some participants would find discussing their experiences difficult and in such cases information was provided to access appropriate support. It was assumed (in line with advice from the UK Mental Capacity Act, 2005) that all participants had the capacity to give informed consent and, in collaboration with care home managers, there were no identified concerns with regards to this.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211418096" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Four themes were identified: 1) Identity: ‘till death us do part’; 2) Making sense of change; 3) Relationship with care provided: visiting as surveillance; 4) Relationship to the future: hope versus despair. These are presented in turn and discussed in relation to relevant literature to purposefully integrate the discussion section with the findings.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211418096"><title>Theme 1: Identity: ‘till death us do part’</title>
<p>The first theme ‘Identity: ‘till death us do part’ reflected the identity of the participants in relation to the spousal relationship, alongside a strong sense of devotion towards their relative. Participants were asked directly about their relationship with the concept of ‘carer’, which gave an insight into their perceived identity and the nature of the spousal relationship. Three of the participants identified themselves with the word ‘carer’ and this appeared to be associated with activities they carried out such as feeding, other aspects of personal care and being consulted on care provided:<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah well I do feel like a carer (.) I am (.) coz I am a carer and that’s it, you know, and erm (.) when the doctors come they ask <italic>me</italic> questions’. (David)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1471301211418096">2</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One person was unsure whether they associated themselves with this word and six did not include this as part of their identity (even though five of them also carried out feeding or other activities related to personal care):<disp-quote>
<p>Just a wife (.) I’m his wife and that’s all there is to it (.) coz I’m out of control with him, aren’t I? You know, I mean I haven’t got him (.) he’s (.) he’s getting cared for by other people. (Mary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The stronger identification with the role of husband or wife (the one unmarried participant who had been with her partner for 23 years regarded herself as a wife) as opposed to a carer appeared to be related to the physical separation from their family member and ceasing with some of the tasks that used to be performed in the home. One participant also commented on being paid, even though a small amount, for carrying out his role as a carer before admission, which related to his perception of this role.</p>
<p>Research suggests that how the identity of a partner with dementia is appraised also has consequences for how the other partner views their own identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211418096">Coeling, Biordi, &amp; Theis, 2003</xref>). As a result the spousal relationship may be altered, for example with some spouses drawn emotionally closer to their loved ones but with an associated negative effect on physical intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418096">Hayes, Boylstein, &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of their perception of identity, there was a strong sense of devotion within the spousal relationship and that despite the current situation their feelings towards their relative remained unchanged. Loyalty was described by participants in the sense that, although the nature of their relationship had changed, their love for them had not. For some participants it appeared that this devotion also translated into visiting out of a sense of duty and feeling that they had to be there for them. The following account describes this devotion of a husband towards his wife:<disp-quote>
<p>… her being in the nursing home hasn’t changed anything. As I say, it’s changed <italic>who</italic> she was to what she is now (.) but it doesn’t change the way I feel about her (.) you know in any shape or form (.) like you know she’s still my wife (.) she’s the love of my life and, as I said, is that will never change and that (.)<italic> that’s</italic> as I say, why it makes it harder for me probably. (Gary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With regards to expression of this devotion, two participants commented on the difficulties of being physically intimate with the person with dementia. Although this represented a small proportion of the sample it felt that this was a salient part of maintaining the relationship with regards to an expression of love that might otherwise be restricted to carrying out tasks associated with caregiving during visits:<disp-quote>

<p>Research suggests that the role of a spouse can continue to be very much part of the participants’ sense of self when their relative is placed in long-term care for older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211418096">Gladstone, 1995</xref>) and that the label of ‘carer’ commonly attached to family members providing care may not be a fair representation of how this group of people perceive themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211418096">Small, Froggatt, &amp; Downs, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current research, identification or not with the word ‘carer’ was mixed, which highlights the presence of difference in this group of people and the complexity in their perceptions of circumstances. The findings also suggested that despite significant changes in how the spousal relationship was viewed, the strong sense of devotion within the relationship remained unchanged.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1471301211418096"><title>Theme 2: Making sense of change</title>
<p>The second theme, ‘making sense of change’, related to the changes people experienced as the person with dementia deteriorated. Participants commented on the difficulties in communicating with their loved ones which appeared to be related to factors resulting from a lack of recognition, the person with dementia being unable to make conversation at all or that their responses did not make any sense. Five of the participants were not recognized by their spouses; four were recognized and one said they were recognized sometimes. It was clear that this recognition was important and for those who were not recognized, although they visited their loved one frequently, it appeared that they felt invisible to the person with dementia:<disp-quote>
<p>… it’s extremely difficult (.) especially when she would grab hold of another (.) say another man in (.) in where she was when she was walking and she’d be (.) when they were trying to get rid of her and she’d be linking (.) come on xxx (husband’s name) she’d be saying come on xxx (.) everybody (.) every man was called xxx (husband’s name). (Ben)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The lack of reciprocity in conversation also left exchanges such as sharing current life experiences feeling very one-sided for the participants, which impacted negatively on their perceptions of the relationship. This highlighted the importance of reciprocal communication for the spouses:<disp-quote>
<p>… the relationship has (.) has gone because you can’t converse and can’t talk and can’t share experiences anymore. (Richard)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The lack of communication in relation to the sense of loss of the person that they once knew also clearly had an effect on their relationship in that they were no longer able to share memories from their lives. Loss resonated strongly for participants in thinking about previous plans made for the future together and, in relation to nursing home placement, was also signified by the loss of their relative from the family home and not being able to do activities together as before:<disp-quote>
<p>This is just a nightmare because it (.) it’s like somebody (.) you wake up and you’re home and your husband’s gone and it’s like someone’s got a carrot and they’re dangling it and they’re saying well he hasn’t gone (.) he’s here (.) you can come and see him but you can’t have him back the way he was (.) I think that’s the difficult part. (Sarah)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the participants’ distress as they witnessed the effects of dementia on their loved one and the relationship, there were also positive appraisals of symptoms as they recounted relief in certain aspects of their partner’s disability. For example, physical disability indicated that they would be safer and less prone to falls and cognitive difficulties meant that a lack of recognition of their spouse resulted in participants not having to endure their loved ones crying out after them as they left, which produced profound feelings of guilt:<disp-quote>
<p>You know and er (.) when we were going home she’d be crying you know and it used to kill me (.) you know she’d be crying you know (.) coz (.) with us leaving but she doesn’t do anything like that now. (Peter)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211418096">McCahon (1991)</xref> demonstrated from an account of a wife whose husband was in long-term care with Alzheimer’s disease that the lack of awareness or communication lessened the guilt she felt from not visiting. The current study demonstrates the importance of both the presentation of the person with dementia (for example with regards to communication and changes from the person they used to be) but also the effect of care home placement in itself as representing loss of the person from the family home. This research also demonstrates the spectrum of feelings towards physical and cognitive difficulties in that they are not always perceived in a negative way. Therefore, it can be said that this finding provides a novel understanding of the way that spouses appraised their situation in what might otherwise be presumed as having a negative effect.</p>
<p>The first two themes demonstrated the importance of the spousal relationship and its influence on the distress felt by the participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418096">Hayes et al. (2009)</xref> reported the contribution of mutual reciprocity on maintaining the spousal relationship. However, the themes identified here link together findings that in despite of threats to the relationship, feelings of devotion appear unaffected. In this sense, the presence of devotion could be argued to be a protective factor. The findings from the current study therefore highlight the importance of how the relationship is perceived by spouses, the impact of the symptoms of dementia and the effect of the system in which the person with dementia now lives (e.g. on issues of separation). In addition these factors need to be considered as a whole, rather than in isolation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211418096"><title>Theme 3: Relationship with care provided: Visiting as surveillance</title>
<p>The third theme, ‘relationship with care provided: visiting as surveillance’, referred to participants’ perceptions of care and the need for ongoing scrutiny with regards to the care provided. For example, participants appeared to take on responsibility through visits for checking that their partners were being well cared for (which also resulted in them carrying out tasks related to caregiving). This theme also comprised positive and negative reports of care and views of staff. Participants provided information that related to their surveillance of the care that was being provided, for example with regards to making sure that their loved ones were nourished sufficiently and more general checking on their spouses’ welfare:<disp-quote>
<p>… I want to be here (in the nursing home) to convince myself that erm (.) she’s (.) everything’s OK. (Ben)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Some people gave examples that suggested if this surveillance were not carried out then their loved ones would not receive the appropriate care they needed. The level of surveillance therefore appeared to be related to how the participants perceived the care that their relatives received:<disp-quote>
<p>Researcher: ‘And what would happen if you didn’t go in?’</p>
<p>Paul: ‘She’d be left dirty (.) she’d be left dirty I know she would (.) she’d be left lying in the corner immobile and if she gets (.) see (.) she’d been sitting in chairs and she slips down like this you see.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For those who experienced some aspects of care as inadequate, concerns included inexperienced staff, a lack of toileting to address incontinence, a lack of staff and consistent staff (due to high turnover and sickness rates), a lack of stimulation for residents and where care activities such as feeding and changing were not carried out effectively:<disp-quote>
<p>… if only they’d get it in their heads that if he comes from the dining hall take him straight to the toilet because he can still look after himself (.) but he’d (.) then they put him in a chair and then he forgets and sometimes he’s wee’d himself and he gets aggressive. (Helen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These findings relate to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211418096">Friedman, Montgomery, Mailberger and Smith (1997)</xref>, who found that individuals assist with their relatives’ care due to poor appraisal of care already provided. Similarly, Davies and Nolan described a similar process in their theme ‘keeping an eye’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211418096">Davies and Nolan, 2006</xref>, p. 287), which incorporated the need to check the care of loved ones. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211418096">Train et al. (2005)</xref> also found that relatives’ experiences of long-term care of residents with dementia included concerns around the care provided in their theme ‘relationships (abuse and vulnerability)’, though all family members were also positive about the staff. Other studies have also reported increased perceptions of burden in those who express more dissatisfaction with nursing home care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211418096">Monahan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211418096">Riddick et al., 1992</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211418096">Tornatore and Grant (2002)</xref> argued that the appraisal of why individuals continue to assist with daily care is important as people who perceive care to be poor may be more likely to feel distressed than those who are satisfied but choose to maintain certain aspects of caregiving.</p>
<p>All participants experienced some aspects of care that they considered positive, though their accounts varied. Two participants described more positive experiences of care and gave no examples of current care that they felt was inadequate. Positive experiences of care appeared to be related to satisfaction with the care provided. Aspects of care that were considered positive included good communication between relatives and care staff; when residents were kept clean; staff that were kind, attentive, friendly and approachable and where stimulating activities were present for the residents. These qualities appeared to give participants peace of mind that their partners were looked after and safe.<disp-quote>
<p>… she’s had such good care here (.) she’s (.) she’s as good now as when she came in you know so. (Ben)</p>
<p>… I think really the staff do a marvellous job and they answer them (.) when they come out with a load of rubbish (.) staff are brilliant because they answer them (.) they don’t just ignore them. (Sarah)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite expressing some negative feelings towards the care provided, participants expressed empathy towards care staff in carrying out a difficult job within the confines of the system in which they worked. They commented that there were usually insufficient staff, who were generally underpaid and simply did not have the time to spend with the residents. An example of this empathy was demonstrated by a lady who accepted why her husband was sometimes left in bed when he was being aggressive towards staff:<disp-quote>
<p>… now and again he’ll be very nasty with them, so I said to them well I know now (.) you know I know how nasty he can be because he used to boot and kick and I had bruises everywhere you know with trying to wash him (.) trying to bed bath him and erm (.) I understand erm (.) if he (.) if he’s had a bad night and he wants to sleep so I (.) I don’t say anything now you know…. (Judith)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Paul also gave his experiences of witnessing care staff under pressure:<disp-quote>
<p>… they were short staffed and I could see their faces (.) the girl (.) there’s a girl pregnant there (.) just worn out (.) just had enough….</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The findings of this theme demonstrate a mixed picture with regards to the views of the spouses and ways that they are able to contain their feelings in relation to the perceived need for surveillance, for example through the expression of empathy towards staff. Although statistics suggest that staff in care homes are still not being provided with adequate training to carry out their role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211418096">Fossey, 2008</xref>), facilitation of communication between relatives and staff may also help address the difficulties that both groups experience.</p>
<p>Finally, this theme focuses on appraisals of care provided and although this research aims not to make claims about the quality of care, there was certainly a dissonance present between the expectations of the spouses and the care delivered. To assist with addressing these expectations, relatives need to be consulted more on their perceptions of care and be included in planning and monitoring the care their family member receives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211418096">Gaugler, Anderson, Zarit, &amp; Pearlin, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211418096">Thornton, Hatton and Tatham (2004)</xref> argue for the use of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418096">Kitwood, 1997</xref>) as part of assessing the care that people with dementia receive but suggest this is carried out in a way that reduces the likelihood of errors being made when utilizing this method. For example, recommendations included sufficient time to document observations, but in a way that ensures behaviours are not missed in the process; using the method with only one person with dementia at a time and frequent booster sessions for the staff involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211418096">Thornton et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211418096"><title>Theme 4: Relationship to the future: hope versus despair</title>
<p>The fourth theme ‘relationship to the future: hope versus despair’ described feelings about the future. Eight of the participants specifically identified negative feelings towards the future which appeared to be associated with fears around their loved one’s condition worsening, no hope for the person with dementia and fears for participants’ own physical health in order to be able to maintain their input:<disp-quote>
<p>He’s (.) now he’s saying oh give me a chair quick and (.) tell you when that finishes (.) when that (.) when he doesn’t walk anymore (.) don’t know what’s gonna happen to him (.) I think we are really in for something then. … (Helen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Half of the participants discussed how they would feel relief if their spouse were to die in thinking of the quality of life that their loved ones experienced but also in ending their own difficulties. There was a sense that bereavement through death was easier to cope with than the loss experienced through having a partner with dementia:<disp-quote>
<p>… as I said it’s not going to get any better (.) it’s just gonna get worse and worse and worse like you know so erm (.) as I said is if I had my own choice I’d rather she’d (.) she’d (.) she’d have died if you know what I mean (.) erm but at least that way she (.) she’d be out of her misery type of thing and that like and erm (.) and as I said <italic>that</italic> I could cope with. (Gary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In relation to feelings around death and bereavement, McCahon described how a wife whose husband had Alzheimer’s disease felt that he had already passed away and was in a position of ‘having to accept that death daily was too much for her to bear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211418096">McMahon, 1991</xref>, p. 46). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211418096">Tilse (1998)</xref> also found that spouses articulated that death would be easier to cope with than experiencing loss daily. These findings relate to perceptions of social death (‘as good as dead’) of people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211418096">Sweeting &amp; Gilhooly, 1997</xref>) and have important implications in addressing family members’ experience of loss in the living person and facilitating enjoyment of their remaining life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211418096">Small et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With regards to intervention, assisting spouses of those with dementia to enjoy the time they have with their relative despite threats to the relationship, alongside facilitating relationships with staff, is consistent with the notion of ‘relationship-centred care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211418096">Nolan, Davies, Brown, Keady, &amp; Nolan, 2004</xref>). This builds on the concept of person-centred care in maintaining ‘personhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418096">Kitwood, 1997</xref>) but includes the requirements of others such as relatives and staff members involved with the person with dementia. In viewing the spouses as part of a wider system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211418096">Fisher and Lieberman (1999)</xref> also advocate taking into account the relationships between other family members in formulating the distress brought about by caring for a relative with dementia. It could be argued that this approach would also be useful in long-term care settings. Therefore, adopting a relationship-centred care approach may not only preserve the identity of the person with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211418096">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>) but also serve to enhance the spousal relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211418096">Hellstrom, Nolan, &amp; Lundh, 2007</xref>) and relationships with staff.</p>
<p>Despite negative feelings, participants also identified that there was some hope for the future (including while their partners were still alive) in terms of thinking about claiming aspects of their lives back such as carrying out social activities and having more time for themselves:<disp-quote>
<p>… I’ve accepted it’s happened you know and I’ll just get on with my life and make the most of it and enjoy what I’ve (.) how much I’ve got left erm (.) and you know xxx’s (wife) not gonna be able to take any part of that with me any more. (Richard)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>What emerged from the participants’ narratives regarding the future therefore appeared to relate to despair but, as is importantly shown from this study, this co-exists with feelings of hope.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1471301211418096" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The participants’ accounts represented diverse experiences of having a spouse with dementia in long-term care. However, there were clear commonalities between them and four themes emerged through the process of analysing the data. These themes were explored through the accounts of the participants and links made to wider research in the area.</p>
<p>The first theme ‘identity: ‘till death us do part’ reflected varied allegiance of the participants in relation to the label of ‘carer’ and highlighted that the nature of their identity should not be assumed by others despite continued involvement with their relative’s care. Furthermore, the presence of constant devotion towards their relative was evident and, therefore, the maintenance of the spousal relationship played an important part in considering the well-being of this group of people.</p>
<p>The second theme ‘making sense of change’ emphasized the importance of how the relationship is appraised including feelings of loss of the person in the light of symptoms of dementia and the context of them living outside the family home. Positive appraisals of physical and cognitive disability gives thought to the possible impact of this way of thinking for the spouses and their loved ones.</p>
<p>The third theme ‘relationship with care provided: visiting as surveillance’ referred to participants’ perceptions of care and their continuing feelings of responsibility in monitoring the care provided. The findings suggested that perceptions around satisfaction with care are important as they affect the roles people engage with, such as continuing to provide care.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth theme ‘relationship to the future: hope versus despair’ described the meaning of the future for the spouses. Although positive appraisals were present around hope for their own lives, this theme links with the second theme in highlighting ways of managing negative appraisals including the promotion of ‘personhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418096">Kitwood, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The current results indicate the complex nature of the experiences of this group of people and it is argued that the presentation of the dementia, the feelings of the spouses and factors associated with the care home including the effect of physical separation should not be considered in isolation. The themes identified here are also not intended to stand alone and will therefore influence each other. Furthermore, the findings highlight the presence of tensions/variance within the experience, evidenced by the simultaneous presence of positive and negative feelings. Although positive aspects of long-term care have been highlighted in the current study and previous research around the practical relief of placement, the current findings also suggest positive feelings in other areas including the spousal relationship and thinking about the future. Finally, there was evidence of difference as well as similarities between individuals in how they made sense of their situation, which represents the breadth of their experience.</p>
<p>With regards to weaknesses in the current study, a major limitation was the fact that data were taken at one point in time and so any changes in experiences post admission were not reflected. Furthermore, it is worth reflecting on the sample who agreed to take part in the study, who all visited their loved ones frequently, with most of the spouses heavily involved in aspects of providing care. Train et al. (2004) also found that those who agreed to take part in their research were largely people who carried out frequent visits to the care home. Studies have found increased levels of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211418096">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>) and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211418096">Stephens et al., 1991</xref>) for those who visited their relative with dementia the most often.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations it was felt that the study achieved its aims of creating a more holistic understanding of the experience of having a partner/spouse in long-term care with dementia. In addition, in what could be said to represent a homogenous sample, the responses did not seem to suggest conflicting experiences relating to differences between the participants such as age and length of caregiving prior to admission.</p>
<p>With regards to clinical implications, supporting a ‘relationship-centred care’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211418096">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>) will be essential in facilitating relationships and promoting positive effects on well-being. In addition, groups set up within care homes would widen the support available to this group of people to enable them to discuss their experiences with others in a similar situation and in a forum where they feel able to make comments about care provision.</p>
<p>With regards to future research, using alternative methods of data collection such as focus groups would add to the richness of information in this field. Other qualitative research has stressed the importance of support for families during the initial transition into long-term care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211418096">Reuss, Dupuis, &amp; Whitfield, 2005</xref>) and further research could also focus on this stage of the process. Furthermore, the evaluation of interventions for relatives of people with dementia in care homes such as group therapy would be invaluable as interventions such as these have mainly focused around those who live at home with their loved one. For the minority that have targeted people who have a relative with dementia in long-term care, mental health has not been the focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211418096">Ducharme, Levesque, Giroux, &amp; Lachance, 2005</xref>)</p>
