<p><italic>Commanding Grace: Studies in Karl Barth’s Ethics</italic></p>
<p>Daniel Migliore, editor</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010. 255 pp. $30.00</p>
<p>Karl Barth’s ethical thought has long been a topic of both interest and controversy. In <italic>Commanding Grace: Studies in Karl Barth’s Ethics</italic>, Barth’s theological work in this area is subjected to new examination by a cadre of commentators that balance appreciation of Barth’s achievements with critical evaluation of perceived shortcomings. Most of the essays in this collection originated as lectures presented at the Third Annual Karl Barth Conference held in June of 2008 and hosted by the Karl Barth Center at Princeton Theological Seminary. While the essays range quite widely in scope, they find a center in addressing the social issues of war, political theory and democracy, crime and punishment, and forms of economic life. Such essays comprise the heart of the collection, bookended by more programmatic examinations of Barth’s ethics that address its overarching method and success, rather than focusing upon a single moral topic.</p>
<p>The collection is framed by the opening introductory essay by Daniel Migliore, editor of the collection and Professor Emeritus of Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary. Migliore puts the central question that the volume seeks to answer this way: “Can Barth the magisterial dogmatic theologian offer significant help to theology and church today in the area of Christian ethics, a discipline Oliver O’Donovan has succinctly defined as thinking ‘from truths of Christian faith to conclusions in Christian action’?” (1). Migliore provides a helpful and illuminating introduction not only to the collection of essays, but to Barth’s ethics in general, rightly noting that for Barth dogmatics and ethics were inseparable, but also that the assessment of this union has been mixed and contentious for a variety of reasons (3–4). He then addresses four topics central to Barth’s ethics: the covenantal context between God and humanity that encloses Barth’s ethical thought; the relation of grace and command (or Gospel and law) that shapes such thought; Barth’s understanding of the nature of divine and human freedom and agency and their relation to human responsibility; and, finally, Barth’s theological ethics in relation to the public domain and public policy. Migliore insightfully outlines these matters and the questions raised by them without pre-emptively moving either to critical or defensive answers, allowing such questions to be addressed by the contributors.</p>
<p>The essays that follow are grouped in pairs: the first essay of each pair offers an examination of Barth’s thought on a specific moral issue, and the second essay responds to the first. Thus, William Werpehowski’s examination of Barth’s ethics of war in dialogue with Roman Catholic thought attempts to read Barth in such a manner that his commonly criticized inconsistencies on “practical pacifism” may be ironed out, while John Bowlin’s response is less confident that such inconsistencies can be resolved. The other essays follow a similar pattern: David Haddorff’s examination of Barth’s understanding of the political order and the question of democracy is followed by a response by Todd Cioffi; Timothy Gorringe investigates Barth’s understanding of the atonement and its significance for understanding criminal behavior and punishment, and Katherine Sonderegger responds; Kathryn Tanner approaches Barth with an eye on the question of the economy and attempts to outline a “third way” beyond the opposing alternatives of capitalism and socialism in an essay that raises more questions than it answers, and Christopher Holmes responds to her position.</p>
<p>The exceptions to essays on ethical topics are those by Nigel Biggar (with a response by Eric Gregory) and Paul Nimmo (with a response by Jesse Couenhoven) that fall at the beginning and the end of the collection, respectively. These are to my mind two of the most interesting of the volume due to the scope of their purview. Biggar revisits Barth’s ethics years after writing his monograph <italic>The Hastening That Waits: Karl Barth’s Ethics</italic> (Oxford, 1993 and 1995), outlining what he believes after years of further reflection should be retained and rejected in Barth’s project and what should be further developed. Regardless of one’s estimation of Biggar’s reading of Barth’s achievement (and failures), such an essay provides an insightful picture of how estimations of Barth’s ethics can progress over time. Nimmo’s essay explores the “ontological foundations” of the ethical space that Christians inhabit, a foundation in the “being in action of the eternal and triune God” (216). Nimmo thus helpfully places Barth’s ethical thought within its larger trinitarian and christological context.</p>
<p>If there is a weakness within this strong collection of essays, it is two-fold: first, some of the secondary essays add little to the primary essays to which they respond, though there are exceptions in Bowlin, Sonderegger, and Couenhoven; second, the topical essays on moral questions focus exclusively on large social and political matters and ignore Barth’s thought on more personal ethical questions such as abortion, euthanasia, and suicide. Yet, as Migliore himself states, and with justification, no single collection can possibly hope to address such a wide range of topics (25). So this is no real criticism, but a remark made to encourage future examinations of Barth’s ethics that do address such topics and to do so with the rigor, fairness, and discernment of those presented in this volume.</p>
