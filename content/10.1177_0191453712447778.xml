<p>In this article I present some implications for a concept of transitional justice through the comparison of two approaches: retributive <italic>vs.</italic> restorative theories. Notwithstanding their profound differences in perspective, both models are grounded upon a strong notion of the public sphere. Accordingly, after showing why neither of the two approaches exhausts the problems of transitional justice, I will demonstrate how a ‘complete’ justification requires a certain view of public reason based upon rights as truth-constraints of the public sphere.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transitional justice is generally understood as a legal and institutional phase in which reforms are implemented in order to move from a political scenario where the rule of law, fundamental rights, institutional social coordination, have been infringed, to a political scenario where they are – at least partially – fulfilled. According to this definition one can imagine a continuum having at its extremes the normatively ideal conditions of justice, on one side, and the total disruption of any pattern of fairness, on the other. Transitional justice is to be placed in between such two poles and the specific subspecies of transitional contexts should align progressively within such a fuzzy continuum. One preliminary point that needs to be clarified concerns the specific definition of the notion of transitional justice, namely, whether it needs to be understood as normal justice in times of transition or if it is to be taken as a specific instance of justice as such. In the first case, one is confronted with classical principles of justice whose domains of application are unusual, having been applied to an exceptional situation; in the latter case, principles of justice can be overcome or substituted by other considerations in view of the specificity and conceptual autonomy that transitional justice assumes towards justice (on this point see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0191453712447778">Ohlin, 2007</xref>: 51 ff.). A specially disputed case which exemplifies such definitional and conceptual tension is the Nuremberg trial of Nazi generals which, strictly speaking, was conducted despite the legal principle of <italic>nullum crimen sine lege</italic>. Indeed, as odd as this might seem, at that time there was no clear international document for the crimes against humanity and genocide. While such difficulty has been nowadays overcome by the proliferation of international texts and courts granting individual and groups rights, what is even more significant is the internal connection that national constitutions have developed with international bodies and charters. This interdependence of national justice with international justice binds states to an ethically stringent international order. Nevertheless, the importance lies not so much in the factual development of the interconnection, even though this has been the result of an experiential process of political self-learning by the states after the Second World War, but in the ideal desirability of such interconnection as binding both internal and external relations at the same time. If such a normative requisite can be justified independently from factual progressions, then what is relevant in the case of transitional states is that, in principle, all past wrongs and abuses have to be judged in the light of a normative theory of justice without this transforming transitional justice into a specific case of justice <italic>tout court</italic>. It is true, though, that this requirement would satisfy the philosophical understanding of why the lack of positive legislation, or soft law legislation, is not a sufficient reason for avoiding the prosecution of criminals. However, if one observes this same scenario from a purely legal perspective, it is obvious that the normative argument must be supplemented by the juridical instruments for its realization.</p>
<p>Within the realm of normative approaches, there are at least two relevant models pretending to interpret transitional justice as a special domain for justice <italic>tout court</italic>: retributive and restorative models of transitional justice. Retributive and restorative justice models interpret, in different ways, the relation that truth bears in a theory of justice. I will first introduce the notion of truth, here, as according to the following two aspects: as historical truth, that is, as the belief that certain things have actually happened; and as a meta-condition of validity of the public sphere. The precise understanding of the contribution of such two dimensions of truth will then shed light on a third notion of truth, that which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0191453712447778">Arendt named as ‘rational truth’ (1977)</xref>, but which she failed to consider both as an essential feature of politics – and not as its competitor – and as an inherently discursive view. I will later explain more extensively the significance of this second meaning. For the time being, though, let me clarify what the first use does amount to. Truth as the belief for the occurrence or the non-occurrence of a certain event, means for the historical understanding of truth that this is linked to time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453712447778">1</xref>
</sup> Further, to defend those beliefs in support of a certain occurrence, means to be capable to provide <italic>reasons</italic>,<italic> testimonies</italic>,<italic> evidences</italic> in support of the belief content. Since historical evidences do require the support of reasoning, truth as historical truth is linked to truth as rational truth. For reasons that will become apparent later in the article, it is my intention to prove that there subsists a strong connection between truth as rational truth and truth as a meta-condition for the functioning of the public sphere. Indeed, the same possibility of providing reasons in support of an historical contingency requires <italic>public conditions of assertibility</italic> and therefore a fully fledged public sphere. I will demonstrate how truth as rational truth can be obtained only if certain preconditions are first granted in the public domain. Therefore, within the general discussion between retributive and restorative theories, I will first address historical and meta-conditional definitions of truth, and then address the role of rational truth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0191453712447778">
<title>1 Counterfactual thinking in retributive and restorative justice</title>
<p>In the following sections I will discuss some of the central features of retributive and restorative justice models and then propose an autonomous view on the role that truth occupies within a third alternative model of transitional justice, that is, the model of justice as recognition. Scholars supporting the view for retributive justice, claim that the primary move for coming to a solution with past wrongs is the systematic punishment of the committed offences.</p>
<p>There is an underlying view connected to this idea, according to which the process of <italic>restitutio in integrum</italic> of a past violation is strictly dependent upon the vindication of past wrongs through punitive measures. This process develops a <italic>backward strategy</italic> in order to come to terms with past wrongs, and implicitly it assumes that the strict punishing of the offenders is the best way to achieve such a goal.</p>
<p>On the contrary, supporters of the so-called model of restorative justice insist on the importance that <italic>reconciliation</italic> must assume over punishment. Thus, they favor processes of dialogical interplay between the parties in order to privilege reconciliation over prosecution. First of all, restorative justice places reflection in a contextual dimension, forcing public dialogue to find apt solutions to specific problems; second, it introduces a criterion of hierarchical priority, subordinating to its goals those requests advanced by patterns of justice based upon retributive or distributive justice. While these criteria represent only very general standards for the development of a theory of restorative justice, the more one proceeds into the specifications of what is to be taken as the leading principle of restoration, the more a technical meaning of justice is gained. Since restorative justice should apply pre-set criteria of validity contextually situated, then, to advance necessary conditions of coordination, means being capable of formulating a counterfactual judgment that critically assesses the actual scenario as a result of past wrongs. Let us see how a first attempt to formulate a maxim of counterfactual reasoning following from this approach can be phrased. Following from the previous considerations, within a restorative perspective, counterfactual reasoning would work here on the basis of the following claim:<disp-quote>
<p>Restorative claim I</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Had this <italic>unjust</italic> action not taken place, then the following <italic>just scenario</italic> would have followed; but since it did take place, then we shall <italic>restore</italic> justice – notwithstanding truth – through amnesty and social reconciliation.</p>
</disp-quote>This line of reasoning avoids the recurrence of an idealized scenario for the justification of the principles of justice, making use instead of a critical notion of counterfactuality. There are some central advantages from this explanatory strategy: the first consists in advancing a criterion of critical normativity anchored to factuality; the second, as a consequence of the first, consists in considering the relation between the ‘is’ and the ‘ought’ as a mutually dependent variable. Let me clarify this point. The view proposed here insists on the idea that reality, and the socio-institutional scenarios particularly involved in this case, can never be taken as a mind-independent object. Inversely, social reality, independently from its ethical value, always represents the concretization of intentional action, a factual crystallization of a project, of an ‘ought to be’. The problem, then, is no longer that of opposing a factual element to a normative standard and concluding that reality is always inadequate to the realization of such a standard. The problem is rather that of proposing an adequate methodology for the construction of a standard institutional critically oriented to an already objectified norm. The critical relation between a meta-standard of validity and a normatively inadequate reality opens the space to counterfactual reasoning. The counterfactual assessment of the factual, contrary to first appearances, is indeed a counterfactual assessment of a possible standard over an actual one. One might define this process as a form of meta-reflection over a standard, that is to say, a process of critical invalidation of a design which has produced unacceptable socio-institutional realities. With this slightly modified view, one comes to see that the kind of counterfactual reasoning involved here would assess more precisely the hypothetical non-crystallization of a standard rather than the hypothetical inexistence of a fact.</p>
<p>Further, the reconstruction of past truth is never a one-sided process but an attempt to understand the different viewpoints and the divisions of the past.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453712447778">2</xref>
</sup> While the way of conceiving of the notion of counterfactuality is common to the approach to justice by the retributivists and the restorativists, respectively, the use they make of the concept of truth in counterfactuality differs a lot. The reason lies in that while restorative theorists make use of counterfactual concepts of historical truth in order to advance processes of forgiveness and amnesty, retributivists make use of counterfactual criteria in order to vindicate historical truth through punishment. This means that retributivists would uphold the formulation of a counterfactual hypothesis of the kind:<disp-quote>
<p>Retributive claim I</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Had this <italic>unjust</italic> action not taken place, the following <italic>just scenario</italic> would have followed; but since it did take place, <italic>punitive</italic> (<italic>retributive</italic>) <italic>measures</italic> shall be taken in order to obtain a <italic>restitutio in integrum</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote>This claim is developed (wrongly) on the basis of a causal chain of relations between intentional actions. The implied thought is based, indeed, on the pretence of assuming backwardly a just scenario, had a wrong not been committed. As an illustration of this point let us take Waldron’s example of the confiscation of private land realized by a totalitarian regime. After the collapse of such regime, a retributive measure aimed at compensating the victims would redistribute the land in accordance to the previous allocation. Nevertheless, this measure excludes the possibility that the landlords’ loss of property was due to their own erroneous administration had a different course of events taken place. In other words, supporters of retributive schemes assume, wrongly, that agents are not only fully rational, but that the information available suffices to let them make the best possible choice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453712447778">3</xref>
</sup> The rationale at the basis of the justification of retributive justice measures is thus grounded upon the double assumption of causality of actions and of the idea of full information available to a rational agent. If one recalls the above-mentioned distinction relative to the domain of application of the normative notion of counterfactuality, then it is easy to see how this way of conceiving counterfactuality rests applicable to the sphere of the individual being and of its actions. Since counterfactuality, in this case, is not concerned with normative criteria, nor with the critical assessment of different models but, on the contrary, with mere states of affairs and their possible causal relations, then, it is a mistake to presuppose immutable laws among states of affairs and behaviors on the side of the agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453712447778">4</xref>
</sup> One further explicatory element of such an approach regards the backward goal it develops: the idea of achieving justice through the re-establishing of truth, that is, the disrupted scenarios. The point, though, is that if one understands a particular retributive scheme as the way to re-establish justice by truth, then one ends up by confusing a punctual resolution of a past wrong transaction with the idea of a scheme of distributive justice. Indeed, one might object that even the same past ownership was unjustly acquired so that the actual retributive action is rather a perpetuation of a long-lasting injustice and then a <italic>restitutio in integrum</italic> of a just scenario. The discussed view represents thus an incomplete version of Nozick’s entitlement theory since, to use Nozick’s terminology, one would propose a theory of justice in rectification without including a theory of justice in acquisition. Moreover, the underlying conceptual framework to this conception of justice is based upon the prioritization of historical truth in order to achieve justice as such. What is at stake here is a reductionist attempt to see justice in terms of the result of a pattern of historical truth developments reconstructed, hypothetically, in a counterfactual way. Counterfactuality is relevant in such cases where the same prevision of what would have happened had a specific unjust event not taken place (in terms of property, for instance), cannot be simply thought of in terms of a restitution of that same thing which has been denied. Sometimes compensatory measures cannot simply give back what has been taken away by unlawful past measures since, in several cases, the actual context of operation differs quite broadly from the past one.</p>
<p>Connected to this point, a second difficulty arises. If one takes seriously the question of what would be counterfactually true in a retributive justice scheme, then, it would follow that by enforcing a strong notion of causation in counterfactual thinking no context variation is allowed. Indeed, the problem of context-sensitivity is a central problem also in Lewis’ theory of counterfactuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0191453712447778">Lewis, 1986</xref>), but for the present purpose what is relevant is that strict causality is a largely inadequate explanation for human actions and social interplay.</p>
<p>Let us consider some further sub-properties connected to this notion of causality, such as the relation of transitivity. If one takes causation as a predominant rule in social affairs, it follows that a relation of transitivity must be admitted between the occurrence of a cause A and a factual effect B. While this oversimplified understanding of causation might have some appeal in oversimplified monocausal scenarios, it does not hold in the case of multicausal complex structures such as those involved in social relations. Additionally, the multiplicity of interactions and intentionalities involved in multicausal social scenarios requires a differentiation between subjective intentional or unintentional action and collective intentional or unintentional action. Indeed, in the first individual subjective level of analysis, it is possible to detect opposite intentional actions leading to certain unintended results. The point is that the concomitance of a multifactorial action of wills (either self-interested or not) does not necessarily lead to an intentional collectively willed result. Transitivity, therefore, cannot be defended as part of a reliable notion of causality in social relations. If this is the case, then, one should wonder what sort of notion of causality could be conceived of, given that the property of transitivity cannot be included as one of its central features.</p>
<p>In the above paragraph I have claimed that both restorativists and retributivists do require a criterion of counterfactual truth in view of different purposes. In both cases, though, such notion seems inadequately conceived. Indeed, in the case of retributivists it has been demonstrated that it is not possible to defend a correlation between historical truth and punitive measures on the basis of a causal chain of intentional actions; in the case of restorativists, on the contrary, it has been claimed that it is not logically and factually possible to ask contending parties to start from a shared vision of historical truths (and thus of responsibilities), in order to achieve a shared pattern of – restored – justice. This option is simply missing, and it is precisely the scope of a transitional theory of justice to enable a shared framework of reasoning among parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the conceptual impasse in which we are now, I do not intend to claim that truth is not at all relevant for achieving collective reconciliation. On the contrary, that this is an essential issue for restorative processes of social reconciliation is true both because of normative and empirical reasons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453712447778">5</xref>
</sup> Also, it is quite clear that in both approaches what is required is a strong paradigm of public reasoning capable of dealing both with past injustices and with a – yet to come – model of justice. For this reason, in the next section I will discuss the role that the public sphere has in justice, as well as what I consider to be its truth-constraints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0191453712447778">
<title>2 Towards an integrated paradigm of transitional justice: truth-constraints and reasonability in the public sphere</title>
<p>In this section I will claim that in view of a certain notion of truth that I will take as publicly relevant within transitional public domains, no exclusive choice can be made among retributive and restorative justice paradigms. Indeed, both integrate with each other, so that transitional democracies, in order to deal with past terror and violence in an effective way should orient their efforts both to a backward reconstruction of historical truth connected to criminal prosecution (retributive paradigm), and to a forward-looking orientation connected to the favoring of integrative processes within socio-institutional restoration (restorative paradigm).</p>
<p>Just by looking at the paradoxical conclusions to which it gives place – the unidirectional defense of truth over justice or, alternatively, of justice over truth – one might come to conclude that no justice can be achieved without truth, as well as no truth can be achieved – even theoretical truth – outside a just paradigm granting basic procedural conditions of dialogical exchange and, thus, basic conditions of rights and fairness. The problem, though, is that while restorativists cannot achieve justice since they do not give enough relevance to the role of truth, retributivists cannot achieve truth since they pretend to work from outside a frame of justice.</p>
<p>In this latter case, for instance, courts under a retributivist regime are very often at a loss in reconstructing past abuses on the basis of testimonies from those who in their turn are liable to criminal offences as a drawback of their collaboration. Further, if one considers ‘mass trials’, as in the case of the Gacaca courts in Rwanda, conducted outside the respect of any minimal rule of law, it becomes clear that in such cases not only justice is sacrificed but truth itself.</p>
<p>On the contrary, were one to follow a restorative scheme, it would be easier to obtain all the relevant information required for the reconstruction of a past scenario in exchange for a dispensation from criminal charges, an amnesty. But the problem is that in such case too, failing to provide any form of justice to the survivors, or failing to provide compensatory remedies (both symbolic and pecuniary), is equal not to make justice at all. A form of justice of this kind would be inadequate since constructed only upon a <italic>partial</italic> grasping of the truth. From such paradoxical relevance that truth and justice acquire both in retributive and in restorative theories, it follows that neither an aim of exclusive forward-looking perspective should be pursued nor, alternatively, an exclusive aim of backward-looking historical truth-reconstruction should be followed.</p>
<p>What is needed is an integrated model of justice. Some might object that, empirically, one has to make a choice between the backward-looking model and the forward-looking model just presented, since so far no actual model combining both properties has ever been realized. And yet, one could reply by assessing whether such practical difficulty would amount rather to an inadequate theoretical design, that is, to an inappropriate institutional design for truth commissions and their power-conferrals. Additionally, the non-exceptionalism of the difficulties involved in the reconstruction of past wrongs could be considered. Indeed, those are the same difficulties in kind – even if not in quantity – that one faces also in standard legal proceedings. Thus, if the obstacles are the same and the only variation is in the amount of work required for the functioning of an efficient system of criminal justice, then the problem remains once again that of the correct institutional design. If this is so, then, one is back to the initial point that has been made, that is, to the strict correlation between facts and norms. An interesting case for assessing the validity of certain institutional designs is that concerned with the role that different truth commissions arrangements have in specific transitional justice contexts. Once one enters into such an enquiry, then, the spectrum of intervention, success and failure is enormous. Besides the necessity of constructing tailored institutional complexes in accordance to the specific subjects for which they have to operate (as, for instance, in the case of the Argentinian military junta), variation concerns also the specific composition of the commission in accordance to the foreseen goals as well as to the overall objective it wishes to achieve, that is, the overall restoration of justice vs. a minimal objective of punishing the criminals.</p>
<p>Institutional reforms for the public assessment of past responsibilities are functional to the possibility of obtaining a working function of truth within the public domain. It is important to refer to the public domain as the <italic>locus</italic> for the emergence of truth. Indeed, a competing paradigm to the understanding of truth in terms of public truth is the view of truth as a private enterprise. The idea of truth as a private enterprise amounts to an old view on truth essentially based on a correspondence to facts. It is a view which includes several versions, such as the view of the mind as a Cartesian theatre which in its turn leads to infinite regress, or the Augustinian view on language criticized by Wittgenstein in his <italic>Philosophical Investigations</italic>. These families of theories develop an oversimplistic understanding of the relation between the mind/language and the world, since they pretend to operate through predefined concepts and objects. The most fundamental difficulty they show is that of assuming that objects and concepts are clear-cut entities, not in need of interpretation, and awaiting simply to be connected through an act of the mind. According to these views assign meanings to things and to speak the truth is just a matter of correspondence, that is, truth is dependent upon the correct description one is capable of providing of the world. Now, as we know from the work of the late Wittgenstein, this model is inadequate for the explanation of the world–mind relationship since meanings are part of a social injustice interplay. If meanings are part of a linguistic interplay with the world, then also truth must be seen as a practice, and if truth is a practice, then it cannot be formulated in terms of pre-constituted objects and concepts.</p>
<p>This observation helps at framing the way in which one should in the first instance intend the cognitive status of truth as such, and this is also what I think Arendt had in mind when she criticized the authoritarian role of truth in political life (I will return later to Arendt’s views). The next step is that of clarifying which role truth should assume within a theory of transitional justice, and to this purpose I will defend a perspective on truth as discursive dialectics of recognition. For explicative purposes, let us distinguish first between moral and theoretical truth and then attempt a recomposition of this classical dichotomy. The issue of truth in morality is a very complex one and it requires an in-depth analysis of the confrontation between reasonability and truth. Due to such difficulties, in the present occasion I will limit myself only to one but crucial point.</p>
<p>Very often defending a strong notion of truth in the public domain. Base their conclusions on the same possibility of constructing a thick model of moral truth. Two objections follow from this, the first arguing against the same possibility of constructing a moral theory of the truth, and the second arguing against the possibility of placing within the public political domain a moral theory of the truth. These two objections can be taken as strictly interdependent, even though it is possible to expand the second aspect in isolation from the first. Due to the large philosophical attention and criticism that the first horn of the dilemma has recently received, I will focus my analysis only on the second aspect.</p>
<p>Suppose that one is to operate within a regime of pluralism and that, within such a context, a comprehensive view on what is morally true would replace a Rawlsian notion of reasonability within the public sphere. What consequences would be obtained on the stability of that society? Presumably, all those reasonable doctrines not agreeing with the officially professed truth would be banned from the public scene and labeled as outlaw doctrines. At the same time, all citizens would be required to give their support to the officially recognized truth and this will enter into conflict with the idiosyncratic truths of each comprehensive view. Conflict would be unavoidable since the notion of moral truth as something publicly enforced cannot avoid interference with private visions of the good life. Personal life-plans would inevitably be affected and disrupted on the basis of the publicly recognized truths, and citizens forced to conform to what is publicly considered as in line with the official vision of the matter. The immediate consequences of the overlapping of such two spheres would amount to a loss of individual liberty and this will lead, in the long run, to a lack of support of those publicly enforced views. At the end, social stability will be lost. On the contrary, saving the notion of reasonability for the practical sphere does not amount to rejecting either the ideal of moral truth, if restricted to the private comprehensive view of life, or the role that cognitive truth takes within the public domain.</p>
<p>Maybe, though, there is also something more in all this. Let us reconsider one key element Rawls provides for the justification of the notion of ‘reasonability’. In <italic>The Idea of Public Reason Revisited</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0191453712447778">Rawls, 2001</xref>), Rawls claims that public justification does not consist simply in a form of valid reasoning. This means that public reason cannot be considered as an enterprise to be conducted in isolation from others, as if it were a syllogistic way of reasoning. It is rather an argument, says Rawls, which we address to the others on the basis of reasonably shareable premises. In para. 2.1 Rawls specified that the principal characteristic of public reasoning as reasonableness is the respect of the ‘principle of reciprocity’. The principle of reciprocity, in its turn, is grounded on a certain number of rights, liberties and opportunities that have to be granted to free and equal citizens. In other words, one can engage in a reasonable enterprise as long as the binding constraint of certain fundamental rights is fulfilled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453712447778">6</xref>
</sup> The question that follows from this is the following: are such constraining rights themselves reasonably agreed, or do they represent rather a condition of reasonableness?</p>
<p>It is clear that, were rights themselves to be decided outside conditions of reasonableness, then one would incur possible unreasonable outcomes. Indeed, it is hard to see how reasonableness can work without conditions for its effectiveness. On the other hand, were rights to be taken as strict conditions of reasonableness, then one would be exposed to two possible alternatives: either considering rights as ‘the truth premises’ of the reasonableness or considering rights as mutually co-dependent conditions of the principle of reciprocity (the reasonableness). This latter possibility reminds us, <italic>mutatis mutandis</italic>, of the Habermasian notion of the co-dependence between rights and discourse. The difficulty with this latter view is that while it provides an orientation to the application of the rights, like: ‘apply rights in such a way that the principle of reciprocity is respected’, it does not provide a parallel justification of why certain rights and not others would be required by the principle of reciprocity. Different is the case in which fundamental rights are considered as unavoidable conditions for the same exercise of public reasoning. In the attempt to provide an explanation of the Rawlsian referral to the reasonable as derived by an acceptance of certain shareable premises, one could claim that the truth-constraints of a reasonable enterprise are constituted precisely by the acceptance of certain rights. Such rights are the meta-conditions for the same engagement into the political principle of reciprocity. As such, that is, as meta-conditions, they are in a truth-relation with the exercise of the reasonable. Whereas the reasonable operates within the contingency and the urgency of factual scenarios, so that variability across time is always possible, rights as meta-conditions are presupposed in political judgment. What is indirectly affected by reasonable public deliberations is the intermediate sphere between rights and deliberations as such, that is, the specific right-configurations a society decides to promote.</p>

<title>3 The dialectic of recognition and transitional justice</title>
<p>This final section will be primarily concerned with an understanding of the role that dialectic of recognition plays as a primary super-ordinate concept for a theory of rights within the context of transitional justice. Indeed, the rationale of this article has been that of: (1) proceeding from an assessment of the incompleteness exhibited by retributive and restorative theories when addressing the problem of transitional justice, and then (2) demonstrating how both approaches are grounded on a strong notion of reasonability in the public sphere requiring as its truth-constraints a theory of human rights and, finally, (3) demonstrating how a theory of human rights is based upon a <italic>jus</italic>-generative criterion of recognition.</p>
<p>In the following section, I will first explain how a notion of dialectic of recognition can be taken as a <italic>jus</italic>-generative notion of rights, and then proceed at stating the principle regulating transitional justice as recognition. The notion of recognition, as rooted in early modern philosophy, gained its international reputation through the works of Hegel. Today, this notion has principally been expanded and reformulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453712447778">Honneth (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0191453712447778">2005</xref>), even if several others have followed. Let me start from one point characterizing part of Honneth’s perspective so to be able, then, to introduce succinctly my own interpretation within a model of discursive action. Recognition is understood by Honneth as a primary bond of intersubjectivity, a condition of mutual co-dependence among people that is at the basis of our cognitive development both as moral beings and as rational actors. Honneth, throughout his writing, continuously places attention on the cognitive aspect of recognition, even though this perspective is often paralleled by a reference to the experiences of moral misrecognitions leading in their turn to different forms of recognition as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453712447778">Honneth, 1997</xref>: 27). Now, while this pattern of analysis is phenomenologically instructive on the dynamics conducing from experiencing misrecognition to postulating the necessity of specific forms of recognition as intersubjective bonds of social interlinkage, this same pattern of explanation cannot replace the conceptual interconnections grounding experiences of misrecognition on the priority of recognition. If this is so, then, an argument is needed for the very justification of recognition as a necessary requirement for the establishment of fair and cognitively relevant experiences as well as for their own denials.</p>
<p>I have already developed this point and its implications for a theory of human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453712447778">Corradetti, 2009</xref>), and on the present occasion I can only refer to the fact that such an argument has to make use of the notion of ‘performative contradiction’. I wish rather to extend this view to a theory of transitional justice, since scenarios of transitional justice are interesting precisely because they necessitate the reformulation from scratch of guiding principles of justice and law. In view of all this, such contexts represent a privileged place of reflection for the construction of a theory of justice.</p>
<p>In the opposite direction from where I intend to go is the criticism, as well as the proposal of reformulation, of the notion of recognition that some scholars have recently advanced (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0191453712447778">Fraser, 2000</xref>). It is important to consider Fraser’s criticisms against the philosophies of recognition since, notwithstanding the fact that she makes correct observations, these observations are due to the wrong interpretations that several contemporary scholars have provided for the same notion of recognition itself. The central attack Fraser advances on the philosophies of recognition is mainly concerned with an identity issue. She claims that today’s economic development and processes of globalization, when combined with claims of recognition, lead rather to <italic>problems of displacement</italic> as far as redistributive issues are concerned and of <italic>reification</italic> of subjects (ibid.: 108). Therefore, the idea is that recognition, rather than serving the purpose of solving redistributive issues in the contemporary world, counteracts this very possibility, leading to an objectification of the subjects themselves. Let us concentrate on the reification problem seen as a result of an identity process activated by a certain understanding of the dynamics of recognition. Fraser considers that misrecognitions of the self lead to a sense of frustration and loss of the self, so that contemporary approaches stress the route to self-identity as the final goal of every dialogical process of recognition. Since this route to recognition is strictly embedded within an identity politics model, it follows that ‘reification of group identities and the displacement of redistribution’ are its most obvious consequences (ibid.: 110). This is due to the fact that in putting too much emphasis on identity, distributive injustices and misrecognitions are seen as a thread for society. Now, as briefly anticipated before, the assimilation of a purely identitarian standard within a model of recognition is not a necessary requirement of the model of recognition. Indeed, even with the problems signaled before, Honneth himself seems to put more emphasis on the phenomenological appearance of misrecognition rather than on the pragmatic-transcendental priority of recognition. The truth is that such two elements are dialectically interconnected and that, on the one hand, the Hegelian moment of the <italic>Aufhebung</italic> must not be seen as the final and immutable result of a dialectical process and that, on the other hand, it must be seen as containing internally a <italic>plurality</italic> of contradictory identity moments. Identity is thus under a perennial process of self-revision and dialectical contradiction is what allows for the overcoming of the reification of the self.</p>
<p>Given such difficulties, in the following, I will assume an autonomous notion of recognition finding its phenomenological manifestation in what appears to be a reverse perspective of the conceptual implication between recognition and misrecognition. Following this interpretation, recognition of otherness in these terms can assume two different meanings: a first and abstract one is that which must be formulated in terms of a pragmatic-transcendental notion of rights (an argument for the justification of rights as human rights); a second, which follows from this, claims that in order to move from a hypothesis of mutual recognition as a constraint of action coordination, one must engage in reasonable public deliberation and dialogue. The search for restorative justice in transitional scenarios is aimed precisely at transforming the notion of recognition as hypothesis of action coordination to recognition as a social and institutional mechanism of action coordination. But what does it mean to activate a mechanism of intersubjective recognition? Essentially this mechanism amounts to recognizing the other (either the generalized other or the particular one) as an intentional agent capable of performing certain actions directed to determinate goals. The instrumental capacity to action, though, is subordinated to the same action coordination process from which it is activated through recognition. This makes it possible to place a mutual relation of action coordination and understanding as a grounding principle for the instrumental action relation of means to ends. Once the principle of recognition is derived from the process of performative contradiction embedded in language, it becomes easy to see how certain fundamental rights follow from the argument for recognition.</p>
<p>Moving from this rough overview of the role that recognition bears in the justification of a system of rights, it is important to characterize in detail which socio-structural areas can be depicted as possible instances of the principle of recognition in transitional justice. For this purpose, the first and foremost point to consider is that from a purely individualistic approach to recognition one must move to a consideration of recognition in transitional states as a collective form. This is due to the fact that in transitional societies we are confronted with social textures characterized by mass killings and acts of discrimination committed against entire ethnic or political groups. The switch from a purely individualistic to a collective perspective of recognition, though, does not require a conceptual readaptation of the notion since, interacting collectivities under a certain perspective and abstracting from certain complexities, can be considered as individual collective actors. Responsibility remains on the shoulders of the group members even if the kind of action characterizing collective violence is the result of group interaction. This consideration of collectivities as complex singular actors, therefore, is not intended to reduce the internal complexity of communities since it recognizes at different levels and in an interconnected way the dynamics between individual responsibility and collective action. As a matter of fact, the first and most relevant domain in which collective recognition applies is the domain of the <italic>epistemic</italic> <italic>collective acknowledgement</italic> of historical truth. This requires public procedures for assessing the actual development of facts and it serves as a way to construct a collective interpretation of the present collective social self in light of past atrocities. The reconstruction of past truth is first of all a symbolic event which provides the opportunity for individuals to free themselves from the weight of terrible memories and forms of misrecognition. By entering into a dialogical process of self-narration, these collectivities aim at constructing epistemic notions of historical truth on the premise of an enforcement of fundamental rights as conditions of validity of the public sphere.</p>
<p>At such regard, for instance, the South Africa’s Promotion of the National Unity and Reconciliation Act, n. 34, 1995, stated that the <italic>Final Report</italic> of the South African Truth Commission had to produce ‘an historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society and a future founded on the recognition of human rights’. To understand such deep differences means to be able to reconstruct those pseudo-motivations at the basis of gross human rights violations without suspending the moral condemnation of such abuses. And yet, the reconstruction of these contrasting views can never take place <italic>within</italic> closed doors (as it has been done in Chile or in Brazil). This has to be a public process. Indeed, the South African national reconciliation process was the result both of parliamentary Acts and also of public individual and collective hearings concerning some of the most crucial events such as the Soweto uprising. The engagement of the media was also very high, discussions were publicly commented on and broadcast to the nation. All these public processes gave place to the <italic>Final Report</italic> of the truth commission delivered in 1998 and completed later in 2000. One interesting aspect of this event was the strictest connection between the <italic>process</italic> and the<italic> product</italic> which characterized the <italic>Final Report</italic>, since this was not simply a public consultative event but a process more specifically based on the construction of a widely accessible informational database as well as of a comparative process of reconstruction of facts spread widely along the country (on this point see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0191453712447778">Villa-Vincencio and Verwoerd, 2000</xref>: 282–3). What central tenets for further reflection and elaboration came out from the <italic>Final Report</italic> ? Certainly one relevant point is that the public disclosing of new information concerning past atrocities raised the standard of <italic>public acknowledgement</italic>; it has also allowed, to a certain extent, for the consolidation of a public <italic>process of recognition</italic> between previously conflicting parties, even though only as a working process to be completed in the future. The elements of acknowledgement and recognition have been rightly considered as two crucial notions in transitional justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453712447778">Du Toit, 2000</xref>: 122–40).</p>
<p>In the longer run, the emergence of collectivities in a public scenario would activate a dynamical interplay of narratives and interpretations – or more specifically a dialectic – which will provide the cement for the yet-to-be renovated society. Ultimately, the output of such dynamics is at the basis of the constitutional enterprise which has been previously addressed as the intermediate level that must precede criminal investigations and charges in transitional context. Indeed, operating only through international standards or even with no standards at all, as has sometimes been the case, would lead not simply to the sacrifice of justice for truth but also to the renouncing of both. If the meta-conditions of public deliberation are truth-constraints of deliberation as such, then, whenever a <italic>criminal tribunal</italic> or truth comission operates outside these parameters, no valid deliberation can be expected. The activity of these entities is thus embedded within the conditions of law advanced by constitutional processes: historical truth must be assessed in the light of the foreseeing perspective of already established principles of justice. Counterfactuality, thus, is reinterpreted in the light of <italic>constitutional principles of law</italic> (as well as the more general principles of international law). Past abuses and injustices, both in their empirical reconstruction and in their moral relevance, are evaluated on the basis of parameters of law and judged on the basis of a criterion of justice. In this case, differently from the previously assessed case of retributive justice, there is no need to compromise between justice and truth. On the contrary, truth is a sub-element of a theory of justice constructed upon constitutional principles. As a result, historical truth as a process of collective self-understanding would be realized on the basis of a counterfactual understanding on which principles of justice should have governed the recently overcome unjust scenario. One could hypothesize that within such a re-elaboration of the retributivist and the restorative model a pattern of reasoning would be similar to the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Dialectic of Recognition claim I</p>
<p>Had a dialectic of recognition been part of our recent history, we would have had a system of fundamental rights capable of validating public narratives for the punishing of abuses as well as for the granting of a collective social body.</p>
</disp-quote>This form of counterfactual reasoning is a fully situated perspective of judgment which does not renounce to the normativity of judgment on past actions despite its situatedness. Its main goal is that of redeeming the past in the light of the presently given constitutional project, a project that should guide the legal action of each newly born institution and, <italic>in primis</italic>, that of truth commissions. This is not simply a backward-looking perspective on the re-establishment of a certain pattern of truth in history; it is also a forward-looking strategy trying to fill the gap between a disrupted pattern in history and a yet-to-realize just scenario.</p>
<p>So far, specific attention has been paid to characterizing those different strategies that retributive and restorative justice pursue in counterfactual thinking, as well as the different role that truth consequently bears within such approaches. Transitional justice is articulated through different levels of interplay in accordance with the institutional, the political and the legal domain. The strict interconnection between these levels is revealed by the role that transitional justice institutions occupy, mediating between law and politics. As previously defined, constitutional courts and truth commissions are called to provide, respectively, a forward-looking perspective on the community and a backward-looking perspective on past wrongs and violations. Thus, the institutional becomes entangled with the political and the latter with the legal. The institutional is strictly dependent upon the political because the political is the presupposition for its very existence and function, whereas the legal is connected to the institutional because it constitutes its mode of working and functioning. Thus, justice as based upon a discursive dialectic of recognition embraces different fields and domains of interaction which all contribute to the placing of counterfactual thinking within legal and political institutional processes. Its aim is certainly that of reconstructing an historical truth to be judged and assessed through public fora of discussion, even though this is a sub-process within the larger goal of realizing justice within history and society.</p>
<p>Once this process has been clarified, we come to see how the two notions of truth that have been introduced in the opening sections do interconnect quite narrowly. Indeed, within the realm of the public sphere governed by validating conditions of truth, the convincing power of the arguments, testimonies and evidences brought forth in support or against a certain historical occurrence are not simplistically related to a factual occurrence <italic>tout court</italic>, but combine those proofs available in support of a certain belief with the <italic>convincing force</italic>, the <italic>power of persuasion</italic>, that certain argumentative strategies have towards the auditors. Public argumentation, therefore, when it is constructed in a non-coercive way, does advance coercive pretences, that is, it aims at being ‘the public relevant truth’. And yet, the way it can claim public validity is based upon the <italic>persuasive</italic> claims effects that it can achieve. With this we come to discover a further dimension in which public truth should be conceived, that is, its <italic>exemplar</italic> dimension of validity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453712447778">7</xref>
</sup> While the exploration of this crucial dimension of discourse validity goes beyond the purposes of the present article, let me signal the advances that exemplarity would have in revising the central tenets of the Habermasian critical principle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453712447778">8</xref>
</sup> Exemplarity, indeed, by introducing an immanent approach to how we come to hold a certain belief, maintains the critical bite on the causal relation of how a belief has been come to be held. As a matter of fact, the critical and causal relation is maintained because it is always possible to make reference to the ‘genetic pattern’ of how a belief has come to be upheld. Drawing from Williams’ reinterpretation of the critical principle which refers to the ‘force of reason’ without though making reference to exemplarity, one could make use of the following test: ‘If they were to understand properly how they came to hold this belief, would they give it up?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0191453712447778">Williams, 2002</xref>: 226–7).</p>
<p>This test reformulates the conditions of the Ideal Speech Situation in a ‘less ideal’, so to say, condition of belief acquisition. Nevertheless, contrary to Williams’ understanding according to which this test would suffice in maintaining a ‘critical’ dimension to public reasoning, what has been here defended is a thicker view based on the crucial relevance that the meta-conditions of the public realm bear in granting the possibility of formulating public truths. It clarifies also what I did refer to, at the beginning of this article, as the role that a third dimension of truth assures in politics. Contrary to what Arendt thought, we do not need to see ‘rational truth’ as a solitary process not requiring forms of dialogical cooperation; we can and indeed have to think of political judgment and ‘opinion as if it were <italic>aims</italic> at truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0191453712447778">Beiner, 2008</xref>:131). If truth is interpreted within the discursive model of recognition as that which I have here only sketched, then, rather than unpolitical and adversarial to imagination, pluralism and discourse, truth becomes inherently embedded within a process of discursive action<italic> oriented</italic> to the assertion of a morally and epistemically true judgment.</p>
<p>Once that also this third dimension of truth is recognized as essential to the public sphere, it seems that the gap between truth as a meta-condition for the validity of the public sphere and truth as historical truth, get a rejoining within this view of truth as rational truth reinterpreted along discursive and dialectical lines.</p>

<p>If one remains at the practical-applicative level, then, it is possible to distinguish alone at least three different approaches. As noted by Crocker: ‘Although most “forensic truths” will be relatively non-controversial, citizens and even members of the truth commission itself may differ over comprehensive atrocities. How should these differences be handled in a truth commission’s final report? One way, which Chile’s National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation practised, is to employ general (and sometimes vague or ambiguous) terms in order to achieve unanimity at the expense of precision. A second method is to strive for agreement but also to identify issues that remain matters of contention. In a third approach, which would resemble the practice of the US Supreme Court, unresolved disagreements would be formulated as majority and minority judgments in the same or even in separate reports’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453712447778">Crocker, 2000</xref>: 102).</p>
