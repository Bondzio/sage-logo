<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Twenty-six cases operated between December 2009 and June 2012. In all of these cases, an open thigh exploration, considered the gold standard, was performed immediately after the VAT. Data retrieved included surgical findings, demographics, and outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599813487490">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 17 men and 9 women with a mean age of 60 years. The average flap size was 91 cm<sup>2</sup> (range, 39-264 cm<sup>2</sup>), and a chimeric double skin paddle flap was harvested in 6 cases. Forty-nine of 53 total perforators were successfully identified endoscopically. Findings on endoscopic and open exploration were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92, <italic>P</italic> = .000). The overall sensitivity for the technique was 92.4% (confidence interval, 80.9-97.5) but reached 100% for perforators located at the midpoint of the anterior-superior iliac spine–patella line. All flaps survived, and there were no technique-related complications. The learning curve plateaued after 15 cases, with a mean endoscopic operative time of 18.2 minutes for the last 10 procedures.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This VAT is a safe and reliable method to identify cutaneous perforators of the lateral thigh. The procedure is straightforward and has a moderate learning curve. This approach has a role in minimizing donor site morbidity and assisting in flap design.</p>

<p>Since its original description by Song et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813487490">1</xref></sup> the anterolateral thigh free flap (ALT) has slowly gained popularity to become one of the workhorses for head and neck reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813487490">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487490">4</xref></sup> The ALT is well known for its versatility, as it can be harvested as a septocutaneous or musculocutaneous flap,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813487490">5</xref></sup> while having distinct advantages such as an inconspicuous donor site, long pedicle, and the potential for use as a chimeric flap by incorporating multiple skin paddles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490">3</xref></sup> an approach particularly useful for specific head and neck defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813487490">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487490"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487490">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with most perforator flaps, the main disadvantage of the ALT is the challenging harvesting, which is in part related to the anatomical variability of cutaneous thigh perforators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487490">9</xref></sup> In 1% to 4.8% of the explored thighs, there are no identifiable perforators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813487490">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487490">11</xref></sup> while multiple perforators, which are a prerequisite for chimeric flaps, are found in only 74%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487490">11</xref></sup> To overcome these limitations, several perforator-mapping techniques have been described, including handheld Doppler examination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813487490">12</xref></sup> flow Doppler ultrasonography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813487490">13</xref></sup> computed tomographic angiography (CTA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813487490">14</xref></sup> and near-infrared laser-assisted indocyanine green imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487490">9</xref></sup> To date, none of these techniques has proven equivalent to open exploration in terms of their ability to identify these vessels.</p>
<p>The author presents a minimally invasive, video-assisted (endoscopic) technique as an alternative to identify and map the cutaneous perforators of the thigh. This approach relies on the creation of a working space in the subfascial compartment via carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation. This concept has been used to identify and control perforating veins in the treatment of venous insufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813487490">15</xref></sup> To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first description of its use in perforator flap harvesting. The objectives of this study were to compare the findings on endoscopic and open approach, describe the surgical learning curve of the procedure, and document outcomes and potential complications associated with the technique. This series represents the initial cohort of patients, all of whom also had an open exploration as part of the accepted standard of care. As such, the potential benefits in terms of flap design and donor site morbidity cannot be assessed in this group and will be the subject of future communications.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. This is a retrospective chart review of 26 patients who underwent reconstruction of a head and neck defect with a video-assisted ALT between December 2009 and June 2012. The inclusion criteria for the study were defined as (1) patient underwent both video-assisted and open exploration, (2) the defect was located in the head and neck area, and (3) data regarding perforator anatomy, surgical outcomes, and complications were available for review. Exclusion criteria were defined as (1) open exploration was not performed following the endoscopic approach and (2) inadequate documentation of intraoperative findings or surgical outcomes.</p>
<p>The anatomical basis and detailed description for the video-assisted technique are presented below.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599813487490">
<title>Anatomical Basis of the Technique</title>
<p>Blood supply to the skin of the lateral thigh is provided by either septo- or musculocutaneous perforators that typically arise from the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490">3</xref></sup> Routinely, the first step in harvesting the ALT flap is to explore the intermuscular septum to identify the perforators. Most authors advocate for a medial incision over the rectus femoris muscle and then dissection in the subfascial plane in a medial to lateral fashion until the septum is exposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813487490">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). One of the anatomical characteristics of the thigh is the presence of loose connective tissue in the lateral subfascial compartment. When harvesting an ALT, this plane becomes apparent once the dissection extends lateral to the intermuscular septum and is known for offering little resistance. The rationale of this technique relies on transforming this virtual space into a 3-dimensional working space via the insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub>. Once the working space is created, the cutaneous perforators are found by dissecting in the subfascial plane with the assistance of laparoscopic instruments, in this case, in a lateral to medial fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Technique Description (Video)</title>
<p>A line is marked on the thigh between the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) and superior-lateral aspect of the patella and divided in 4 equal segments. A 12-mm cutaneous incision is created 4 cm lateral to the lowest one-quarter mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The dissection proceeds through the subcutaneous tissues and fascia. Blunt dissection is used to create a small pocket in the subfascial compartment, then a 12-mm laparoscopy trocar (CTF73 Kii Fios First Entry; Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, California) is placed and secured circumferentially in an air-tight fashion. The CO<sub>2</sub> insufflator (Pneumosure XL; Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan) is set on vessel harvest mode with a maximum pressure of 8 mm Hg, and connected to the trocar port to insufflate the subfascial compartment. The laparoscopic camera is then used to perform an initial exploration of the space and to assist in the placement of the second trocar, a 5-mm laparoscopic port (CTF03 Kii Fios First Entry; Applied Medical). This is placed 5 to 8 cm above the initial point of access under direct endoscopic visualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Then, 5-mm laparoscopic monopolar scissors (ENDOPATH 5DCS; Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, Ohio) are used to dissect in the subfascial plane in an inferior to superior and lateral to medial fashion. First, the row of musculocutaneous—or septomusculocutaneous—perforators will become apparent; these are carefully isolated from the surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). As the exploration proceeds medially, the intermuscular septum becomes visible; meticulous dissection ensues to expose the septocutaneous perforators located within this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Finally, surface mapping of the perforators is achieved by palpating externally while visualizing the working space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813487490"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). At this point, the video-assisted portion of the procedure is concluded, the trocars are withdrawn, the excess CO<sub>2</sub> is released, and the access points are closed in 2 layers with absorbable suture. Depending on the width of the skin paddle, trocar incisions can sometimes be included in the lateral boundary of the flap.</p>

<p>The data retrieved from the charts included demographics, defect location and extension, findings on endoscopic and open exploration, operative time, free flap size (cm<sup>2</sup>), flap outcomes, and primary/donor site morbidity. The location of the cutaneous perforators was documented based on their relationship to the midpoint of the ASIS-patella line as described by Yu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487490">16</xref></sup> Perforators located at the midpoint were defined as “B,” while those located up to 5 cm above or below the midpoint were named as “A” and “C,” respectively. Location “D” was defined as perforators arising distal to location C, while vessels proximal to position A were defined as “T,” given their origin, which is usually the transverse branch of the LCFA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487490">16</xref></sup> Perforators found during the endoscopic exploration were marked on the skin, and their location was documented as per the described nomenclature. Given the lack of objective data supporting this approach, open thigh exploration as described by Lin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487490">11</xref></sup> was performed in all the cases to confirm the endoscopic findings. The same perforator nomenclature system was used for both stages of the procedure.</p>
<p>The data analysis was generated using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0 (Armonk, New York). Descriptive analyses were used to categorize findings, while Pearson correlation test was used to compare outcomes between techniques. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic>≤.05; no adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 26 patients included in the cohort, 17 men and 9 women with a mean age of 60.3 years (range, 44-83 years). The demographic characteristics of the cohort are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813487490"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Most patients were Caucasian (n = 17), and the most common location of the defect was the oral cavity (n = 11), followed by pharyngolaryngeal (n = 7) and cutaneous (n = 6).The average flap size was 91 cm<sup>2</sup>, with a range of 39 to 264 cm<sup>2</sup>. A double skin paddle flap was harvested in 6 cases to meet the specific reconstructive needs of the case or for flap monitoring. Overall, all flaps survived, but a partial flap loss was observed in 2 cases (15% and 20% of the total flap area, respectively). In 1 of these cases, this was secondary to infection, while in the second case, it appeared related to excessive tension at the closure line. All donor sites were closed primarily, with the exception of 1 case, in which a split-thickness skin graft was necessary. There were no complications associated with the trocar incisions.</p>

<p>Surgical reexploration was needed in 1 patient for a postoperative hematoma, which was found to originate from a previous pectoralis major flap and not related to the ALT. The pedicle was inspected, but no microvascular revision was necessary. In this case, both cutaneous paddles were viable in the long term.</p>
<p>One patient with a circumferential pharyngeal defect developed a pharyngocutaneous salivary fistula that was managed conservatively. The patient resumed a regular diet several weeks postoperatively.</p>
<p>The location of cutaneous perforators as identified by endoscopic and open exploration is detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813487490"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Overall, the findings were concordant in 22 cases, meaning that no additional vessels were found on open approach. In 4 cases, open exploration revealed the presence of additional perforators—1 in each case—which were identified on locations T, A, C, and D, respectively. Collectively, 53 cutaneous perforators were found in the 26 explored thighs, yielding an average of 2.04 vessels per extremity. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813487490"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> summarizes the location of the perforators as found by the video-assisted and open approaches. Vessels located at the midpoint of the ASIS-patella line (or its immediate vicinity) were successfully identified with the video-assisted technique in 100% of the cases. The accuracy of the technique decreased as perforators became more distant to this location (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813487490"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Overall, there was a high degree of correlation between the video-assisted and open technique (Pearson’s Correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.092, <italic>P</italic> = .000), and the estimated sensitivity for this approach was 92.4% (confidence interval, 80.9-97.5).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The anterolateral thigh free flap has several characteristics that make it ideal for reconstruction of head and neck defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490">3</xref></sup> including the amount of available tissue, long pedicle, robust blood supply, and its potential as a chimeric flap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487490">9</xref></sup> Despite these, harvesting is still considered challenging because of the variability of lateral thigh perforators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813487490">14</xref></sup> Multiple approaches have been described to address this problem, starting with refinements in the surgical technique and better systematization of the perforator anatomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487490">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487490">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813487490">17</xref></sup> which are of little assistance in the presence of uncommon anatomical variations such as absent perforators or vessels originating directly from the profunda femoral system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487490">16</xref></sup> The implications of these variations are not to be underestimated because they commonly call for an abortion of the procedure. A much more common situation is identifying a single cutaneous perforator, which is the case in approximately 25% of the cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487490">11</xref></sup> This anatomical configuration precludes the use of a double skin paddle flap, particularly useful for certain head and neck defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813487490">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487490">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487490">8</xref></sup> As such, it becomes clear that preoperative identification of cutaneous perforators is desirable when planning the reconstruction of head and neck defects with an ALT.</p>
<p>The handheld Doppler has been extensively used for perforator mapping. This simple device has the advantages of being widely available and noninvasive, but its accuracy is significantly affected by the thickness of subcutaneous tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487490">16</xref></sup> In a recent systematic literature review, Doppler was found to have a high sensitivity (98.7%) but a specificity of only 18.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813487490">12</xref></sup>; for this reason, the device is not routinely used by the author for the purpose of perforator mapping.</p>
<p>Radiological approaches for perforator mapping include Doppler ultrasound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813487490">13</xref></sup> and CTA, which has become particularly popular. In a recent report of 196 extremities assessed with CTA, cutaneous perforators were identified in 88.8%, and in only 47% of these, they were located at the midpoint of the ASIS-patella line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813487490">18</xref></sup> It must be noticed, however, that these findings were not confirmed by open exploration, still considered the gold standard for the descriptive anatomy of perforators. In a comparative study between CTA and open exploration, Garvey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813487490">14</xref></sup> reported a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 90% for the technique, concluding that it was better at identifying proximal vessels and those of larger caliber. These findings highlight the potential impact of preoperative perforator localization on surgical planning. Some of the disadvantages of CTA include its relatively low sensitivity, increase in treatment costs, and unnecessary radiation to the patients.</p>
<p>Near-infrared laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography has emerged as another alternative for preoperative identification of thigh perforators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487490">9</xref></sup> but there are no specific data on its objective predictive value.</p>
<p>At our institution, the anterolateral thigh flap has become the workhorse for soft-tissue reconstruction of the head and neck. The familiarity with the technique and anatomy was critical in the development of the minimally invasive approach herein presented. In addition to describing the technique, one of the main goals was to assess its predictive value with regard to the cutaneous perforators of the thigh. A high degree of correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92) was found between this approach and open exploration findings, and the calculated sensitivity of 92.4% compares well to the sensitivity of CTA in a similar setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813487490">14</xref></sup> On a more detailed analysis, the endoscopic approach was found to be particularly accurate for detecting perforators located at or around the midpoint of the ASIS-patella line. This is relevant because this was the most common perforator location in this study, which is in agreement with previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487490">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487490">16</xref></sup> Vessels located up to 5 cm above or below the ASIS-patella midpoint (A-C) were also detected consistently with the technique. This is relevant because the vast majority of the lateral thigh perforators will be located within this range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490">3</xref></sup> Vessels located outside this range are much less common (collectively 9.4% in this series), and for perforators in these locations, the video-assisted technique was not as effective. In the case of high perforators (location T), the drop in sensitivity appeared related to the presence of the tensor fascia lata muscle, which is superficial to the subfascial compartment and limits the height of the working space. In the case of very low perforators (location D), the phenomenon could be secondary to the small caliber of the vessels and proximity of the trocars.</p>
<p>An inherent limitation of the technique is its lack of information regarding the vascular origin of the perforating vessels. Perforators arising from different pedicles pose a significant challenge when a double skin paddle flap is planned. This anatomical disposition was present in 1 patient of the series (case 14), and the reconstruction was successfully completed by harvesting the second skin paddle as a perforator flap and anastomosing it to the main pedicle as a flow-through flap. From the author’s perspective, the vascular origin of the perforator does not have a significant impact in flap design or outcomes when a single cutaneous paddle is planned. While the descending branch of the LCFA is usually regarded as the pedicle of the flap, an alternative origin of the cutaneous perforators has been described in 16% to 34% of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487490">3</xref></sup> Of these, the oblique—or unnamed—branch is the most commonly found alternative pedicle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813487490">10</xref></sup> and it can be identified only upon open exploration or contrasted vascular imaging. It is important to recognize that the presence of an alternative vascular pedicle does not hinder the successful harvesting of the flap or result in higher failure rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813487490">10</xref></sup> Essentially, the ALT flap can be based indistinctly on the descending or oblique branch of the LCFA. The impact of variations in the pedicle origin is minimal when compared with variations in the perforator anatomy, which is where the technique excels.</p>
<p>The learning curve of the technique appears to be approximately 15 cases, after which point changes in operative time are minor. After overcoming the learning curve, the average time for the endoscopic exploration was 18 minutes, which is acceptable taking into account the potential benefits in flap design and donor site morbidity. This is especially true for a double-team approach, when there is usually less time pressure on the reconstructive surgeon. In this setting, the additional allotted time can be used to refine the flap design in light of the video-assisted findings.</p>
<p>Decreasing donor site morbidity should be a constant consideration for reconstructive microsurgeons and endoscopic techniques have been widely used to achieve this goal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813487490">19</xref></sup> In this regard, the morbidity of the ALT is usually considered as low,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813487490">5</xref></sup> but its real incidence could be underestimated. In a recent systematic review, donor site morbidity was associated with a large skin paddle, sacrifice of a motor nerve, excessive proximal dissection, and an extensive fascial component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813487490">20</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the design of the present study did not allow for an empirical comparison between open and endoscopic techniques from the donor site standpoint. It is worth noting, however, that the absence of perforators (in 1 case) was appropriately identified with this approach and confirmed by open exploration. In the future, under this scenario, the morbidity of an open incision could be completely avoided as an alternative donor site is explored. The nature of the study called for an open exploration in all cases; however, in a noncomparative setting, the technique has a great potential to reduce donor site morbidity by reducing length of the incisions and assisting with the design of the skin paddles (see the video at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.otojournal.org">www.otojournal.org</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The video-assisted technique presented offers a safe and reliable method to identify the cutaneous perforators of the lateral thigh, particularly around the midpoint of the ASIS-patella line. This procedure is straightforward, and it has a moderate learning curve. This minimally invasive approach has a role in decreasing donor site morbidity and assisting in the design of chimeric free flaps.</p>
