<p>Most social scientists are by now very familiar with the ways in which neo-liberalisation has transformed the matrix of city spaces, entailing intensified differentiation, displacement of the poor and a significant degree of conflict and contestation. In this way, Swapna Banerjee-Guha’s recent edited volume <italic>Accumulation by Dispossession: Transformative Cities in the New Global Order</italic> does not entail a lot of new material on the theoretical side of things. I also found the title of the book to be somewhat misleading for a few different reasons. First, while chapters from David Harvey and Saskia Sassen provide some interesting insights that are no doubt worthy of consideration by scholars interested in neo-liberalisation and changing urban dynamics, I had hoped for a greater theoretical extension of the ideas that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012467839">Karl Marx (1867/1976)</xref> first put forward in the first volume of <italic>Capital</italic> and that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012467839">Harvey (2003)</xref> himself later expanded upon in <italic>The New Imperialism</italic>. In other words, a title like <italic>Accumulation by Dispossession</italic> to me promises a rigorous discussion of the historical origins of primitive accumulation as the underpinning principle of capitalism itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012467839">Perelman, 2000</xref>) and, more importantly, an exposition of primitive accumulation as a continuing tenet of a capitalist mode of production, ingrained within its very logic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012467839">Glassman, 2006</xref>). It is for this very reason that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012467839">Harvey (2003)</xref> redubbed primitive accumulation as ‘accumulation by dispossession’, which ultimately serves to reflect the continuity of capitalism’s most enduring feature: violence. Unfortunately, these important facets appear to be missed opportunities even as Banerjee-Guha seemed obliged to attend to them, given the actual title that was chosen.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are not offered a clear indication of what is meant by ‘accumulation by dispossession’ in the introductory chapter and, while this can be inferred from the chapters that follow, offering some clarification from the outset would have really benefited the presentation of the arguments throughout. Again, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012467839">Harvey’s (2003)</xref> own work could have provided some substantial insights here, as he refers to accumulation by dispossession as specifically those practices that operate and evolve through the violent expulsion of peasants through land privatisation, the conversion of common property rights into exclusive property rights, the commodification of labour, the suppression of alternative and indigenous forms of production and consumption, the appropriation of natural resources, the continuation of slavery through the sex industry, the monetisation of exchange and taxation, and the proliferation of usury. Banerjee-Guha probably should have given some indication of how this volume makes use of these various iterations of accumulation by dispossession, or even potentially expands upon or adds to them, but instead the introductory chapter imparts us with a well-trodden overview of the geographies of globalisation.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is no mention of South Asia or India anywhere in the title, even though—aside from an out-of-place chapter on Vienna by Heinz Nissel and the aforementioned chapters by Harvey and Sassen which, although providing some discussion of Seoul, New York and Paris, remain largely within the realm of theory—the focus of the book is concerned with the empirical context of South Asia. Leaving aside an additional chapter on Dhaka by Nazrul Islam and Salma A. Shafi, the book is actually entirely focused on various cities in India. While the chapter from Islam and Shafi seems to mesh well within the larger focus of the volume and, given the shared history of Bangladesh and India, it seems appropriate to include it here, Nissel’s chapter in contrast seems like an odd choice for inclusion, even though his argument is compelling. I am not against comparative studies by any means, as one of the lessons that recent literature on neo-liberalisation has taught us is that there is a great degree of contextual specificity within the various institutional contexts and regulatory frameworks that neo-liberalism articulates; hence, a comparative focus is an ideal approach in contesting the monolithic view of neo-liberalism producing a homogeneous bulldozer effect, an interpretation that Banerjee-Guha’s volume appropriately challenges. However, I cannot help but think that this book would have much more of an impact if it was pitched to readers as a detailed and rigorous analysis of the neo-liberalising practices and spatial crises that have unfolded in Indian or South Asian cities, rather than as a more diverse volume that looks at how these issues have played out globally without having the empirical depth or diversity to sustain this sort of claim.</p>
<p>The compiled chapters bring a strong empirical charge to the contradictions between the claims and counter-claims of the rich and poor as neo-liberalisation has been effected in cities across South Asia (and in Austria) and thereby affords readers with a deeper understanding of how neo-liberalising processes bite down upon and rub up against the actual spaces of cities in India. The detailing of what all this actually means for marginalised peoples is the book’s primary strength. Thus, despite the mismatch between what this volume promises and what it actually delivers, it nevertheless has wide scholarly appeal. <italic>Accumulation by Dispossession</italic> will be useful not only to academics conducting research within the domain of urban studies in India, but anthropologists, sociologists and political scientists working in a wide range of contexts should appreciate the detailed analyses of transformed urban forms arising from the accumulative practices that neo-liberalisation necessarily entails. Indeed, Banerjee-Guha’s volume offers an excellent opportunity to think through how the trajectories of Indian cities might inform our understandings of similar political, economic and social developments that continue to evolve and play themselves out in other specific contexts undergoing neo-liberalisation. Geographers in particular will find this to be an informative symposium of recent debates within the discipline surrounding exclusionary modes of governance and altered governmentalities arising from neo-liberal discourse, while the volume’s recognition of and attention to the fragmented spatialisation of dispossession and increasing polarisation of urban communities will similarly have significant resonance.</p>
