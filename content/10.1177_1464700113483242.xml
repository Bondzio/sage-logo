<abstract>
<p>This article considers the role of beauty in Costa Rican sex work. In the context of sex tourism, beauty operates as affective labour performed by sex workers, labour that is mediated by deeply contradictory understandings of race and nation. Theorising beauty as a form of affective labour means thinking about beauty as value, as something that circulates, can be exchanged and is ultimately relational. While Costa Rica's national mythology has long focused on claims to white origins, sex tourists identify local women's ‘exoticism’ and non-whiteness as particularly appealing. Commercial sex does not simply depend on an imperial male gaze, but rather requires us to consider how particular national mythologies about race are linked to ideals of attractiveness in complex ways. I also explore how women experience and manage their sexual attractiveness to foreign tourists in their daily lives and work.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464700113483242" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has been a veritable explosion of literature exploring the role of affect in relation to labour markets since Arlie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464700113483242">Hochschild's original ground-breaking book (1983)</xref> on emotion in the workplace. Efforts to build upon Hochschild's work have led to a proliferation of new concepts, including body work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464700113483242">Wolkowitz, 2006</xref>), body labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483242">Kang, 2010</xref>), affective labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464700113483242">Hardt, 1999</xref>), and intimate labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483242">Boris and Salazar Parreñas, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464700113483242">1</xref></sup> Not all of the literature on affect has acknowledged feminist theorising, and attempts to develop new definitions frequently offer only slight variations in terms of whether the focus is on private or public spheres, unpaid or paid work, biological or social phenomena, or an attempt to transcend these distinctions altogether. Bonnie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464700113483242">McElhinny (2010)</xref> rightly asks why there is so much recent interest in affect in current academic theorising. The answer can at least partially be found in the particular characteristics of the post-industrial, neoliberal era; indeed, numerous scholars have drawn our attention to the central role of affect in an economy increasingly based on services. As Brian Massumi argues, ‘the ability of affect to produce an economic effect more swiftly and surely than economics itself means that affect is itself a real condition, an intrinsic variable of the late-capitalist system, as infrastructural as the factory’ (1995: 106). Affective labour, or the production of immaterial, intangible feelings, whether of well-being, satisfaction or passion, is key to late capitalism, and this includes the increasing dissolution of distinctions between markets and intimate spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483242">Bernstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464700113483242">Hardt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464700113483242">Lancaster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1464700113483242">Zelizer 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464700113483242">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>But what role does beauty play in an affect economy? As Rebecca Coleman and Mónica Moreno Figueroa argue,<disp-quote>
<p>affect is a productive way of exploring beauty because it emphasises not only content but also <italic>process</italic>; that is, it is not only necessary to examine specific beauty practices (of make-up, hair styling, dieting and cosmetic surgery, for example), but it is also important to see beauty as an embodied social, cultural and economic process. (2011: 358; emphasis in original)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>How might we understand the role of beauty in the context of affective <italic>labour</italic> more specifically? And what happens when that labour takes place in the sex industry? By focusing on sex tourism to Costa Rica, this article explores how beauty operates as a form of affective labour performed by sex workers, mediated by deeply contradictory understandings of race and nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464700113483242">3</xref></sup> Theorising beauty as a form of affective labour means thinking about beauty as value, as something that circulates, can be exchanged, might produce more value, and is ultimately relational. This also means considering how the contradictions between whiteness and exoticism come together in a specifically Costa Rican context, and how beauty gets deployed by sex workers and purchased by sex tourists, because ‘the desiring psyche is a political and economic entity … and political economy is thoroughly invested with consumer and sexual desire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464700113483242">Edmonds, 2010</xref>: 104). The first section of this article briefly considers how beauty intersects with ideas about race in Costa Rican national discourse, as well as within sex tourists’ discussion of what they are looking for when travelling to Costa Rica. This sets the stage for the second section, which focuses on how sex workers understand beauty as a form of affective labour that is highly productive, while also divisive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464700113483242" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This article draws on an ethnographic study of the sex tourism industry in San José, including fourteen months of non-participant observation in three bars, the state's HIV/AIDS prevention clinic, and two non-governmental organisations (NGOs). I also carried out over one hundred and thirty in-depth semi-structured interviews with sex workers, sex tourists, and state, NGO and private sector employees, as well as some archival and online research. Interviews took place in a variety of locations, including bars, the state clinic, the NGOs, and private homes. Interviewees chose their own pseudonyms, and all names and identifying features have been changed. The men and women I interviewed were a diverse group, making it difficult to provide a portrait of the ‘average’ sex tourist or sex worker. All interviews with sex tourists were in English, while interviews with sex workers were in Spanish. All translations are my own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464700113483242">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>I am aware of the political and methodological difficulties in attempting to speak with authority about the lives of North American sex tourists and Costa Rican sex workers. Gender, race, class, and age always affect interviews, yet one's status as an insider or outsider is never static; it depends on particular contexts and perspectives, and on the choices we make about emphasising different aspects of knowledge and identity with different groups and situations. This was very much the case in my research, which included making distinct social contacts with interviewees. Beverley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464700113483242">Mullings (1999)</xref> describes this as the creation of ‘positional spaces’ in which the situated knowledges of the researcher and the interviewee come together to create trust and cooperation. While reflecting on power in the field is a necessary and ongoing component of feminist research, I am cautious about giving too much importance to these issues, as dwelling on them extensively can lead to paternalistic constructions of ‘third world’ women, especially sex workers, as passive and in need of rescue (usually by white feminists). Some sex workers I was closest with during fieldwork cheerfully refused to be interviewed. Once given information about the research, sex workers were able to decide whether or not to participate and did so without hesitation. While it is crucial to think through questions of power and privilege in research, we also must remember that despite the inherent methodological and ethical dilemmas, participants are never just passive. Interviewees engage in a range of strategies to resist their positioning, to intervene in and comment on the research process, and to achieve their own goals through participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464700113483242">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1464700113483242"><title>Race, nation, and tourism</title>
<p>Feminist theorists have argued that beauty is primarily about patriarchal oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483242">Bordo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464700113483242">Faludi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483242">Jeffreys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1464700113483242">Wolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1464700113483242">Young, 1980</xref>), given the primacy of the male gaze in determining and defining women's desirability. However, as others demonstrate, it is necessary to think about how discourses of beauty are also always discourses about race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483242">Craig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464700113483242">Graham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483242">Kang, 2010</xref>). Many scholars have considered the racism of dominant beauty standards, arguing that beauty has been used as a form of racist and sexist disciplining of women (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483242">Banks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464700113483242">Craig, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464700113483242">Gilman, 1986</xref>). Theorising from a Latin American and Caribbean context is useful for getting at the nuances of beauty as more than a tool of patriarchy, as a phenomenon linked to ideas about race and nation specific to particular locales and histories. For example, intersections of race and beauty in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464700113483242">Edmonds, 2010</xref>), Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464700113483242">Moreno Figueroa, 2012</xref>) and Ecuador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483242">Casanova, 2011</xref>) are quite different from those in Costa Rica. And the myths of racial democracy (in Brazil), <italic>mestizaje</italic> (in Mexico), and white settlement (in Costa Rica) all lead to significant variations around ideals of beauty and its value.</p>
<p>Costa Rica has a long history of being defined as ‘exceptional’ in Central America, based in part on claims to white origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464700113483242">Giglioli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464700113483242">Jiménez Matarrita, 1997</xref>). The representation of Costa Rica as a peaceful, democratic ‘Switzerland of Central America’ is ‘one of the most attractive and widely disseminated national mythologies of any Latin American nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464700113483242">Paige, 1997</xref>: 219–220). Costa Rican intellectuals writing about national identity have rarely engaged with broader debates on the conditions and cultural history of the region as a whole and claims to whiteness have been used to explain social, economic, political, and cultural rationality and order. In contrast, <italic>mestizaje</italic> has been associated with conflict in the rest of Central America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464700113483242">Jiménez Matarrita, 2005</xref>). As such, Costa Rica distanced itself from the discourses of racial mixing found to varying degrees throughout Latin America and instead emphasised the nation's privileged position on what Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1464700113483242">Wade (2001</xref>: 849) calls ‘a global scale of whiteness’. These ideas were reinforced by academic accounts of the country as unique, relying on colonial isolation from the Spanish empire and racial homogeneity to explain Costa Rica's comparative prosperity (see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464700113483242">Booth and Walker, 1999</xref>; Skidmore and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464700113483242">Smith, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464700113483242">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The myth of whiteness and peace has long been used internationally by elites promoting the image of a healthy, hard-working, orderly, and patriotic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464700113483242">Jiménez Matarrita, 2005</xref>), and Costa Rican exceptionalism continues to play an important role in official tourism marketing, representing the country as simultaneously exotic and safe, making it especially welcoming for US tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464700113483242">Rivers-Moore, 2007</xref>). Costa Rica's historical construction of national identity as based on whiteness, the nation as ‘exception’ in a region of <italic>mestizaje</italic>, is also deployed in discussions of sex tourism to explain foreign tourists' attraction to Costa Rican women. For example, a former senior employee of the national tourism board suggested that<disp-quote>
<p>we Costa Ricans are more beautiful. If you compare Costa Ricans with the rest of Central America, ticos are more beautiful. Costa Rican women are in first place in Latin America … in fact, in Central America you can’t get women like the Costa Ricans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464700113483242">7</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But what is it that allegedly makes Costa Ricans more beautiful? According to the same interviewee, ‘we don't have any indigenous people, we're pure’. Similarly, a senior legislative assistant argued that sex tourism is so popular in Costa Rica because the country has a ‘less indigenous genetic composition … the physical characteristics of Costa Ricans are a little different and that, mixed with our level of education, makes us attractive’. The head of security at a large hotel in San José's sex tourism neighbourhood added ‘we don't have illiteracy here and the women are beautiful, they have beautiful features. In other countries they're more like Indians [<italic>sic</italic>]’. Though a key element of the attraction of Costa Rica for sex tourists is racialised sexual difference, as we will see below, discursive constructions of Costa Rican national identity rely on representations that are also racialised but in ways that contradict the exoticism that sex tourists seek out. By equating whiteness with beauty, Costa Rican nationalist discourse is flexible enough to incorporate, and provide an explanation for, the booming sex tourism industry.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, whiteness and education level were not among the features that sex tourists identified as especially attractive about Costa Rican sex workers. The search for the ‘Other’ remains associated with ideas about race, class, and gender that are decidedly modern and have long histories. Compelling work has been done on representations of ‘third world’ tourism destinations in texts and images, as advertising, guidebooks, and travel writing reveal the connections between tourism and colonial discourses of backwardness and exoticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464700113483242">Dubinsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464700113483242">Kaplan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464700113483242">Pratt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1464700113483242">Pritchard and Morgan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464700113483242">Sheller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1464700113483242">Spurr, 1993</xref>). As Jacqui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483242">Alexander (1998)</xref> notes, tourism patterns tend to follow earlier imperial geographies, reproducing colonial boundaries and relying on colonial mythologies of servile and hypersexual natives.</p>
<p>Within the tourism industry, difference is gendered, racialised, and often sexualised; the tourist is constructed as an explorer who is almost always male. These patterns are deeply connected to histories of colonial conquest. The colonies operated as sites beyond bourgeois cultural inhibitions, providing economic and sexual opportunities for masculinity. The management of sexuality and morality was central to imperial projects. In the Latin American context, many scholars have discussed the long history of sexual contact between white men and women of colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483242">Cabezas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483242">Chaves, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464700113483242">Franco, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464700113483242">Martínez-Alier, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483242">McClintock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464700113483242">Smith, 1997</xref>); indeed, Latin America is arguably the ideal place to study the racialisation of sex and the sexualisation of race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1464700113483242">Wade et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Transnational travel for sex in Latin America is not new, as transracial encounters served to guarantee European hegemony through social and affective bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464700113483242">Pratt, 1992</xref>). The desirability of the exotic, primitive ‘Other’ so evident in the period of colonial rule continues to play a central role in travel to Latin America for sex tourism. Sex tourists interviewed for this research insisted that sexuality in Costa Rica was exaggerated: ‘down here, sexuality is different. Sexually, I think they go out of their way to satisfy a man’ (Jeff). Darryl, a New York construction worker, explained ‘sexuality here is not the same as it is in the United States and Canada. Here, women find sex as enjoyable as a man does.’ Sex tourists assumed that women's enjoyment of sex was natural and unconnected to payment for services rendered, and many sex tourists generalised about all Costa Rican women, rather than speaking specifically about sex workers. For example, Craig, an unemployed Canadian in his early thirties, said ‘the women here are hornier than in North America. I don't know why … the life style, their way of being. Women really want sex here, more than at home. They even want sex if they're not being paid for it, the payment is just the icing on the cake.’ John, a construction worker from North Carolina, was even more precise: ‘Costa Rican women, they all wear really tight clothes. They know their sexuality, they enjoy sex. There's some truth to the hot Latina blood.’</p>
<p>As interviews with state officials and sex tourists demonstrate, beauty is always contested and ‘at any given moment there will be multiple standards of beauty in circulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483242">Craig, 2006</xref>: 160). Beauty has often been associated with innocence, purity, and whiteness, in contrast to the hypersexuality and excessiveness of the bodies of women of colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464700113483242">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483242">Craig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464700113483242">hooks, 1992</xref>). Yet eroticism, exoticism, and beauty all combine and operate messily, particularly in desire for the ‘Other’. Racialised sexuality in the context of the sex tourism industry in San José operates in contradictory ways. While Costa Rican national identity has long relied on notions of whiteness in comparison to Central America, sex tourists seek out contacts with women they consider exotic and hypersexual precisely because they are perceived to be different from North American women. Unable to distinguish between Costa Rican, Colombian, Dominican, and Nicaraguan sex workers, sex tourists covet encounters with women who are racialised universally as ‘hot Latinas’, imagined to be sexually insatiable and to know how to treat a man, whether this is attributed to biology or culture. This contradiction between Costa Rican national identity based on whiteness and the attraction of Costa Rica precisely as a non-white space of difference for tourists is at the heart of sex tourism encounters that involve North American tourists, Costa Rican and non-Costa Rican sex workers, and the state. This demonstrates the importance of considering how intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation change considerably when examined relationally, through various comparative perspectives. Both Costa Rican claims to a national identity defined by whiteness and ‘exceptionalism’ and sex tourists’ essentialising of all sex workers as hypersexual and exotic are forms of symbolic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483242">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>) that depend on unequal inclusions and exclusions that are gendered, racialised, sexualised, national, and spatial.</p>
<p>Sex tourists are attracted to Costa Rica because of the perceived hypersexuality of Latinas, but they also value being seen with beautiful young women. Julio, a forty-six year old divorcé, recounted (with some astonishment) being called handsome by beautiful twenty year old women, adding that it had positively impacted his self-esteem. John Jones, a sixty-three year old teacher, said ‘I'm unwanted in the States, even though I'm educated and easy-going. But I'm wanted down here.’ He went on to clarify, ‘the reality of Costa Rica is it's an economic exchange. You, as an older man, represent security. She represents youth and beauty, and it's an exchange.’ The pleasure of participating in the sex industry in Costa Rica is not just sexual, but is also about spending time in the presence of beautiful young women. As JR explained, ‘they're beautiful women. And you pick the one that you want. There's no greater power for a man than to sit in a chair and say “I'll take that one”.’ This provision of affect, the intangible but highly coveted sense of self-esteem and value that comes from acquiring the attention of attractive young women is, in fact, what most distinguishes sex tourism work from sex work in the nearby red-light district that caters to national clientele. In the red-light district, negotiations are undertaken on the street or in brothels, and the sexual-economic transactions themselves are swift (often lasting five or ten minutes). In sex tourism, sex workers spend many hours with their tourist clients, drinking, eating, gambling, and listening. While the sexual encounter is important, the time spent beforehand is also crucial. During one interview with four friends who travelled to San José together from the US, Moe was encouraged to tell me how beautiful his date from the previous night was. Moe described the woman in great detail, expressing his delight that a twenty-five year old ‘world class beauty’ had agreed to sex with him, a fifty-five year old man. Describing the evening the group spent at an expensive restaurant, Bobby explained ‘it was actually like we were on dates with them, on real dates.’ Joe added ‘sex is only part of it. For guys our age, it's the hanging out, partying with them, dancing with them, that's the best part.’ While sex is the most obvious service being paid for, Costa Rican women's beauty is also highly valued. But its value comes not just from the sexual exchange, but also through the emotional nourishment that beauty provides to North American men. Sociality, then, is central to the pleasures being purchased.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464700113483242"><title>Beauty as affective labour</title>
<p>Similar to the tourists quoted above, sex tourism workers interviewed considered their work to include myriad aspects other than the provision of simple sexual release. As Yorleny succinctly stated, ‘I offer a service’. That service includes sex, but also requires the skills of a tourism guide, massage therapist, actor, psychologist, companion, and friend. Lindsay, a twenty-two year old with previous experience working in strip clubs, explained ‘you have to be very patient … You listen, you try to console them. Sometimes they pay to talk, sleep and nothing else.’ Tamara added ‘there are gringos that are unbearable. But you treat them well because it's your job.’ But how do sex workers experience the role of beauty in their working lives? What does it mean to deploy sex appeal and eroticism as a form of affective labour, day after day, on the job? In this section, I consider how sex workers understand the need to perform a particular aesthetic, how they embrace beauty as part of their work, and how beauty gets used in ways that often serve to sustain divisions between women.</p>
<p>Few sex workers had much to say about themselves as exoticised, racialised subjects. Several expressed some awareness of the way they were seen by tourists. According to Micaela:<disp-quote>
<p>Clients tell me that Latin American women are sexier by nature. I think maybe it’s not that we’re sexier by nature, it’s that we’re being paid. They say American women are really cold, really rough, but if they’re not getting anything in return, why would they want to do anything [sexual]?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Others compared themselves with the women that sex tourists travelled to get away from, suggesting that there were indeed significant differences, partly personality and partly aesthetics. Carolina, a thirty-three year old Colombian, said ‘gringos love Latinas. We have a way of treating them that European women don't have. We're very loving. We don't feel anything for them, but we make them feel like kings'. Valentina, nineteen, added: ‘gringas are like men. They don't wear high heels or the colour pink. They get very fat after they have kids’. Similarly, Susan, a thirty year old sex worker from San José explained succinctly that ‘the gringos come here because they like Latin American women, because North American women are cold, fat and ugly.’</p>
<p>On the basis of the notion that their beauty offered a comparative advantage, sex tourism workers were sure to deploy beauty as a form of affective labour that creates value, in that it operates as a key way of accessing income from gringo clients. Ruby explained, ‘we play with the weapons we have: seduction, youth and beauty.’ Sex workers were clear about the need to market themselves in particular ways in order to ensure the continuation of the industry:<disp-quote>
<p>You have to be an actor so that he’ll say ‘wow! I loved that!’ And that’s good for you, because then he’ll go to his country, he’ll tell his friends, and they’ll come back, and then you’ll make more money. It’s better if they go to their countries saying ‘wow, they’re marvellous women, very hot, they’re incredible!’ (Micaela)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Marketing a consistent image of Costa Rican womanhood as particularly beautiful and sexually attractive is central to sex workers’ labour with tourists. This aspect of their work, the regular deployment of eroticism and physical attractiveness, plays a significant role in ensuring that tourists return to the country, thus securing sex workers’ incomes.</p>
<p>Sex workers expressed a general consensus about the significance of physical appearance. Ronda explained the importance of youthful beauty: ‘you have to invest so that you can take advantage of those years. Invest in make-up, exotic clothes. After that you get old, you get fat …’. While youth is a distinct plus, beauty and sex appeal require notable effort and financial commitment. Estela and Patria explained the costs of dressing for work:
<list id="list1-1464700113483242" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Estela: I only wear clothing from Colombia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1464700113483242">8</xref></sup> Trousers from Colombia cost me ¢25,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1464700113483242">9</xref></sup> And blouses are between ¢8000 and ¢15,000.

<list-item><p>Patria: It's very necessary for this job. What work is a woman without make-up going to get? … For me [make-up] is very important because it changes your appearance. But it has a cost, just like clothing.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As Sara Ahmed points out, ‘the accumulation of affective value shapes the surfaces of bodies and worlds’ (2004: 121). Sex workers are well-aware that sex tourists are especially interested in being seen, and having sex, with young women who are well turned-out and have made an effort to look beautiful. By foregrounding beauty and sex appeal in their interactions with sex tourists, sex workers go to great lengths to ensure that value is produced through ‘enlivening, capacitating, and modulating affect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464700113483242">Wissinger, 2007</xref>: 234).</p>
<p>The importance of make-up and clothing was confirmed by the informal sale of both at many sex tourism bars in San José. Several Colombian sex workers made extra money selling clothing purchased in Colombia to other women. A non-sex worker did the rounds of the sex tourism businesses in San José selling make-up, jewellery, and lingerie on credit. Her arrival was always greeted with excitement, especially when business was slow and women were bored. Whatever was available for sale would be spread across the bar and sex workers, bartenders and other staff would try items on, mull over their choices, and make down payments. Sales were brisk. Lengthy conversations were had about where women had their eyebrows tattooed and for how much. Sex workers’ physical appearances were constantly being discussed and worked on, in order to secure and maintain the interest of tourists willing to pay for women’s sex appeal. In a particularly funny exchange, Anika told me she was due for her technical appraisal at Riteve, the state agency that checks vehicle emissions and safety. Though she was actually referring to her fortnightly appointments at the state HIV/AIDS prevention clinic, Anika's comparison of her body's regular physical examinations to a car's need for servicing was indicative of the importance of paying close attention to the physicality of women's work in the sex industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1464700113483242">10</xref></sup> Plastic surgery, though still relatively uncommon in Costa Rica's sex industry, was another way that some women made investments in their bodily presentations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1464700113483242">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of beauty as a form of affective labour is not unique to the sex industry; indeed, ‘the human body … [is] the site of capital investment for the realization of profit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464700113483242">Wissinger, 2007</xref>: 234) in a wide variety of jobs in the twenty-first century. This is particularly the case with service sector work, and the tourism industry is a prime example. Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483242">Adkins’ research (1995)</xref> demonstrates that what is purchased in tourism is a social experience, requiring that frontline tourism workers’ social characteristics like age, race, and gender, become part of what is being sold to consumers. Attractiveness is frequently a condition of employment in the service sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1464700113483242">Williams and Connell, 2010</xref>), to the point that, as Adkins argues, ‘one of women's main roles in customer relations work is the sexual servicing of male customers’ (1995: 135). Beauty and sex appeal are crucial to service sector work in general, not just in the sex industry. It is worth noting that all the sex workers interviewed for this research had experience in other jobs, primarily service work such as domestic work, retail, and waiting tables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1464700113483242">12</xref></sup> Several sex workers had previously worked as demonstrators, giving out free samples or demonstrating the use of products in grocery stores and shopping centres, dressed in tight and revealing clothing (classified advertisements usually specify that applicants must be between eighteen and twenty-six years old and demonstrate excellent ‘personal presentation’). Many drew parallels between their previous job experiences and the sex industry, underlining the significantly higher remuneration for fewer hours of work available in sex tourism.</p>
<p>Alongside sex workers themselves, academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483242">Agustín, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483242">Chapkis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464700113483242">Oerton and Phoenix, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464700113483242">Wolkowitz, 2006</xref>) have drawn parallels between sex work and other kinds of service work. But sex workers also use their participation in affective labour to <italic>distinguish</italic> between themselves and other working-class women. The requirements of smart clothes, manicures, salon haircuts, professional waxing, and other aesthetic treatments ensure that sex tourism workers will not be mistaken for working-class women in factory or domestic work, jobs that women described as physically taxing, dirty, and poorly paid. Sex workers emphasise their investments in beauty to counter the stigma of both poverty and sex work. The content of the practices of beauty, when deployed as affective labour, makes beauty an embodied social process. Embracing beauty as a key form of affective labour allows sex workers to present a vision of successful womanhood. It is worth noting, however, that sex work remains highly stigmatised, with most sex workers struggling to hide their work from their families and communities. As such, claims to respectability through the affective labour of beauty are always partial and potentially contestable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464700113483242">Freeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464700113483242">Rivers-Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1464700113483242">Wilk, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the sex industry, there is a fairly strict divide between work that involves affective labour (in tourism) and work that is a much more direct, quick exchange of sex for money (in the red-light district, for nationals), as discussed above. Sex tourism workers draw on beauty as affective labour in order to distinguish themselves from sex workers in other sectors. Unlike sex workers in the rundown bars and brothels of the red-light district frequented by local clientele, sex tourism workers work in what is considered a ‘nice’ neighbourhood. Sex workers frequently mentioned the comfortable beds in sex tourism hotels, the air conditioning, how classy most of their clients were. Many of the women interviewed claimed to have no knowledge of the red-light district, though they could describe it in great detail. The physical condition of the women who work in the red-light district was often brought up; they were called flabby, vulgar, and aggressive, unlike the glamorous women who work with tourists. For Vanessa,<disp-quote>
<p>the level is different. The majority of women who work there are different, they have a different category of education, they come from more marginal areas. Something marks them, there’s a difference. They don’t mind going with another type of man, a man who isn’t so clean.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Sex tourism workers considered what takes place in the red-light district to be ‘real’ prostitution, in contrast to what they do. They described in minute detail, and often with visceral horror, the damaged bodies, filthy working conditions, and disgusting clients that they imagined women faced, just a few blocks away. Sex workers in the red-light district might be described with pity, but just as often they were constructed as vile drug addicts, willing to exchange sex for a pittance. As Mariana imagined:<disp-quote>
<p>it’s terrible, it must be hell [to work in the red-light district]. They’ll go with anyone … Imagine what it’s like to be with eight, ten men a day. They live <italic>real</italic> prostitution. They touch bottom. We all do the same thing, but there is a difference in that they relate to another type of person … other social classes, other Costa Ricans. There’s a big difference.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Not just any woman can work in sex tourism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1464700113483242">13</xref></sup> It requires an investment in physical appearance, and a willingness to deploy beauty and sex appeal as forms of affective labour over much longer stretches of time with foreign clients. That is, it is less about particular bodies as the starting point and more about a willingness to take part in the affective labour of beauty as a social process. The implication is that anyone could work in the red-light district; indeed, sex tourism workers’ descriptions of red-light district workers emphasise that beauty is not a requirement. The deployment of beauty, then, while serving as a way for sex tourism workers to understand their labour as more prestigious, skilled, and difficult, also serves to reinforce divisions amongst sex working women in San José. As working-class women, sex tourism workers strive to distance themselves from previous work they have had that is considered unskilled (such as domestic and retail work) as well as from even more stigmatised sectors of the sex industry.</p>
<p>While sex workers appear to enjoy the ways in which beauty distinguishes them from other working-class women, especially those in the national sex industry, they remain low-income women and there is stress involved in having to spend money on aesthetics when business is slow. This labour that sex tourism workers perform on their own bodies, as with that of other service workers who must maintain a particular standard of personal presentation, is not explicitly acknowledged or valued in the remuneration they receive. However, compelling research on retail work astutely questions what it might mean to recognise the aesthetic labour of low-wage workers, highlighting how the value of beauty serves to underscore social inequalities of size and age, as well as race and class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1464700113483242">Williams and Connell, 2010</xref>). It is also worth considering what the attention to beauty means for worker solidarity, as the deployment of beauty as affective labour creates divisions among sex workers in potentially unproductive ways. This is significant in Costa Rica, where organising for sex workers’ rights has been haphazard at best. The role of beauty, then, is not just about meeting the male gaze or appeasing tourists’ desires to be seen with beautiful, racially ‘exotic’ women, but in this case it is also very much about how sex tourism workers can use beauty as a classed process that allows them to distinguish themselves from other working-class and poor women.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1464700113483242" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Sex tourism is an embodied social experience that involves affect in crucial ways, particularly through the production of intangibles such as the feeling of being cared for and considered attractive. My research demonstrates that beauty plays a key role in this context, as a kind of required content for interactions in the sex industry but also as a social process, both in terms of men being seen with beautiful young women by other men, and in terms of sex workers’ ability to distinguish between themselves and other working-class women because of the affective labour they provide. In the Costa Rican case, there is the added complication of the contrast between sex tourists’ search for the beauty of the exotic ‘Other’ and the nation state's historical and contemporary claims to whiteness. This contradiction between the white bodies that the state imagines attracts tourists and the exoticism that tourists desire is at the heart of the sex tourism encounter. In addition, sex workers actively engage with the provision of beauty as a form of affective labour, partly to make sex tourists feel good about themselves and partly to market themselves in ways that will attract more clients and thus more income.</p>
<p>Beauty operates in the sex industry as a form of affective labour that is intangible but creates value for all involved. It is also deeply problematic in that it remains highly gendered and racialised, and in the case of sex tourism workers, is used to maintain hierarchies and divisions among women. Similar to aesthetic labour in other kinds of service work, beauty as affective labour in the sex industry potentially reproduces and legitimises social inequalities. Thinking about beauty in the labour market, including the sex industry, helps to demonstrate how attractiveness can be functional for capital.</p>
