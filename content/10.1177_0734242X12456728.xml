<abstract>
<p>The volume of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is growing rapidly worldwide, making its management difficult; therefore, this should be improved as a matter of urgency. WEEE includes both essential household appliances [including televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines; but not air conditioners, where the consumption mode is more like information, communication and technology (ICT)] ICT equipment (also called high-tech household appliances). In the present study, Baoding, a medium-sized, prefecture-level city in north central China with a population of 11 million, including 1.1 million urban residents, was selected as a representative city for an investigation of recycling behaviors. A valid sample size of 346 households in Baoding was investigated, and categorized into various income and educational levels. The results showed that the major reason for discarding WEEE was malfunction of the appliance, accounting for 52% of disposals. Surveyed households with either high income or good education were more likely to consume high-tech household appliances, attracted by advanced technology, versatile functions or flexibility of use. Personal computer ownership rates were highest in households with a high income and good education—1.2 and 0.9 per home respectively. WEEE was most often sold to peddlers or hawkers from where the WEEE flowed into the second-hand market to be refurbished or repaired, and then re-sold. However, 56.3% of residents in the college community were in support of charging consumers for disposal and 61.7% were in support of including a disposal surcharge in the purchase price of new products—a percentage approximately three times that for high-income residents. Thus, high educational level appears to be currently the most important factor in raising the potential of a household’s willingness to pay for WEEE treatment cost. The findings of this study can be used to develop sound recycling systems for WEEE in mainland China.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the rapid development of electronic technology and related industries, the quantity of end-of-life electronics (often referred to as ‘waste electric and electronic equipment’ or WEEE) has been also increasing faster in virtually every country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12456728">Kahhat et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, environmental pollution and human health hazards caused by improper recycling and treatment of WEEE have become critical concerns worldwide. Consequently, the establishment of effective and pragmatic recycling systems for WEEE, and the enactment of regulations to implement these systems and enforce compliance, should be of vital importance. Current recycling channels have been developed by chance, responding primarily to market demand, with no standards for recycling practitioners, methods or prices. In many countries, there is almost a complete lack of effective supervision, regulatory systems or legal frameworks to control the processing of WEEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12456728">Li and Li, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12456728">Li et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, the development and management of recycling systems could reduce pollution and threats to human health caused by improper treatment of WEEE significantly. Thus, many countries have established laws and regulations to manage WEEE recycling. Developed countries have led the way in establishing formal systems for treating WEEE since the early 1990s. The European Union (EU) has enacted directives on electrical and electronic equipment and its treatment—the Directive 2002/96/EC on WEEE was passed in 2003 and put into effect in August 2005. Since 1998, Japan has also regulated household appliance recycling with legislation such as the ‘Appliance Recycling Law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12456728">Aizawa et al., 2008</xref>). These regulations have set up a strict division of obligations among manufacturers, distributors and consumers for the processing of waste household appliances. In the USA, manufacturers, distributors, government and consumers have shared responsibility for recycling obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12456728">Kahhat et al., 2008</xref>). Multi-channel recycling, then, has been a commonly adopted model for most developed countries and the recycling behavior of individual households has become a key link in the WEEE recycling process.</p>
<p>A fair amount of research has been carried out on WEEE recycling, especially in developed countries. This research has been focused on various topics, such as: the current status of WEEE recycling in general (or even a specific WEEE product); material flow, processing technology and residents’ recycling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12456728">Barr et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12456728">Darby and Obara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12456728">Davis et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12456728">González-Toore et al., 2003</xref>); participation and factor analysis of attitudes and incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12456728">Aizawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12456728">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12456728">Robinson and Read, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12456728">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>); and the effect of economic incentives, such as penalties and psychological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12456728">Barr et al., 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12456728">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12456728">Berglund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12456728">Christer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12456728">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12456728">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12456728">McDonald and Oates, 2003</xref>). While many developed countries have conducted regulatory and legislative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12456728">Kahhat et al., 2008</xref>), few such recycling legislative research studies have taken place in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12456728">Li and Li, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12456728">Matsui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12456728">Nnorom and Osibanjo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12456728">Vicente and Reis, 2007</xref>), including China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12456728">Hicks et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the research methods and areas of focus for household recycling behavior could vary a great deal, with some focusing on the materials recovery behavior of residents, using a combination of observation and reduction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12456728">Barr et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12456728">Streicher-porte et al., 2005</xref>), and some focusing on how residents’ behavior has been affected by specific incentives. Furthermore, most of these studies have been conducted in developed countries with formal and mature recycling systems; however, there has been an almost total lack of such studies in the developing countries. And in all of the research conducted so far, there has been no detailed or critical study on the incentive factors affecting WEEE recycling in China.</p>
<p>The current WEEE recycling system, developed spontaneously and haphazardly in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12456728">Li and Li, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12456728">Li et al., 2009</xref>), still lacks a coherent, overall strategy encompassing financially viable, environmentally benign and safe management methods. The lack of widespread and easily accessible recycling channels has also contributed to the excessive and inefficient re-use of waste household appliances, highlighting the urgent need to establish a sophisticated management system to standardize the market. This situation is also prevalent in other developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12456728">Hicks et al., 2005</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12456728">Nnorom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12456728">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to most studies, which have focused on the formal and mature recycling systems in developed countries, this study will focus on the current situation of spontaneously developed recycling systems in a developing country—China—in the hope of promoting the establishment and management of a formal system which could be applied in many developing countries. An in-depth investigation and study of household WEEE recycling behavior in a typical Chinese city could provide very useful information on how to establish a sound WEEE recycling management system.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The Chinese city of Baoding was chosen for this study because it is it is a good representation of most medium-sized cities in China, not only in economic development, but also in the income levels of its residents. By studying the varying degrees of household WEEE recycling behavior we could determine how various factors influence this behavior, taking into account the differing income and educational levels of households and how they affected recycling behavior, as well as the residents’ potential willingness to support the standardization of the existing recycling channels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12456728">Figure 1</xref> shows the location of Baoding, in the west area of Hebei Province, and it is at the center of the triangle formed by Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang.</p>

<p>Baoding has a total population of 11.4 million people (2008), and is ranked number 113 out of all 238 prefecture-level cities in China. Its gross national income (GNP) is $US23.6 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12456728">Baoding Bureau of Statistics, 2009</xref>), ranking it 5 in Hebei Province and 58 among all 238 prefecture-level cities in China; its per-capita gross domestic produce (GDP) is $US2380, ranking it 109 among the 238 prefecture-level cities in China. And, like many Chinese localities, Baoding has a serious problem with WEEE—a problem exacerbated by social factors, including the city’s internal recycling processes, its operations network and its relations with surrounding cities. Baoding, therefore, is an excellent representative medium-sized city in China—a good model for studying the problem of discarded WEEE. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12456728">Figure 2</xref> shows the flow of WEEE in Baoding.</p>

<p>The formal interview and questionnaires used in this research revealed the method of consumption, and the recycling channels and discarding of household appliances, including local maintenance facilities, recycling stores and second-hand household appliance stores.</p>
<p>This project selected six categories of neighborhood residence types, based on differing income and educational levels: cottage, representing people live in a bungalow area; general residential area, representing people living in a general area; college dormitory, representing people who live in a campus area or a faculty; office dormitory means people who work for the government; enterprise employee residence, represents people who work in a factory or company; and high-income community represents people who live in a high-income area. We considered methods used in previous studies, such as investigating and interviewing stakeholders, on-the-street interviews and household surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12456728">González-Toore and Adenso Díaz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12456728">Streicher-Porte et al., 2005</xref>), and chose street interviews as the means of gathering information about the existing recycling channels, and questionnaires as the means of analyzing information about the consumption and discarding of household appliances. In order to examine all the variables in the entire recycling process, this study designed a questionnaire—the Baoding Household Recycling of Waste Household Appliances Survey—which was compiled using various measures to quantify residents’ recycling behavior, including intention and recovery mode, and the effect of WEEE recycling prices. Responses were measured with an agreement scale for attitude statements, as well as ‘yes/no’ and ‘true/false’ responses to measure potential willingness to participate in various treatment activities.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was hand-delivered to a sample of 498 households (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12456728">Table 1</xref>), according to the above 6 categories, and included the main types of income levels in Baoding, from low-income (21825 RMB/year—about $US3420/year)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0734242X12456728">1</xref></sup> to high-income (32306 RMB/year—about $US5064/year )<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0734242X12456728">2</xref></sup>. A sample size of 346 effectual questionnaires was returned, giving a response rate of 70%. This sample size was large and typical enough to generate results that could be classified in a number of different ways and still permit statistical testing.</p>

<title>Ownership of household appliances</title>
<p>Detailed data on the ownership of various household appliances were gathered and categorized into six types of appliances. Taking the aggregate numbers for these types in all the categories of households at Baoding, it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12456728">Figure 3</xref> that cell phones scored the highest type of appliance in units per capita in Baoding, with 0.71 units per person, while computers scored the lowest, with only 0.23 units per person; this latter figure indicated that, on average, there is one computer to every five persons. These results reflected the city’s level of economic and cultural development.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12456728-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>As can be seen from the results based on different household categories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12456728">Figure 4</xref>, there was an obvious gap in the ownership of various types of high-tech and amenity household appliances, with high-income residents and college residents owning more air conditioners, computers and cell phones. The high-income residents’ ownership of computers was the most obvious example of this disparity, with up to 1.2 units per household for this category. This was followed by college residents, whose ownership level for computers was 0.9 units per household. For air conditioners, the high-income category owned 2.6 units per household—twice the rate of other households categories with 1.3 units per household (mean value). These results demonstrated that the high-income residents placed a fairly high value on these, less essential, household appliances. However, the results for the ownership of more essential household appliances, such as television sets and washing machines, showed a much lower ownership gap between higher-income and lower-income households at just less than 10%.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12456728-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>It can be concluded that cell phones had the highest per-capita ownership rate of all household appliance types and computers had the lowest in Baoding. Among high-income residents and college residents, however, computer ownership rates were much higher, showing that households with higher levels of income and education placed more value on high-tech household appliances or information, communication and technology (ICT) products.</p>

<title>Recycling channels for WEEE</title>
<p>As in other medium-sized cities in this area of China, both formal and informal WEEE recycling channels have existed in Baoding, and the informal recycling of WEEE has been harmful to both human health and the environment. The most common entry point for WEEE into recycling channels has been the second-hand household appliance market. This market has comprised two major sub-channels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12456728">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>More than 51% of discarded household appliances (except for cell phones) entering the second-hand market were examined, and almost 80% of the broken ones were repaired or re-assembled to be sold as used household appliances through the second-hand markets. There have been a number of second-hand markets in Baoding, classified mainly by their categories of household appliances, for example Wanjiahui Market, Minghua Computer Market, Yigao Digital Square and Shifang trade centre.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the supply sources for these second-hand markets can be divided into three main types: WEEE sold by scrap merchants to the second-hand market accounts for 60–70%; used products sold from household appliances dealers account for 10–20%; and the remaining 10% were sold directly by residents to other consumers, as second-hand appliances. However, the major buyers of second-hand household appliances included the following three categories: transient populations in Baoding (such as migrant workers), self-employed business persons and low-income households. These consumers, whose functional requirements have not been high and whose financial resources have been limited, were attracted by the low price of second-hand household appliances. Many of these second-hand appliances, most notably those purchased by self-employed business persons, may be in use at public places, such as small restaurants.</p>
<p>Discarded household appliances that cannot be repaired for the second-hand market can be dismantled into accessories and parts for repairs. Specialized personnel can acquire and transport them to surrounding areas, with specific types of parts and components flowing into different regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12456728">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12456728">Figure 6</xref> shows different parts of the flow into different regions, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) flowing to Guangzhou Province, and iron and copper flowing to Beijing and Shijiazhuang. In fact, every kind of second-hand household appliance was flowing into many different cities. It was obvious in this study that the second-hand household appliance markets in Baoding were being impacted by neighboring cities. The surrounding cities were not only the supply sources for the second-hand household appliance markets, but were also the downstream dismantling and processing areas. This phenomenon was one reason for selecting Baoding as a typical research city.</p>

<p>In fact, second-hand appliance markets have not only existed only in developing countries, but in developed ones as well. Some studies of WEEE recycling in the USA have shown that 20% of discarded household appliances produce as much as 80% of their value for re-use in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12456728">Saphores et al., 2009</xref>). The ratio of the domestic reuse of discarded computers to new ones purchased has increased every year in Japan, rising from 25% to 37% from 2001 to 2004. Moreover, between 2002 and 2004 the export share of Japanese second-hand computers has increased even more significantly than the domestic reuse share, rising from 8% to 26% (Yoshida et al., 2008). This phenomenon has been characteristic of developed countries and may show that there have been definite differences between Japan and China with regard to the flow of second-hand appliances. In a word, one of the conclusions of this study was that the increasing trend of appliance reuse could achieve important reductions in the WEEE waste stream, taking advantage of the residual value of discarded household appliances.</p>

<sec id="section6-0734242X12456728">
<title>Disposal methods for WEEE</title>
<p>The following analysis of the questionnaire results showed that the methods of discarding WEEE were influenced by objective factors, including both the characteristics of the WEEE (such as the type of WEEE and its recycling price) and the different types of local recycling channels. The disposal methods for large household e-waste items (televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and computers) and small ones (cell phones) were noticeably different, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12456728">Figure 7</xref>. Selling to scrap merchants was the main way of discarding large WEEE in Baoding. Fifty-one percent of households chose this method, while trade-in or selling directly to treatment companies accounted for another 13% of the disposals. And, according to the questionnaire responses, the major reasons for discarding these larger appliances were the inconvenience of storing such large articles at home and the economic benefit of recouping some salvage value. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X12456728">Figure 9</xref>, 87% of the discarded household appliances had not completely lost their original function and could be sold as second-hand products; hence, some of the discarded household appliances entered the secondary market after being repaired.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12456728">Figure 8</xref>, due to the small size and low recycling price of cell phones, 31% of residents preferred to store them at home, 25% donate them and 14% directly discarded them. Questionnaire responses showed that storing the cell phones at home was usually a temporary solution and that 65% of them were eventually donated.</p>

<p>As for television sets, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines and computers, few households discarded them directly, as most of them were still functioning and had not completely lost their value to scrap merchants. Moreover, previous research on recycling polices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12456728">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) has shown that active policy guidance can play a key role in promoting the regulated recycling of WEEE. In South Korea, only 6% of scrapped computers were recycled through legal channels prior to the introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12456728">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0734242X12456728">3</xref></sup> However, after the effective implementation of EPR in Korea in 2003, this percentage reached 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12456728">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). It has been clear, then, that publicity and education in recent years have helped many residents to recognize that the appropriate way to dispose of WEEE could be to recycle the items, not just discard them directly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734242X12456728">
<title>Reasons for discarding WEEE</title>
<p>In addition to the objective factors discussed above, subjective factors also played a leading role in household recycling behavior. These subjective factors included the reasons for discarding household appliances, different levels of functional requirements for different types of household appliances, and attitudes about the necessity of appropriate treatment and its cost. This section analyzes the impacts of these subjective factors on different households.</p>
<p>The reasons given for discarding household appliances had two distinguishing characteristics, which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X12456728">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X12456728">10</xref>. For large household appliances, such as television sets, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines and computers, the leading reasons for discarding them were that they were broken or malfunctioning, accounting for 57% of disposals, while the failure of the appliance to meet the household’s needs accounted for 21%, ranking second. Other reasons for discarding appliances, such as moving to a smaller home, accounted for less than 10% of the responses. It appears, then, that most households in Baoding were not particularly concerned with updating the features of these household appliances, unless failure or malfunction affected their normal functioning.</p>

<p>The reasons for discarding cell phones were different from those for discarding other household appliances. First, 19% of the residents lost their cell phones—a mishap which tended not to happen with other household appliances. However, breakage and malfunction were still the dominant reasons for replacing cell phones, accounting for 38%, although this was still less than the 57% for other appliances. The low price of new cell phones accounted for 14% of the responses, whereas this reason accounted for only 5% for other household appliances. The phone’s inability to meet functional requirements accounted for 27%—higher than the 21% for other appliances. Previous studies have reached similar conclusions, i.e. that the motivation to update ICT products was different from that for basic household appliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12456728">Barr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12456728">González-Toore and Adenso Díaz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12456728">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). This result indicated that the residents placed significantly more value on updating ICT-category products. Further corroborating this result, ICT products exceeding their life cycles accounted for only 1% of responses compared with a value for other household appliances of 8%, although this still relatively low value indicated that residents were not particularly concerned with updating other appliances (in the absence of appliance failure).</p>
<p>‘Functions insufficient for requirements’ accounted for 27% of the reasons for discarding all household appliances. Most household appliances discarded for this reason could still operate well and could meet lower functional requirements. These discarded household appliances could, therefore, be sold as second-hand household appliances with some simple repairs. Analysis showed that the second-hand household appliance network has been developed spontaneously and it has been robust, being driven by the economic benefit to all participants, but it has lacked any industry standards. Many discarded household appliances have flowed into the secondary market either directly or indirectly, making it a very important component of the WEEE recycling process.</p>

<sec id="section8-0734242X12456728">
<title>Households’ sensitivity to recycling prices</title>
<p>‘WEEE value’ refers to the money a household can get when it sells WEEE to a scrap merchant in the informal recycling channel or to a qualified treatment enterprise in the formal channel. Investigation showed that residents were influenced by the WEEE values and that these values were correlated with their type, brand, life span and appearance—results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0734242X12456728">Figure 11</xref>. For example, the average WEEE value for a television set is $US7–29, for a refrigerator it is $US29–37, for an air conditioner it is $US37–44, for a washing machine it is $US7–29, for a computer it is $US22–44 and for a cell phone it is usually less than $US15.</p>
<fig id="fig11-0734242X12456728" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12456728-fig11.tif"/></fig>
<p>The WEEE values were affected by the materials and the level of technology they contained. These values, in turn, could directly affect the disposal method of the appliances, especially in Japan, where the treatment cost was high because of the strict regulations there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12456728">Matsui et al., 2007</xref>). There was a clear correlation between this treatment cost and the appliance’s likelihood of being recycled. When the treatment cost decreased, the percentage of illegal dumping was reduced. In our study, 80% of the value of cell phones was less than $US29, while the most lucrative type of appliance was air conditioners—the highest value of which was more than $US66; about 15% of them had a value in that range. The second most lucrative type of appliance was computers, with 60% of them bringing a value of around $US29–51. The remaining appliances, in descending order of WEEE value, were: washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and air conditioners. The value paid for electronic waste could directly affect the likelihood that they will be recycled rather than disposed of.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0734242X12456728">
<title>Households’ potential willingness to pay for treatment cost</title>
<p>There have been two ways to charge for the treatment cost of waste household appliances: (a) charging for discarding the product, and (b) including the cost of discarding in the price of the new product. Both methods (a) and (b) were rejected by more than half of the residents. Method (a) was supported by only 21% of residents, whereas 33% supported method (b). While 63% of residents rejected being charged by method (a), analysis of the responses based on the different types of neighborhood residents revealed that college residents had the highest acceptance rate for charging for treatment cost, while general residents demonstrated the lowest level of acceptance for this method.</p>
<p>These results indicated that the residents still had a certain resistance to paying for treatment, despite the extensive education and promotion explaining the harm caused by improper treatment of WEEE that has been implemented. The survey showed that when the economic interests of the residents were not involved, they indicated a willingness to send the discarded household appliances to formal enterprises for disposal. But, once their economic interests were involved, any charge for treatment was rejected instantly.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0734242X12456728">Figure 12</xref>, the acceptance of college residents was high for both method (a) and method (b)—56.3% and 61.7%, respectively—far higher than for any other household categories. This was followed by office residents, whose acceptance rates were 23.2% and 56.3% respectively. However, high-income residents, who were most concerned with keeping their household appliances up to date, and were the highest consumers of these products, provided the lowest support for such charges. Their acceptance rates were only 8.3% and 17%, ranking last for both methods. Those most opposed were general residents and cottage residents, who strongly rejected both methods with percentages as high as 90% and 80%, with essentially no answer as ‘undecided’. It can be concluded that the most important factors affecting the potential willingness to pay for treatment cost were educational level and awareness of the importance of recycling WEEE, but not income level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0734242X12456728">Figure 13</xref> shows that highly educated residents had a clearer understanding of the necessity of appropriate treatment and were willing to support the establishment of a formal recycling system.</p>

<p>In spite of residents’ reluctance to pay for recycling treatment, analysis showed that method (b) was somewhat more acceptable for the residents than method (a). Furthermore, college residents were more likely to accept the concept of charging for treatment cost. With regard to recycling method, both college residents and office residents thought that different costs based on the different types of appliance was more reasonable than charging an average fee.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has analyzed objective variables, such as appliance type, life spans, cost, etc., and subjective variables, such as intention and willingness, in order to understand the current recycling situation in Baoding to demonstrate the crucial factors influencing the operation of a sound WEEE recycling system and to suggest methods of improving the existing collection system. The results of this study showed that the most effective indicator in the WEEE recycling system was the differing consumption patterns of the various types of household appliances and that WEEE value was the most critical factor in choosing recycling methods. The study also provided a foundation for designing and establishing a sound recycling system for WEEE in China.</p>
<p>Cell phones were found to have the highest per-capita ownership, reaching 0.71 units per person, while computers had the lowest ownership rate of only 0.23 units per person. The ownership analysis also showed that the residents with higher income and educational levels valued the high-tech household appliances the most.</p>
<p>Analysis of WEEE recycling activities showed that 52% of the residents sold WEEE to scrap merchants. Reusable appliances flowed into the second-hand market in both Baoding and the surrounding large cities. The main reason for discarding high-tech appliances was the availability of newer technology, but broken or malfunctioning equipment was the main reason for discarding televisions and washing machines, with a percentage of 52%. College residents and office employees were more willing to accept being charged for treatment, with acceptance rates of up to 56.3% and 61.7% for the two methods presented. These results showed that appliance ownership rates can not only reflect the local economic development level, but also influence the recycling rates for household appliances.</p>
<p>According to the results from this study, the influence of the consumption patterns of different types of household appliances should be considered when attempting to establish a sound recycling system for WEEE. Furthermore, the cost of recycling is the most crucial factor influencing the flow direction of WEEE. Hence, a scientifically designed recycling pricing scheme and a consumption pattern analysis are needed before regulating the current recycling system or establishing a sound WEEE management system. Furthermore, the pricing schemes and consumption patterns need significantly more research.</p>
