<title>Methods</title>
<p>This exploratory study utilized a baseline self-administered written survey and an 8-week telephone follow-up survey that included 2 open-ended questions. Forty-three adults aged 50 or older with diabetes and a solid tumor cancer receiving chemotherapy were recruited from 8 community outpatient cancer centers in Michigan and Ohio.

<title>Results</title>
<p>After a minimum of 8 weeks of chemotherapy, patients performed significantly fewer diabetes self-management behaviors. The majority of individuals experienced a moderate to high impact on their ability to perform diabetes self-management activities while receiving chemotherapy. Exercise, ability to eat and drink, and monitoring blood sugars were most affected. Three themes identifying patient issues were noted: self-management issues, health issues, and prioritization.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Cancer treatment and cancer-related symptoms can have a negative impact on diabetes self-management behaviors in adults with diabetes who are undergoing chemotherapy. Diabetes self-management education is targeted to improve health outcomes in patients with diabetes and cancer and addresses the “cause” not just the “source” of the problem needs to be developed. Further research needs to be done to address issues related to glycemic control and health-related outcomes in this population.</p>

<p>Diabetes and cancer are both prevalent diseases today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712458835">1</xref></sup> The co-occurrence of these 2 complex disorders within the same individual is greater than what would be expected by chance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712458835">1</xref></sup> Eight to eighteen percent of individuals with cancer will have diabetes at the time of their cancer diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712458835">2</xref></sup> Individuals with diabetes and cancer have higher mortality rates, are more likely to be hospitalized, or develop an infection while undergoing treatment when compared to individuals with cancer without diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712458835">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712458835">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is unknown why individuals who have preexisting diabetes at the time they are diagnosed with cancer have higher mortality and complication rates when compared to individuals without diabetes. It has been hypothesized that glycemic levels may play a role in the development of complications for individuals with diabetes who are undergoing chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712458835">6</xref></sup> Self-management behaviors for diabetes can have a positive impact on glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712458835">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712458835">9</xref></sup> Individuals who perform fewer self-management activities for their diabetes have poorer glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712458835">8</xref></sup> Poorer glycemic control in individuals with diabetes is also associated with poorer outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased infection rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712458835">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712458835"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712458835">13</xref></sup> Nurses and other health care providers need to be aware the potential issues faced by patients with both diabetes and cancer and how cancer treatment may affect diabetes self-management.</p>
<p>This exploratory study seeks to develop a beginning understanding of how self-management for diabetes is affected by a new chronic illness (cancer). The purpose of this study is to identify the impact that cancer and its treatment have on diabetes self-management in adults 50 years of age and older and to identify common issues that individuals with diabetes encounter while undergoing chemotherapy. An increased understanding of how cancer affects diabetes self-management in adults among diabetes educators can be the basis for the development of interventions to improve the self-management of diabetes in adults undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721712458835">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The following section provides an overview of the challenges for diabetes self-management, the self- management of multimorbidities, and the relationship between diabetes and cancer. Factors that can affect diabetes self-management, cancer self-management, and the relationship between diabetes and cancer are also explored.</p>
<sec id="section6-0145721712458835">
<title>Diabetes Self-Management</title>
<p>The self-management of diabetes is an essential component of the patient’s plan of care. Individuals with diabetes are required to maintain a sometimes-complex regimen to achieve good glycemic control and prevent complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712458835">14</xref></sup> Poor glycemic control in individuals with diabetes has been associated with the development of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease as well as kidney disease, which can be life threatening. In addition, poorly controlled diabetes can have an impact on health-related quality-of-life outcomes, such as physical, social, emotional, and cognitive functioning, as well as pain and overall well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712458835">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetes self-management is not without challenges for patients who need to perform specific activities to maintain glycemic control, decrease complications, and improve overall quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712458835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712458835">15</xref></sup> Activities include daily monitoring of blood sugars, medication administration, and the following of specific diet and exercise recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458835">16</xref></sup> Individuals need to incorporate all these activities into their daily lives and be able to manage potential complications such as hypoglycemic reactions and hyperglycemia. The complexity of the plan of care, the number of other comorbidities that an individual with diabetes has, and the social/family environment have all been noted to affect the performance of diabetes self-management activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712458835">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712458835"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712458835">20</xref></sup> Plans of care that are too complex have been shown to contribute to decreased adherence in taking medications and a increased confusion regarding how best to self- manage all the recommended care components in individuals with multiple morbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712458835">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712458835">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>For individuals who have multiple comorbidities, their plans of care become more complex and possibly compete with one another. Multiple comorbidities along with diabetes can produce an increase in disease burden and symptoms, which can lead to additional challenges and compete with an individual’s ability to self-manage diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712458835">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712458835"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712458835">24</xref></sup> The disease burden of a dominant effect associated with 1 chronic condition can affect the ability of an individual to exercise or follow diet recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458835">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712458835">25</xref></sup> The amount of discordance between 2 chronic conditions, such as cancer and diabetes, can contribute to the overall burden experienced by individuals. Discordance between the plans of care and treatment effects of 2 or more chronic conditions can cause a competition for time, attention, and priority and so affect the self-management of 1 or more of the coexisting chronic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458835">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712458835">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Individuals with multiple morbidities can also experience multiple symptoms, and the compounding effects of these symptoms may increase their total symptom severity and burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712458835">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712458835">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712458835">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712458835">28</xref></sup> Higher levels of symptom burden have been noted to decrease an individual’s ability to follow self-management recommendations for diet, exercise, and medication regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712458835">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712458835">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712458835"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712458835">31</xref></sup> For the patient undergoing chemotherapy, symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, and nausea may all play a role in how well he or she performs self-management activities for diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712458835">32</xref></sup> To better understand how cancer and its treatment may affect diabetes self-management, the following section discusses the effects of cancer treatment on cancer self-management.</p>

<title>Cancer Self-Management</title>
<p>Over the past decade, the responsibility for oncology care has shifted from provider to patient.

<title>Cancer and Diabetes</title>
<p>The importance regarding the relationship between cancer and diabetes and health-related outcomes are becoming an increased focus of published papers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712458835">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712458835">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145721712458835">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145721712458835">48</xref></sup> None specifically address the impact that cancer and its treatment have on the self-management of diabetes.

<p>The glucocorticoids used in cancer treatment protocols affect glucose levels in individuals with cancer and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145721712458835">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145721712458835">47</xref></sup> In addition to glucocorticoids, the impact associated with cancer-related symptoms and changes in diabetes self-management may also affect glycemic control. Nausea and vomiting may affect patients’ ability to eat and drink and, therefore, their ability to continue to follow their diabetes diet. Fatigue and pain may have an impact on the individual’s activity level. Patients undergoing chemotherapy with diabetes are at risk for hypoglycemic as well as hyperglycemic episodes, which can affect their symptom severity and how they self-manage their diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145721712458835">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145721712458835">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nurses, diabetes educators, and health care providers need to understand the competition between cancer and diabetes self-management to provide safe and efficacious care to this population. Improvement in chronic disease self-management for individuals with cancer and diabetes requires both nursing expertise and an understanding of self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145721712458835">50</xref></sup> Currently, the majority of patients with diabetes and cancer are left to their own devices in figuring out how to manage both these competing diseases.

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This exploratory study was conducted at 8 community-based cancer centers in Michigan and Ohio, and it utilized a written self-administered survey at baseline and a phone survey 8 weeks later. The phone survey included 2 open-ended questions. The open-ended questions were tape-recorded with the participant’s permission for the purpose of transcribing for analyses. Use of both quantitative and qualitative measures in this study allowed for the development of a clearer understanding of the impact that cancer treatment can have on diabetes self-management from the patient’s perspective.</p>

<sec id="section12-0145721712458835">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample consisted of individuals who were 50 years of age or older with type 1 or 2 diabetes and a diagnosis of a solid tumor cancer who were eligible for or currently undergoing outpatient intravenous or oral chemotherapy. A convenience sample of individuals meeting the study criteria was obtained from 8 cancer centers in the states of Michigan and Ohio over a 6-month period. All of the centers in the study were chosen because they had an outpatient chemotherapy or infusion center and treated similar types of solid tumor cancers. In addition, the investigators had a prior relationship with the majority of the centers utilized in this study. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows: First, patients needed to be on daily insulin or an oral hypoglycemic for their diabetes. This criteria was also utilized as a mechanism to confirm that the patient had an actual diagnosis of diabetes, and it assisted the cancer center staff in being able to identify potential participants for the study. Second, they had to be able to read, write, and speak English. Third, they had to be able to follow verbal and written instructions, and, finally, they had to have access to and be able to use a telephone. Participants were excluded if they were unable to hear or use a telephone, were unable to understand written and verbal communication, or had a self-reported history of Alzheimer disease or dementia.</p>

<sec id="section13-0145721712458835">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Participant recruitment began once institutional review board approval was obtained from Michigan State University and the individual cancer centers. Potential participants were identified by clinic staff who agreed to assist in the recruitment of participants. These individuals were provided with a checklist of the inclusion and exclusion criteria to assist them in identifying potential participants. Cancer center staff had an educational session provided by the study investigator regarding the study protocol and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Nurses at the cancer centers approached potential participants who met the study criteria; if the patient was willing to participate, he or she was given a packet, which included the baseline written survey, the consent form, a study brochure, and a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of the completed survey and signed consent form to the study investigator. Once the surveys were returned to the study investigator, patients were contacted to reconfirm their willingness to participate in the study and to schedule a date for the follow-up survey. Phone surveys were completed by the study investigator 8 weeks after the participants were enrolled in the study, at which time they were asked 2 open-ended questions that were tape-recorded and then transcribed into word documents for analysis in ATLAS.ti 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145721712458835">51</xref></sup> The questions participants were (1) “Based on your experiences over the past 8 weeks, what do you think have been some of the challenges or issues you have had to face in regards to managing your diabetes?” and (2) “In general describe how your diabetes has been affected or impacted since you started undergoing chemotherapy for your cancer.”</p>

<title>Study Variables and Measures</title>
<p>Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, education level, income status, marital status, race, and ethnicity. Clinical characteristics included type of diabetes, diabetes medications, years with diabetes, type of cancer, cancer treatment, number of other comorbidities, and symptom severity.</p>
<p>Symptom severity was measured with the Symptoms of Illness Checklist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145721712458835">51</xref></sup> which is a comprehensive measurement of physical illness and measures 33 common symptoms associated with illness. The instrument measures the frequency and interference of the symptom. Frequency is measured on a 0-4 scale (0 = not present, 4 = present at least 15-30 days over the past month). Interference is measure on a 0-3 scale (0 = did not interfere, 3 = severely interfered). Severity is determined by multiplying the frequency score times the interference score for each symptom. Total severity is the sum of the 33 severity scores. Cronbach α for this instrument in this study was 0.86.</p>
<p>The impact that cancer has on diabetes self-management was measured using a modified intrusiveness of illness inventory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145721712458835">52</xref></sup> The modified scale contained 5 questions, which asked the individual to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 how much cancer and its treatment affected his or her ability to perform diabetes self-management activities in general, to take medications, and to follow diet and exercise recommendations (1 = not very much, 7 = very much). Cronbach α for this modified instrument was 0.85.</p>
<p>Diabetes self-management behaviors were measured using the Self-Care Inventory–Revised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145721712458835">53</xref></sup> This is a 15-item self-report measure that assesses patients’ perceptions regarding their adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations: following recommendations for diet, reading food labels, exercising, taking medications, checking blood glucose, keeping appointments with their providers, and wearing a medic alert bracelet. This instrument is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never, 5 = always). The inventory has an internal consistency reliability of .87.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145721712458835">53</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section15-0145721712458835">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe sample characteristics and the perceived impact of cancer treatment on diabetes self-management. For question 1, correlation was performed to assess the relationship between patient demographics/characteristics and the perceived impact that cancer treatment had on diabetes self-management. A paired <italic>t</italic> test was performed to determine if there were significant differences between baseline and 8-week diabetes self-management behaviors and level of symptom severity. Analysis of question 1 was completed with SPSS 18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145721712458835">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Question 2 was analyzed utilizing a conventional content analysis approach from the data obtained from the 2 open-ended questions. This approach allows the researcher to develop categories or themes from the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145721712458835">53</xref></sup> Each transcript was read through several times as a whole; then codes, subthemes, and themes were identified by study investigator, who utilized reflection and maintained notes during the analysis process. Once codes and themes were developed, results were shared and discussed with others on the research team. Themes and subthemes were then revised and final themes developed.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A total of 44 individuals were enrolled and completed the baseline survey; 37 completed the 8-week follow-up survey. Of those that did not complete the study, 3 did not respond to follow-up, 2 died, and 1 was placed in an extended-care facility. At baseline, the majority of the individuals were female (51.2%, n = 22), Caucasian (86%, n = 37), and married (62.8%, n = 27). Most individuals had type 2 diabetes (95.3%, n = 41) and had diabetes for an average of 9.6 ± 5.65 years (n = 43), were on oral medications only (60.5%, n = 26), and had 2.7 ± 1.6 additional comorbidities (n = 43) other than cancer and diabetes. Breast (27.9%, n = 12), lung (11.6%, n = 5), and pancreas (11.6%, n = 5) were the most common cancers. The majority of the individuals had late-stage cancer (62.8%, n = 27); 60.5% (n = 26) were receiving intravenous chemotherapy only; and 23.3% (n = 10) were receiving intravenous chemotherapy and radiation.

<title>Research Question 1</title>
<p>A significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .009) between baseline and 8-week diabetes self-management was noted. The baseline mean for diabetes self-management was 50.84 ± 2.47, compared to the 8-week, 45.86 ± 2.65, thus indicating that patients performed fewer self-management activities for their diabetes after being on chemotherapy for a minimum of 8 weeks. There was also a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .038) detected between the levels of symptom burden experienced at both time points; namely, patients at baseline (25.43 ± 3.81) had lower levels of symptom burden when compared to those at 8 weeks (32.57 ± 4.49).</p>
<p>The overall mean for the impact that cancer has on diabetes self-management was 16.47 ± 8.43, indicating that individuals experienced a perceived moderate impact on diabetes self-management activities from their cancer treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712458835">Figure 1</xref>). The largest perceived impact was on ability to exercise (4.35 ± 2.36), followed by blood sugar monitoring (3.73 ± 2.38) and ability to eat and drink (3.56 ± 2.31; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712458835">Table 3</xref>). The impact that cancer has on diabetes self-management was significantly correlated with level of symptom burden at 8 weeks (<italic>r</italic> = .46, <italic>P</italic> = .004), indicating that as symptom burden increased, the impact from the cancer treatment on diabetes self-management activities increased.</p>

<title>Research Question 2</title>
<p>Content analysis was utilized to identify common themes from the transcribed tapes. Three common themes emerged: self-management issues, health issues, and prioritization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712458835">Table 3</xref> for definitions and indicators). The theme of self-management issues was characterized by patients reporting an overall negative impact on ability to manage diet, exercise, medication, and blood glucose monitoring (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721712458835">Table 4</xref> for quotes). In regard to the theme of health issues, individuals reported problems with glycemic issues, mainly hyperglycemia, while they were receiving chemotherapy and an overall increase in symptoms. Some individuals reported having no impact on their ability to self-manage their diabetes while undergoing chemotherapy. It is unknown what level of diabetes self-management these individuals were performing before starting chemotherapy or what type of chemotherapy regimen they were receiving (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0145721712458835">Table 5</xref> for quotes). The theme of prioritization included the indicators of provider influence, personal choice, and need for help. Some individuals reported that they were advised by their primary care providers not to be concerned about their diabetes while undergoing chemotherapy, while others were referred to endocrinologists to assist with management of their diabetes. Many individuals reported that they prioritized their cancer care over their diabetes care and were “putting their diabetes on the back burner.” Few individuals did feel that it was important to continue to care for their diabetes while undergoing treatment for their cancer. Some individuals reported that they needed help in managing their diabetes while undergoing treatment; they could no longer do some things by themselves (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0145721712458835">Table 6</xref> for quotes).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study focused on the impact that cancer treatment has on diabetes self-management in adults 50 years of age and older who were undergoing chemotherapy for a solid tumor cancer or lymphoma. The results indicate that cancer and its treatment can have a negative impact on the performance of self-management activities for preexisting diabetes in adults 50 and older—with exercising, eating and drinking, and monitoring blood sugars being the most affected.</p>
<p>Level of symptom severity was found to be significantly correlated with the performance of diabetes self-management activities overall and specifically associated with the impact on exercise, eating and drinking, and taking medications to manage diabetes. The higher the symptom severity experienced after 8 weeks of chemotherapy, the lower the number of self-management activities performed. This negative impact on the performance of self-management activities is consistent with the literature. The more symptoms that an individual experiences and the overlapping or competing effects of these symptoms can negatively affect the performance of self-management activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458835">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145721712458835">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0145721712458835">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0145721712458835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0145721712458835">56</xref></sup> The influence of symptoms was also noted as one of the factors that affected one’s ability to perform diabetes self-management activities, according to the analysis of the open-ended questions. As nurses and other health care professionals, we need to be aware of this negative impact to assist our patients in finding ways to minimize the impact that symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment can have on the self-management of diabetes.</p>
<p>Another challenge identified by several patients was the impact on blood glucose levels. Many individuals reported problems with hyperglycemia while receiving chemotherapy. Some of the problems associated with hyperglycemia may be related to the impact that treatment had on their ability to exercise and follow their diets. Other reasons for the reported problems with hyperglycemia may be related to the type of chemotherapy they were receiving and if they were receiving steroid-type medications as part of their treatment protocols.</p>
<p>Some patients prioritized their cancer treatment over taking care of their diabetes. The literature has noted that if patients perceive one condition to be more life threatening than their diabetes, they will prioritize its treatment over that of their diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458835">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712458835">24</xref></sup> In some cases, patients were advised by their primary care providers not to worry about their diabetes while undergoing treatment for their cancer. Patient and health care provider education needs to be done to increase awareness regarding the importance of glycemic control during cancer treatment and the increased risk for complications in patients with diabetes. At the same time, better ways to help patients with real-life tools to achieve optimal goals need to be provided to all health care providers who provide care for patients with diabetes and cancer. Further research needs to be conducted using a larger sample size, looking at the relationship among symptoms, diabetes self-management, glycemic control, and health-related outcomes, for interventions to be developed that can be tested and possibly translated to practice.</p>
<p>This is one of the first studies to specifically examine the patient’s perceived impact on diabetes self-management while being treated for cancer. It is limited by the small sample size, namely in its ability to generalize to all patients with diabetes cancer. A second limitation is the lack of information regarding individuals’ levels of actual glycemic control. These data before starting chemotherapy and during the data collection process could have increased our understanding of the impact that cancer treatment and decreased diabetes self-management had on diabetes-related outcomes. A third limitation is the short period between collection of baseline data and final follow-up. Eight weeks was selected to ensure that individuals had received at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy. It is possible that individuals may experience a greater impact later in treatment or developed a better balance between managing their cancer and their diabetes over time. Future studies need to address the impact that cancer and its treatment may have over a longer period.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The combined results of the quantitative data and open-ended questions indicated clinical issues that nurses and other health care providers need to be aware of in this population. Oncology nurses need to be aware of the problems that individuals with diabetes and cancer may encounter and so encourage patients who are undergoing chemotherapy to continue to manage their diabetes. Interventions need to be developed to assist oncology nurses in regard to helping patients manage their diabetes while undergoing chemotherapy. Care guidelines for oncologists, oncology nurses, endocrinologists, advanced practice nurses, diabetes educators, and primary care providers who are caring for individuals with cancer and diabetes need to be developed and disseminated to ensure that patients with diabetes and cancer can achieve the best possible diabetes and cancer outcomes.</p>
<p>These recommendations are congruent with overarching trends in diabetes patient education in regard to diabetes self-management education—namely, that it should fit the individual and unique populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0145721712458835">57</xref></sup> The educational needs and self-management recommendations for individuals with diabetes and cancer need to be targeted toward improving and maximizing the health benefits of this population. The cancer population presents diabetes educators with opportunities to not practice as if food, exercise, self-monitoring of blood glucose and medication education is the same for all. Individuals do not know otherwise without help. To help patients with diabetes and cancer, patient education needs to focus on individualized <italic>how</italic>’s, not more universal <italic>why</italic>’s. Future studies need to identify the specific educational needs of patients and providers to develop targeted self-management strategies for improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>Further research that investigates the relationship between diabetes and cancer needs to be conducted. The relationship between glycemic control and cancer-related outcomes needs to be explored, and the role that diabetes self-management may have on glycemic control in this population needs to be further explored. Interventions need to be developed and tested that focus on improving health-related quality of life, diabetes self-management, glycemic control, and the dual management of diabetes and cancer. As nurses, health care providers, and researchers, our ultimate goal should be on improving health-related quality-of-life outcomes in this population and ensuring long-term survivorship for those with diabetes and cancer.</p>
