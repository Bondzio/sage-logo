<abstract>
<p>When Beijing hosted the Olympic Games in 2008 we were reminded that almost four decades earlier the People’s Republic of China’s road back to international recognition and acceptance had begun with a chance sporting encounter between two members of the US and Chinese table tennis teams in Japan in 1971. It is less well known that not long after this successful ‘ping pong’ diplomatic episode, attempts were made by various parties to use baseball in a similar way to try and repair international ties between Cuba and the United States. In this article the circumstances through which the former succeeded whereas the latter failed miserably are subject to detailed examination. Drawing upon existing literature and unclassified material gleaned from the National Security Archive (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Archive we argue that for a number of historically specific reasons, and because of the different balances of interest and asymmetric power relations, ‘ping pong’ diplomacy was able to help broker rapprochement between the United States and China, whereas ‘baseball diplomacy’ could do little or nothing to stimulate diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although there is much said about sport in the context of diplomacy, little of this debate has taken place in the International Relations literature. In what discourse does exist, more often than not the positive value of sport as a broker of transnational good will is taken as given, particularly in rhetorical statements emanating from sports organizations or in sound-bites from vote-catching politicians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047117811411741">1</xref></sup> In contrast, a perusal of the historical record reveals a mixed picture, with sport just as likely to feature in provoking new or augmenting existing forms of international conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047117811411741">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>When considering the diplomatic power of sports, the vanguard role played by table tennis in the thawing of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the early 1970s is the most often used example. However, it is less well known that not long after the success of ‘ping pong diplomacy’ there were concerted attempts to use baseball for similar purposes by those interested in engineering rapprochement between the US and its much nearer island neighbour, Cuba. These attempts at sporting diplomacy with Cuba failed miserably. Today China is (almost) a fully integrated member of the international community, with formal diplomatic relations with the United States and all other Western powers. In terms of US foreign policy, Cuba remains an American political pariah and marginal to European international relations. Drawing upon existing literature and recently declassified documents from the CIA Archives, in this paper we scrutinize the cases of both ‘ping pong’ and ‘baseball’ diplomacy in an attempt to identify the specific historical and contextual circumstances by which the former initiative succeeded while the latter did not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0047117811411741">
<title>Ping pong diplomacy</title>
<p>The decision to award the 2008 Olympic Games to Beijing represented the culmination of a process of sport-led diplomacy that began in April 1971, when the US Table Tennis Federation accepted an invitation from its Chinese counterparts to play a series of exhibition matches in the PRC. There can be little doubt that this moment of ‘ping pong’ diplomacy represented a watershed in Sino−US relations. The undoubted success of the ping pong initiative can only be fully understood in the context of a complex interplay of transcending political, economic and strategic factors.</p>
<p>Formal diplomatic ties between mainland China and the West had been severed in 1949, when the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party, the Red Army, led by Mao Zedong, defeated the forces of the Nationalist government, the remnants of which were forced into exile on the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) along with their leader Chiang Kai-shek, where the Republic of China or ROC was formed. This provided another dimension to the politics of international relations in a post-Second World War period which was already dominated by growing frostiness in relations between the United States (and its allies in the West) and the Soviet bloc in the East − the so-called Cold War. The USSR had been a major backer of the Chinese Communists during the Chinese civil war, while the United States sided with the Nationalists. With Mao’s victory in mainland China, the United States naturally assumed that this represented a very significant spread of Soviet influence and proof positive that the ultimate goal was a Soviet-led, communist global hegemony. This persuaded the United States to continue to back Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists’ claim for national sovereignty. It also helped to fuel and frame the development of the ‘domino theory’ of international relations – that communism could be spread through geographical proximity and contagiousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047117811411741">3</xref></sup> This assessment caused the United States to draw a line in the sand in Indochina and led to US military advisors and ground troops being deployed in increasing numbers throughout South-East Asia in the 1950s and 1960s, most notably in Korea and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This rather simplistic view of a uniform and unified ‘Communist bloc’ built around the USSR and China began to shift in the early 1960s as cracks appeared in the red monolith. Ideologically, the PRC and its leadership were becoming increasingly resistant to the notion that Moscow was the fulcrum and spiritual leader of the communist movement. Mao accused the Soviet leadership of betraying the legacy of ‘Leninism−Stalinism’ with power and privilege concentrated in the hands of a ‘new type of bureaucratic capitalist class’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047117811411741">4</xref></sup> In a series of anti-Soviet polemics, the USSR was depicted by Mao as the harbinger of a new form of ‘social imperialism’ − something that had to be resisted as much as American imperialism. The PRC sought to reposition and reassert itself as a more virtuous communist state than the USSR and one better placed to lead the quest for world domination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047117811411741">5</xref></sup> Undoubtedly, at least in part, this was driven by Mao Zedong’s desire to promote himself globally as the chosen leader of world communism and domestically to feed the cult of personality so characteristic of his leadership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047117811411741">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Washington listened with interest to the increasingly hostile rhetorical exchanges between Moscow and Beijing as they began to sound less like ideological debates and more like sabre rattling. Then, in 1969, a series of incursions and limited combat operations broke out along China’s disputed northern border with the Soviet Union. The prospect of wholesale conflict between the two emerging and nuclear-equipped superpowers began to seem increasingly possible. The response of the United States to something that had the potential to trigger World War III was twofold. First, through both official and unofficial diplomatic channels, the United States pledged to do everything in its power to help prevent the conflict escalating further. Second, behind the scenes it worked equally hard to exploit the situation to its best advantage. This is clearly evidenced in a recently declassified briefing written by Allen S. Whiting, a senior intelligence officer and veteran China watcher, for the then US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The U.S. objectives therefore should be (1) to deter a Soviet attack on China, (2) to inhibit the use of nuclear weapons in a Sino-Soviet War, and (3) to maximize the possibility of China identifying Russia as its sole antagonist, in contrast with the rest of the world and particularly with the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047117811411741">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The threat of nuclear war notwithstanding, the incumbent US President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, both saw huge advantages to be gained through helping to drive a wedge between the USSR and the PRC. First, not long after the Cuban missile crisis and at the high point of the Cold War, to be facing a disunited communist adversary was quite an attractive prospect. Second, and most importantly, as the US body count began to mount, Nixon was committed to the development of a strategy for disengaging from Vietnam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047117811411741">8</xref></sup> Along with his advisor Kissinger, Nixon believed this could only be achieved through cooperation with the PRC which had been providing considerable material and strategic support to Hanoi for the duration of this increasingly bloody conflict. Public opinion in the United States had turned against the Nixon administration, largely because of stagnation in Vietnam.</p>
<p>In this context what both the United States and China needed was a relatively risk-free pretext to begin to explore the possibilities for closer political, economic and military relations. The unlikely mechanism for this arose during the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships which took place in Nagoya, Japan. For the first time since the start of Cultural Revolution in China – a period when many sports were suppressed and all international sporting contacts with the West were severed – the Chinese, who had dominated world table tennis in previous years, agreed to send a representative team, with the blessing of Mao Zedong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047117811411741">9</xref></sup> The United States had also sent a team and on 4 April a member of that squad, Glenn Cowan, made history when he hitched a ride on the Chinese team’s bus and struck up a conversation with the captain of the Chinese team, Zhuang Zedong, who was then widely regarded as the best male table tennis player in the world. In defiance of prevailing political taboos and national stereotypes, the two men found a common bond in table tennis. When they got off the bus gifts were exchanged in front of waiting press photographers, who had somehow been tipped off about the encounter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047117811411741">10</xref></sup> Photographs of Cowan and Zhuang soon sped around the world on the wires of Associated Press and Agence France Presse, and from that moment relations between China and the United States began a journey towards rapprochement.</p>
<p>What happened as a consequence of this dubiously serendipitous moment and in what sequence is a little unclear. Some observers suggest that local American officials recognized this ‘chance encounter’ as an opportunity to open up a dialogue with the Chinese, and engineered an invitation to the PRC. Others believe the opposite and that it was the Chinese, prodded from the wings by Chairman Mao Zedong and Prime Minister Chou En-lai, who viewed this eventuality as something that could be exploited for their own political ends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047117811411741">11</xref></sup> On seeing the smiling photograph of Zhuang Zedong and Glen Cowen, Mao is reported to have referred to his namesake as ‘a good diplomat’ and after some deliberation had ordered that the US team should be invited to China. Whichever side made the first move, what is certain is that on 14 April, not much more that a week after Cowan set foot on the Chinese bus, he made the short walk across a bridge from Hong Kong to mainland China, together with eight teammates, two spouses, four officials and ten journalists. They played several exhibition matches in which the far superior Chinese team, in the spirit of ‘friendship first, competition second’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047117811411741">12</xref></sup> allowed the US team to win at least some games. The delegation visited the Great Wall and were generally feted and treated as honoured guests. As a sporting occasion this tour was very forgettable; as a diplomatic intervention, however, it was anything but − opening what Chou En-lai later was to refer to as a ‘new page’ in Sino-American relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047117811411741">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the United States, the table tennis venture was viewed as a heaven-sent opportunity, not only to help to isolate the USSR, but to help with the development of an exit strategy from Vietnam, as well as giving the American public something to think about other than body bags. The following brief extract from a recorded telephone conversation between the President and his Secretary of State illustrates both points:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Kissinger:</speaker>
<p>Exactly. For every reason we have got to have a diversion from Vietnam in this country for a while.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nixon:</speaker>
<p>That’s the point isn’t it, yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kissinger:</speaker>
<p>And we need it for our game with the Soviets.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nixon:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kissinger:</speaker>
<p>I mean it would be absolutely impossible, we would be doing the Soviets the greatest favour if we rejected this overture and we would get nothing for it, it would lead to tougher relations between us and the Soviets, rather than easier.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nixon:</speaker>
<p>That’s right, that’s right. That’s what they would like for us to do, they would like for us to sort of slap the Chinese in the face but we’re not going to. We’re not going overboard but we’re saying well, if they open the door, we’ll open the door.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047117811411741">14</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
<p>For their part the Chinese leadership had their own reasons to look favourably upon opportunities for diplomatic rapprochement with the United States. Militarily, while numerically superior, the Chinese armed forces were no match for their Soviet counterparts in terms of hardware and technological sophistication, and if full-scale war did break out, they were fearful of being outgunned by the Russians. An alliance with the United States would do much to deter Soviet aggression. Moreover, Mao craved access to US military technology and was particularly interested in using this to help the development of China’s nuclear arsenal. Also, outside of the military sphere, the Chinese economy had been ravaged by years of war and by the failures and follies of the ‘Great Leap Forward’ and the Cultural Revolution. An American-led trade embargo exacerbated economic underdevelopment and the Chinese were eager to see this relaxed.</p>
<p>Then there was the vexed question of Nationalist China. From his base in Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek still claimed to be the only legitimate ruler of China and that Nationalist China was the only legitimate and sovereign state. Hitherto this status had been broadly accepted by most Western powers and had been championed by the United States, who were happy to do so as long as support for the PRC was believed to be counter to US interests in the region. Up until now the United States had lobbied for Taiwan’s membership of the United Nations to the exclusion of the PRC. Likewise it had been a strong backer of Taiwan in its claim to be the only legitimate representative of China in the Olympic movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047117811411741">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of related concern for the PRC were the intentions of an older enemy, Japan, by whom any Sino-US rapprochement was viewed with great suspicion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047117811411741">16</xref></sup> As it recovered from the devastating impact of World War II, the Chinese were worried that Japan would rediscover its expansionist tendencies. In a worst-case scenario, if things went badly with the Soviets, the Chinese leadership believed it could end up fighting a war on two fronts, with both Taiwan and Japan exploiting Chinese deployments to counter the Soviets in the north and west to mount assaults in the east. The United States was viewed by the Chinese as having a key role to play in containing any Japanese expansionist ambitions and influencing the status of Nationalist China in the eyes of the rest of the world. This analysis was shared by the US intelligence community. In a briefing note for the State Department, intelligence analyst Ray S. Cline spells out what he believed lay behind the PRC’s sporting detente:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Peking’s most immediate consideration in adopting ‘people’s diplomacy’ toward the US is presumably a belief that a show of reasonableness will fuel its current drive for international recognition and improve prospects for allocation of the China seat in the United Nations to the PRC in the fall … the impact on Moscow of PRC gestures to the US was obviously quite strong last winter and the present steps must have been designed in part for their effects in both Moscow and Tokyo. In addition, Peking presumably hopes that Taipei’s predictably anguished reaction will contribute to the PRC’s longstanding – and strikingly unsuccessful – effort to undermine morale on Taiwan and cause the Nationalist Government to collapse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047117811411741">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of ‘people’s diplomacy’ as expressed here is an important one. It is similar to the concept of ‘track two diplomacy’ and refers to civil society initiatives that utilize agents and activities without any formal political status in lieu of more formal political and diplomatic developments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047117811411741">18</xref></sup> It was China’s way of making tentative steps towards diplomatic and economic normalization with the rest of the world without initially running the risk of political failure. As Cline put it, ‘Peking will hope to win propaganda benefits while avoiding the tough substantive issues which would inevitably arise in governmental discussions or visits by high level US personages.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047117811411741">19</xref></sup> If, for whatever reason, the ping pong initiative had led nowhere, then there would have been little political fallout and, importantly, no loss of face by the Chinese leadership. This, of course, worked both ways, and the United States likewise saw the table tennis tour as an opportunity to edge forward its emerging policy of rapprochement with China with limited political risks.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to take account of the personal political agendas of Mao and Nixon. In the case of Nixon, he faced an election in November 1972 against George McGovern, an opponent who was avowedly anti-war. As we have seen, the Vietnam War had become increasingly unpopular and anything that could be done to suggest that the Nixon administration was making progress towards disengagement would play well in the polls. In Nixon’s own words, the ping pong initiative ‘opened a door’ which he was more than happy to walk through if it would help him get US troops out of Vietnam, while at the same time cocking a snook at the Soviets. Mao understood the needs of his former adversary and was able to play him accordingly:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Glowing and fascinated reports littered the American and major Western Press day after day. Mao the old newspaperman had hit exactly the right button. ‘Nixon’ wrote one commentator, ‘was truly amazed at how the story jumped off the sports pages and onto the front page’. With one move, Mao had created the climate in which a visit to China would be a political asset in the run up to the 1972 presidential election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047117811411741">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After much ‘back-channel’ diplomacy, including a top-secret visit to China by Kissinger in February 1972, Nixon became the first Western leader to make an official state visit to the PRC. Not only did this pave the way for a whole raft of new political, economic and military arrangements between the United States and the PRC (mostly in favour of the PRC), it also hugely enhanced Mao’s standing both at home and abroad. For his part, while Mao did not have to deal with the messy details of a democratic election, like Nixon he was equally obsessed with power and the retention and enhancement of his personal share of it. After Nixon’s visit, ‘Mao became not merely a credible international figure, but one with incomparable allure. World statesmen beat a path to his door’, massaging the former journalist’s considerable ego.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047117811411741">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Mao, and to a slightly lesser extent Nixon, were the greatest beneficiaries of ping pong diplomacy, undoubtedly it was Chiang Kai-shek and the ROC who were the biggest losers. In October 1971 the ROC’s membership of the United Nations was revoked and the PRC admitted in its place, also taking the ROC’s place as a permanent member of the Security Council. Eight years later the PRC was admitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and while the ROC kept its membership, it was forced to change its name to Chinese Taipei.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047117811411741">22</xref></sup> As far as Nixon and Kissinger were concerned, while constituting unfortunate ‘collateral damage’, the fate of Chiang Kai-shek and the ROC could not be put before US interests in the region and the world at large.</p>
<p>Today the Soviet Union is a receding memory and Vietnam is a peaceful and integrated member of the world order. The PRC is one of the world’s most powerful trading economies, and while it has yet to embrace democracy and fully sign up to international codes of human rights, it is a relatively open society and a far cry from the repressive era of the Cultural Revolution. Highly symbolic of this journey, Beijing was selected by the IOC to host the 2008 Olympic Games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047117811411741">23</xref></sup> It would be foolish to suggest that all this happened because in 1971 a little-known American table tennis player was late for his bus. Indeed as early as 1968 political elites in Beijing and Washington had begun exploring and probing unofficial channels through which the United States and China could be brought to the negotiating table.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047117811411741">24</xref></sup> On the other hand, it would be equally foolish to discount the contribution of ping pong diplomacy to the complex processes of detente that have produced these conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0047117811411741">
<title>Baseball diplomacy</title>
<p>The remaining and really interesting question is why – with the same key principle involved on the US side, i.e. Henry Kissinger − the table tennis initiative between China and the United States paved the way for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two powers, whereas only a few years later attempts to achieve a similar rapprochement between the United States and Cuba through baseball failed miserably. It is to this question we now turn.</p>
<p>Since Cuba’s independence from Spain in 1898 up until the Revolution in 1959, the political relations between the United States and Cuba, while never overtly hostile, had been based on what can be loosely described as neo-colonialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047117811411741">25</xref></sup> While the Cuban passion for baseball was clearly affected by US clientelism, over time the sport became a vehicle through which American domination could be resisted. Not long after the Revolution, with Castro in power and Cuba being characterized as a communist enclave, diplomatic relations between the two nations were severed. The American economic embargo and Cuba’s ban on professional sport were part of a tit-for-tat exchange that completely ruptured the historic sporting ties between the two countries. Put simply, each side refused to play ball with the other. These were the prevailing conditions when the idea of a series of exhibition baseball encounters between Cuba and the United States was first proposed in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>US−Cuba relations were fully influenced by the domestic political crises in the United States during the early 1970s. Although the diplomatic courtship between the United States and China described above came at the zenith of the Nixon−Kissinger partnership, the move towards a possible sports exchange between Cuba and the United States came as the Watergate crisis was coming to its calamitous end, and the disgraced President was leaving the White House. Kissinger, however, remained in place in a new administration under Gerald Ford. Fully dominated by Cold War political ideology, the relations between United States and Cuba were frigidly distant in the public’s eye, while remaining hotly intense and violent behind the scenes. Espionage sanctioned by each government against the other was rife, with right-wing Cuban exile groups recruited by the CIA acting as the fulcrum of this clandestine struggle. Mysterious paramilitary organizations known as Omega 7 and the Co-ordination of the United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU) waged violent campaigns against Cuba while the Cuban intelligence services sent agents to Miami to infiltrate these counter-revolutionary organizations. Sustained bombing campaigns against Cuban embassies and other government sites formed a central part of the ongoing anti-Castro campaign of violence. In the first half of 1974 alone, Cuban embassies were attacked in Madrid, London, Paris, Mexico (Mérida and Mexico City), and Kingston, Jamaica. One example of the deadly consequences of this ‘Cold War game’ was the worst act of terrorism in the Americas before 11 September 2001. On 6 October 1976 a Cubana airliner exploded soon after take-off from Barbados killing all onboard. Among the dead were the entire Cuban fencing team. This terrorist act is only one of the numerous attacks against Cuban interests by anti-Castro organizations. The destruction of the Cuban civilian airliner was merely one of the many activities the CIA has been involved in since the ill-fated Bay of Pigs misadventure in 1961. The CIA had been involved in numerous assassination plots against Castro and other acts designed to destabilize the revolutionary government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047117811411741">26</xref></sup> For example, in 1971 the CIA introduced African swine fever virus, appropriated from a US military base in the Canal Zone in Panama, to Cuba via these anti-Castro Cuban exile organizations, forcing Cuban authorities to slaughter half a million pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047117811411741">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the covert war being waged and overt relations between Cuba and the United States remaining hostile, there was a brief moment in the middle of the 1970s when it appeared that a potential rapprochement via sport might have been forged. Evoking the precedent created by the ping pong exchange with China, a similar stratagem was proposed for US−Cuba relations using baseball as its initial point of contact. The hardened American stance towards Cuba was beginning to soften in 1974. In April the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had voted for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two governments and for an end to the trade embargo. That bill, though, had virtually no chance to become law, since even in the waning days of his presidency Nixon remained adamantly anti-Castro, allegedly telling an aide, ‘There’ll be no change toward that bastard [Castro] while I’m president.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047117811411741">28</xref></sup> The dislike between the two administrations was mutual with <italic>Granma</italic>, the pre-eminent newspaper in Cuba, replacing the ‘x’ in Nixon’s name with a swastika while reporting the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p>Nixon’s resignation in August 1974 increased the possibility of a new diplomatic-political rapprochement between the two countries. A public sign of the thaw in relations was the first meeting between US elected officials and Cuban government representatives since the severing of diplomatic ties in 1961. US senators Jacob Javits and Clairborne Pell flew to Havana to meet Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials in September 1974. Although Nixon’s resignation publicly signalled a potential change in attitude toward Cuba by the American government, and while Nixon’s administration was dismantled, the major decision makers that determined US foreign policy remained in place. With the swearing in of President Ford, who had been a key player in bringing communist China in from the cold, it was thought among US State Department officials and other influential Americans that Kissinger might wish to replicate his success by cultivating similar relations with Cuba. Kissinger suggestively reinforced this view commenting that ‘he saw no virtue in perpetual antagonism’ with Cuba. Secret negotiations between State Department officials and the Ministry of the Interior began in January 1975.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047117811411741">29</xref></sup> However, these discussions did not include any mention of a potential sports exchange. Any potential ‘baseball diplomacy’ was kept entirely separate from other diplomatic negotiations and plans to the point of excluding prominent politicians involved in other policy debates regarding Cuba.</p>
<p>The idea of a US−Cuban baseball exchange was first formally proposed under the auspices of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Bowie Kuhn. In a series of secret communiqués between the State Department and Major League Baseball (MLB) throughout 1975, the potential merits and ramifications of the US−Cuba baseball exhibition game between the Cuban national team and an All-Star team of MLB stars were weighed. There are a number of intriguing developments revealed in these documents. The first is that MLB had been in communication with the Cuban Ministry of Sport, the Instituto Nacional de Deporte, Educación Física, y Recreación (INDER) outside any official political communication channels. The second is how blinkered American bureaucrats were in their considerations of how the US would benefit from such a sporting exhibition. A third revealing development is the degree to which MLB was attempting to assert a role in international politics for what can only be considered vague motivations at this time. Lastly, it is also revealing that the Cubans were also apparently considering their own baseball infrastructure in relation to the American leagues.</p>
<p>In declassified documents obtained from the NSA, Bowie Kuhn, writes to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in January 1975 proposing that a Major League All-Star squad should travel to Cuba at the end of March for an exhibition series. In a series of communiqués over the ensuing six weeks the proposal is considered, debated and rejected. The following outlines the key features of those deliberations.</p>
<p>In his initial query Kuhn identifies a Cuban exile, Preston Gomez, who had a long working relationship with MLB and had apparently already acted as a go-between for MLB and INDER.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047117811411741">30</xref></sup> At that time Gomez was a manager of the Houston Astros. In the 1940s he had played professional baseball in the US and continued to migrate seasonally between Cuba and the United States until the sundering of political relations in January 1961. Gomez remained in the US but worked continuously to maintain and improve relations between the countries, contrary to the powerful political currents swirling around him, especially the dominant virulent anti-Castro positions among Cuban exile groups in Miami. Gomez’s role is intriguing because Cubans publicly known to be ‘working’ with the Castro regime or even ‘advocating’ normal relations with Castro’s government were frequently targeted and all too commonly assassinated by the more extreme elements of the right-wing Cuban exile groups. Omega 7 and CORU, for instance, were running organized campaigns against Cuban interests around the world: they destroyed several embassies and assassinated Cuban diplomats and other revolutionary sympathizers. Both organizations were sponsored by and were comprised of individuals either formerly or currently employed by the CIA. However, Gomez’s dialogues with INDER officials in Mexico and elsewhere were not public knowledge. This is particularly curious since the initiative for this potential sporting exchange lies with MLB, a transnational corporation, rather than either government. It is probable that Kuhn was less interested in the politics than he was in the commercial potential that might follow any rapprochement.</p>
<p>Kuhn’s underlying motives had no bearing on Kissinger’s considerations. Kissinger emphatically and immediately rejected the exchange, writing in the margins of the memo proposing an exhibition an underlined one-word response: ‘No!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047117811411741">31</xref></sup> However, Assistant Secretary William Rogers was more supportive of Kuhn’s initiative. Rogers writes to Kissinger backing Kuhn’s proposal, saying that ‘major league baseball has a magic value in projecting a positive image of the United States wherever the sport is played’. Further, Rogers felt that ‘the announcement that a major league squad was to play in Cuba in late March [1975] would have a symbolic significance not limited to the sports pages’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047117811411741">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kissinger was curious as to why Rogers would favour such an exchange and asked him to outline his arguments further.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047117811411741">33</xref></sup> Rogers clearly saw such an exhibition as a potentially potent symbolic gesture that could counteract Cuban propaganda demonizing the United States, while simultaneously clarifying the American administration’s policies towards Cuba. Rogers outlines the symbolism involved and the potential benefits to the US administration. First, sending a Major League squad to Cuba would be ‘a public relations move [that] would correct some of the distortions in the [US] public mind about our Cuban policy – shifting the emphasis to a non-political and non-controversial area’. Second, Rogers likened such a move to Kissinger’s earlier work with the Chinese in shifting American public perceptions: ‘The Chinese ping-pong players were accepted by the US public as a good way to break the ice between countries separated by decades of hostility.’ Third, a baseball exhibition would help to redefine and dampen the hostility endemic in US−Cuba relations at that time. Baseball with Cuba would serve a similar purpose in bridging the gap between the Bay of Pigs and a new relationship with Castro.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047117811411741">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to outlining how such a spectacle might change American perceptions of both Cuban and US government policies, Rogers also outlines how such an exchange might affect both Castro and Cubans. He notes that prior to the Revolution, Cuba was ‘the most “Americanized” of any Latin American country’ in terms of cultural consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047117811411741">35</xref></sup> While technically accurate, what Rogers is failing to recognize is that Cubans’ sense of self-identity and worth is drawn from a distinction between the American as the Other and a complex Cuban concept of self that is wholly uncomfortable with the influence of US culture, while at the same time thoroughly enjoying the same kinds of commodities as signs of being modern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0047117811411741">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Mao Zedong before him, Rogers can see advantages in employing a low-risk form of ‘people’s’ or ‘track two’ diplomacy through a sporting exchange to test the waters for further political contact, without losing face if things did not work out. Extending his argument regarding how such an exhibition would be publicly perceived, Rogers also demonstrates the naïve assumptions of US State Department officials. On the one hand he rather naively argues that the apolitical nature of baseball would make it difficult for Cuban exiles ‘to take issue with [a baseball game] despite their general uneasiness about any change in US−Cuba relations’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0047117811411741">37</xref></sup>− an assertion that was patently ill-informed based on the degree of political outrage expressed when an exhibition series finally did take place 20 years later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0047117811411741">38</xref></sup> On the other hand, he argues that this sporting spectacle with an assumed American victory would be seen ‘as a shrewd Yankee political move’, thereby arguing that the supposed apolitical nature of such an exchange was entirely entangled in both international and domestic politics. In fact, Rogers pushes the initial point by suggesting that the President would have a sturdy platform for making an unequivocal comment on Cuban policy in an impending Miami appearance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0047117811411741">39</xref></sup> The depth of emotion coursing through the Cuban exile community and the particularly strong influence of the Miami-based Cuban right wing in national political circles is something that Rogers appears to be dismissing. If President Ford did make such an announcement in Miami in 1975, it would have been tantamount to political suicide given the lobbying power Cuban groups had already developed in Washington, particularly in view of the upcoming election in 1976.</p>
<p>Rogers also demonstrated supreme arrogance by arguing that the exchange should go ahead because ‘picking a game we are likely to win would go well with Americans who are depressed by the regimented victories of the Communists in the Olympic Games’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0047117811411741">40</xref></sup> Clearly he was unaware that by that point the Cuban national team had not lost in over 100 international games. There was no guarantee that a Major League squad would win, and nor was the possibility of it losing even entertained. The potential public relations damage from such a scenario was apparently unfathomable. This tunnel vision was proved even narrower by the Cuban Olympic gold medal victories in 1992, 1996 and 2004 in baseball, as well as the resounding defeat of the Baltimore Orioles in that 1999 exhibition series. In short, Rogers was committing the ultimate sin of underestimating his enemy.</p>
<p>These arguments notwithstanding, Rogers followed orders and informed Kuhn that an exhibition could not proceed at this time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0047117811411741">41</xref></sup> However, the channels were kept open and in May 1975 Kuhn again pushed for a trip to Havana for the following March.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0047117811411741">42</xref></sup> The impetus for this renewed effort emerged through unrelated yet parallel events. Senator George McGovern made a diplomatic tour of Cuba in early 1975 and met with Castro. During this encounter, the possibility of a sporting exchange or competitive sports exhibitions was discussed among other topics. While McGovern was debriefed by the State Department, which is standard procedure for all such diplomatic tours by US politicians, Castro publicly ‘invited’ American baseball to come to Cuba for an exhibition series. McGovern, who supported further and broader contacts with Cuba, asserted that the Cubans were enthusiastic about any possible exhibition, although the likely dates would be July 1975 at the earliest or the following March.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0047117811411741">43</xref></sup> McGovern was unaware of the earlier discussions between the Commissioner and the State Department and when made cognizant of them agreed that the matter should be kept confidential. Intriguingly, at the end of the State Department memo of 21 June 1975, in which Rogers outlines the proposed exchange, he informs Kissinger that ‘Bowie [Kuhn] and I have not brought McGovern into this and we do not intend to’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0047117811411741">44</xref></sup> What is interesting and beyond the scope of this paper is the State Department’s deliberate strategy to keep McGovern out of the loop regarding MLB’s attempts to organize an exhibition series with the Cuban national team. McGovern was a prominent liberal politician and a future Democratic presidential nominee whose stance on a number of issues challenged Kissinger’s own agendas.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1975 Kuhn pushes the State Department for an answer because the only feasible time for such an exhibition series would be in late March, before the start of the MLB season, as Assistant Secretary of State William Rogers notes in his communiqué to Kissinger dated 21 January 1975: ‘Late March is the only time a Major League visit to Cuba is possible. For purposes of TV and the Major League scheduling, Kuhn will need a final answer as to such a trip sometime around February 15.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0047117811411741">45</xref></sup> An exhibition series, if it was to be part of political diplomacy, could feasibly occur at any time. That Kuhn is insistent that the potential series has to be in March has nothing to do with international politics and everything to do with MLB revenues tied to broadcasting rights. MLB is interested in fostering contacts with a prominent baseball-playing nation but not at the expense of its own contractual obligations and potential profits. An exhibition series between April and October would force Kuhn to interrupt the MLB season, which the owners would not permit because of lost revenue. The immediacy of those losses would not outweigh the potential gains in expanding the global labour pool of athletes. The motivation for Kuhn revolves around the exploding unrest within the sport and the inevitable rising cost of wages. The era of free agency was about to begin, which would usher in spiralling wage costs for veterans but also the costs of signing new recruits were already escalating.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0047117811411741">46</xref></sup> This particular moment is when Latin American athletes began to establish a greater presence in MLB squads. A dozen or more young Latin American athletes could be signed for the cost of one North American, thereby spreading the owner’s initial investment risk in developing talent. It is in this vein, we argue, that Kuhn is thinking of the Cubans: as a future labour pool which the Cubans were prior to the Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0047117811411741">47</xref></sup> Rogers notes that Kuhn has come to the (most likely mistaken) view that Cuban baseball officials are reconsidering their relationship with US professional baseball. He acknowledges that ‘they have done their best to develop their talent, but being shut out of professional baseball here hurts; they would now like Cuban players to be able to look forward to the opportunity to play someday in our major leagues’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0047117811411741">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Misconceptions abounded throughout the entire process, with intentions masked and motivations hidden by all the players involved. Rogers notes that the Cubans appeared to be keen, yet he has his doubts over Cuban desire for such an exhibition and is seemingly unaware of the direct communications Kuhn has had with his Cuban counterparts. Kuhn has a letter from Fabio Ruíz Vinajeras, the vice-president of INDER, assuring him that the Cubans would be interested when circumstances permitted. Ruíz Vinajeras reassures Kuhn that failure to organize the proposed exhibition is not through Kuhn’s lack of interest or effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0047117811411741">49</xref></sup> Yet Rogers notes that he has seen nothing on the Cuba side that could be taken to be ‘a move to which the baseball trip might be considered’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0047117811411741">50</xref></sup> He suggests that there could a number of reasons for this apparent lack of interest:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This may be due to the stickiness of our communications techniques. It may be that the Cubans themselves have not been able to bring themselves to decide to do anything. It may be that the sports effort is a somewhat discoordinated step by a ministry not entirely related to political objectives and strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0047117811411741">51</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That particular misconception was ripped apart when in early 1975 Fidel Castro publicly invited a Major League squad to visit Cuba. His public ‘invitation’ re-galvanized US State Department considerations. Such a trip ‘would be to engender cordial relations between Baseball in Cuba and in the United States. There would be no political aspect or purpose.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0047117811411741">52</xref></sup> This proposed exhibition would consist of no more than two games in Havana, one of which would be televised live by an American television network in cooperation with the Cuban Broadcasting Institute. That telecast would carry a substantial rights payment, outside the already existing broadcasting contracts MLB had with US television corporations, that would be split equally with INDER. Although the initial comment is that the dates for such an event were open, the plan’s emphasis was placed on the games occurring ‘sometime in the last two weeks of March, 1976’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0047117811411741">53</xref></sup> However, an additional suggestion is made that ‘matches in Cuba should be combined with a match in Santo Domingo [Dominican Republic] for general foreign policy purposes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0047117811411741">54</xref></sup> Thus once again baseball was to be used as a foreign policy tool as advocated since A. G. Spalding asserted that baseball should ‘follow the flag’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0047117811411741">55</xref></sup> A Caribbean tour of this nature would also be in Bowie Kuhn’s interests since it would permit the potential expansion of MLB’s markets overseas and he thought the extension of the proposed tour was ‘an excellent one’. The Dominican Republic was rapidly becoming the primary overseas source of baseball labour, and an opportunity to also transform the Dominican Republic into a market for American baseball rather than the domestic national league would be an additional godsend.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0047117811411741">56</xref></sup> Extending the tour would fit in with the Commissioner’s first attempts to ‘grow the game’ in what amounted to the earliest vestiges of the globalization of baseball.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0047117811411741">57</xref></sup> This proposed tour, however, never materialized.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1975 deliberations and negotiations over whether or not to organize such a trip, the bureaucrats at the State Department masked their motivations for the potential sporting event. The eventual proposed contingent that would visit Cuba would be a selection of coaches and athletes from the rosters of all Major League squads along with ‘a party which would include umpires, club and league officials and American press representatives’. Yet while they were aware that there would be no overt political aspect or purpose to such a trip, Rogers and other State Department officials clearly foresee that it would be extremely useful political propaganda. Their interests were how to make the American government look good with the public at a time when American politicians and bureaucrats were dealing with the last aftermath of the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p>However, in 1977 a delegation of coaches and athletes from the Houston Astros did fly to Cuba to put on a coaching clinic and foster initial contacts with the Cuban baseball structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0047117811411741">58</xref></sup> The Astros, however, played no games; the trip was only permitted by the US Treasury and State Department if no games were to be played, precisely because of the potential political ramifications. Instead, the trip was an informational exchange on coaching techniques. The president of the Houston Astros, Tal Smith, had a long personal history with Cuba, having played there prior to the Revolution, and he was a close colleague of Preston Gomez. Although Gomez was fired as manager early in the 1975 season, he still worked within MLB and continued to work towards greater communication and understanding between the United States and Cuba under the auspices of baseball. Although he apparently did not travel to Cuba with the Astros’ contingent, he must have played a significant role in facilitating the coaching exchange given his close friendship with Tal Smith. Yet neither man informed Bowie Kuhn or MLB that they were going to Cuba because Smith did not want to get turned down.</p>
<p>Bowie Kuhn would, in all likelihood, have refused any request from Smith for a visit. By this time, Gerald Ford had lost the 1976 presidential election and Jimmy Carter had replaced him in the Oval Office. Carter signalled a slight shift in the Americans’ approach to the Cuban government, in part by replacing Kissinger with Cyrus Vance as Secretary of State. These political changes appeared to create a window of opportunity for various executives from MLB to travel to Cuba. Tal Smith was not the first. Bill Veeck, the Chicago White Sox owner, had already made a trip in 1977 to evaluate Cuban talent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0047117811411741">59</xref></sup> George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees, also visited Havana after several comments from influential Cubans, including Fidel Castro, that they would like to see an exhibition game between the Cuban national team and the Yankees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0047117811411741">60</xref></sup> Bowie Kuhn prevented such a game from occurring, despite the keen interest of the Yankees’ officials to participate in such a spectacle, because of those same concerns over controlling Cuban labour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0047117811411741">61</xref></sup> Other owners apparently felt that the Yankees would have a distinct advantage in signing Cuban players because of the proposed exhibition game. Kuhn baldly stated that there would be no exhibition games if Cuban players were not free to negotiate contracts to play in the United States despite Cubans flatly announcing that no team would have an advantage because they were not interested in selling their players.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0047117811411741">62</xref></sup> In other words, MLB’s interest was not the promotion of baseball but a desire to obtain control over a pool of athletic labour that was currently beyond their grasp.</p>
<p>The 1975 exhibition game did not occur as Kuhn desired, and the efforts to hold the exhibition in 1976 did not prove fruitful either. These efforts did not die though. Individual owners attempted, and in some cases succeeded, in making trips to Havana to meet with INDER officials. Indeed, the owner of the Cleveland Indians, Gabe Paul, made a visit in 1977 after Veeck’s and Steinbrenner’s separate spring visits, and the Seattle Mariners had an exhibition trip all arranged with the Cubans that Kuhn scuppered in 1978.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0047117811411741">63</xref></sup> These trips did not even reach the State Department because they did not fit Kuhn’s agenda for Major League Baseball. Instead, they were driven by individual team owners wanting to access Cuban talent ahead of their competitors. That was the context within which Tal Smith led his group of employees to Cuba for a few ‘secret’ coaching clinics. The Astros, though, were not the first US sports team to visit Cuba as part of a nascent yet burgeoning effort to foster cultural exchanges. On 5 April 1977, the first American sports team to play in Cuba since 1961 was a university basketball team. Senators George McGovern and James Abourezk (both representing South Dakota) watched from the stands as a team made up of athletes from South Dakota universities played the Cuban national men’s team in Havana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0047117811411741">64</xref></sup> Other exchanges did materialize, in athletics for example, in the ensuing months, but for the time being baseball diplomacy was essentially dead.</p>
<p>A baseball exhibition between a MLB club and the Cuban national team would have to wait another 23 years until 1999. Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, would become the catalyst for building a two-game exhibition series with a game played in Havana in March of that year, before the start of the MLB season, and then another in Baltimore two months later during one of the only off days the Orioles athletes had during that season. Once again, the initial stages circumvented the US government with clandestine communication between Angelos and the Cuban National Commission of Baseball. This proposed tour too would face determined resistance from both Cuban exiles in the United States and bureaucrats within the US State Department.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0047117811411741">65</xref></sup> Thus, because there were no US political officials involved in the planning or the staging of this exhibition series, it could not be considered to be a two-way process of baseball diplomacy and had little effect on US−Cuba relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0047117811411741">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite individual efforts, the potential encounter between Cuba and the United States on the baseball diamond had too many competing factions to ever succeed as a diplomatic bridge between the two countries. Beyond the machinations of Bowie Kuhn and the owners, the strategic ambitions of the Department of State also meant that any American approach to Cuba would be highly unlikely to succeed. The failure in the development of potential ‘baseball diplomacy’ is situated within broader Cold War politics, both domestically within the US government and internationally. Sport was constantly part of this shadowy game − a game with real grievous costs. The multiple attempts to undermine Castro’s regime and the Cubans’ Soviet-backed, defiant responses shaped the relationship between the Cuban and US governments during this period, leaving any attempts at sporting diplomacy between the two dead in the water.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>How sports-led diplomacy between the China and the United States in 1971 was allowed to be successful, but failed in the case of the US and Cuba only a few years later can only be explained, as we have attempted to do here, through a forensic examination of the surrounding circumstances. In the case of China it is clear that both the established superpower and the emerging one, albeit for different reasons, saw major advantages to be accrued in exploiting what may have been a serendipitous sporting encounter for political advantage. The United States wanted to pull out of Vietnam and believed forging a relationship with China could help facilitate this. China had fallen out with the Soviet Union and felt the need for a closer alignment with the United States to counterbalance the growing animosity and aggression being displayed by its former ally. For its part, the Nixon administration was only too happy to help drive a wedge between the two main powers in the Communist orbit, even if this meant sacrificing Chiang Kai-shek and Nationalist China and upsetting the Japanese. Furthermore, both Mao Zedong and Nixon were men with big egos who were concerned to strengthen and boost their image. Nixon had an election to think about and Mao needed a breakthrough with the Americans to enhance his reputation as a statesman both at home and abroad. Broadly, then, we can conclude that the ping pong initiative succeeded because of an interdependence of interests and an emergent ‘symmetrical power relationship’ between the United States and China, with corresponding domestic personal and political gains for both Nixon and Mao.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0047117811411741">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cuba presented a different case at a different time. Famously, a week is a long time in politics, and three years is an eternity. By the time the baseball initiative was first proposed to Kissinger in 1975, Nixon had been engulfed in the Watergate scandal and had left the White House. The Vietnam War was over and the United States was winning what remained of the Cold War – politically, economically, technologically and militarily. Although it was backed by the Soviet Union, Cuba, unlike China, was not an emerging superpower − rather it was a proxy of a declining one. The then President, Gerald Ford, had little or nothing to gain politically from encouraging a relationship with Cuba, but he might have had much to lose. Carter’s election in 1976 led to a slight shift in approach, but circumstances still prevented any real rapprochement. The expatriate Cuban population in the United States was both large and influential, particularly in Florida, a notorious ‘swing state’ in US electoral politics. Any rapprochement with Castro’s Cuba was regarded as political suicide for anybody who wanted to occupy and stay in office. Castro, on the other hand, had much to gain. The problem of almost total dependence on dwindling Soviet economic support could have been much ameliorated by renewed trade with the United States. A further factor was the presence of a third party, the transnational corporation Major League Baseball. Its role in shaping the rhetoric and negotiations of any baseball diplomacy cannot be ignored, but MLB had its own vested interests in promoting an exhibition series, as outlined above. Those motivations did not necessarily coincide with the political concerns of either the American or the Cuban governments.</p>
<p>Finally, in considering these two cases of US sporting diplomacy, we have to take note of the cultural significance of table tennis and baseball in China, the United States and Cuba respectively. While table tennis is a prominent feature of Chinese popular culture it is at best marginal to the sporting milieu in the United States. The Americans knew they were highly likely to lose in a ping pong contest with the Chinese – ‘friendship first’ notwithstanding – but the outcome of the games was not nearly as important as the fact that the two sides were actually playing together. In contrast, at the time baseball was the national sport of both the United States and Cuba and as such would be very high-profile, so that the outcome of any contest could have significant consequences for both parties in sporting and political circles. Therefore, despite what sports entrepreneurs may have wanted, any US−Cuba baseball encounter during the Cold War posed too great a risk, particularly for the Americans.</p>
<p>Thus, while there may have been symmetrical and balanced mutual interest in baseball circles in the United States and Cuba for facilitating sporting diplomacy between the two countries, albeit for different reasons, the same could not be said for political elites. On the contrary, in terms of foreign policy in the 1970s, it was in the interests of the United States to keep Cuba isolated and weak. In other words, there was an asymmetrical imbalance in power relations and political and economic interests on either side of the Florida Straits, with Cuba heavily outweighed. Finally, there is what we do not know and will probably never know. As Perez reminds us, the highly personalized nature of the antagonism between the United States and post-revolutionary Cuba should not be underestimated when trying to account for what otherwise might seem to be an irrational longevity of mutual ‘fear and loathing’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0047117811411741">68</xref></sup> No doubt buried deep in the NSA or CIA Archive there are other documents that might, one day in the distant future, shed light on the continuation of the US diplomatic and economic isolation of Cuba almost 50 years after the Revolution and two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>For the coming decades, as the most vehement phase of the Cultural Revolution dwindled and China moved away from its political isolationism, the concept of ‘friendship first, competition second’ was emblematic of the PRC’s modus operandi when it came to using sport as a tool to foster better relations with the international community. The encounter with the United States during the World Table Tennis Championships in Japan marked the beginning of this strategy.
