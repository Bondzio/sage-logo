<abstract>
<p>This study examined characteristics of child care centers associated with preschoolers’ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior while in child care (MVPA-C, SB-C), and attributes of outdoor play areas associated with the same behaviors during outdoor time (MVPA-O, SB-O). Participants were 89 children (3 -5 years) recruited from 10 child care centers in Brisbane, Australia. Children’s activity was measured by accelerometer over a 3-day period. Center characteristics and outdoor play area attributes were identified through survey and observation. We found that children were mostly sedentary while in child care. Lower child-staff ratios and using indoor play areas for motor activity were associated with more MVPA-C and less SB-C. Fixed play equipment in outdoor areas was conducive to more MVPA-O and less SB-O. This study suggests the possibility of enhancing preschoolers’ activity levels through changing these attributes. Further research with more centers from diverse settings is needed to test these findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The preschool period (defined as approximately between 3 and 5 years of age) is one of the critical developmental periods during which the pattern of health behaviors such as physical activity and sedentary behavior is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510393276">Certain &amp; Kahn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510393276">Pate, Baranowski, Dowda, &amp; Trost, 1996</xref>). Evidence suggests that physical activity has a beneficial effect on adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510393276">Moore et al., 2003</xref>), musculoskeletal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510393276">Specker &amp; Binkley, 2003</xref>), and motor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393276">Fisher et al., 2005</xref>) and that prolonged time spent watching television has a detrimental effect on adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510393276">Proctor et al., 2003</xref>) and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510393276">Zimmerman &amp; Christakis, 2005</xref>). It has been shown that around one half of preschool-aged children do not meet the U.S. National Association for Sport and Physical Education guidelines for physical activity, a minimum of 2 hr (1 hr of structured and 1 hr of unstructured) physical activity per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510393276">Tucker, 2008</xref>). Moreover, nearly half exceed the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for electronic media use of no more than 2 hr per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510393276">Vandewater et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is imperative to understand the factors that may influence physical activity and sedentary behavior of children during these preschool years.</p>
<p>Child care centers, preschools, and kindergartens are important settings for young children’s development as they provide safe and convenient opportunities for children to be active, and a large proportion of children aged 3 to 6 years (72% in Australia) attend a preschool or preschool program in day care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510393276">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008</xref>). Within this setting, there is a large variability in children’s physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510393276">Finn, Johannsen, &amp; Specker, 2002</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510393276">Pate, Pfeiffer, Trost, Ziegler, and Dowda (2004)</xref> reported that children in an active preschool engaged in more than twice as much moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) as those in a less active preschool. This variability may be due to differences in center characteristics such as curricula, practices, and policies, but it may also be attributable to differences in the physical environments of the centers, including the provision and quality of outdoor play areas.</p>
<p>Ecological models of health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510393276">Sallis et al., 2006</xref>) and of child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510393276">Moore, 1987</xref>) suggest that individual behaviors are influenced by multiple levels of factors, including individual, social, organizational, environmental, and policy. In the case of child care centers, a number of recent studies have examined associations of the organizational and environmental attributes of centers with children’s physical activity, with mixed results. On the subject of organizational attributes, preschoolers’ activity level in child care was found to be positively associated with teachers’ physical activity training in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510393276">Bower et al., 2008</xref>) but not in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>). Little research has examined other potentially relevant organizational factors, such as a child–staff ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510393276">Hinkley, Crawford, Salmon, Okely, &amp; Hesketh, 2008</xref>). Regarding physical environmental attributes, larger outdoor play areas have been found to be conducive to higher physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510393276">Cardon, Van Cauwenberghe, Labarque, Haerens, &amp; De Bourdeaudhuij, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>). However, research has produced mixed findings on the relationship of fixed play equipment in outdoor play areas with preschoolers’ physical activity. Two studies reported negative associations with physical activity in centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510393276">Bower et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>), whereas another reported no association with outdoor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510393276">Cardon et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the presence of fixed play equipment was positively associated with children’s sedentary time in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al. (2009)</xref> but not associated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510393276">Bower et al. (2008)</xref>. Further research is thus needed to examine organizational and environmental characteristics of child care centers relevant to children’s physical activity and sedentary behavior while they are in child care.</p>
<p>This study examined (a) organizational attributes of child care centers associated with preschoolers’ physical activity and sedentary behavior while in child care and (b) physical environmental attributes of outdoor play areas associated with their outdoor physical activity and sedentary behavior.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0013916510393276">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>A total of 37 child care centers providing long day care in urban areas of Brisbane, Australia (Australia’s third largest city with a population of approximately 2 million), were randomly selected from the list of 105 child care centers in the relevant areas provided by the Brisbane City Council. Of these, 11 centers agreed to participate and provided written consent. Center directors selected up to 12 children aged 3 to 5 years who attended the center 4 or more days per week to participate in the study. We chose a 4-day minimum to maximize the number of children who could participate in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each child’s parent or guardian prior to data collection. Along with the informed consent, each child’s date of birth was collected. A total of 107 children from 10 centers participated in the study (one center failed to return the parents’ consent forms).</p>
<p>Data were collected between June and September 2008. The winter season was chosen as Brisbane has a subtropical climate with dry and mild winters (warm enough for outdoor activity). During data collection, there were only two rainy days, for which data were collected on a later day. Ethical approval was obtained through the University of Queensland Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee.</p>

<sec id="section4-0013916510393276">
<title>Outcome Variables: Children’s Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior</title>
<p>Accelerometers were used to measure children’s physical activity and sedentary behavior objectively. The accelerometer is a device that records the intensity and duration of the movement (acceleration), and data can be downloaded for computer analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510393276">Tudor-Locke &amp; Myers, 2001</xref>). Accelerometers are widely used to objectively measure preschool-aged children’s physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510393276">Kelly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510393276">Pate et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Participating children wore an Actigraph GT1M accelerometer (weight 27 g; dimensions 3.8 × 3.7 × 1.8 cm) on their right hip for 3 days while attending child care. A staff member at each center attached the accelerometer to each participating child when he or she arrived in the morning and took it off before the child went home. Each child wore the same accelerometer each day. Center staff also recorded the time the accelerometers were put on and taken off and outdoor time for each child in an activity log.</p>
<p>Accelerometer data were collected in 15-s epochs to capture short bursts of activity characteristic of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510393276">Nilsson, Ekelund, Yngve, &amp; Sjöström, 2002</xref>). This sampling interval was also used to categorize accelerometer output into sedentary behavior, light-intensity physical activity, and MVPA. In this study, we calculated time spent in MVPA and in sedentary behavior while in child care (MVPA-C and SB-C) using the age-specific cut-points, specified in 15-s epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510393276">Sirard, Trost, Pfeiffer, Dowda, &amp; Pate, 2005</xref>). Time spent in MVPA and sedentary behavior during outdoor time (MVPA-O, SB-O) was also determined, using the same cut-points, based on the outdoor time recorded in the activity log.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916510393276">
<title>Independent Variables: Attributes of Centers and Outdoor Play Areas</title>
<p>Characteristics of the centers were collected using a short questionnaire completed by the director. Questionnaire items included the number of children attending the center (on a typical day), the number of staff members (full-time equivalent), the number of staff trained in the area of children’s physical activity, and the use of indoor spaces for motor activities (yes or no). The number of children was divided by the number of full-time equivalent staff to calculate the child–staff ratio. A plan of the outdoor play areas was obtained from each center. If centers did not have such a plan, a simple plan was drawn by research staff who measured necessary dimensions.</p>
<p>To identify attributes of the outdoor play areas, the area was divided into “unit” spaces first. The number of unit spaces ranged from 4 to 15 (median: 8). These spaces were differentiated from adjacent spaces by some form of demarcation such as a fence, change in surface level or material, or the presence of an overhead structure (e.g., roof or shade cloth). The following attributes were identified for each unit space through observation by two research staff members: fixed play equipment (number), the amount of shade (little, partly, and mostly), vegetation (none, hedge, plants, and trees), gradient (none, gentle, and considerable), and surface material (concrete, grass, mulch, timber, and synthetic). Interrater agreement (percentage of exact agreement across centers) of these items was 100% for fixed play equipment, 76% for shade, 88% for vegetation, 90% for gradient, and 100% for surface material. When two raters disagreed, agreement was sought by examining photographs of the play areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013916510393276">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Multilevel linear regression analysis examined associations of the attributes of centers or outdoor play areas with the outcome variables, adjusting for the effects of clustering (within-center similarity). As ecological analysis (using center as a unit of analysis) does not account for individual differences within centers, multilevel analysis was needed to examine the effects of center-level variables after correcting for individual-level variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510393276">Roux, 2001</xref>). For MVPA-C and SB-C, we ran null models (without any independent variables) first to identify within-center similarity. Then, the analysis examined associations of center attributes with each of these behaviors, adjusting for age, gender, and the time the accelerometer was worn. Using a median split, we dichotomized center size (50 or less children, more than 50 children) and child–staff ratio (6 or less children per staff member, more than 6 children per staff member). Associations of the attributes of outdoor play areas with MVPA-O and SB-O were also examined, adjusting for age, gender, and time spent outdoors. The size of outdoor play areas was dichotomized using a median split into smaller (400 m<sup>2</sup> or less) and larger (more than 400 m<sup>2</sup>). The number of pieces of fixed play equipment was used as a continuous variable. Centers were categorized according to surface material (whether the majority of the outdoor play areas had a natural surface or not). Grass and mulch were considered as natural. Similarly, play areas were categorized by vegetation (whether the majority of outdoor play areas had vegetation or not) and by shade (whether the majority of outdoor play areas had shade or not). For gradient, play areas were classified into no gradient (flat) or containing some gradient. Such binary classification was used as no specific criterion has been identified in past research. Each center or outdoor play area attribute was examined separately. STATA 10 was used for analysis.</p>

<p>The average time the accelerometer was worn by children was approximately 6 hr and 40 min per day, ranging from 4.5 hr in the shortest operating center to 8 hr in the longest operating center (including children’s naptime). The time spent in MVPA-C and SB-C was on average 6% and 81% of the total monitored time, respectively (the remainder, 13%, was light-intensity activity). Centers differed considerably in MVPA-C and SB-C. Average daily MVPA-C time ranged from 12 min/day to 36 min/day, whereas time spent in SB-C ranged from 217 min/day to 389 min/day. After adjusting for the time the accelerometer was worn, the centers were found to be significantly different from each other in MVPA-C, <italic>F</italic>(9, 79) = 5.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, and in SB-C, <italic>F</italic>(9, 79) = 3.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Participating children spent on average slightly less than 2 hr/day outdoors, which occupied about 30% of their accelerometer wear time. Average outdoor time ranged from 42 min/day to 198 min/day. Time spent in MVPA-O and SB-O was 12% and 66% of the outdoor time, respectively.</p>
<p>Multilevel analysis (null model) found a high level of clustering with an intraclass correlation coefficient of .41 for MVPA-C and .69 for SB-C, indicating that children’s behavior patterns were highly dependent on which center they attended. Regression analysis found that some center characteristics were associated with MVPA-C and SB-C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510393276">Table 3</xref>). After adjusting for age, gender, and accelerometer wear time, those children who attended centers with a lower child–staff ratio (six or less children per staff member) engaged in significantly more MVPA-C and less SB-C, compared with centers with a higher child–staff ratio. Centers using indoor spaces for motor activity tended to be higher in MVPA-C and lower in SB-C. Children who attended centers where one or more staff member had some training in children’s physical activity engaged in more MVPA-C, compared with centers without such staff. Center size (based on the number of attending children) was not significantly associated with MVPA-C or SB-C.</p>

<p>The attributes of outdoor play areas associated with MVPA-O or SB-O were the number of pieces of fixed play equipment and the surface material (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013916510393276">Table 4</xref>). It was found that every additional piece of fixed play equipment was associated with 2 min more MVPA-O and 4 min less SB-O per day, after adjusting for age, gender, and outdoor time. Children attending centers where the majority of the outdoor surface was “natural” (grass or mulch) were found to engage in less MVPA-O, compared with centers with mostly “built” surfaces. The other outdoor play area attributes (area size, vegetation, gradient, and shade) were not significantly associated with MVPA-O or SB-O.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that preschoolers were mostly sedentary while in child care. Participating children, on average, spent more than 80% of their time in child care being sedentary, while the mean amount of time spent in MVPA was just 24 min/day (6% of the monitored time). A low level of physical activity in this age group has also been reported in previous studies in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510393276">Brown et al., 2009</xref>), the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510393276">Reilly et al., 2006</xref>), and Belgium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510393276">Cardon &amp; De Bourdeaudhuij, 2008</xref>). In particular, the latter study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510393276">Cardon &amp; De Bourdeaudhuij, 2008</xref>) reported similar results to our own, 5% and 85% of monitored time spent in MVPA and sedentary behavior, respectively, using the same epoch and cut-points.</p>
<p>It has recently been recommended that Australian children aged 3 to 5 years be physically active for at least 3 hr/day, which includes light-intensity activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510393276">Department of Health and Ageing, 2009</xref>). As many preschool children spend a large proportion of their weekday waking hours in child care, they may need encouragement to be much more active during this time to meet this recommendation. It is important to highlight that preschoolers’ physical activity levels are determined to a considerable degree by the centers they attend. Our findings thus confirm an important role of child care centers in promoting preschoolers’ physical activity in the broader context of gross motor development.</p>
<p>It needs to be noted that a wide range of early childhood play activities essential for young children’s development (interaction with friends, small motor play with toys, and fantasy play) are typically sedentary in nature. Thus, sedentary behavior for this age group should not be automatically considered as a negative behavior, unlike the case for adults. However, in the light of preschoolers spending only a small proportion of their time in physical activity while in child care, promoting physical activity should have a high priority in child care programs and centers as part of an overall gross motor development strategy.</p>
<sec id="section9-0013916510393276">
<title>Attributes Associated With Center-Level Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior</title>
<p>Lower child–staff ratios and the use of indoor space for gross motor activities were associated with more physical activity and less sedentary time. It is possible to argue that children may require stimuli or opportunities provided by staff to be active, and those in centers with fewer staff members may lack such encouragement for being physically active. Staff member training in physical activity was also found to be associated with children’s physical activity, potentially through increased staff competence in leading movement or activity programs. The findings on the use of indoor spaces for motor activity suggest the importance of indoor places being available for children to engage in gross motor activities such as dancing and playing games. However, center size (in terms of the number of children) was not relevant to preschoolers’ activity patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0013916510393276">
<title>Attributes Associated With Outdoor Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior</title>
<p>The study found that children were largely sedentary in outdoor play areas (66% of their outdoor time). Outdoor playtime would seem to provide an ideal opportunity for children to engage in physical activity, although some outdoor activities such as playing in sandpits may be more sedentary.</p>
<p>We found that a greater number of pieces of fixed play equipment was associated with more outdoor physical activity and less sedentary behavior. Fixed play equipment such as climbing structures and slides may provide opportunities or stimuli for children to be active (move, climb, crawl, jump, swing, etc.), which in turn reduces their sedentary time. This finding is supported by an experimental study that showed increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behavior after the addition of portable play equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510393276">Hannon &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>) and by a study on playgrounds (not within preschools) that showed children in areas with installed play equipment to be more active than those in open grass areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510393276">Farley, Meriwether, Baker, Rice, &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>). An additional piece of fixed play equipment may also create a transitional space between the equipment, facilitating movement from one area to the other. However, there are studies reporting contrasting findings. The presence of fixed play equipment was associated with less physical activity measured by accelerometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>) and by observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510393276">Bower et al., 2008</xref>), although physical activity in these studies included both indoor and outdoor activity. A potential reason for such discrepancy in the findings is that some children may wait for their turn to use the equipment. It is also possible that some types of fixed equipment are used for sitting and social interaction rather than gross motor activity. A study reported that play equipment can involve different types of play, including social interaction and imaginary play, which can be relatively sedentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510393276">Maxwell, Mitchell, &amp; Evans, 2008</xref>). Further research is needed to examine the types and design characteristics of play equipment that encourage more gross motor activity and to look at a potential moderating role of crowding in play areas on the relationships of fixed play equipment with preschooler’s physical activity levels.</p>
<p>Children in centers where the ground surface of outdoor play areas was mostly natural, typically grass, tended to spend less time in physical activity, compared with “built” surfaces, typically synthetic carpet or rubber mats. It can be argued that a built surface was associated with more physical activity because fixed play equipment is often installed on such surfaces. The presence of vegetation was not significantly associated with outdoor activity patterns. This means that vegetation in outdoor play areas per se is unlikely to increase or decrease children’s activity. As having contact with natural elements in early childhood is considered to have a number of benefits to children’s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510393276">Fjørtoft, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510393276">Kellert, 2005</xref>), providing grass, shrubs, and trees in outdoor play areas may be promoted from a developmental perspective. Future research may investigate the advantages and disadvantages of natural versus built surface materials and having natural elements in play areas to inform the design of activity-friendly and developmentally stimulating outdoor play areas.</p>
<p>The size of outdoor play areas was not related to outdoor physical activity or to sedentary behavior in this study. This suggests that it is possible to increase children’s physical activity by providing a stimulating play setting even in smaller outdoor play areas. However, this finding is not consistent with previous studies showing positive associations between larger outdoor play areas and higher physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510393276">Cardon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>). The variance of outdoor play area size in this study may not be large enough to identify significant associations. Further research using a wider range of outdoor play areas is necessary to address this inconsistency. In addition, it is important to identify the minimum outdoor play area size, below which children’s activity may be compromised, to inform the planning and designing of child care centers.</p>
<p>The amount of shade was not significantly associated with outdoor physical activity or sedentary behavior. This may be because 8 out of 10 centers had shade for the majority of their outdoor play areas. Due to the high prevalence of skin cancer in Australia, many child care centers have programs and policies that limit children’s exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510393276">Harrison, Saunders, &amp; Nowak, 2007</xref>). Thus, the participating centers may have been similar in terms of shade provision. A study in Sweden has shown that large play areas with vegetation (trees and shrubs) are associated with more physical activity but with less UV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510393276">Boldemann et al., 2006</xref>). It would be interesting for future studies to investigate the relationship between the presence of a sun protection policy and outdoor physical activity, and whether this is moderated by the amount of shade in outdoor areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013916510393276">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations need to be considered in interpreting the findings. The first is the small sample size. This made it difficult to examine, for instance, correlates of behaviors separately for boys and girls. Different factors may be relevant to each gender, thus, combining genders may have masked potential associations. In addition, the 10 participating centers were mostly located in the urban areas of Brisbane, which may have resulted in less variability in attributes of child care centers and outdoor play areas. Another limitation is that the study may have failed to include other potentially relevant confounding variables such as “style” of play (structured vs. unstructured). Finally, the particular cut-points applied to the accelerometer data may have implications for the findings. The cut-points for sedentary behavior used in the study, 300 to 400 counts per 15 s (depending on age), aimed to capture “sit and play,” which involves limited trunk and limb movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510393276">Sirard et al., 2005</xref>). Although this value was equivalent to the cut-point of 1,100 counts/min previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510393276">Reilly et al., 2003</xref>), other studies have used a much lower threshold—36.5 counts per 15 s—for the same age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393276">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>). A standard set of cut-points for this age group may be needed to allow direct comparison between studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite the limitations discussed above, this study has identified a number of organizational and physical environmental attributes of child care centers associated with children’s physical activity and sedentary behavior. Changing these attributes may help preschoolers to be more active while in child care. More research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study using preschools recruited from diverse settings and to identify the relative importance of determinants of children’s behaviors. Causal relationships between child care attributes and outcome behaviors need to be examined through longitudinal and intervention studies. In addition to organizational and environmental attributes, research should also examine the impact of physical activity policy (adopted at the level of individual center, group of centers, or local government) on preschoolers’ activity levels. With regard to outdoor play areas, developing typologies (e.g., open space surrounded by play equipment, open space surrounding play equipment, paths connecting different play areas/equipment, etc.) and investigating whether they differ in terms of children’s physical activity patterns would be informative for the planning and designing of play areas supporting physical activity. The accumulation of such studies will inform the development of policy and design recommendations for child care centers that encourage greater levels of preschoolers’ physical activity.</p>
