<p>This study focuses on the experimental comparison of combustion phenomena and nanoparticle emission characteristics from a wall-guided direct-injection (DI) spark ignition engine for gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). A returnless gasoline direct-injection (GDI) fuel supply system was reworked for the return-type liquid-phase LPG injection fuel supply system that was composed of an LPG tank with a brushless d.c. pump and a low-pressure regulator to supply the stable liquid-phase LPG for the DI engine. To verify the clean combustion characteristics of the LPG DI engine, nanoparticle concentrations obtained with a differential mobility spectrometer and the total hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emission levels were compared with those of a gasoline-fuelled engine. The maximum performance and the part-load combustion phenomena of the two fuels were evaluated. In conclusion, the nanoparticle and exhaust emissions of the LPG DI engine were much lower than those of the GDI engine. Furthermore, the combustion performance of LPG in the full-load condition was comparable with that of the gasoline fuel, and the combustion stability in a part-load condition of LPG was better than that of gasoline because it evaporated very rapidly and mixed well with the air. As a result, a substantial reduction in the fuel wetting in the combustion chamber was achieved.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, toxic emissions and greenhouse gases from internal combustion engines have been important issues for vehicle-manufacturing companies. In Europe, the diesel engine is widely used to reduce the level of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but conventional port fuel injection (PFI) gasoline engines have disadvantages compared with diesel engines in terms of fuel economy. Thus, using a downsized gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engine with a turbocharger is the key to overcoming the fuel economy issue. A GDI engine can achieve a fuel economy comparable with that of a diesel engine with a higher power output than conventional PFI gasoline engines.</p>
<p>However, the GDI combustion mechanism inherently produces particle emissions because of the high-pressure injection and wall wetting in the combustion chamber during the cold-start phase. Therefore, many studies have aimed to reduce the particulate emissions from GDI engines while at the same time optimizing the control strategy, the fuel supply system, the combustion chamber modifications, and the installation of a particulate filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011413058">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011413058">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Current particulate matter (PM) standards regulate particle emissions in terms of the total mass of PM emitted per kilometre travelled. This regulation is an effective way of controlling larger-sized particle emissions because finer particles contribute little to the total mass of PM emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407011413058">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407011413058">7</xref>]. Although the particulate mass from diesel engines is higher than from gasoline engines, the total number of gasoline vehicles travelling in cities is much higher than the total number of diesel vehicles. Gasoline vehicles may contribute up to 68 per cent of the particulate mass and 90 per cent of the particulate numbers generated by vehicle engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011413058">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011413058">9</xref>]. However, in the Euro-6 emission regulation, the nanoparticle number standards which are applied to light-duty diesel engines (6.0 × 10<sup>11</sup> N/km) might be applied to GDI engines in the near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011413058">10</xref>]. In the USA, the California Air Resources Board is debating the future particle emission regulation in the LEV III emission standard. On the basis of the research, the particle number concentration is expected to be 1.2 × 10<sup>12</sup> N/mile for GDI vehicles without a particulate filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011413058">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as a clean fuel, is considered one of the most promising alternative automotive fuels worldwide because of its potential for reducing emissions, its relatively low fuel price, and its CO<sub>2</sub> advantage compared with gasoline fuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011413058">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011413058">13</xref>]. Two kinds of LPG-fuelled vehicle, namely liquid-phase LPG injection and gas-phase LPG injection, comprise up to 14 per cent of the total number of passenger vehicles in the Republic of Korea. The nanoparticle concentration from the PFI LPG engines over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP)-75 and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) were lower than those of PFI gasoline engines. For the NEDC, the particle numbers were 9.95 × 10<sup>10</sup> N/km for LPG and 1.44 × 10<sup>11</sup> N/km for gasoline. The total particle numbers for each fuel during the FTP-75 driving cycle were at similar levels to the NEDC results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011413058">14</xref>]. Because the advanced GDI engines were largely introduced in automotive powertrains, comprehensive research on the LPG direct-injection (DI) engine was required in terms of the engine performance and the emissions with particles. The purpose of this paper is to compare the nanoparticle concentrations and gaseous emissions (total hydrocarbon (THC) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>)) of GDI and LPG DI engines in part-load operating conditions. Finally, the combustion phenomena for the part-load and full-load cases were analysed to evaluate the maximum cylinder pressure, the mass burned fraction, and the combustion stability of each fuel.</p>

The combustion performance, the particle number concentration, and the size distribution characteristics of the engine were analysed using an engine dynamometer test.

The test engine was a wall-guided GDI engine with a double overhead camshaft, in-line four cylinders, and a 2.4 l gasoline-fuelled spark ignition engine equipped with a dual continuously variable valve timing (CVVT) device. A dome-shaped combustion chamber with a side-mounted six-hole injector was used, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011413058">Fig. 2</xref>. The combustion performance of the GDI engine was improved by injection during the intake stroke mainly focused on the complete vaporization and mixing of fuel and air. In-cylinder fuel vaporization reduced the charge temperature, which increased the charging efficiency of the GDI engine. The high-pressure pump, which was operated by the camshaft, pressurized the fuel to a maximum pressure of 150 bar. The injector was made by the Continental Automotive Co. Inc. The Sauter mean diameter of the injector is less than <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0954407011413058">

The particle number concentrations and size distributions were directly measured before the three-way catalyst position with a differential mobility spectrometer (Cambustion DMS500). The THC and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentrations were analysed with a flame ionization detector and a chemiluminescent detector respectively. A commercial low-pressure d.c. pump maintained at 4.5 bar was used for the base GDI engine test. However, a brushless d.c. type of low-pressure pump and a pressure regulator for the LPG application were installed to modify the GDI returnless fuel system. The fuel pressure applied to the high-pressure pump of LPG was constantly maintained by a downstream pressure regulator at pressures up to 7 bar for the entire low-pressure fuel supply line. The same peak and hold type of fuel injectors controlled by the electronic control unit were used for the two types of fuel. The fuel injection mass was adjusted by modifying the injector characteristic value to match the target air-to-fuel ratio of the LPG fuel during the part-load and full-load conditions. The combustion phenomena were analysed with a combustion analyser and a spark-plug-type pressure sensor.</p>

<title>2.2 Specifications of tested fuels</title>
<p>LPG is a petroleum-derived colourless gas, typically consisting primarily of either propane or butane, or of a combination of the two. The butane-to-propane ratio of the LPG fuel is varied according to environmental parameters, such as the temperature. For example, it is preferable that the fuel contains 100 per cent butane during a hot summer, when the LPG fuel may evaporate more easily because butane has a higher vaporization point. On the other hand, the preferable butane-to-propane ratio of the LPG fuel is 70 to 30 during a cold winter. The propane component in the LPG fuel in the Republic of Korea has been increased to improve the cold startability of LPG vehicles in the winter season. For example, LPG fuel in the summer consists of at least 98 per cent butane, while propane is added to the winter-season LPG (maximum, 35 vol % basis).</p>
<p>For mixer systems, which account for over 80 per cent of LPG vehicles, a higher vapour pressure is advantageous for cold startability, while the percentage of propane in the LPG is irrelevant for the liquid-phase LPG injection system. In this experiment, winter LPG is composed of <italic>n</italic>-butane (46.4 per cent), <italic>i</italic>-butane (29.9 per cent), and propane (23 per cent). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011413058">Figure 3</xref> represents the chromatogram and composition of the tested LPG in this research as analysed by gas chromatography.

The total particle number at the engine-out sampling point varied from 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup> to 1.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup> for gasoline, and the amount of PM emitted from the LPG engine was approximately one order of magnitude lower than the amount emitted from the gasoline engine. In particular, for gasoline in the 2500 r/min, 4.0 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) condition, the nanoparticle concentration reached approximately 1.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup> but, for LPG, it did not increase because of the fast evaporation in the combustion chamber.</p>

The increase in the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> level from the LPG engine was the result of fast burning and the higher peak cylinder pressure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011413058">Figure 7</xref> shows the results of the 90 per cent burning periods of fuel in the cylinder and the peak cylinder pressures. The peak cylinder pressure for LPG was higher than that for gasoline by approximately 0.4–2.0 bar. In order to make a comparison of the 90 per cent of mass burned durations after spark ignition, for LPG a 59–77° CA period was measured while for gasoline a 105–122° CA period was found. Thus, the fuel flame development period from 0 per cent to 90 per cent of LPG was shorter than that of gasoline. Fast burning of the fuel clearly led to a higher peak temperature. Thus the increase in the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> level resulted from the high peak combustion pressure and temperature.

<title>3.1.2 Particle, THC, and NO<sub>x</sub> emission characteristics with an excess air ratio</title>
<p>To analyse the mechanism of engine-out emission formation, the excess air ratio λ was varied in increments of 0.05 units from 0.9 to 1.1, while the SA and the valve timing were fixed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011413058">Figure 8</xref> shows the variation in the total particle number concentration with the excess air ratio in the 2000 r/min, 4.0 bar BMEP condition. In the case of gasoline, the total particle number in the rich operating condition reached approximately 5.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>–2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup> compared with 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup> for the stochiometric air-to-fuel ratio, and 8.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>–1.03 × 10<sup>6</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup> was measured for the lean operating condition. The excess air ratio of the GDI engine became rich, the fuel injection mass was increased, and unstable combustion occurred. Therefore, particle emissions were sharply increased because of the incomplete combustion of fuel stratification in the combustion chamber. However, the particle number (1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> N/cm<sup>3</sup>) emitted from LPG was insensitive to the air-to-fuel ratio because LPG is easily vaporized in the combustion chamber. As a result, a more homogeneous air–fuel mixture was formed in the cylinder.</p>

<title>3.1.3 Combustion phenomena with an excess air ratio</title>
<p>To analyse the combustion phenomena, the cylinder pressure was measured with a spark-plug-type pressure sensor and analysed with a combustion analyser. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011413058">Figure 11</xref> shows the cylinder pressure at various excess air ratios in the 2000 r/min, 4.0 bar BMEP condition. In the case of the two fuels, as the air-to-fuel ratio became richer, the peak cylinder pressure slightly increased. The peak pressure of LPG rose by 2.0 bar compared with the peak pressure for gasoline. When the fuel was injected into the combustion chamber, LPG was easily vaporized and mixed homogeneously with the intake air; this led to a higher combustion stability. The combustion stabilities indicated by variations in the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) over 50 cycles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407011413058">Fig. 12</xref>. As the air-to-fuel ratio became leaner, the combustion stability became worse. As a result, the coefficient of variation (COV) in the IMEP increased as the mixture became leaner. Furthermore, because the LPG easily vaporized in the combustion chamber, the COV in the IMEP is decreased.</p>

<title>3.2 Full-load test results</title>
<p>To compare the full-load performances of the GDI and LPG DI engine types, a test was performed from 1500 r/min to 5000 r/min at 500 r/min intervals with the same air-to-fuel ratios. The spark timings of the two fuels were the MBT condition. In the full-load tests, the combustion pressure was measured, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954407011413058">Fig. 13</xref>. The maximum combustion pressures of LPG DI rose by 5–10 bar compared with those of gasoline. This results from the proper vaporization after injection into the combustion chamber and rapid combustion of LPG fuel, as mentioned above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407011413058">Figure 14</xref> shows the maximum cylinder pressure during 150 cycles versus the CA at which the maximum pressures occurred. As the <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> location approached the top dead centre, fast burning in the combustion chamber was accomplished by rapid combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407011413058">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011413058">17</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407011413058">Fig. 14</xref>, the CA at the maximum pressure of LPG is smaller than that of gasoline, which means that LPG burns more rapidly because of its better vaporization of gaseous fuel than gasoline does. The flame development period is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954407011413058">Fig. 15</xref> according to the fraction of the fuel mass burned. The flame development period from 0 per cent to 50 per cent of LPG is slightly shorter than that of gasoline, approximately 2.3–4.6° CA, because LPG was more easily vaporized in the cylinder and homogeneously mixed with the intake air than gasoline was. The full-load performances of the LPG DI engine are comparable with those of the GDI engine. In conclusion, LPG has advantages with respect to particle and hydrocarbon emission levels, which are important for complying with emission regulations such as the Euro-6 or super-ultra-low-emissions vehicle emission regulations.</p>

<title>4 Conclusions</title>
<p>Part-load and full-load engine operation experiments were performed to understand the particle number concentrations, the size distributions, and the regulated emissions of gasoline and LPG fuel in a wall-guided DI spark ignition engine with dual CVVT. On the basis of these analyses, the following major conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<list id="list1-0954407011413058" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For the part-load condition in which the engine is mainly operated in the FTP-75 mode, the particle emission levels of the LPG DI engine were lower than those of the GDI engine by one order of magnitude because of the clean combustion and low carbon number in LPG fuel. The engine-out THC emission levels decreased by a maximum of 45 per cent, but the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration increased by a maximum of 30 per cent owing to the high combustion stability of LPG.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As the air-to-fuel ratio became richer, the engine-out nanoparticles gradually increased in the case of gasoline owing to the change in the fuel injection quantities and unstable combustion. However, in the case of LPG, the particle emission level was insensitive to the excess air ratio, because of fast vaporization and the fully homogeneous mixture in the cylinder. The THC concentration of LPG was reduced by approximately 46 per cent compared with that of gasoline, but the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission level is increased by a maximum of 40 per cent. These results occurred because of the fast burning of LPG and the outstanding combustion stability of LPG.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As the excess air ratio was leaner from 0.9 to 1.1, the maximum cylinder pressure is decreased for both the two fuels. The peak cylinder pressure of LPG is higher than that of gasoline in the 2000 r/min, 4.0 bar BMEP condition. This means that high combustion stabilities of LPG are accomplished. The COV of the IMEP for LPG was less than 3 per cent with respect to the air-to-fuel ratio.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results of the full-load engine performance tests showed that the maximum combustion pressure of LPG was higher than that of gasoline by 5–10 bar. The fuel burning period from 0 per cent to 50 per cent of LPG decreased by 2.3–4.6° CA compared with that of gasoline fuel. In conclusion, the LPG DI engine gave full-load performances comparable with those of the gasoline engine.</p></list-item>
