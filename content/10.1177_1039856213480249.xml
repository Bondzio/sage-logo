<body>
<p>In the 50 years of the life of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP), many Fellows have passed through their specialist training in psychiatry. Five decades have seen many changes in both the profession of psychiatry and the social and cultural times in which it was practiced. Whether it was during the tension of the Cold War, the social liberation movement, the threat of oblivion from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), nuclear war, or the implosion of the world economy, psychiatrists always learned their craft within the context of the times.</p>
<p>To commemorate five decades of Australasian psychiatry, four psychiatrists provided their reflections on the decade of their training and/or early work. In a separate article immediately following this paper, Anne Wand, a psychiatrist who trained in the first decade of the 2000s, provides a more in-depth account of the contemporary setting of psychiatry in Australasia.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856213480249">
<title>The 1960s (Joan Lawrence)</title>
<p>The 1960s in Australia, and indeed worldwide, was a time of societal change. In Australia, for psychiatry, it was the dawn of a new era. It brought about the birth of the, now Royal, Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, in 1963. Our discipline even accepted its then rather stigmatised title of psychiatry. It ‘came out’ from its disguise of ‘psychological medicine’. Both terms were always seen as more politically correct than the much earlier American term, ‘alienist’.</p>
<p>The severely mentally ill had services provided, for usually a very long term, in institutions that were often built in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, on a Queen Victoria based model: usually remote from the hub of the patients’ family, if there were any, and often in delightful surroundings which provided very comfortable houses for their psychiatrists, and usually his family. A handful of psychiatrists in private practice cared for the smaller numbers of citizens whose psychological problems necessitated care, for those who could afford it, as private health insurance had not long been introduced. Training for those pursuing specialist recognition (which was not required by Registration Boards in most states of Australia) was available, usually in asylums in Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and other Australian States where university diplomas could be acquired. Qualifications were by diplomas available most commonly in Victoria, but many travelled to the UK to acquire the ‘Conjoint’ Diploma of the British Psychological Society (later the Royal Medico-psychological Association). Child psychiatry services were rudimentary in Australia and were still being established, in this decade.</p>
<p>It had always been recognised that Queensland was different. A vast area, with services concentrated in the South East corner, except for a centre in Townsville, a small institution in Charters Towers and a padded cell in Cairns. The Brisbane General Hospital (BGH; later, today’s Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital) had Ward 16, a small Dickensian-like single-storey building that was described by one investigative journalist as ‘a disgrace to Queensland and like a 19<sup>th</sup> Century madhouse’. The walls seemed impregnated with paraldehyde and the staff clanked ominously, with their jail-like rings of huge keys on their belts. There was a preponderance of male staff, contrasting with the white, traditionally-uniformed female nursing staff, equally laden with clanking keys.</p>
<p>Ward 16 served as a reception house for patients from the metropolitan and district area. All who presented there as disturbed, intoxicated, agitated, over-dosed, raving, suicidal, or even homicidal were admitted, diagnosed, ‘treated’ and triaged. If likely to recover in 2–4 weeks, they were transferred to one of the two nearby open wards, Lowson House at BGH and the Winston Noble Unit, recently opened at Chermside, now Prince Charles Hospital. They were discharged if the presenting condition resolved quickly; the rest were transferred on the second daily bus run to Goodna Lunatic Asylum/Brisbane Mental Hospital/Brisbane Special Hospital/Wolston Park/The Park Centre for Excellence. Having the right name for the facility seemed essential for political correctness (acceptability): these five changes within 50 years’ time are not bad (beyondblue got it right the first time!).</p>
<p>Not all admissions survived. Overdoses, commonly of the widely-used barbiturates, were admitted in a comatose state and nursed in Ward 16 until recovery or its alternative. In the early 1960s, it was the work of a medical registrar,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213480249">1</xref></sup> who instituted a system whereby semi or unconscious overdoses had to be admitted to an Acute Medical Ward, where they received individual nursing with second hourly turns. In fact, his paper demonstrated the dramatic, virtual elimination of a previously high mortality rate from overdoses. Later, Queensland’s first Professor of Psychiatry and Head of Department, Professor Tony Whitlock, who arrived in 1964, further contributed to the reduction of the overdose rate and its morbidity, with his studies on drug dependence in sychiatric patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213480249">2</xref></sup> and his later successful advocacy for the presentation of psychotropic medication in individual packaging, instead of bottles of tablets, which could be so easily accessed on impulse. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213480249">3</xref></sup> Whitlock also researched<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213480249">4</xref></sup> suicide in migrants and socio-cultural influences, as well as contributing to other work on drunken drivers and reducing the road toll.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213480249">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>What about treatment? Now that was changing! In the asylums, Deep Coma Insulin and Unmodified ECT vied as the treatment of choice for schizophrenia. Subcoma insulin, barbiturate sedation, occasional abreaction and much environmental manipulation/respite predominated in the open ‘Neurosis’ wards. In the early 1960s, Largactil was introduced for treating schizophrenia, soon followed by melleril and stelazine. Though most of us workers in the field found these drugs far more efficacious, safer and easier to use than the quite frightening or unpleasant alternatives, old habits die hard. The Winston Noble Unit that opened in 1963 was designed and built with a special unit for Deep Coma Insulin: It was never used. On another occasion, in the mid-60s, I vividly recall a debate between a Visiting UK guru and our own, newly appointed, also of UK pedigree, Professor Whitlock, on the treatment of schizophrenia: On the ‘If it were your son or daughter’ type question, the visitor vigorously defended Deep Coma Insulin.</p>
<p>About the same time, Tofranil, the first tricyclic antidepressant, was introduced, closely followed by Amitriptyline. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors had already been introduced and were proven useful. As a first full-time consultant and psychiatry supervisor, I found these drugs very effective in the treatment of depression and the need for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (thankfully, by this time modified and available with anaesthetist supervision of the young, untrained interns who often gave it!) was reduced, but still an older and very experienced clinician was sceptical. Random Controlled Trials (RCTs) were unheard of at that time, but we learned that concept before the end of the decade: their utility and availability slowly increased.</p>
<p>In 1961, the Australasian Association of Psychiatrists (AAP), originally formed in 1946 and influenced by the war experience of many psychiatrists of that time, had determined that it would transform itself into a learned college, just as the surgeons and physicians had achieved expertise. Entry to the college would be by examination only, and the foundation for a truly professional body of learning in the specialty of psychiatry, producing clinicians of the highest standards of practice, would be established thereby in Australia and New Zealand. A curriculum, pre-requisite 3-year training requirements, a 2-part examination, each part with papers and vivas or clinicals, with scheduling and a recommending reading list were all determined, with David Maddison playing the part of the first Censor in Chief. The goal was to train psychiatrists of the highest calibre in Australia, not just academically trained, but well-trained, comprehensive, all-around clinicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213480249">6</xref></sup> Tensions between academics and clinicians and between the public and private clinicians were already alive and well in the 1960s.</p>
<p>At this time, I had ‘almost literally’ fallen into psychiatry at BGH, and certainly fallen in love with it, once exposed. For personal reasons, I was reluctant to leave Queensland at that time to follow the usual overseas training path. So when Vincent Youngman, then President of the AAP and Senior Psychiatrist at BGH, told me of the plans for a college with entry by examination, which would be available with local training, it was very opportune for me. There was no shortage of clinical experience at BGH.</p>
<p>I recall that the recommended reading list was relatively short, about six textbooks. Remember, there was no college journal, as there was no college. One could access the <italic>Journal of the British Medical Psychological Association</italic> and the <italic>American Journal of Psychiatry</italic>, as well as the <italic>Lancet</italic>, in university libraries, but journal articles were relatively sparse, and textbooks that were contradictory and undoubtedly out-of-date were the norm. The favoured general text was the British tome by Mayer-Gross, Slater and Roth. The <italic>American Handbook of Psychiatry</italic>, then in two volumes and edited by S Arieti, was also valuable, though not listed. It provided an interesting insight into the very different approaches to psychiatry at that time: the British bio-psycho-social descriptive and disciplined approach to diagnosis, versus the American approach, so widely influenced by the European psychoanalytic influx of the pre-World War II (WWII) era. Nevertheless, passing over the scepticism of the ‘schizophrenogenic mother’, and the myth of mental illness of Thomas Szas, the rapid subsequent development of pharmacotherapy over the rest of that decade and thereafter saw a shift of influence from the UK to America on the Australian scene, climaxed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 3rd Edition classificatory system, released in the next decade.</p>
<p>Australia, in its passage from dependent colonies to an independent entity, was able to select the most useful and meritorious concepts from abroad and adapt them to its own particular societal and cultural context, free of oppressive tradition. Revitalisation occurred during this process.</p>
<p>But back to our own embryonic college and its examination and rudimentary training requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213480249">7</xref></sup> In keeping with other collegiate and academic qualifications, ‘Part 1’ occurred after 2 years of medical practice, including 1 year as an resident medical officer at a general hospital. Part 1 mainly explored the basic theoretical knowledge of neuroanatomy and neuropathology, neurology, psychology, psychopathology and statistics, first with a written paper, followed by a viva. Successful candidates in both the latter aspects of Part 1 would then become eligible to sit for papers and clinical vivas in psychiatry, after completion of a full 3 years training, including 12 months in general psychiatric hospitals that were approved by the Board of Censors, and at least 30 half-day sessions at a child psychiatric unit, also approved by the Board. The exam fee was 30 guineas for the Part 1 and 20 guineas for Part 2.</p>
<p>Of the 20 applicants for Part 1, three were invited to the vivas: one survived and went on to pass Part 2, about 12 months later in 1962. Although a pass rate of 5% is not an encouragement to upcoming aspirants, a standard was quickly established and continued, fortunately with a much more encouraging future survival rate. The curriculum was revised, with benefit, in 1966–1967.</p>
<p>In 1962, the College had not yet been established formally, but I was able to be registered as a specialist in Queensland with the assistance of the incoming President, Dr Youngman. The ANZCP was formally incorporated in 1963–1964. I received my piece of paper, formally endorsed as 001, in 1965. A number of interesting contretemps arose out of all that: But that’s another story!</p>

<title>The 1970s (Richard White)</title>
<p>Caricatures of the ‘Me’ generation or ‘baby boomers’ in the films of Woody Allen, like <italic>Manhattan</italic> and <italic>Annie Hall</italic>, as both self-absorbed and morally conflicted, are sometimes accurate but, like all generalisations, often misleading. This generation reached adulthood in the late 1960s and the 1970s. They grew up in physical comfort and prosperity, but aware of the Cold War and of the risk, receding by 1970, of nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<p>By 1970, globalisation was well under way. World trade, travel and communications flourished, spurred by four developments: the new technology of containerisation, the launching of the Boeing 747, the invention of the microchip and advances in communication technology. Australia and New Zealand were evolving from being predominantly Anglo-centric cultures into new and distinctive societies.</p>
<p>Australians and New Zealanders were increasingly divided and perturbed about the war in Vietnam. In 1970, there was the biggest political demonstration in Australian history. Similar demonstrations occurred in New Zealand. There were also dramatic demonstrations against Apartheid throughout the 1971 bi-national Springbok tours.</p>
<p>In Australia, the 1970s were years of increasing political and social change. In 1972, the incoming Whitlam Labour Government promptly recognised the legitimacy of the People’s Republic of China, ended their military engagement in Vietnam, lowered the voting age to 18 and introduced a Northern Territory Land Rights Bill. In 1975, the Government introduced a universal healthcare program, initially called ‘Medibank’. Social change also resulted from the efforts of various civil rights organisations, such as those, for example, advocating gay rights. In 1975 and 1976, consensual same-gender sexual relations were legalised, respectively, in South Australia and in the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>The media and arts were often critical of psychiatry. The drama <italic>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</italic> was released as a film in 1975. Among the anti-psychiatrists of the 1960s, Thomas Szasz still maintained a high profile. The Church of Scientology continued its attacks on psychiatry, especially concerning ECT, deep sleep therapy, psychosurgery and involuntary hospitalisation.</p>
<p>In July 1970, the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (ANZCP), which had then been operating for 6 years, introduced an ambitious membership entrance examination. Its principal architect was the college’s first Censor-in-Chief (1961–1971) and first locally-born clinical Professor of Psychiatry, David Maddison. By his insistence on psychodynamic and diagnostic formulation skills, Maddison profoundly influenced the competence and attitudes of a generation of Australasian psychiatrists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213480249">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arguably the most important single event, leading to a more broad-based provision of services to the community by the Australian psychiatric profession, was the advent of federal reimbursement for time-based fee-for-service. If this had never happened, private psychiatry would hardly exist in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213480249">2</xref></sup> For anyone who doubts the importance of the issue of private practice, a comparison of Australia and New Zealand is instructive. The addition of psychiatric services to the Australian Medical Benefits Schedule led to an exodus of psychiatrists (possibly more than half of the profession) into private practice, but in time a balance would be achieved, so that many psychiatrists would ultimately divide their professional lives between private and public work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213480249">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the decade, medical ethics and bioethics came to the fore. In response to this, and in anticipation of further developments, the College established a Social Issues Committee in 1969.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213480249">3</xref></sup> That committee conducted membership surveys regarding attitudes on abortion, homosexuality and torture, and issued several related memoranda. In the <italic>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic>, several leading articles and presidential addresses focussed on ethical and social topics. These included gender identity issues, family law issues, censorship, the management of violence, the abuse of power by psychiatrists and abortion law reform.</p>
<p>Within the profession, there was increasing concern about reports of morbidity and mortality linked to the program of deep sedation therapy, run by Harry Bailey at Chelmsford Hospital. During the 1970s, several local psychiatrists publicly criticised Bailey’s various treatment methods and his published outcomes, and the media picked up the story; however, the extent of the casualties would not reach full community awareness until after closure of the program, in 1979.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213480249">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The preceding decades had seen the introduction of radically new antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, like chlorpromazine, iproniazid and imipramine. Innovations in pharmacology during the 1970s were less dramatic, but the evolution of derivative drugs with fewer side-effects and the provision of broader options for symptom control assisted the lives of many patients. Depot antipsychotic agents, like fluphenazine decanoate introduced in the 1960s, were now subjected to careful clinical comparison trials: these demonstrated that, when employed within well-planned community care protocols, they provided enhanced outcomes.</p>
<p>In 1971, John Cade, the discoverer of the anti-manic properties of lithium salts, contributed an editorial comment in the local <italic>Journal</italic> that reviewed the status of lithium therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213480249">5</xref></sup> Morgens Schou, who had finally demonstrated the therapeutic value of lithium carbonate, published an update on the use of lithium prophylaxis in the same <italic>Journal</italic>, in 1979.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213480249">6</xref></sup> The use of lithium, and of other mood stabilisers, is one of the great psychiatric success stories of the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Community psychiatry and other community services had developed, by utilising crisis intervention and consultative models that were developed earlier in the United States by Gerald Caplan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213480249">7</xref></sup> These programs were promoted by, among others, Eric Cunningham Dax in Victoria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213480249">8</xref></sup> and Bill Barclay in NSW. Many patients were discharged into boarding houses and other accommodations, so that chronic psychiatric wards would become a thing of the past. This had major implications for the management both of acutely and recurrently ill patients. Unfortunately, the creation and filling of community mental health appointments often lagged behind the earliest hopes and projections.</p>
<p>In 1959–1960, Wallace Ironside, who held the Foundation Chair of Psychiatry at Otago, visited George Engel in Rochester, to study his biopsychosocial model. In 1969, Ironside accepted the Foundation Chair of Psychiatry at Monash University, creating an enduring consultation-liaison service at the Monash Centre. In 1971, Issy Pilowsky accepted the Chair of Psychiatry at the University of Adelaide. By extending David Mechanic’s concept of illness behaviour, Pilowsky forged a new concept of ‘abnormal illness behaviour’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213480249">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213480249">10</xref></sup> Consultation-liaison psychiatrists quickly favoured Pilowsky’s new model, because it showed a more effective way to diagnose and manage difficult clinical roblems.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, the philosophical and ethical structures of psychiatry were shaken by the attacks of anti-psychiatrists such as Thomas Szasz. Young psychiatrists were appropriately concerned about the justness of these attacks. In 1974, Martin Roth, the main author of the authoritative textbook <italic>Clinical Psychiatry</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213480249">11</xref></sup> destined to be elected the first President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, engaged in a debate with Szasz that was published in the <italic>British Journal of Psychiatry</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213480249">12</xref></sup> In my judgement, and in my professional life, Roth’s arguments restored confidence in the validity of psychiatry and in psychiatry’s central role within medicine.</p>
<p>John Bowlby is accurately described as ‘one of the three or four most important psychiatrists of the twentieth century’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213480249">13</xref></sup> His best-known writings are his ‘Attachment and loss’ trilogy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213480249">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213480249">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213480249">16</xref></sup> In his inspiring 1979 paper, ‘Psycho-analysis as art and science’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213480249">17</xref></sup> Bowlby distinguished between two ‘very different aspects of our discipline – the art of psychoanalytic therapy and the science of psychoanalytic psychology’. He then proceeded to ‘emphasize the gulf that divides them’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213480249">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bowlby argued that research ought to be based on the systematic recording of data from multiple subjects and multiple sources, including ethological, comparative psychological and child and family studies. In contrast, clinical psychotherapy explores the life of a single subject in a circumscribed clinical setting; however, that setting does offer unique opportunities to identify phenomena that can later be transposed to the research setting.</p>
<p>For Bowlby, effective psychotherapy must provide a ‘secure base’ of attachment, before any exploratory work can commence. The importance of Bowlby’s emphasis on the therapeutic relationship would be confirmed by later research concerning what is now called ‘the therapeutic alliance’. According to Jeremy Holmes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213480249">18</xref></sup> Bowlby’s model is perfectly compatible with the practice of dynamically-informed supportive psychotherapy, a model that would inform and support my own future psychotherapeutic practices.</p>
<p>In the medical setting, the Conversational Model of psychotherapy, deriving from the ideas of Robert Hobson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213480249">19</xref></sup> and Australia’s Russell Meares,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213480249">20</xref></sup> offered additional hopefulness.</p>
<p>In 1970, it was obvious that the closure of long-stay wards in large psychiatric hospitals and the concurrent opening of acute psychiatric admission wards in general hospitals would not falter. It was also clear that general hospital psychiatry and the very new sub-specialty of consultation-liaison psychiatry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213480249">21</xref></sup> would flourish. As I gained experience in general psychiatry, I realised that my main vocation lay in consultation-liaison psychiatry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213480249">21</xref></sup> or in psychotherapy, or in a combination of the two. I recognised my abiding identification with, and interest in, general medicine. Therefore, I left the New South Wales state psychiatric service in 1975, to take an appointment in consultation-liaison psychiatry. In my new role, I was pleased to find that the treatment of cases of delirium, or of mood disorders associated with major medical illnesses, was as satisfying as the management of abnormal illness behaviour in patients with personality disorders. From my general hospital perspective, perhaps blinkered from problem areas in psychiatry, including the storm clouds gathering over Chelmsford Hospital, the prospects for psychiatry looked very favourable.</p>

<title>The 1980s (Nick O’Connor)</title>
<p>The 1980s are remembered for a number of international events: The period of <italic>perestroika</italic> and <italic>glasnost</italic> in the Soviet Union led to a questioning of Communist rule through Eastern Europe, and by the end of the decade, the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Cold War had effectively ended; the famine in Ethiopia and the <italic>Live Aid</italic> Concert of 1985; the protests against the Chinese government and the deaths in Tiananmen Square, in 1989.</p>
<p>In Australasia, there were Labor governments in Australia and New Zealand and economic reform occurred. Both countries floated the dollar, and dismantled industry tariffs and protections. This was termed <italic>Rogernomics</italic> in New Zealand, Roger Douglas being the Finance Minister from 1984–1988. In Australia, there was the wages <italic>Accord</italic> between the government and labor unions. In New Zealand, there was greater recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi, through the Waitangi Tribunal. Pressure from Aboriginal community groups in Australia led to the Royal Commission into Deaths in Custody, in 1987. Deaths and adverse incidents in New Zealand forensic hospitals led to the Mason Inquiry, which reported in 1988. In New Zealand, there was Homosexual Law reform. Probably best remembered is the New Zealand government’s stance on a nuclear-free Pacific zone and their refusal to allow US warships to enter New Zealand waters. In 1985, the Greenpeace vessel <italic>Rainbow Warrior</italic> was bombed and sunk by French agents in Auckland harbour.</p>
<p>John Lennon was shot in December 1980, Bob Marley died in May the following year and Andy Gibb died of myocarditis in 1988. We all remember Michael Jackson’s moonwalk and Madonna’s extraordinary costumes. Neil Finn formed the musical group Crowded House in Melbourne, in 1985. The eighties cinematic offerings opened with <italic>Chariots of Fire</italic> in 1980 and included <italic>Rain Man</italic> in 1988. Australia’s sporting record in the 1980s began with the shameful underarm incident of 1981, in a 1-day contest between our two countries. Men At Work’s <italic>Down Under</italic> became the theme song for Alan Bond’s successful America’s Cup challenge in 1983. Who can forget Bob Hawke’s advice to Australian bosses on national television that morning? The 1980s was also one of Australia’s strongest periods in rugby, with the Wallabies winning the Bledisloe Cup in 1980 and 1986, and the grand slam tour of 1984; however, it was the All Blacks who won the 1987 Rugby World Cup, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Internationally, the Jamaican bobsled team stunned the world with their performance at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.</p>
<p>As a young registrar, I first heard about a new and formidable disease in 1983. There were stories of rare illnesses, <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic> pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma, appearing in intravenous drug users and gay men with impaired immune systems. The virus was identified in 1983 by two independent research groups, led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier. By the end of the 1980s, a number of psychiatric sequalae were being described, and treating HIV/AIDS patients had become a specialist area of consultation-liaison psychiatry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856213480249">1</xref></sup> The term <italic>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</italic> (HIV) was officially adopted in 1986. Australia’s history, in relation to the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS, is one of the success stories of public health interventions. The controversial grim reaper advertisements certainly grabbed public attention and showed the government’s commitment. But the success of the Australian HIV/AIDS strategy was in the engagement of community stakeholders and in particular, the engagement of the gay communities through partnership with AIDS Councils in all states, and the introduction of needle exchange programs.</p>
<p>For the College, the 1980s was a time when the public standing of psychiatry fell to its lowest point. This period also found the College’s structures and governance processes sadly deficient, which resulted in enduring change. Brian Boettcher had written to the Chair of the NSW Branch in March 1979, with concerns about what was occurring at Chelmsford. The Chelmsford Hospital affair first came to the College General Council’s attention in October 1980, with two complaints: one from the Citizens Committee for Human Rights (CCHR) and the other, from John Sydney Smith, Director of the Neuro-Psychiatric Institute, at the University of New South Wales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856213480249">2</xref></sup> Between 1962 and 1979, Harry Bailey treated more than 1000 patients at Chelmsford Hospital. Many received deep sleep therapy, which involved long periods of barbiturate-induced coma. There were 26 patient deaths at Chelmsford during this period. Bailey committed suicide in 1985. Newspaper and television exposure of the inadequacies of care at Chelmsford forced a Royal Commission in 1988. The 1980s were a period of ‘great and genuine consternation’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856213480249">2</xref></sup> for the College, and a great deal was learnt from Chelmsford. The constitutional provisions and committee structure dealing with abuses and complaints were reformed. The College was thus better equipped to deal with the Townsville Hospital Ward 10B scandal. John Lindsay developed the Townsville psychiatric unit as a therapeutic community. The Queensland Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate the abuses that occurred in Ward 10B, found that two patients had died because of negligent and unsafe treatment and that such treatment had contributed to the suicide of six more patients.</p>
<p>There were, of course, a great many books and articles that influenced me during the 1980s when, as a registrar, I like most of us saw psychiatry’s curriculum as unbounded and certainly including: all of medicine, the social sciences, and the classics of literature and stage. But what to single out for posterity? The Quality Assurance Projects, a series of treatment outlines created for the major psychiatric disorders, were an important development, but the original outlines have now been superseded by multitudinous clinical guidelines. The article by Hoult et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1039856213480249">3</xref></sup> on community versus hospital treatment continues to be much cited. I have returned to the articles by Barry Nurcombe about diagnostic reasoning on many occasions as a teacher and supervisor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1039856213480249">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1039856213480249">5</xref></sup> The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third Edition</italic> (DSM III) was published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. These many years later, it is easy to forget what an impact DSM III had on psychiatry. The expansion of diagnoses, to encompass and pathologise normal experiences of living and the charge of ‘cookbook’ diagnosis are reasonable accusations against what has subsequently become of the DSM project. DSM V may be where The Manual finally ‘jumps the shark’ but in its day, DSM III was a crucial advance. Prior to the operationalisation of diagnostic criteria, there was an embarrassing lack of reliability and validity in diagnosing such bread and butter psychiatric conditions as schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1039856213480249">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1039856213480249">7</xref></sup> Daniel Stern’s <italic>The Interpersonal World of the Infant: The view from Psychoanalysis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1039856213480249">8</xref></sup> is another classic I find myself returning to, in the training of registrars. And for me, an article on diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1039856213480249">9</xref></sup> was one of the most fascinating and useful articles I read in the 1980s. As well as being of practical use in recognising depression in this group, the article contained a fascinating introduction to the concept and neuroanatomy of prosody and its disorders. Armed with this background in making diagnoses, the insights from psychotherapy and developmental child psychology, and the promise of understanding the neurophysiology of morbid conditions, there was a brief period in the eighties when I was convinced that psychiatry could conquer the world and its troubles.</p>
<p>Finally, those who were around in the 1980s will remember interminable games of ‘Trivial Pursuit’, the quiz board game that was released on the Christmas market in 1982. Reading through the Letters to the Editor in the <italic>Australian New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic> is an amusing pastime. There have been some vitriolic debates. In the 1980s, who made this memorable statement, and why?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1039856213480249">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The other obdurate root to the maternal deprivation hypothesis is of course, Christianity, except that now instead of the Magi, one now finds child psychiatrists, paediatricians and allied professionals on their knees before Madonna and Child.</p>

<title>The 1990s (Michael Robertson)</title>
<p>The 1990s were meant to be the ‘end of history’. The decline of Communism in Europe meant that the future of humanity was in the ‘invisible hands’ of the market, and in particular, Wall Street. Events late in the subsequent decade proved such ideas to be misplaced. The 1990s seemed a decade without a core theme. Unlike the doomsday threatened by nuclear war or AIDS in the 1980s, life in the 1990s in the post-industrial West seemed less complicated. Ethnic cleansing reappeared for the first time since the Holocaust, in the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa, yet we seemed more preoccupied with the specifics of President Clinton’s after-hours activities in the White House. Much to the bewilderment of the rest of the world, the Anglosphere emoted on the grandest of scales after the death of the Princess of Wales in a Parisian tunnel in 1997. In 1995, Mariah Carey’s duet with the group Boyz II Men <italic>One Sweet Day</italic> spent 16 weeks at Number 1, making her Billboard Magazine’s musical artist of the 1990s. James Cameron’s film <italic>Titanic</italic> was considered the greatest film of the 1990s, whilst Michael Jordan’s achievements on the basketball court with the Chicago Bulls saw him considered the sportsman of the 1990s. Without doubt, the man of the decade was William Henry (Bill) Gates, whose company, Microsoft, pioneered the technology that, through making the operation of computers accessible to the most luddite of people, would lead to the greatest change in human communications since the telephone. Speaking of telephones, in 1991 the world’s first Groupe Special Mobile (GSM) phone call was made on Finland’s Radiolinja’s network. By the end of the decade, mobile (or cell) phones were indispensable.</p>
<p>In Australia, we spent half a decade under a neo-liberal, economically rationalist Labour government, and half under a populist liberal government. By the end of the decade, John Howard had cemented his grip as Prime Minister of Australia and for a time it seemed that would be the case indefinitely, with the dominance of Liberal ‘dry’ politics in Australia, the socially-contentious ideas of a republic and reconciliation with the Aboriginal people stalled. New Zealand spent most of the 1990s under the leadership of Jim Bolger and the decade ended with the rise of Winston Peters as a political force. As always, the All Blacks dominated the Rugby landscape (despite the decade being book-ended with World Cup victories to the arch-rival Wallabies) and we saw the emergence of the world’s first true Rugby superstar, Jonah Lomu.</p>
<p>In Australia, the 1990s landmark development was the National Mental Health Strategy, endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in 1992. It proposed major changes in the provision of mental health services, not the least of which was the ‘mainstreaming’ of mental health care and the devolution of the antiquated asylum system. The decade saw the emergence of different paradigms in mental health care, addressing specific populations such as youth, indigenous members of the community, refugees and survivors of traumatic stress. The profession balkanised into different specialty streams, with the emergence of substantive disciplines such as psychiatry of old age, consultation-liaison psychiatry and addiction psychiatry. The rich tradition of internecine conflict within psychotherapy was galvanised by a decision in the 1996 Australian Federal Budget to limit public funding for psychiatric consultations beyond 50 sessions per annum. Strenuous advocacy by the RANZCP struck a compromise agreement, ensuring patients would not be disadvantaged. It was clear the introduction of an economic dimension to the extant tensions between the advocates of the longer and shorter-term psychotherapies made for an unfortunate intra-professional conflict.</p>
<p>The craft of psychiatry in the 1990s was defined by one statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the decade beginning January 1, 1990, as the Decade of the Brain. I call upon all public officials and the people of the United States to observe that decade with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>
<attrib>Presidential Proclamation 6158, July 17, 1990</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ‘decade of the brain’ saw the emergence of neuroscience as the epistemic basis of the profession. When I started training in 1992, I seemed to prescribe endless amounts of modecate, largactil and prothiaden; by decade’s end, this had changed to nearly 30 different psychotropic agents of various classes. For me, the pivotal moment in psychiatric treatment in the decade was the re-introduction of clozapine, in 1993. Antipsychotics were suddenly ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’. As for antidepressants, the 1990s was the decade of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Indeed, the popular cultural impact of Prozac was transformative in how the community conceptualised depression: the disorder was suddenly defined by the treatment. Author Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote in her memoir, <italic>Prozac nation</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1039856213480249">1</xref></sup> that fluoxetine had brought her to her disease, and not vice-versa.</p>
<p>Along with the robustly neuroscientific basis of psychiatric practice, the other dominant paradigm was that of evidence based medicine (EBM). The Cochrane Collaboration was founded in 1993 and the first of its many systematic reviews of the scientific literature in medicine soon followed. The RANZCP, along with other professional bodies, embraced EBM through its curriculum for psychiatry trainees and the publication of a series of clinical practice guidelines for Australian and New Zealand psychiatrists.</p>
<p>For me, there were three scientific papers which changed how I thought about clinical practice:</p> <list id="list1-1039856213480249" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Perel JM, et al. Five-year outcome for maintenance therapies in recurrent depression. <italic>Arch Gen Psychiatry</italic> 1992; 49: 769–773.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This paper established the current rule of thumb that ‘what gets you better keeps you better’, thus dispelling the long-held view that doses of antidepressants should be reduced after their antidepressant benefits were evident. This paper also helped establish the place of Interpersonal Psychotherapy in the management of depression:</p>
<list id="list2-1039856213480249" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Sackeim HA, Prudic J, Devanand DP, et al. Effects of stimulus intensity and electrode placement on the efficacy and cognitive effects of electroconvulsive therapy. <italic>N Engl J Med</italic> 1993; 328: 839–846.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The work of Sackheim and co-workers revolutionised the practice of electroconvulsive therapy. The advent of stimulus dosing and the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) morphological analysis to improve the technique of ECT, which are procedures that are now standard in any ECT service, was in large measure due to this work. For a treatment that was anathema to many, such scientific and technological progress was critical.</p>
<list id="list3-1039856213480249" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Frank E, Prien RF, Jarrett RB, et al. Conceptualization and rationale for consensus definitions of terms in major depressive disorder. Remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence. <italic>Arch Gen Psychiatry</italic> 1991; 48: 851–855.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This model of depression enabled better understanding of patterns of response to therapy with antidepressants. The instrumental value of this paper, like that of Kupfer et al (above) was the distinction of ‘relapse’ and ‘recurrence’ in depressive disorders, and their prognostic significance. This observation enabled clinicians to formulate better long-term management of depressive illnesses and to distinguish between fluctuations of an established episode and the onset of a new one.</p>
<p>Of the books published in the 1990s, Judith Herman’s <italic>Trauma and recovery</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1039856213480249">2</xref></sup> influenced me most. Herman’s core thesis, that the discourses of trauma had been masculine and based on a specific socio-political view of traumatic stress, was a cogent and highly plausible critique. Her pointed reference to the generic trauma survivor as ‘she’ was the most eloquent of feminist assertions.</p>
<p>At the end of the century, the future of psychiatry seemed to me perplexing. On the one hand, there had been a large amount of neuroscience activity, with an enormous body of published scientific data; academic careers and numerous commercial endeavours had thrived on the basis of particular molecules relevant to the nervous system. On the other hand, the plight of someone with a severe mental illness had not changed: In fact, from some perspectives, it had worsened. Like many neophyte psychiatrists, at the beginning of the 1990s I had been sold on the notion of neuroscience-derived answers to the challenges of caring for people with mental illness transforming my practice. By the end of the millennium, I was still waiting.</p>
