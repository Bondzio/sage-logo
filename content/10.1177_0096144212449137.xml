<p>The simple position behind a conference at the University of London, from which the following articles are drawn, was that investigation into relationships between cities and nationalisms is still in its infancy and should be encouraged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212449137">1</xref></sup> Cities have been places where nationalisms of one kind or another have been constructed, conveyed, and contested and where many nationalists have learnt their political trade. Equally, individual cities or the urban in general have often played a major role in nationalist imagination and ideology, whether in positive or negative fashion. Yet historians of nationalism have generally paid little attention to cities and, at least until recently, urban historians have displayed similar neglect toward nationalism. So this special issue is a contribution toward remedying the lacuna.</p>
<p>The relative paucity of studies of cities and nationalisms seems particularly strange given the predominant view that nationalism, in the form of political movements, was a product of “modernity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212449137">2</xref></sup> In this view, nationalism was conterminous with the rise of industrial capitalism in Europe from the sixteenth century onwards. Such capitalism brought revolutionary advances in transport and technology that ultimately facilitated the imagination and creation of nations throughout the world. The very same processes lay behind the growth of ever larger cities. Rapid urbanization helped break down old hierarchical ties of the countryside and allowed the development of new social classes, associations, institutions, and cultural practices through which nationalism could be imagined, taught, and learnt.</p>
<p>Nationalism <italic>sans</italic> the urban has of course received plenty of insightful attention from historians and political scientists. Some of their theoretical conclusions might usefully be noted by urban historians and could be summarized as follows. There remains debate about definitions of nationalism, but a useful distinction can be made between “ethnic” and “civic” nationalism. The former assumes that members of a nation must have common ancestry, culture, and history the latter does not, and instead allows for membership of a nation to be acquired, perhaps through naturalization, birth, or residence in the territory of the nation state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212449137">3</xref></sup> There is however considerable consensus that nationalism is at least partly conveyed and “imagined” through the likes of print media, but that it will usually involve a “real” territorial component. Nationalism is clearly created and experienced in particular historical circumstances, while its ideological content is subject to change over time, and is likely to be at least partly reimagined or recreated. Nationalism can coexist with other group identities (and vice versa), including other forms of sub- or supranationalisms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212449137">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, hitherto, empirical and theoretical literature on nationalism has largely ignored the urban dimension. Instead it has focused on empires, states, or substates. Perhaps this is because of an initial association between European nationalism and the celebration of the rural world promoted by nineteenth-century romanticism. It may also be because this nationalism, and subsequently much “national liberation” resistance to European imperialism and colonialism on into the twentieth century, aimed at mobilizing predominantly rural societies. More certainly, studies of progenitors or agents of nationalism have seldom analyzed the significance of the urban places they predominantly inhabited.</p>
<p>For their part, historians of cities have often neglected the latter’s relationship with nationalism. This is probably because urban history had its origins in attempts to define a subdiscipline at least in part in contradistinction to other historical areas that included national political history. The subdiscipline that emerged was one, at least in its early incarnations, in which groups of cities, or an individual city, or even a small part of a city, as well as distinctively urban issues such as sanitation, housing, transport, local government, or planning were seen as appropriate and adequate objects of study in their own right. The fact that this was so may have been because the rise of large industrial cities, and the dystopian and utopian perceptions that accompanied them, took place within the already established and relatively well-unified and internally peaceful “nation-states” of Britain and the United States, two countries that determined much of the early agenda of urban history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212449137">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>So the intention behind the conference on Cities and Nationalisms was to facilitate the exploration of the widest possible variety of relationships between the two by not prescribing either chronological or geographical boundaries to such investigation. It was hoped to add to, and if possible move beyond, nascent areas of knowledge. One such area has been the examination of ways in which the design, built environment, and representation of (especially) capital cities has served national purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212449137">6</xref></sup> Another has been a focus on the relationship between nationalism and urban territoriality. From the early 1990s, there has been the growth of both historical and contemporary studies of what have been dubbed “Divided Cities,” hitherto a term broadly deployed to embrace such diverse cases as Belfast, Berlin, Danzig, Los Angeles, London, Mostar, Beirut, and Jerusalem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212449137">7</xref></sup> An important recent research project has attempted to distinguish in this respect between what a leading participant has described as “state-divided” cities (for instance, Berlin) and “ethnically divided” ones (for instance, Los Angeles), while using the term “ethno-nationally divided cities” for cases in between or that combine both aspects (for instance, Belfast or Jerusalem). A provisional finding of the project is that the latter are the historical products of declining empires.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212449137">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet in the case both of Divided Cities as well as cities that one way or another stage or project nationalism, most of the work has not ventured much if at all beyond Europe and North America, albeit on occasion including cities of Asia Minor such as Beirut and Jerusalem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212449137">9</xref></sup> In contrast, five of the six articles in this special issue focus on non-Western cities. All were selected not only because they were individually insightful and significant but because in combination they give a sense of the geographically and (not unrelated) thematically wide-ranging investigations and insights that the conference gave rise to. This introduction will attempt to give a taste of how they did so.</p>
<p>The articles provide further, and non-Western, examples of how and by what means cities sustained nationalisms. But they also suggest ways in which cities (such as Shanghai and Alexandria discussed below) could and did promote themselves as cosmopolitan and hospitable to all nations, or where different national identities were rarely translated into nationalist expression, or where, when varieties of nationalist expression took place, these were usually tolerated. The case studies of Shanghai, Alexandria, and Kinshasa also demonstrate how cities could offer the possibility of changing national or ethnic identity, and thus of actual or potential nationalist adherence. Shanghai also renders examples of ways in which a city might facilitate transnational political alliances of varying kinds.</p>
<p>In the opening article then, Robert Bickers demonstrates how nationalism was both sustained and challenged in Shanghai in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He argues that the existence of numerous competing nationalisms in the city was fostered by the existence and practice or observance of different legal systems, national calendars, and ethnonational “spaces” as well as by the likes of visiting royalty or naval squadrons. Such nationalist identities included the settler nationalism of British ex-patriot “Shanghailanders” as well as the nationalisms or imperialisms of European and Asian powers, not least the Chinese. In addition, there were anti-Imperial nationalisms and cross-national solidarities whose “underground” existence was facilitated by the multinational complexity of space and law and order enforcement in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212449137">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was also the matter though of Shanghai’s vaunted cosmopolitan tolerance. Yet this was limited, motivated by commercial imperatives that suggested it was best, as in “Basil Fawlty’s dictum,” not to mention the war, “whatever the war that was going on.” So its demonstration was largely confined to the Shanghai race course, an annual parade, “inspections of the volunteer militia, and to funerals.”</p>
<p>James Moore persuasively suggests that there was, in contrast to Shanghai, greater substance to Alexandria’s reputation for cosmopolitanism, at least before Nasser’s rise to power, and particularly in the interwar period. In Moore’s view, this was a cosmopolitanism of the poor as much as a westernized elite that had much to do with the combination of particular economic activities and their distribution in the city with a built spatial environment that militated against sharply defined neighborhood divisions. Social geography was more a question of “economic status than national difference.” In addition, facilities such as cafés and patisseries or public spaces like the French Gardens or the Place de la Gare provided places for cosmopolitan intermingling.</p>
<p>Alexandria was not, and never had been, a city clearly dominated by one nation or nationalism, or a Dual-City of new European settlement adjacent to old “native” areas. Yet Moore argues that this did not mean that it was simply a cosmopolitan melting pot. Rather Alexandria was cosmopolitan in the sense of containing “networks of national communities,” sustained in part by the nature of political authority in the city, that generally lived side-by-side in tolerant fashion. External factors, such as the rise of fascism in Italy among some inhabitants of Italian descent, could temporarily ignite nationalist expression among such communities. But it was the decline of the cotton industry, concomitant decline in “foreigners,” in-migration of Egyptians, and growth of Egyptian nationalism that finally all but put paid to Alexandria’s cosmopolitan tradition.</p>
<p>Kinshasa is not a city normally associated with international cosmopolitanism. Yet Bill Freund’s article indicates that this capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a country that has also been called Zaire and in colonial times the Belgian Congo (when Kinshasa was known as Léopoldville), gained a post-independence reputation for at least multiethnic tolerance or neutrality in times of political turmoil. Even after violent episodes in the 1990s and early twenty-first century, Kinshasa could not be described as a Divided City of ethnic or ethnonationalist tension. Freund relates that despite the prevalence of ethnic tensions in the broader DRC, or indeed in cities and states in many parts of Africa, Kinshasa’s elite from the 1960s onwards had a sense of group identity and self-worth derived from the possession of educational diplomas, ability to speak French, and state employment. Members of this group continually supported national state unity ahead of any desire to promote Kinshasa’s, or Kinshasan regional, or indeed any ethnonationalist, autonomy.</p>
<p>Freund draws on both Gellner and Benedict Anderson to help explain why this was the case, despite the existence in the DRC, as in Indonesia, of considerable ethnic heterogeneity and seemingly random and far-flung national territorial borders imposed by colonialism. Freund also argues that an absence of popular interethnic conflict in Kinshasa is in part explicable because potential correlation between ethnicity and urban space has been far less sharp than in other African cities, such as Brazzaville, capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo. Indeed, if certain occupations were associated because of chain migration with particular ethnicities (as in many cities around the world), changing one’s ethnicity in Kinshasa for employment (or other) purposes would appear to have been commonplace. So although some political leaders may have disapproved of Kinshasan culture, in popular imagination the city was “Kin La Belle,” a metropolitan place of opportunity and pleasure. As such, we might add, the city was a product of modernity, as was nationalism, with travelling or living in the metropolis helping to turn peasants into Congolese.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212449137">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the course of the twentieth century, many residents of Kirkuk were not easily turned into Iraqis. The reason, as Arbella Bet-Shlimon explains, lies in the way in which power and position in the emerging city, and struggles for control over its institutions and resources, developed along ethnonationalist fault lines. These were already visible in the British mandate period after the First World War as Kirkuk ceased to be a semiautonomous part of the Mosul province of the Ottoman Empire and was instead absorbed into an Arab-controlled and centralizing Iraq.</p>
<p>The majority population of the town, whether they “self-identified” as Turkmen or Kurds opposed this development. They expressed their position by voting against accepting the Arab amir Faysal as their monarch in the referendum of 1921 “in which the rest of the country almost unanimously accepted him.” The desire of most Kurds as well as Turkmen was simply a return to “Ottoman-era autonomy,” and they “dreaded the prospect of having to answer to an Arab-led government in Baghdad.” This led some Kirkukis to prefer incorporation into the Republic of Turkey. But Bet-Shlimon argues that there was still fluidity to ethnic identity at this stage, and that perceived economic or employment possibilities were key: “Kurdish tribal leaders of Kirkuk who favoured inclusion in Iraq were often those who were being paid by the Iraqi government to police the roads leading into the city.”</p>
<p>According to Bet-Shlimon, what hardened ethnonationalist positions in Kirkuk, even before the end of the British mandate, was Baghdad’s Arab-language policies for schools as well as its control of civil service appointments in the city, which resulted in employment patronage that favored Turkmen over Kurds. The development and growth of Kirkuk as an oil city increased what was at stake for Baghdad as well as local inhabitants. Local taxation that discriminated against Kurds and led to demands for a Kurdish state was one of the results.</p>
<p>This position was somewhat reversed with the army coup of 1958 that involved the killing of the royal family, establishment of a republic. Kurds were now appointed to several important positions in local government and the army. In parallel, the new government allowed the rise of the Communist Party and trade unions, organizations attractive to Kurds who had hitherto generally held lower social status than Turkmen, which set the stage for interethnic violence. At its heart was “the desire of each group to assume authority over the city,” in ideological terms by each side in the divide claiming Kirkuk as historically and rightfully “their” city.</p>
<p>Another ethnonationalist Divided City was Dublin in the late nineteenth and twentieth century. Ciarán Wallace explores ways in which local politics and municipal government in the city interacted with Irish and British nationalisms and ethnosocial geography. An overcrowded and impoverished city center projected its Irishness within Dublin’s ring of canals; outside, the more prosperous, generally Unionist, suburbs emphasized their Britishness. Such proximity predictably produced tensions.</p>
<p>What Wallace demonstrates is that these tensions were as much about rates as they were about how to respond to royal visits, coronations, or deaths. “In Dublin, even the drains were politicised.” The determination of Unionist suburbs to retain their identity and independence went against economic and sound sewerage-system logic and the pattern of city governance expansion in other cities such as London. But retaining municipal independence allowed suburbs to express their Britishness, not just through raised Union Jacks but also through the likes of an earl’s coronet on electricity junction boxes. In contrast, shamrocks were a motif of central Dublin “street furniture,” Irish Gaelic was used alongside English in signage, and streets were renamed after Irish heroes. In other words, urban space could be visibly transformed into nationalist place, and municipal control was the key to this. This is a point reinforced in a variety of insightful ways by contributors to a very recent volume that focuses on urban communities in Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212449137">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last of the six articles, Prashant Kidambi also examines the relationship between urban governance and nationalism. This he pursues in a case study of Bombay in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But Kidambi uses this case study to make broader assertions about the relationship between nationalism and cities in colonial India, an area little explored in the otherwise extensive historiography of Indian nationalism.</p>
<p>Kidambi examines ways in which the Indian middle class, including members of the Indian National Congress, developed a “public sphere” in cities like Bombay. By doing this, whether through journalism, establishing civic associations, or (importantly) actually concerning themselves with urban issues and participating in municipal politics, they established middle-class credentials and built themselves a platform from which to aspire to political power at a national level, even while avowing loyalty to the British Empire. They did so while internalizing the civic language of metropolitan Britain that emphasized “progress,” “improvement,” and “respectability.”</p>
<p>Kidambi contrasts this middle-class rhetoric (of what some of us might see as British loyalism akin to that of nineteenth-century Africans)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212449137">13</xref></sup> with that of Gandhian “popular nationalism” in the post–First World War period that discarded liberal discourse in favor of ideas of “service to the nation, the people, and public good.” Kidambi shows how the city was now used as a stage on which to perform mass rituals of “collective resistance,” thereby challenging the politics of Town Halls with that of the streets. The popular nationalism of the Indian National Congress also developed its own calendar of significant events and commemorations, implicitly in competition with those of Imperial Britain. In turn though, Congress nationalism was challenged by other movements including the Muslim League. Kidambi concludes by stating that “while the city may not have figured prominently in nationalist <italic>thought</italic>, it nonetheless occupied a central place in nationalist <italic>political practice</italic>” [Kidambi’s emphasis].</p>
<p>The six articles in this special issue contain rich information on a range of relationships between cities and nationalisms. Some of what they argue confirms the findings of the existing nascent literature; but they also contain both new empirical information and new insights. Cities were indeed places where nationalism was taught or learnt. This could be through imperial and national-state “Ornamentalism,” in varying forms of either ritual or material culture, or through the print media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212449137">14</xref></sup> There could also be competitive Ornamentalism within the same city (Shanghai). In addition, the fact that cities were located within empires (Shanghai, Dublin, Bombay), or that a city was transferred from imperial to national-state control (Kirkuk), made ethnonationalist tension more likely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212449137">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Equally, territorial divisions of cities or parts of cities that largely coincided with national identity surely sustained competing nationalisms. Territorial division could also be compounded by concomitant division of political or legal authority (Dublin and Shanghai). Indeed Wallace, as we saw, gives examples of how different local authorities within the same city could use political power to brand competing national symbols into “street furniture.” In addition, both Bickers and Prashant Kidambi draw attention to ways in which competing nationalisms within the same city could promote themselves through alternative commemorative calendars. Indeed anti-imperial nationalism flourished in both Shanghai and Bombay, though in the former its existence was rather more surreptitious than in the latter, where Gandhian protest in part took the form of mass appropriation of public space.</p>
<p>Understanding the possible relationships between cities and nationalisms should include understanding the reasons why cities may have been relatively free, for long or short periods, from ethnic or ethnonational tension. This is what both Freund and Moore explored for Kinshasa and Alexandria. What Moore’s article suggests is that urban historians wishing to understand the existence of “cosmopolitan” cities need to explain why, in his words, “economic status not national identity” better explains their social geography. For Freund, the key to Kinshasa’s lack of ethnic, let alone ethnonationalist, tension is explicable through an understanding of why its elite were so invested in national unity.</p>
<p>Clearly there are other questions that urban historians may wish to ask about cities and nationalisms. One might be how the urban in general or individual cities (London during the Blitz?) were incorporated into nationalist ideology. Another might be to ask what we know about the range of possible relationship between cities and nationalisms before the rise of industrial capitalism, in “pre-modern” or even medieval times. Or perhaps this second question should more appropriately refer to cities and <italic>national identities</italic> in premodern times, if we believe with Gellner and others that nationalism is a modern development and defined in part as a political movement aimed at national autonomy?</p>
