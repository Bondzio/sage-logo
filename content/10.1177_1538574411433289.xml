<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAAs) account for between 5% and 10% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and occur primarily in male patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411433289">1</xref></sup> Their true etiology is unknown and, despite being an important variant of AAA, they have received little attention. The symptoms and signs of IAAA are so variable that they may present to a wide range of specialties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411433289">2</xref></sup> There is also some debate in the literature whether IAAA is a manifestation of systemic autoimmune disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411433289">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411433289">4</xref></sup>

<p>Treatment options include open surgery or endovascular repair, but in the presence of active inflammation conservative and medical approaches both have a role in patients with IAAA. We here describe the investigation and treatment of a young female patient with complicated inflammatory aortoiliac aneurysmal disease, which is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433289">Figure 1</xref>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>An Afro-Caribbean lady was admitted to hospital in June 2005, aged 39, with malignant hypertension (systolic blood pressure 242/142 mm Hg) manifesting as headaches and retinal hemorrhages. She was found to have increased plasma renin activity. Furthermore, she complained of severe left iliac fossa pain and pain in her left leg on walking consistent with intermittent claudication. Her past medical history was unremarkable.</p>
<p>A computed tomography (CT) angiogram in November 2005 showed multiple contiguous thick-walled saccular aneurysmal dilatations of the abdominal aorta and iliac systems bilaterally located distal to the level of the celiac axis. The aneurysms also involved visceral branches with a large aneurysm present at the origin of the left renal artery. The left external iliac artery was occluded and there was no thoracic aortic or infrainguinal disease. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at this time was 118 mm/h. At this point, she was referred for specialist multidisciplinary vascular care.</p>
<p>A CT angiogram in early December 2005 further revealed a left atrophic kidney with aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal left renal artery and no clearly defined distal renal artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411433289">Figure 2</xref>
). The right renal artery was of normal caliber, arising from an aneurysmal aortic segment. A mercaptoacetyltriglycerine scan showed minimal function of the left kidney, with a large right kidney contributing 95% of total renal function. Significantly, the scan also showed a segmental occlusion of the left external iliac artery which reconstituted distally via collaterals. Small-volume retroperitoneal lymph nodes were also seen. The appearances were thought to be consistent with diffuse large vessel vasculitis, of either primary (such as Takayasu disease), infective (including tuberculous [TB] aortitis), or autoimmune etiology. Her ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) at this time were 86 mm/h and 20 mg/L, respectively. Her ankle–brachial pressure indices (ABPIs) were greater than 1 on the right and 0.3 with a biphasic signal on the left. At this point, she was commenced on steroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433289">Figure 1</xref>). Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose–positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging showed no abnormal metabolic activity; however, at this point, she had already been taking prednisolone for 1 week.</p>

</fig>
<p>Due to increasing left iliac fossa pain, another CT scan was done at the end of December 2005, which showed left psoas muscle enlargement and fat stranding adjacent to the left iliac aneurysms, consistent with recent bleeding into the retroperitoneum. Her ABPIs on the left were 0.38. The patient was hemodynamically stable and underwent coil embolization of the left external iliac artery. Postembolization her left ABPI was 0.82.</p>
<p>The suspicion of TB aortitis prompted the undertaking of a TB enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (Elispot) test, which was positive. She was started on empirical TB treatment in February 2006 concluding in August 2006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433289">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>By April 2006, her severe left iliac fossa pain had completely resolved and a CT angiogram in May 2006 did not show extension or expansion of her aneurysms. Her blood pressure was stable at 145/80 mm Hg with aggressive antihypertensive therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433289">Figure 1</xref>). Her inflammatory makers showed a CRP of 24 mg/L and an ESR of 67 mm/h.</p>
<p>An autoimmune screen revealed positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) with fine speckled pattern (1 in 640), p-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), rheumatoid factor, and anti-Ro antibodies.</p>
<p>In December 2006, she complained of occasional pain in both thighs after walking 5 to 10 minutes and difficulty climbing stairs and gradients. She was started on azathioprine in January 2007 to dampen down ongoing autoimmune aortitis.</p>
<p>In March 2007, duplex ultrasonography showed that the right external iliac aneurysm had enlarged, with a maximum diameter increase from 4.6 to 5.1 cm. Angiography confirmed a saccular 7 cm right external iliac artery aneurysm arising from the right common iliac artery bifurcation. The multidisciplinary team therefore decided to proceed with endovascular repair of the right external iliac aneurysm in May 2007, with coil embolization of the right internal iliac artery. Tissue samples of the right common femoral artery wall were negative for neoplastic or inflammatory changes; however, these sections were deemed nondiagnostic. Furthermore, inguinal lymph node excision biopsy showed only reactive changes.</p>
<p>In December 2008, our patient’s left leg claudication started to improve. Ankle–brachial pressure indices were 0.56 on the left and 0.96 on the right. Imaging demonstrated the maximum diameter of the abdominal aorta was 4.8 cm and her other aneurysms had not enlarged further.</p>
<p>In October 2010, her abdominal aortic aneurysm had increased to 8.3 cm in size. Endovascular access was not possible through the occluded left iliac system, and an external iliac stent was present on the right side. A subclavian approach via a conduit was considered feasible but challenging. Endograft planning confirmed that a right renal side branch would be required in addition to superior mesenteric and left renal artery fenestrations. However, she was relatively young and fit and required annual CT follow-up, which at the age of 44, would have represented a significant lifetime radiation exposure. Following discussion of the treatment options, in January 2011, the patient opted for open aneurysm repair. A subcostal rooftop incision and type IV approach with left medial visceral rotation was undertaken, exposing clean tissue planes around the visceral segment. A long beveled anastomosis incorporated the celiac axis, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries. The distal end of the graft was anastomosed to the in situ aortic stent graft. The left kidney was not revascularized. A right-to-left femorofemoral crossover was planned, but good inflow to the left common femoral artery was demonstrated intraoperatively, negating the need for crossover and the vessel was patch closed. The operation was successfully completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433289">Figure 1</xref>) and the patient made a full recovery.</p>

<sec id="section3-1538574411433289">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms were first described by Walker et al in 1972 as a discrete entity with significant differences from atherosclerotic aneurysms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411433289">5</xref></sup> In particular, IAAAs were described to have a thickened aneurysm wall (an imaging feature present in our patient). Others, however, consider IAAA to be at one end of the spectrum of AAA pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411433289">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411433289">7</xref></sup> Reports of patients with IAAA are rare and this case report illustrates both diagnostic and treatment challenges.</p>
<sec id="section4-1538574411433289">
<title>Diagnostic Challenges</title>
<p>Patients with IAAA are younger and usually symptomatic, chiefly from back or abdominal pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411433289">8</xref></sup> with a proportion of these individuals describing systemic symptoms. Patients with IAAA have a higher incidence of autoimmune disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411433289">9</xref></sup> and studies reporting a high frequency of certain autoantibodies, including ANA and ANCA, prompt the consideration of autoimmune vasculitis as a cause.</p>
<p>There have also been reports that IAAA can have an infectious cause, usually termed mycotic aneurysms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411433289">10</xref></sup> Speculation has largely centered around cytomegalovirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411433289">11</xref></sup> and Chlamydia pneumoniae,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411433289">12</xref></sup> but TB has also been implicated in IAAA. Tuberculous aneurysms are extremely rare with only 41 cases having been reported in the English literature in the first 53 years since the introduction of antituberculous pharmacotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574411433289">13</xref></sup> Most (90%) TB aneurysms are saccular.</p>
<p>Our patient had a positive autoantibody screen, raised ESR, positive TB Elispot, and saccular aneurysms, including TB and autoimmune aortitis in her differential diagnosis. Whole-body FDG-PET showed no abnormal metabolic activity. However, at the time of the test, she had been commenced on prednisolone hence widespread arthritis could not confidently be excluded. It was anticipated that the common femoral artery biopsy taken at the time of her endovascular repair in 2007 would provide a tissue diagnosis, but this was deemed nondiagnostic.</p>
<p>In our patient the kidney function deteriorated, which was likely pre-renal due to the aneurysm affecting her left renal artery. However, certain autoimmune conditions, such as Wegener granulomatosis, also affect renal function by way of a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Wegener granulomatosis is associated with a positive ANCA, which our patient also had. Tuberculous is also known to cause extrapulmonary infection in the renal system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574411433289">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is possible that either TB or autoimmune vasculitis was responsible for her extensive aneurysmal disease, however multifactorial etiology should be considered; a combination of genetic, environmental, and endothelial factors that results in an antigen-driven, destructive inflammatory process in the arterial wall of susceptible persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411433289">15</xref></sup> Speculation regarding the antigen responsible for this process includes both endogenous and exogenous products. A genetic risk determinant has been mapped to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 locus, and the alleles B1*15 and B1*0404 in particular to playing a role in IAAA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574411433289">
<title>Medical Treatment</title>
<p>There are no clear guidelines concerning medical treatment of IAAA with most published studies being retrospective, uncontrolled, and involving small numbers of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411433289">16</xref></sup> The likelihood that IAAA results primarily from inflammation has prompted efforts to use corticosteroids, other anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive therapies. Azathioprine, which was used in our patient, has also been shown to have some efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411433289">16</xref></sup> In addition, medical therapy can prevent disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411433289">17</xref></sup> and if the aneurysm is not large enough to warrant repair may be used alone for symptomatic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411433289">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>At presentation, our patient had large iliac aneurysms and although steroids reduced her inflammatory markers, medical treatment alone was insufficient in the control of symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574411433289">
<title>Endovascular and Open Surgical Repair in Inflammatory Aneurysms</title>
<p>The primary aim of surgical management is to prevent rupture, and despite data suggesting that IAAA are less likely to rupture, intervention is advised once the diameter exceeds 5.5 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574411433289">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Dissection and clamping of the neck of an inflammatory aneurysm may be more difficult due to the presence of retroperitoneal fibrosis. This can result in plastering of the duodenum onto the aneurysm wall and often the left renal vein and ureters become embedded within the inflammatory tissue. One can attempt to dissect these structures free but the incidence of damage is increased as is the chance of opening the aneurysm sac prior to achieving adequate control. This leads to increased mortality (3%-19%) and morbidity (7%-15%) compared to noninflammatory AAA repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574411433289">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Endovascular repair has been a routine procedure in the treatment of noninflammatory aortoiliac aneurysms; however, there are few reports of interventional treatment of inflammatory aneurysms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411433289">21</xref></sup> An endovascular approach may be preferred to open surgery because of intraperitoenal adhesions commonly present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574411433289">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, in the context of inflammatory aneurysms and associated retroperitoneal fibrosis, endovascular repair avoids injury to vital structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574411433289">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In patients with TB, an endovascular approach may limit bacterial spread and graft infection and may also be more appropriate in critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574411433289">24</xref></sup> Persistent infection is always a concern and long-term outcomes are unavailable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538574411433289">25</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-1538574411433289">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The IAAA is a rare condition that should be approached as a systemic process that can affect other organ systems. Early diagnosis is crucial to limit disease progression, morbidity, and mortality; however, this case highlights the challenges in this regard. This case also emphasizes the importance of medical management to address the underlying disease process; but this often requires definitive surgical intervention. Further studies need to address outcomes following open and endovascular repair. This may not be possible due to the sporadic occurrence of inflammatory aneurysms. Available evidence offers plausibility for the short-term benefit of endovascular intervention over open repair; however, questions remain regarding long-term durability and need for surveillance in this context. Currently, a multidisciplinary approach is adopted for managing individual cases. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor the aneurysms, the durability of repairs undertaken, systemic inflammation, and renal function.</p>
