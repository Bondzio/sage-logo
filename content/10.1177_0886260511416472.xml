<abstract>
<p>Both desistance research and strengths-based approaches to offender rehabilitation suggest that attempts to reduce sex offender recidivism should attend to an offender’s release environment. Recent research has demonstrated that better quality release planning is associated with reduced recidivism; however, whether release planning contributes significant incremental validity in predicting recidivism over and above static and dynamic risk factors is unclear. In the present study, release planning was retrospectively assessed for a sample of child molesters (<italic>n</italic> = 196) who had been released into the community following completion of a prison-based treatment program and its relative contribution to recidivism risk prediction was investigated. The average follow-up period was 11.08 years, during which 13.3% of the sample were convicted of a new sexual offence. Hierarchical Cox regression analyses showed that release planning contributed additional predictive validity for sexual recidivism after controlling for static and dynamic risk factors. Findings suggest that assessment of release planning might improve accuracy of sex offender risk assessments and that improved release planning should contribute to reductions in recidivism.</p>

<p>The outcomes of sex offender risk assessments inform the delicate balance between community safety and offender rights, which underscores the necessity for maximizing their accuracy in predicting recidivism. The practice of sex offender risk assessment has become increasingly sophisticated, such that unstructured clinical judgment has been replaced with empirically informed hierarchical risk-assessment protocols (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416472">Hanson, Harris, Scott, &amp; Helmus, 2007</xref>). Despite substantial improvements in predictive validity, however, the practice of risk assessment has not yet caught up with theoretical advances in offender rehabilitation. That is, current best practice risk assessment is focused almost exclusively on identifying an individual’s deficits, for example, deviant sexual arousal, high sexual preoccupation, poor affect regulation, and poor problem-solving skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416472">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, desistance theory and research as well as strengths-based approaches to offender rehabilitation such as the Good Lives Model (GLM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511416472">Ward &amp; Marshall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511416472">Ward &amp; Maruna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511416472">Ward &amp; Stewart, 2003</xref>) assert that individuals’ strengths as well as environmental factors are pivotal in the rehabilitation process. In other words, external and internal factors are both important in determining whether an offender leads a prosocial life after release. Incorporating strengths and environmental factors into risk assessments should, therefore, improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the emphasis on the risk factors that predict reoffending in the forensic psychology literature, research on desistance seeks to understand the lifestyle change process associated with disengagement from crime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416472">Laws &amp; Ward, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511416472">Serin &amp; Lloyd, 2009</xref>). Major influences on desistance that have been identified include aging (recidivism rates drop as offenders age), marriage, work and job stability, education, cognitive transformation (i.e., creation of a new, more adaptive narrative identity), the pygmalion effect (social acceptance can increase an offender’s chances of positive change), and “knifing off” (severing bonds to criminal past). Theories of desistance tend to focus primarily on concepts of social control and agency and stress the importance of individuals being able to create new social bonds and opportunities for meeting their needs in prosocial and personally meaningful ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511416472">Ward &amp; Maruna, 2007</xref>). Although developed independently, there is a natural resonance between the desistance literature and the GLM. According to the GLM, criminal behavior results when individuals lack the internal and external resources necessary to satisfy their values (defined as <italic>primary goods</italic>) using prosocial means. In other words, criminal behavior represents a maladaptive attempt to meet life values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511416472">Ward &amp; Stewart, 2003</xref>). Rehabilitation efforts should therefore equip offenders with the knowledge, skills, opportunities, and resources necessary to satisfy their life values in ways that do not harm others. In applying the GLM, offenders are helped to identify <italic>secondary goods</italic> or prosocial approach-oriented goals aimed at fulfilling primary goods, such as friendship, experiences of mastery, health, and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511416472">Ward, Mann, &amp; Gannon, 2007</xref>). For example, in the case of offenders who value career-related success (i.e., primary good is experience of mastery), depending on an individual’s specific strengths and aspirations, relevant secondary goods might revolve around preparing a curriculum vitae or enrolling in a small business course, with the eventual aim of seeking employment or setting up a business, respectively. At the heart of desistance theory and research and the GLM is the assumption that instead of just bearers of risk, sex offenders are goal-directed individuals embedded within social systems, like people in general. To live prosocial lives, individuals with histories of sexual offending require the same opportunities, resources, and supports that nonoffenders do. Without the external scaffolding that supports a prosocial life, recidivism risk might increase. For these reasons, evaluation of an offender’s release environment should enhance the predictive accuracy of risk assessment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>) recently investigated the impact of release planning on sex offender recidivism and showed that recidivists had significantly poorer release planning overall than nonrecidivists. More specifically, they developed a coding protocol to evaluate the quality and comprehensiveness of release planning for sex offenders, including items related to planning for accommodation, employment, community-based treatment, social support, and GLM secondary goods (i.e., prosocial approach-oriented goals relating to one or more primary goods). The first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis &amp; Grace, 2008</xref>) applied the protocol retrospectively to recidivist and nonrecidivist graduates of a prison-based treatment program, matched for static risk level (i.e., offense history variables such as number of prior offences, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511416472">Hanson &amp; Bussière, 1998</xref>) and time since release. They found that recidivists had poorer release planning overall compared with nonrecidivists and poorer planning on items relating to accommodation, employment, and GLM secondary goods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2009)</xref> sought to validate results with a matched sample of recidivist and nonrecidivist graduates from an independent prison-based treatment program. Insufficient information was available to rate the GLM secondary goods item, so this was excluded. Consistent with the first study, recidivists had significantly poorer release planning overall compared with nonrecidivists and poorer planning on items relating to employment and social support. Using the pooled data from both studies, accommodation, employment, and social support planning combined to give the best predictive model of recidivism, with accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = .71) similar to that obtained with static risk models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416472">Barbaree, Seto, Langton, &amp; Peacock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511416472">Harris, Phenix, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2003</xref>). As static risk was matched and there were no significant correlations between release planning and static risk level, results suggested that quality of release planning might represent an independent source of predictive validity for recidivism in addition to static risk factors. Results were only tentative, however, because the matching procedure ensured that there was no correlation between static risk and recidivism. Whether release planning produced significant incremental validity in the prediction of recidivism was unknown and is the focus of the present study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>) also considered the relative impact of dynamic risk factors on recidivism prediction. Dynamic risk factors are the broad range of potentially changeable predictors of recidivism and have been divided into stable and acute dynamic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511416472">Hanson, 1998</xref>). Stable dynamic risk factors are relatively enduring tendencies that may be amenable to change through treatment (e.g., sexual deviancy, antisocial orientation, and self-regulation problems; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416472">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2005</xref>), whereas acute dynamic risk factors are those that can potentially change rapidly and precipitate recidivism (e.g., negative mood states, substance abuse; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416472">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>). Several studies have shown that stable dynamic risk factors contribute significant predictive validity for recidivism after controlling for static risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416472">Allan, Grace, Rutherford, &amp; Hudson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416472">Beech, Friendship, Erikson, &amp; Hanson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511416472">Thornton, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>) reported between-group differences in stable dynamic risk factors, measured via a psychometric battery administered at pretreatment which assessed four dimensions: social inadequacy, sexual interests, anger/hostility, and pro-offending attitudes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416472">Allan et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, recidivists’ scores for deviant sexual interests, pro-offending attitudes, and overall deviance (a combination of the four dimensions) were significantly higher than nonrecidivists’ scores. Differences in release planning between recidivists and nonrecidivists were confounded by differences in stable dynamic risk factors, such that accommodation planning was the only item to remain significantly different between recidivists and nonrecidivists while controlling for differences in dynamic risk level. However, in their validation study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2009)</xref> found no between-group differences on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416472">Allan et al. (2007)</xref> risk factor scores, suggesting that differences in release planning were not confounded by differences in stable dynamic risk levels. Accordingly, in the present study, we examine the relative contributions of static risk, dynamic risk, and release planning in the prediction of sex offender recidivism for a larger sample of offenders.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, the current practice of sex offender risk assessment relies almost exclusively on the detection of an offender’s deficits. The Stable 2007 and Acute 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416472">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>), which measure stable and acute dynamic risk factors, respectively, represent the most recent advances in sex offender risk assessment for adults. The Stable 2007 does afford some attention to strengths through 2 of its 13 items, specifically social influences and capacity for relationship stability. Aside from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>), to our knowledge, only one study has systematically considered strengths in recidivism risk prediction. Researchers in the United Kingdom developed the AIM2 framework, which incorporates both deficits (labeled “concerns”) and strengths into the assessment of adolescent sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416472">Griffin, Beech, Print, Bradshaw, &amp; Quayle, 2008</xref>). They found that nonrecidivists had significantly more strengths than recidivists for eight items, including positive leisure interests and positive evaluations from work/education staff. Preliminary analyses suggested that the strengths items made an independent contribution to recidivism risk prediction; however, conclusions were limited by the small sample size.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>An offender’s environmental context sets the limits for opportunities to desist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511416472">LeBel, Burnett, Maruna, &amp; Bushway, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511416472">Serin &amp; Lloyd, 2009</xref>) or, from a GLM perspective, the fulfillment of life values in socially acceptable and personally meaningful ways. Consistent with the desistance literature and the GLM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>) found that recidivists had significantly poorer release planning than nonrecidivists. The goal of the current study was to examine whether assessment of release planning provides significant incremental validity after controlling for static and dynamic risk factors, in a larger, more representative sample than those studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>), which used a design where equal numbers of recidivists and nonrecidivists were individually matched on static risk. Specifically, we tested whether overall release planning scores would contribute additional predictive validity after controlling for Static-99 scores and an estimate of dynamic risk level, as assessed through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416472">Allan et al.’s (2007)</xref> overall deviance scores.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample for the present study was drawn from men who completed the 32-week prison-based treatment program at the Kia Marama Special Treatment Unit between 1993 and 2000. Kia Marama is a 60-bed self-contained unit for men convicted of sexual offending against children in New Zealand, located within Rolleston Prison, near Christchurch. All men had provided written consent for their file information to be used for research and evaluation purposes.</p>
<p>The initial sample consisted of 218 offenders for whom Static-99 scores and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416472">Allan et al. (2007)</xref> factor scores had been previously calculated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416472">Beggs &amp; Grace, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416472">2010</xref>). Of these 218 cases, 14 files could not be located and 8 did not contain the appropriate reports from which to rate release planning, leaving a final sample size of 196. Of these, 34 cases had been included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>; 12 recidivists, 24 nonrecidivists).

<title>Release Planning at Kia Marama</title>
<p>The primary goal of the Kia Marama treatment program is to reduce an offender’s risk of recidivism in the community. In line with this aim, offenders voluntarily enter the program toward the end of their sentence to facilitate the transition to living in the community. A reintegration coordinator oversees release planning for each inmate and liaises between the offender, his nominated support network, and community agencies. Throughout treatment, release plans are discussed and refined and final plans are detailed in reports written to the community probation service as the offender’s release approaches. At a minimum, conditions of release typically include residing at an approved address, regular meetings with the probation service, and regular attendance at a monthly follow-up support group.

<title>Recidivism</title>
<p>Criminal history information for all men in the sample was obtained from the computer database maintained by the New Zealand Department of Corrections as of July 1, 2008. Convictions for sexual, violent, or general offences that occurred postrelease were recorded. Sexual recidivism was defined according to the Static-99 scoring criteria for Category “A” offences, that is, an offence with an identifiable victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511416472">Harris et al., 2003</xref>). Category “B” offences (i.e., no identifiable victim) were excluded, except for possession of child pornography. Violent recidivism was recorded when the offender had been convicted for a nonsexual offence against a person (e.g., assault, robbery, kidnapping). General recidivism was recorded for offences that were neither sexual nor violent (e.g., burglary). The time at large prior to each reconviction, or to the end of the follow-up period, was calculated for each offender. The average follow-up time was 11.08 years (minimum of 1 month and a maximum of 14 years).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Files held by the Department of Corrections Psychological Service were sourced for each participant, and the report for each participant written by Kia Marama staff to the probation service on release was rated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace’s (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>) protocol. These reports contained details relating to an offender’s conviction, a summary of assessment findings and treatment progress, an indication of current risk level, a list of high-risk situations and warning signs, and an outline of release plans. The first author rated release planning for all participants in the sample, and a research assistant rated release planning for approximately 11% of the sample so that interrater reliability could be calculated. Data coders rated release plans independently of each other and were blind to recidivism outcomes. For each report, data coders were instructed to (a) read the report in its entirety before conducting any ratings, (b) reread the report and record ratings (coders were instructed to be conservative in any event of uncertainty), and (c) ensure that all ratings had been recorded. All disagreements between coders were resolved by consensus. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 17).</p>

<title>Sample characteristics</title>
<p>Participants were aged between 19 and 74 years at entry into the Kia Marama program, with an average age of 41.7 years. The average Static-99 score was 2.18 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.01), corresponding to a risk band of medium-low. More than half (57%; <italic>n</italic> = 112) of participants in the sample consisted of intrafamilial offenders whose victims were exclusively family members, whereas 43% (<italic>n</italic> = 84) of participants had at least one unrelated victim. During follow-up (<italic>M</italic> = 11.08 years), 13.3% (26/196) were convicted of a new sexual offence, 12.8% (25/196) were convicted of a new violent offence, and 35.7% (70/196) were convicted of a new general offence. For those who reoffended, the mean time to failure was 3.94, 4.37, and 4.32 years for sexual, violent, and general recidivism, respectively.</p>

<title>Interrater reliability</title>
<p>To measure interrater reliability of the coding protocol items, release planning for a randomly selected 11% of cases (<italic>n</italic> = 25) was assessed independently by two data coders. Cohen’s κ was calculated for all items except accommodation, for which percentage of agreement was calculated because of limited variance. Cohen’s κ values ranged from .83 to .93, slightly higher than those obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>), who reported an average Cohen’s κ = .83. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511416472">Landis and Koch’s (1977)</xref> criteria, Cohen’s κ &gt; .80 indicate “almost perfect” reliability. Raters agreed on 24 of the 25 cases (96%) for the accommodation item.</p>
<p>We also calculated Cronbach’s alpha as a measure of internal consistency. Including all items, α = .55. This suggests that planning quality, as measured by the protocol, is not a unidimensional construct.</p>

<title>Distribution of release planning total scores</title>
<p>Release planning total scores were calculated by summing the accommodation, social support, employment, motivation, and GLM secondary goods items. Due to insufficient file information, 81 cases did not have motivation ratings, thus motivation scores were imputed as the average of the remaining items. Total scores ranged between 0 and 11 (<italic>M</italic> = 6.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.05). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260511416472">Figure 1</xref> shows a histogram of the total release planning scores. Overall, scores were negatively skewed, with a skewness of −.90 (<italic>SE</italic> = .17) and kurtosis of 1.62 (<italic>SE</italic> = .35). The negative skew suggests that most offenders tended to have reasonably good planning scores and relatively few had lower scores. More specifically, the majority (64%) of the sample scored between 6 and 8 on the release planning protocol. The positive kurtosis resulted from having a higher concentration of cases in the middle compared with a normal distribution and relatively few in the tails. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test found that the distribution was significantly different from normal, <italic>D</italic>(196) = 1.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Relative contributions of release planning, static risk, and dynamic risk in recidivism prediction</title>
<p>Total release planning scores were significantly correlated with sexual recidivism, <italic>r</italic> = −.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Although the effect size was small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416472">Cohen, 1988</xref>), this finding confirmed that better planning for reintegration was associated with a reduced likelihood of reoffending. As expected, the correlations for the Static-99 and overall deviance score with recidivism were also significant, <italic>r</italic> = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, corresponding to medium and small effect sizes, respectively. Thus offenders with higher levels of static and dynamic risk were more likely to reoffend. Predictive validity for each variable was also assessed using AUC. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1.0, with higher values indicating greater accuracy, and are independent of the recidivism base rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511416472">Rice &amp; Harris, 1995</xref>). The AUC values for total release planning, Static-99, and overall deviance were .64 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), .70 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and .67 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), respectively. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals were [.52, .76], [.58, .81], and [.56, .79].</p>
<p>We also calculated correlations between release planning and static and dynamic risk. Total release planning was negatively correlated with Static-99 and overall deviance scores, <italic>r</italic>s = −.10 and −.12, respectively, but these did not reach significance (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .14 and .08).</p>
<p>A series of hierarchical Cox regressions were conducted to test whether release planning could provide incremental predictive validity for sexual recidivism after controlling for Static-99 and overall deviance scores. As expected, the Static-99 significantly predicted recidivism, <italic>B</italic> = .37 (<italic>SE</italic> = .08), Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 1.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Controlling for Static-99 scores, the total release planning score significantly predicted recidivism, <italic>B</italic> = −.18 (<italic>SE</italic> = .08), Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and the incremental validity was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Overall deviance also significantly predicted sexual recidivism, <italic>B</italic> = .31 (<italic>SE</italic> = .11), Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 1.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The total release planning score significantly predicted recidivism while controlling for overall deviance, <italic>B</italic> = −.20 (<italic>SE</italic> = .09), Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and added significant incremental validity, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Next, we tested whether release planning contributed significant predictive validity when controlling for static and dynamic risk factors simultaneously. With the Static-99 and overall deviance controlled for, the total release planning score was significant, <italic>B</italic> = −.18 (<italic>SE</italic> = .09), Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and the incremental validity approached significance, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> = .05. Finally, we adjusted the release planning total score to contain only those items that significantly differed between recidivists and nonrecidivists in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>) studies, namely accommodation, social support, employment, and GLM secondary goods (i.e., excluding the motivation item). Controlling for Static-99 and overall deviance scores simultaneously, the total release planning score was significant, <italic>B</italic> = −.21 (<italic>SE</italic> = .10), Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and the incremental validity was also significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study aimed to investigate whether assessment of release planning contributed significant incremental validity in the prediction of sexual recidivism. Results showed that the combination of release planning items that best predicted recidivism in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>)—accommodation, social support, employment, and GLM secondary goods—contributed significant incremental validity in predicting recidivism after controlling for static and dynamic risk, with the latter measured using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416472">Allan et al.’s (2007)</xref> psychometrically derived factor scores. In other words, assessment of release planning increased predictive accuracy for recidivism beyond that attained using measures of static and dynamic risk level, respectively. These findings are consistent with desistance theory and research and the GLM of offender rehabilitation, which emphasize the importance of environmental opportunities, resources, and supports in the cessation of criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Together with preliminary findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416472">Griffin et al. (2008)</xref>, the current results have implications for the practice of sex offender risk assessment. The systematic assessment of strengths and environmental factors in addition to static and dynamic risk factors will likely enhance predictive accuracy and, therefore, warrants consideration in the development of future instruments for risk assessment. Planning for postrelease accommodation, social support, and employment, as well as the presence of prosocial personally meaningful goals (i.e., GLM secondary goods), suggest particular attention. However, motivation to follow through with postrelease plans seemed to weaken the overall impact of release planning on recidivism prediction. Given that motivation scores were derived from unstructured therapist’s judgments in the case reports, this may reflect the lower accuracy of therapist judgment compared with structured, objective risk assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511416472">Grove &amp; Meehl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511416472">Hanson &amp; Bussière, 1998</xref>). Moreover, adopting a broader focus beyond individual deficits will likely increase the willingness of offenders to engage in the risk-assessment process. Given that the outcomes of risk assessments often inform the level of restrictions placed on sex offenders such as extended supervision orders, some offenders might attempt to disguise risk factors or refuse to participate in the assessment process. Widening the net of risk-assessment practice to include strengths and environmental factors should make the process more collaborative and productive (Barnett &amp; Mann, in press).</p>
<p>We acknowledge that some overlap exists between the release planning items and established dynamic risk factors—for example, employment and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416472">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416472">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>)—and it might be argued that assessment of release planning is simply another way to measure dynamic risk factors. The relative impact of release planning on recidivism might have been less pronounced if Stable 2007 scores had been available to measure dynamic risk level because they afford attention to current social supports. In any case, results of the current study suggest that increasing attention and resources to promoting strengths and release planning in sex offender treatment programs is likely to contribute toward reductions in recidivism. Although this focus may lack compatibility with the predominant risk management framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511416472">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2006</xref>) of sex offender treatment programs, the contemporary GLM of offender rehabilitation accommodates a focus on strengths and environmental factors, in addition to risk reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511416472">Ward &amp; Maruna, 2007</xref>). Preliminary findings into the utility of the GLM have been positive (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511416472">Lindsay, Ward, Morgan, &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511416472">Whitehead, Ward, &amp; Collie, 2007</xref>), which likely reflect the GLM’s attention to the social ecology of offenders as well as its focus on offenders’ values and life priorities.</p>
<p>Several limitations of the current study should be noted. Release planning is an integral part of the Kia Marama program, potentially limiting the range of release planning scores. Indeed, there was little variation in scores on the accommodation item, which is not surprising, given a key role of the reintegration coordinator is to ensure offenders have accommodation available to them at the time of their release. Greater variance in release planning scores would likely be observed in offenders completing programs that do not emphasize release planning. However, the present results, together with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416472">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416472">2009</xref>), suggest that greater variance in release planning would produce a stronger association between poor release planning and recidivism. In addition, as assessed by the Static-99, the present sample was relatively low risk and, therefore, results might not generalize to higher risk samples. Finally, whether offenders followed through with their postrelease plans was unknown, meaning that directing resources and efforts toward improving release planning might prove fruitless if planning does not predict actual experiences on release. In a small prospective study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511416472">Willis and Johnston (in press)</xref> recently showed that release planning was significantly correlated with actual reentry experiences among men released from Kia Marama (and its sister program, Te Piriti), thus it can be reasonably assumed that release planning corresponded with actual reentry experiences for men in the current sample. Any deterring effect of sound release planning is also likely to depend on sufficient internal motivation to desist from future offending—and it might be the case that higher levels of internal motivation were related to better quality release plans. Viewed in a broader context, the present study adds to a growing body of research which suggests that reducing rates of sexual recidivism requires coordinated efforts between several key stakeholders including clinicians, other professionals, and community supports (e.g., Circles of Support and Accountability (COSA); see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511416472">Wilson, Cortoni, &amp; McWhinnie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511416472">Wilson, Picheca, &amp; Prinzo, 2007</xref>). Treatment is time limited, and its effective generalization requires external resources, opportunities, and supports so that release plans can be followed through and offenders can lead prosocial lives. Important goals for future research will be to determine how treatment gains can be maintained after release from prison and how community-based treatment and supervision can maximize the likelihood of successful reintegration.</p>
