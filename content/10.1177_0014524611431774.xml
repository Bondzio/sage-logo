<p>Twelve scouts sent out by Moses surveyed the land. What happened next is frequently misread by people, even by Bible teachers, as being that ten scouts brought back a pessimistic report, “We can’t defeat these people”, while two of them, Joshua and Caleb, urged, “We can do it.” But this is to misread the text, and to miss a significant point in the story: for the record informs us that eleven (not ten) brought the negative report. There was only one, Caleb, who said, “With God’s help, we can take possession of the land.” However, overnight one man, Joshua, changed his mind - and that man subsequently came to play a crucial role as Israel’s leader.</p></abstract>

<p>People often say (I have frequently heard and read it) that when the twelve scouts returned from exploring the Promised Land (Num 13:25), ten of them brought a pessimistic report but there were two - Joshua and Caleb - who had confidence in the promise of the Lord and urged the people to enter the land. This is quite wrong, and quite misses a major point of the account.</p>
<p>To look more carefully at what the text does in fact say:</p>
<p>When the people of Israel were camped at the oasis of Kadesh-barnea in the Wilderness of Paran (Num 12:16;13:26), at the southern edge of the territory of the Promised Land, Moses sent twelve leaders, one from each tribe, to investigate and report back to him everything about the land. For forty days these men journeyed around Canaan, entering from the Wilderness of Zin, the southern desert west of the Jordan, and thence travelled through the Negev and as far as the northern border of the Promised Land; then they reported back on what they had found (Num 13:17-29).</p>
<p>This is where it is important to note carefully what the text says. The scouts’ factual report indicated the difficulties ahead in taking over the land (13:28-29), but Caleb added his enthusiastic encouragement of (13:30): “We must go up and take possession of the land, because we can certainly conquer it!” However, all Caleb’s colleagues “gave a negative report to the Israelites about the land they had scouted” (13:32, HCSB).</p>
<p>At this point, when the scouts reported back, Caleb stood absolutely alone. There is no mention that he is supported by Joshua. There is no mention of Joshua - except collectively as being included amongst “the men who had gone up with him [Caleb]” who said, “We can’t go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are” (13:31). The result was the people broke out into wailing, and wept all that night.</p>
<p>There were three developments by the morning. First of all, the people were complaining bitterly about Moses and Aaron, and began planning to replace them with a leader who would take them back again to Egypt (14:1-4).</p>
<p>Secondly, Caleb continued to urge the people to trust the Lord and move forward. But thirdly - and very significantly - Joshua has now taken his stand by Caleb’s side (14:6-9).</p>
<p>Clearly, the night had provided a very fruitful opportunity for Joshua to reflect further upon the situation. Upon what Caleb had said, and what the other scouts had said. And, doubtless, upon the promises of God. And whose side he was going to be on. And in the morning there was a change. The one man who had shown faith in the Lord and said “Let us go forward” was no longer alone: Joshua stood beside him.</p>
<p>In the short run, this made no difference. The majority still carried the day - the people were not willing to enter the land then and there, as the Lord had intended them to. Indeed, Caleb and Joshua were in danger of being stoned (14:10).</p>
<p>Then the Lord intervened. In his anger at the rebellion of the Israelites he purposed to wipe them out and raise up a people to Moses. But Moses interceded for the people, and so God pronounced instead that all those twenty years of age or older would die in the wilderness, while their children, about whom they had been so fearful, would actually be the ones to inherit the promise of the land. The upshot was that the people of Israel were to wander in the deserts for forty years until the last of that rebellious and unbelieving generation had died. But there were two exceptions (14:30): Caleb and Joshua. And the longterm repercussions were significant. Joshua developed further as a leader, became Moses’ right-hand man (Num 27:18), and then Moses’ successor who led the next generation of Israelites into the Promised Land.</p>
<p>What a rich vein of teaching there is in this account when we recognize the significance of the series of events - and especially of the influence of Caleb, and of Joshua’s change of mind.</p>
<p>When Caleb gave his initial report, upon his return from the expedition, he stood alone. What an example this is of a person - boldly and fearlessly, or in fear and trepidation - being willing to take a stand for the right and the truth, and for faith in the promises of the Lord, when friends and colleagues and everyone else around us has lost faith and lost heart. In such a situation our nerve may well fail us. The more we recognize this the more we recognize the greatness of this man Caleb and what he did.</p>
<p>And his testimony bore fruit: he persuaded Joshua. This stands on a level with Andrew recruiting Simon Peter. Had there been no Caleb, there is no suggestion in the text that Joshua would have had a different opinion the following morning.</p>
<p>Under God, it was a turning point in the history of Israel that reached its fulfilment when this man Joshua was the one who led the conquest of the Promised Land. As Paul had his Ananias and Simon Peter had his Andrew, so in the outworking of the providence of God Joshua had his Caleb. The less important, less significant Christian can take heart that he or she may well be a link in the chain for the outworking of God’s purposes in the raising up of another Paul, another Peter, another Joshua.</p>
<p>So it is quite mistaken to say that when the scouts reported back two of them brought a favourable report. Rather, only one man - Caleb - did this. But that lone testimony, that lone voice, that lone act of faith, had a significant outcome in the outworking of God’s program for Israel, in the early stage of the development of Joshua to grow to become the leader of the Israelites after Moses.</p>
<p>Translators need to take care to see that their versions allow the sequence of events to show through clearly. And all Bible readers should carefully note, and give full credit for, the valiant and lonely stand taken by Caleb in his testimony for the Lord.</p>
