<abstract>
<p>Negative social feedback is often a source of distress. However, self-verification theory provides the counterintuitive explanation that negative feedback leads to less distress when it is consistent with chronic self-views. Drawing from this work, the present study examined the impact of receiving self-verifying feedback on outcomes largely neglected in prior research: implicit responses (i.e., physiological reactivity, facial expressions) that are difficult to consciously regulate and downstream behavioral outcomes. In two experiments, participants received either positive or negative feedback from interviewers during a speech task. Regardless of self-views, positive compared to negative feedback elicited lower self-reported negative affect. Implicit responses to negative feedback, however, depended on chronic self-views with more negative self-views associated with lower blood pressure reactivity, lower facial negativity, and enhanced creativity. These findings point at the role self-verification may play in long-term coping and stress regulation.</p>

Self-verification and self-enhancement are widely recognized as two of the most fundamental motives driving people’s reactions to positive and negative self-evaluations. According to a recent meta-analysis, cognitive reactions (i.e., accuracy perceptions) to feedback are heavily influenced by self-verification strivings, while affective reactions are mostly driven by self-enhancement strivings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612471827">Kwang &amp; Swann, 2010</xref>). Here, we argue that this conclusion may be premature due to prior research focusing exclusively on self-reported affect (i.e., explicit affect), which is consciously regulated and vulnerable to response biases. As such, one of our primary goals was to examine the impact of self-verification motives on affectively driven responses in channels that are less consciously regulated (i.e., implicit affect) and less vulnerable to self-presentational biases. A second goal was to examine the consequences of self-verifying feedback on behavior in novel situations that fall outside of the feedback context. Such spillover effects have received relatively little research attention (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550612471827">Swann, Kwan, Polzer, &amp; Milton, 2003</xref>) despite their importance in elucidating how self-verification may affect well-being and life outcomes at a broader level and over time.</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550612471827">
<title>Self-Verification Theory and Prior Research</title>
<p>The basic premise underlying self-verification theory is that people desire subjective accuracy and consistency in their self-views, and hence prefer partners and information that verify their beliefs about the self, even when such beliefs are negative (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550612471827">Swann, 2011</xref>, for a review). Therefore, a unique prediction of the theory is that people with negative self-views should prefer negative over positive feedback, which stands in contrast to the prediction of self-enhancement theory that people should prefer positive feedback (regardless of their self-views) resulting from a motivation for positive self-regard (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550612471827">Leary, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550612471827">Sedikides, Gaertner, &amp; Toguchi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612471827">Sedikides &amp; Gregg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-verification theory has found broad support across dozens of studies. To summarize, people prefer feedback and interaction partners who confirm their self-views (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550612471827">Swann &amp; Read, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550612471827">Swann, Stein-Steroussi, &amp; Giesler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550612471827">Swann, Wenzlaff, Krull, &amp; Pelham, 1992</xref>), perceive self-view consistent feedback to be more accurate, accept more responsibility for such feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612471827">Jussim, Yen, &amp; Aiello, 1995</xref>), show greater commitment to self-verifying marital partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550612471827">Swann, De La Ronde, &amp; Hixon, 1994</xref>), and derive health benefits from life experiences (e.g., success and failure) that are self-view consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550612471827">Brown &amp; McGill, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612471827">Shimizu &amp; Pelham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550612471827">Wood, Heimpel, Newby-Clark, &amp; Ross, 2005</xref>). </p>
<p>Despite this wealth of evidence, however, self-verification effects have been difficult to demonstrate with respect to affective reactions (e.g., feeling negative or positive affect in response to the feedback; liking or disliking of the evaluator). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612471827">Kwang &amp; Swann, 2010</xref>) has revealed that although the self-verification effect is robust for cognitive processes (effect size <italic>r</italic> = .30), it is not significantly different from zero for affective responses. Kwang and Swann conclude that affective reactions to feedback seem to be better explained by the self-enhancement motive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1948550612471827">
<title>The Current Research</title>
<p>The meta-analytic findings summarized above nevertheless leave unanswered the question of why affect may be predominantly driven by the self-enhancement motive whereas responses in other domains, particularly the cognitive domain, seem governed by self-verification strivings. Two possibilities come to mind. First, self-report measures of negative affect may be influenced by self-report bias to a greater extent than cognitive measures; for example, people may report how they <italic>believe</italic> they should feel rather than what they actually feel (e.g., success should bring happiness). In contrast, cognitive measures may not be as strongly governed by normative beliefs about appropriate responding, leading individuals to be more willing to express disagreement with inconsistent evaluations. Second, people may not be aware of their affective reactions and may thus be unable to report on them. Both possibilities suggest that self-verification effects for affect might become evident when examining implicit, less consciously controlled responses, such as physiological reactivity (i.e., blood pressure [BP] reactivity) and nonverbal affect (i.e., facial expressions and bodily posture). To our knowledge, there is no study to date that has examined this hypothesis. One of our goals was to address this gap.</p>
<p>We acknowledge from the outset that physiological reactions and nonverbal affect are not “pure” measures of implicit affect. BP responses are known to tap into both cognitive appraisals of and affective reactions to situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612471827">Mendes, 2009</xref>). Similarly, nonverbal affect may be driven as much by cognitive agreement with the feedback as from one’s emotional reactions to it. Nevertheless, to the degree that these responses are not under conscious control, they are less subject to obstacles associated with self-reported affective reactions.</p>
<p>Physiological responses, particularly those linked to stress processes, may additionally provide insight into possible downstream health effects of self-verification. Therefore, we examined BP reactivity given its link to negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550612471827">Gallo, Smith, &amp; Kircher, 2000</xref>), vigilance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550612471827">Smith, Ruiz, &amp; Uchino, 2000</xref>), distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550612471827">Matthews, Woodall, &amp; Allen, 1993</xref>), and long-term health, especially coronary heart disease (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550612471827">Chobanian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612471827">Matthews, 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1948550612471827">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, we extended our questions to explore the behavioral consequences of self-verification in a new situation not directly relevant to the feedback domain. Recent research shows that feedback inconsistent with one’s self-views leads to regulatory efforts to reconcile the discrepancy, resulting in resource depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612471827">Stinson et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, failure to self-verify may lead to poorer performance on a subsequent task. To examine this prediction, we measured performance on a creativity task previously shown to require effort, concentration, and persistence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550612471827">Amabile, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550612471827">Swann, Kwan, Polzer, and Milton (2003</xref>) provided indirect evidence for the link between self-verification and creativity by showing that in small group settings, receiving self-verifying feedback from team members was associated with earning higher scores on a test that required creative problem solving. In the current study, we probed this link more directly, in an experimental setting.</p>
<p>We examined these hypotheses in two experiments with different samples (Berkeley and Harvard) but that followed largely similar procedures in which participants delivered speeches in front of two interviewers who provided positive or negative feedback. Dependent variables across both studies included self-reported affect and continuous BP. Nonverbal affect and creativity task data were available only in the Berkeley and Harvard samples, respectively.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1948550612471827">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were (a) University of California, Berkeley students who received course credit or $15 for their participation (<italic>N</italic> = 82, 67% female, 48% Caucasian, 52% Asian American) and (b) Harvard University students who received $25 for their participation (<italic>N</italic> = 69, 73% female, 54% Caucasian, 20% Asian American, 4% African American, and 22% other/unidentified). One participant with extremely poor English proficiency and three who omitted the self-esteem (SE) questionnaire were excluded from the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550612471827">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The procedures at each site were the same except as noted below. Participants first completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (RSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612471827">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>). They were then connected to a BP monitor and rested while baseline BP data were collected for 5 min. Subsequently, they were introduced to a Trier Social Stress Task (TSST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612471827">Kirschbaum, Pirke, &amp; Hellhammer, 1993</xref>) modified to include the delivery of explicit evaluative feedback (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550612471827">Akinola &amp; Mendes, 2008</xref>). Participants were told that they would first deliver a 5-min speech in front of interviewers in a simulated job interview followed by a 5-min Q&amp;A session and that the interviewers would give them explicit feedback regarding their performance. After a brief, private preparation period (5 and 2 min, at Berkeley and Harvard, respectively) participants rated their current affect (prefeedback assessment) on the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS; see measures for details).</p>
<p>Next, a male and a female confederate trained in giving scripted feedback entered the room. At this point, participants were randomly assigned to receive either positive (<italic>n</italic>
<sub>Berkeley</sub>
<italic> = </italic>40; <italic>n</italic>
<sub>Harvard</sub> = 34), or negative (<italic>n</italic>
<sub>Berkeley</sub> = 39; <italic>n</italic>
<sub>Harvard</sub> = 35) feedback. Initial feedback was delivered both verbally and nonverbally during the speech task and continued via nonverbal channels during Q&amp;A. Participants rated their current affect (postfeedback assessment) on the PANAS again between speech and Q&amp;A. The TSST ended with a 5-min rest (recovery) period. </p>
<p>Subsequently, the Berkeley participants were debriefed and compensated, whereas the Harvard sample completed a creativity task. They were instructed to make a collage using a 10” x 15” cardboard piece, bottles of glue and glitter, and 54 pieces of felt and paper in various shapes, sizes, and colors. They were given 10 min to complete the collage (one participant declined), followed by debriefing and compensation.</p>

<title>Measures and Materials</title>
<sec id="section7-1948550612471827">
<title>Feedback type</title>
<p>In the positive feedback condition, evaluators started smiling and nodding 30 s into the participant’s speech. A minute later, they stopped the participant and provided verbal feedback (e.g., <italic>You are very clear and manage to put your personality across</italic>). In the negative feedback condition, the interviewers first started to shake their heads and frown, and then stopped the speech and gave verbal feedback (e.g., <italic>I felt that you could be much clearer and more articulate</italic>) following the same timeline. During Q&amp;A, interviewers continued giving nonverbal feedback as originally assigned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550612471827">
<title>Self-views</title>
<p>We measured valence of self-views with global SE. Sociometer theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550612471827">Leary, Tambor, Terdal, &amp; Downs, 1995</xref>) posits that because social acceptance has survival value, the SE system has evolved to detect individuals’ level of acceptance and rejection. According to this model, the SE system experiences a drop when individuals experience social rejection. Low SE is, in turn, assumed to motivate individuals to behave in ways that elicit acceptance by the social group. Because the manipulations used in our experiments had social acceptance and rejection embedded in them, we chose to operationalize self-views with global SE where lower levels of SE tap into more negative self-views regarding one’s competence and likability in social interactions.</p>
<p>To assess SE, participants rated themselves (1 = <italic>does not describe me at all</italic> to 6 = <italic>describes me very well</italic>) on the RSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612471827">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>). SE was unrelated to experimental condition in both samples (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550612471827">
<title>Self-reported affect</title>
<p>Participants completed the PANAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550612471827">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>) with respect to their current affect (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 5 = <italic>a lot</italic>) before and after feedback (in the speech task). Negative and positive items were averaged to create negative and positive affect indices, respectively (αs ≥ .85). One Berkeley participant omitted this questionnaire. We created an overall affect index by subtracting positive affect from negative affect scores (higher scores = higher negativity).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1948550612471827">
<title>Nonverbal affect</title>
<p>Two coders rated participants’ nonverbal affect (0 = <italic>very negative</italic>, 1 = <italic>somewhat negative</italic>, 2 = <italic>neutral</italic>, 3 = <italic>somewhat positive</italic>, 4 = <italic>very positive</italic>) from their facial expressions (e.g., smiles) and bodily posture (e.g., closed vs. open) using videotape data available in the Berkeley sample. Coders, who were blind to condition, watched the videotapes without sound, and made global judgments about participants’ affective state during participants’ speech after feedback delivery. We coded for nonverbal affect during the initial speech task (but not the Q&amp;A) on the assumption that such reactions would be the most visible right after participants received verbal feedback. Videotapes of four participants were uncodeable due to low quality. Ratings were reverse-scored with higher scores indicating more negative affect and averaged across the judges (α = .84).</p>
<p>Coders also evaluated emotional expressiveness of the participants’ face (0 = <italic>not emotionally expressive</italic>, 6 = <italic>extremely emotionally expressive</italic>) for the period of speech preceding the delivery of feedback. This index of baseline expressiveness was used to control for individual differences in emotional expressivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612471827">Gross &amp; John, 2003</xref>), which may influence how accurately participants’ nonverbal affective responses to feedback could be coded. Coders’ ratings (α = .67) were averaged for the final analysis (<italic>M</italic> = 3.81, <italic>SD</italic> = .64). </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1948550612471827">
<title>Blood pressure</title>
<p>At Berkeley, we used a Medwave BP monitor (St. Paul, MN) that estimates BP responses approximately every 15 heartbeats. At Harvard, we used the Colin 7000 (San Antonio, TX), which estimates BP continuously. Nevertheless, both instruments use the tonometry method, which estimates BP from the radial artery attached to the wrist of the nondominant arm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612471827">Mendes, 2009</xref> for details). The signals were recorded with Acqknowledge software (Biopac Systems, Inc, Santa Barbara, CA) and then data were visually inspected offline for artifacts. BP responses were averaged across 1-min epochs. We report mean arterial pressure (MAP) as systolic and diastolic measurements yielded similar results when they were analyzed separately.</p>
<p>Consistent with past research using similar paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550612471827">Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, &amp; Salomon, 1999</xref>), we focus our BP analyses on the second (Q&amp;A) task. The rationale is that whereas the speech task established the feedback manipulation, the Q&amp;A task allowed us to examine physiological responses in response to a “new” task that was still uncertain. </p>
<p>Some physiological data could not be scored due to faulty sensors, loss of signal, or noisy signals, leaving 119 participants. This attrition was not statistically related to SE or the feedback condition in either sample, all <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1. Furthermore, statistical outliers were defined as BP responses greater or less than 2.6 <italic>SD</italic> from the mean and were winsorized (assigned a unit value 1% higher or lower than the next closest value). Using this standard, less than .012% of the total data were recoded.</p>
<p>Baseline MAP did not differ significantly as a function of feedback condition or SE in either sample, <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1. Therefore, MAP reactivity values were calculated by subtracting baseline MAP (the last minute of the baseline period) from the average MAP during Q&amp;A. </p>

<sec id="section12-1948550612471827">
<title>Creativity</title>
<p>Six professional artists were recruited to judge the creativity of the collages following the consensual assessment technique guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612471827">Amabile, 1982</xref>). Each collage was rated on 21 dimensions, which were assessed by having the judges mark an X on an-18-mm line anchored from low to high creativity with a midpoint labeled “medium.” Exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation showed that 13 of the 21 dimensions loaded high on one factor (factor loadings &gt; .30). Therefore, we created a single index of collage creativity per participant averaged across judges and across the 13 dimensions (α = .95, <italic>M</italic> = 7.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.87).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550612471827">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations among key variables separately by sample. Preliminary analyses indicated that the Berkeley sample was higher than the Harvard sample in SE, MAP reactivity, and self-reported affect (variances did not differ by sample). However, such mean differences are not theoretically relevant to our hypotheses and the key findings reported below were not significantly moderated by sample. Furthermore, because sample (Berkeley vs. Harvard) and SE were correlated, we did not want to confound sample with SE by using raw scores. Therefore, all variables were standardized within sample and sample was dropped from further consideration.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two experiments replicated the well-established finding for self-reported negative affect, which showed large and robust self-enhancement effects but no significant self-verification effects: all participants regardless of their SE reported greater negative affect following negative compared to positive feedback. Extending this prior literature, however, we also found significant self-verification effects in two channels of responding that are less consciously regulated—BP reactivity and negative affect in facial and bodily expressions. Participants’ responses in these channels were more positive following positive than negative feedback if they held positive self-views whereas we observed the opposite pattern if they held negative self-views. These findings are consistent with the possibility that self-verification effects in self-reported affect may be masked by participants’ unwillingness or inability to report fully on their affective reactions. Furthermore, because data were collapsed across two samples for MAP reactivity (with no significant sample differences), these studies provide an internal replication for self-verification effects for a physiological concomitant of negative affect. To our knowledge, these findings are the first in demonstrating how self-verification motives impact physiological stress responses to feedback. </p>
<p>Swann and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550612471827">Swann, Hixon, Stein-Seroussi, &amp; Gilbert, 1990</xref>) have argued that whereas self-enhancement depends on simple computations (e.g., determining the valence of the feedback), and therefore influences immediate, affective responses to feedback, self-verification requires more complex computations (e.g., determining valence and comparing it to the self-concept) and thus, shapes long-term cognitive responses. Current findings are the first to demonstrate that self-verification responses are evident even in the short term if they are assessed at the implicit level—a finding consistent with growing evidence showing how complex decisions can be executed more efficiently and rapidly by an implicit (vs. explicit) response system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550612471827">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study also adds to the relatively sparse body of work examining how self-verification strivings impact downstream behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612471827">Stinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550612471827">Swann et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with self-verification theory, we demonstrated greater creativity among low SE individuals following negative feedback and among high SE individuals following positive feedback. Social feedback consistent with one’s self-concept is processed more easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550612471827">Markus, 1977</xref>) whereas inconsistent feedback elicits compensatory efforts such as resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550612471827">Swann &amp; Hill, 1982</xref>) and can be depleting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612471827">Stinson et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, following self-verifying feedback individuals may have greater resources to allocate to a subsequent task, such as the creativity task used in our research, which has been shown to require effort and persistence. Self-verification may also impact mechanisms other than availability of resources such as increased feelings of authenticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550612471827">Swann et al., 1994</xref>), psychological mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550612471827">Feist &amp; Barron, 2003</xref>), or self-acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612471827">Feist, 1998</xref>), which, in turn, may facilitate creativity. These possibilities should be explored in future research.</p>
<sec id="section19-1948550612471827">
<title>Implications of Self-Verification for Health Outcomes</title>
<p>The present results open a window into the possible health consequences of accumulated experiences of failure to self-verify. Although generalizing from responses from a laboratory experiment to responses in the outside world requires caution, these data provide initial evidence that inconsistent information may be met with greater distress and pathophysiological responses than consistent information. If repeated over time and situations, these physiological profiles may lead to more physical health vulnerabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550612471827">Matthews, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550612471827">Thayer &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>). </p>
<p>It is also important to note that compared to individuals with positive self-views, people with negative (or less positive) self-views fare better physiologically when faced with negative feedback. Thus, as ironic as it may be, receiving schema confirming negative feedback may have initial affective and behavioral benefits, which presents an even greater challenge to mental health professionals attempting to modify tendencies of individuals who have negative self-schemas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550612471827">Brown &amp; McGill, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550612471827">Townsend, Major, Sawyer, &amp; Mendes, 2010</xref>). Importantly, the results caution that simply modifying elements of a target’s environment without attempting to modify the entrenched negative self-views of the target might be counterproductive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1948550612471827">
<title>Caveats and Conclusions</title>
<p>Several caveats need to be acknowledged. First, the valence of the feedback affected people with positive self-views more than those with negative self-views. Nevertheless, because many factors can influence the match between the self-view and the feedback (e.g., both the positive and negative feedback may be far more positive or negative than the self-views), the key finding for self-verification theory is the interaction between self-view and feedback and the pattern of slopes rather than the significance of any particular slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612471827">Kwang &amp; Swann, 2010</xref>). In this regard, our results consistently revealed such an interaction across implicit and behavioral measures.</p>
<p>Regarding our use of physiological responses, as previously noted BP reactivity can be altered via cognitive appraisals and/or affective reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612471827">Mendes, 2009</xref>). Similarly, nonverbal affective reactions of the kind that was coded may also be, at least partly, due to cognitive processes. For example, low SE participants may discount the credibility of positive feedback, leading them to experience less positive, more negative affect in response.</p>
<p>Although these considerations make us cautious in interpreting the results as an unequivocal demonstration of self-verification effects on implicit affect per se, they contribute to the literature by showing how self-verification processes can shape affectively driven responses that are difficult to control. They are also the first to link failures in self-verification to physiological outcomes related to the stress-disease pathway. As such, they invite both self-verification and self-enhancement researchers to pay close attention to affective concomitants of responses to feedback at the implicit level in future work.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the findings were observed in a highly stressful performance paradigm in which participants were given face-to-face feedback. Therefore, the results are noteworthy in demonstrating the operation of self-verification processes in a setting high in ecological validity.</p>
