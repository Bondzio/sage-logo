<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the motion event language children and their parents engaged in while playing a board game. Children are sensitive to differences in manner and path at infancy, yet adult-like motion event expression appears relatively late in development. While multiple studies have examined how exposure to parent speech generally relates to very young children’s language, none looks at motion event language and learning in 3- to 7-year-olds. This study aimed to examine the opportunities for children to learn motion event language through engaging with their parents, using a constructivist view of language learning. Parent–child conversation of Spanish-speaking (21) and English-speaking (24) families was examined for lexical and syntactic differences in motion event expressions. Results demonstrated English-speaking parents used more manner verbs and Spanish-speaking parents used more specific path verbs. English-speaking parents also used more general path verbs than did Spanish speakers. These differences mapped onto children’s production of motion event language. Parental speech may provide the potential for children to gradually learn about motion event language typology.</p>

<body>
<p>A great deal of attention has been devoted in recent years to the expression of motion events in various languages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723713490599">Slobin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142723713490599">Talmy, 2000</xref>). This attention has provided insight into both cognitive and linguistic theory, given that motion is a universal phenomenon but its linguistic expression differs in several ways. However, no study has addressed how interaction with parents might facilitate development of the lexicon and syntax associated with motion event expression. This study examines the relationship between parental language use and child productions by comparing interactions in two different language communities, Spanish and English.</p>
<sec id="section1-0142723713490599">
<title>The relation between child and parent language use</title>
<p>Much evidence supports the constructivist view of language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142723713490599">Tomasello, 2000</xref>) in which the speech that parents use with children influences children’s early language production. Parents provide clues about such varied aspects of language as conventionality of words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723713490599">Luce &amp; Callanan, 2010</xref>), mutual exclusivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723713490599">Callanan &amp; Sabbagh, 2004</xref>) and category membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723713490599">Gelman, Coley, Rosengren, Hartman, &amp; Pappas, 1998</xref>). Adult speech at one time point has been used to predict child speech at a later time point (or several later time points) with regard to syntactic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723713490599">Baker &amp; Nelson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723713490599">Naigles &amp; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723713490599">1998</xref>), types and tokens of words used in child-directed speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723713490599">Clark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723713490599">Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea, &amp; Hedges, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723713490599">Rowe, 2008</xref>), pragmatic intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723713490599">Hoff-Ginsberg, 1986</xref>), connectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723713490599">van Veen, Evers-Vermeul, Sanders, &amp; van den Bergh, 2009</xref>) and clausal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723713490599">Huttenlocher et al., 2010</xref>). Cross-linguistically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723713490599">Weisleder and Waxman (2010)</xref> have examined potential distributional cues that occur in English and Spanish directed at children aged 2;6 or younger. They found that so-called ‘frequent frames’ are available to children learning both languages, especially with regard to nouns and verbs, enabling young children to differentiate word types through analysing the language they were hearing. Consistent with these findings, other cross-linguistic studies have also demonstrated relationships between parental speech and child onset of various aspects of language use (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723713490599">Bassano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723713490599">Xanthos et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, some aspects of language may be difficult to acquire based on the language to which children are exposed. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723713490599">Sandhofer and Smith (2007)</xref> demonstrated that the adjectival language English-learning children hear provides relatively little information about the meaning of these words and, in fact, even children who know relatively many names for objects find learning names for properties difficult in ambiguous learning situations. Thus, the relationship between language learning and exposure to adult speech is not clear-cut.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that all of these studies focus on very early production. This study examines children’s learning of different aspects of motion event expression, which tends to develop over a relatively late period during childhood. As such, the concern is with parent–child language that occurred at a later point in the child’s life as well. There are at least two possible results in such a study: examination of motion event language in parent–child conversation may show cues that children might utilize or it could demonstrate a lack of systematic information such that children may have trouble discovering the nature of motion event language in their language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0142723713490599">
<title>Motion event expression</title>
<p>One of the most important elements in motion description is path, or direction, of motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142723713490599">Talmy, 2000</xref>). Languages that express path in the verb (e.g. Spanish, Turkish, Greek) are known as verb-framed languages, while languages that tend to express path in the satellite (e.g. English, German) are referred to as satellite-framed languages. It should be noted that expression of all aspects of motion is available in all languages. It is the difference in emphasis on particular elements through expression in the main verb that becomes interesting for questions of cognition and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723713490599">Hohenstein, Naigles, &amp; Eisenberg, 2004</xref>). Additionally, syntactic studies with adults have shown that Spanish speakers use more bare verb phrases, providing no post-verbal locative information about motion, than do English speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723713490599">Hohenstein, Eisenberg, &amp; Naigles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713490599">Naigles, Eisenberg, Kako, Highter, &amp; McGraw, 1998</xref>). Moreover, Spanish speakers tend to use more manner modifier information than do English speakers, particularly in the presence of a path verb, compensating for relatively few manner verbs.</p>
<sec id="section3-0142723713490599">
<title>Development of motion event language</title>
<p>Very young infants are able to notice changes in both manner and path in habituation studies of motion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723713490599">Pulverman, Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, &amp; Buresh, 2008</xref>). Despite this, children seem to have similar patterns of acquisition across languages at the one-word stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142723713490599">McCune, 2006</xref>) and may only begin to use language in a typologically distinct way in or beyond the preschool years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723713490599">Maguire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713490599">Ozcaliskan &amp; Slobin, 1999</xref>). In fact, there is some conflict about the age at which children show differences across languages in motion event typology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713490599">Ozcaliskan and Slobin (1999)</xref> found that 3-year-old English speakers used many more manner verbs than path verbs in elicited production, whereas Spanish- and Turkish-speaking children of the same age were like Spanish- and Turkish-speaking adults in their production (using nearly the same numbers of manner and path verbs). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723713490599">Gullberg, Hendriks, and Hickmann (2008)</xref> demonstrated that 4-year-old French-learners used primarily path verbs in motion event descriptions. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723713490599">Maguire et al. (2010)</xref> showed that English-, Spanish- and Japanese-learning 2- and 2.5-year-olds preferred to generalize a novel motion verb to path rather than to manner in a verb-learning situation that had few syntactic constraints on verb meaning. And in their tests of preschool-aged children, Maguire et al. noted that though English-speaking preschoolers did conform to the manner preference that is shown by adult English speakers, preschool-aged children in the Spanish and the Japanese groups were not yet adult-like in their attribution of novel verbs.</p>
<p>A pattern of early bias towards path is consistent with findings from narrative data that suggest that young children in both Spanish and English tend to use ‘general path’ verbs, or ‘path light’ verbs, and only after the age of 3 or 4 do they begin to look more language specific typologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723713490599">Hohenstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723713490599">Slobin, 2004</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723713490599">Hohenstein (2005)</xref> found that 7-year-old speakers of English and Spanish, but not 3.5-year-olds, were influenced by the typology of the language in a novel verb learning experiment that varied syntactic frame. The younger children in that study used only the syntax of the sentence and not the typology of the language to extend novel verbs, while the older children used both syntax and typology.</p>
<p>In fact, there does seem to be evidence that syntactic development of motion event language takes different amounts of time across different language groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723713490599">Allen et al. (2007)</xref> studied 3.5-year-olds and adults by eliciting descriptions of motion event videos in Turkish, English and Japanese. Their examination focused on whether children and adults would use a single clause for expressing motion as is typical in English or whether they would package the motion separately by manner and path, which is more typical of Turkish and Japanese. Their findings demonstrate that children are more likely to use a single phrase to talk about manner and path in Turkish and Japanese than would have been predicted based on adult language. As such, Allen et al. suggest that there may be a universal constraint on motion event language as it may be easier for children to package the syntax of motion event language ‘tightly’ than to do it in a semi-tight or loose way that would be more typical of some adult language. Studies on the use of manner modifiers and bare verbs have not been conducted with children. It could be that children begin using motion event syntax in ways that match the language they are learning or language typical patterns may only appear in adult language.</p>
<p>The fact that 1- and 2-year-olds produce similar motion event language across language groups (extending novel verbs to path and using more general path verbs) suggests that it is only once they reach a certain point in development that children can start to pay attention to the specific patterns of the language they are learning; sometime between 3 and 7 years of age seems to be the time during which children’s language is changing. In elicited production preschoolers appear to use verbs that mirror those of adults in their language communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713490599">Ozcaliskan &amp; Slobin, 1999</xref>). But they struggle to extend novel verbs in language typical ways at 3 years, either in syntactic frames that help them focus on a particular meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723713490599">Hohenstein, 2005</xref>) or in syntactically more neutral stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723713490599">Maguire et al., 2010</xref>), and the syntax they produce does not match that of adults in the languages they are learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723713490599">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the evidence about how children from different language typology backgrounds understand and produce motion event language is not conclusive.</p>

<title>Current research</title>
<p>The project reported here was designed to address whether the language children are exposed to in activities with their parents provides the potential for learning about motion event language typology in different ways across development. To that end, Spanish- and English-speaking parent–child dyads were filmed playing a game during the period when children are learning to use motion event language in language specific ways, between 3 and 7 years. Data are reported here that show whether the potential for learning specific language patterns is present, as opposed to testing a causal claim. Consistent with a constructivist claim about parental language providing a model for children’s language development and based on previous research on motion event language, it is predicted first that English-speaking parents will use more manner verbs and fewer bare verbs than will Spanish-speaking parents. Second, it is predicted that Spanish-speaking parents will use more specific path verbs and more manner modifiers than will English-speaking parents. In line with these predictions and some previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713490599">Ozcaliskan &amp; Slobin, 1999</xref>), it is also predicted that the motion event language of English-speaking children will contain more manner verbs, whereas that of Spanish-learning children will contain more specific path verbs. General path verbs have not been researched in a naturalistic way with adults before and thus this study aims to explore their use amongst English- and Spanish-speaking adults and children.</p>

<sec id="section6-0142723713490599">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Children and their families were recruited from a predominantly Spanish-speaking city (Mexico City, Mexico), as well as a predominantly English-speaking city (Los Angeles, California). All participants in both locations were of middle-class background. Families were recruited through Catholic schools in Los Angeles and through private schools in relatively wealthy areas of Mexico City. All families participated in a larger project, which also examined non-linguistic cognition of the children.</p>
<p>The sample for this study comprises 45 families: 21 Spanish-speaking and 24 English-speaking children. The mean ages (with ranges), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (English or Spanish version) scores, Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) and Leiter International Intelligence scores for the target children in the sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723713490599">Table 1</xref>. Aside from the standardized vocabulary test, on which Spanish-learners scored higher than English-learners, these do not differ between language groups. Several families were excluded from analyses for the following reasons: faulty video recordings provided insufficient data to use (7 Spanish-speaking children, 6 English-speaking children), or they did not play the game used in analysis (see Procedure; 2 Spanish-speaking children).</p>

<p>The focus of the study is on the parent and a target child. However, many of the videos contained other family members, including children of other ages. Of the Spanish-speaking families, eight included additional children (mean age 57.75 months); whereas in the English-speaking families, there were 11 other children present in 10 families (mean age 76.27 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0142723713490599">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Chutes and Ladders™ was chosen as a tool to elicit motion event language because it is a board game that involves a lot of movement across the game board, with many opportunities for climbing up and sliding down by way of ladders and slides, in addition to typical movement across the board towards the ‘goal’. Though families usually engaged in other play during the recording, in order to equate the potential for motion language across ages and languages, the analysis presented here focuses on Chutes and Ladders™ only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0142723713490599">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Families were invited to play games that were brought by the researcher to their homes. In addition, they could engage in ‘free play’ following the games that were brought. Once the videotaping of games and free play was finished, the parent completed a short questionnaire and the child was asked to complete a vocabulary and intelligence test. The whole visit normally lasted between 45 minutes and 1 hour.</p>
<p>Duration of Chutes and Ladders™ play generally lasted between 5 and 18 minutes. Mean length of play was 11.22 minutes (SD = 6.03). In addition to varying lengths of time spent on playing this game, there were different numbers of utterances used by parents and children while engaging in the game. These differences are addressed in the coding section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0142723713490599">
<title>Coding</title>
<p>Each video recording was transcribed and checked for accuracy. Following transcription, motion event verbs that were associated with voluntary motion were identified and coded for manner of motion, general path of motion, or specific path of motion separately for parents and children. Instances of verbs used in different conjugations were all coded as a single type of verb (e.g. ‘go’, ‘going’ and ‘went’ were all instances of the verb ‘to go’). Both the number of tokens and number of types of each motion verb category were recorded. Uses of the verb ‘to go’ were not included if they did not refer to motion (e.g. meaning ‘it’s your turn’ or in quoting another). Because of its idiomatic consistency to act as a single verb in both English and Spanish, when uttered in the context of ‘fall down’, the verb ‘fall’ (‘caerse’ in Spanish) was coded as a specific path verb. All other instances of ‘fall’ were coded as general path motion. Examples of these verbs in both Spanish and English can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0142723713490599">Appendix 1</xref>. A second coder rated 20% of the data and reliability was found to be excellent for all three categories of verbs (manner = 90% agreement, general path = 98% agreement, specific path = 99% agreement). In addition, sentences were parsed and uses of manner modifiers and bare verbs were coded for later analysis of syntactical variations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713490599">Naigles et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>For each category of motion event verb, the number of tokens was divided by the total number of motion event verbs in order to control for the different number of utterances about motion in the speech of different families. In other words, analysis was carried out on the proportion of motion verbs that were manner verbs, general path verbs or specific path verbs. In addition, the proportion of verb types in each category was calculated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Reported here are the ways that parents spoke about motion events with their children followed by the ways the same children used motion event language. In order to contextualize this, overall descriptive statistics are reported first, followed by a breakdown by language group.</p>
<p>As a group, parents used an average of 349 utterances while playing with their children, which consisted of 30 motion verbs of all categories. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723713490599">Table 2</xref> shows the breakdown of utterances and motion verbs by language group. Spanish-speaking parents’ language contained more utterances than did that of English-speaking parents, <italic>t</italic>(33.66) = 2.16, <italic>p</italic> = .038. However, this did not result in different numbers of motion verbs being used by the two groups, <italic>t</italic>(43) = .12, n.s., or different ratios of motion verbs to utterances, <italic>t</italic>(38.98) = 1.76, n.s.</p>

<p>Children, in comparison, used 96 utterances on average with 8.44 motion verbs. The numbers of utterances and motion verbs (and their ratios) produced by children did not differ across language groups.</p>
<sec id="section11-0142723713490599">
<title>Motion verb categories</title>
<p>Analyses were carried out in two different ways. First, the number of tokens of each verb category was divided by the number of tokens of motion verbs overall in order to account for interactions that differed in number of utterances. Though these data are presented in proportions, the analyses were calculated on the arcsin transformed proportions in order to account for the restricted range and variance of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723713490599">Hogg &amp; Craig, 1995</xref>).

<title>Relation between parent and child uses of motion verbs</title>
<p>Similar patterns appear in the language of parents and children. Correlations were calculated between parent and child verb use to see whether the patterns stemmed from similar uses between parents and their children or from general language patterns across families only. Positive correlations were found between parents and children on the ratios of manner verb tokens, general path verb tokens and specific path verb tokens to overall motion verbs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0142723713490599">Table 5</xref>). Similarly, parents’ manner verb, general path verb and specific path verb types were positively correlated with children’s uses of the same types of verbs. There were no significant positive relationships across verb categories. In contrast, negative correlations were found between parents’ and children’s uses of different categories of verbs: parent specific path verbs (types and tokens) and children’s general path verbs (types and tokens) and manner verb types, parent general path verbs (types and tokens) and children’s specific path verbs (types and tokens). Thus, there was a fairly close relation between parent verb use and children’s verb use, both in terms of types and tokens, within categories of motion verbs.</p>

<title>Motion verb syntax</title>
<p>Analyses of the motion verb syntax provide further insight into the ways members of different language and age groups went about expressing motion events. Because numbers become very small (when discussing those utterances that included each form of expression, ranging in number from 0 to 37 between individuals), primarily percentages without inferential statistics are presented here.</p>
<sec id="section18-0142723713490599">
<title>Parent syntax</title>
<p>Overall, parents used manner modifiers with motion verbs in 3% of utterances in Spanish and 1% in English, which did not result in a significant difference. However, Spanish-speaking parents used bare verbs 48% of the time compared to English speakers’ 11%, <italic>t</italic>(22.62) = 6.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Like with other adult samples, Spanish-speaking parents used manner modifiers when a specific path verb was present (52%) but also when a general path verb appeared (32%). Bare verbs appeared in their use mostly when the verb was specific path (80%) but also occasionally when a general path verb appeared (16%). On the other hand, English-speaking parents mostly used manner modifiers with general path verbs (77%) and sometimes with manner verbs (23%). Their use of bare verbs was mainly when the verb was general path (69%), but also when it was manner (26%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0142723713490599">
<title>Child syntax</title>
<p>Spanish learners did not use manner modifiers more than English learners did (5% vs 4%), though they did use more bare verbs than did English learners (53% vs 12%), <italic>t</italic>(20.68) = 4.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Spanish speakers used manner modifiers in ways similar to their parents (30% with general path, 50% with specific path and 20% with manner verbs). And it was mostly specific path verbs that appeared bare (67%) with some general path verbs (20%) and manner verbs (10%) as well. English speakers, like their parents, only used manner modifiers with general path verbs. Their use of bare verbs was primarily in sentences containing general path verbs (51%), but also some manner (35%) and specific path (14%). Recall the only specific path verb appearing in English was ‘fall down’.</p>
<p>There is apparent correspondence between parent and child syntax, though English-speaking children seemed more likely to use bare verbs in somewhat broader contexts than did their parents.</p>
<p>The final analysis examined whether the different language groups were more or less likely to include manner information in any form. Previous research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713490599">Naigles et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723713490599">Hohenstein et al. (2006)</xref> found, when taking into consideration either manner verb or manner modifiers, the inclusion of manner information did not differ between Spanish and English speakers. Similarly, in these data, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0142723713490599">Table 6</xref> shows that there were no significant differences between different groups of parents or children, <italic>t</italic>s(41) &lt; 1.16, n.s. As in previous research, the amount of manner information is relatively equal when both the category of verb and the manner modifying information is taken into account. However, the overall amount of manner information seems to be lower in this study than it was for either of those previous studies. For instance, in Hohenstein et al., participants mentioned manner of motion in 74–95% of the elicitations. However, in this study the most any participant group (child or adult) mentioned manner was 17% of the time. It is possible that the task had some effect on the amount that participants found it useful or necessary to mention manner of motion, a topic that will be returned to in the discussion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In support of the first and third predictions, English-speaking parents and children generally used more manner of motion verbs (tokens and types) than did Spanish speakers. In addition, both parents and children used more specific path verbs (types and tokens) in Spanish than in English, supporting the second and third predictions. Somewhat unexpectedly, English speakers also used more general path verbs than did Spanish speakers, both in terms of types and tokens. Unsurprisingly, correlations between parents’ and children’s uses of the different verb categories were strong. Syntactic differences were comparable to the lexical differences in adult and child speech. Supporting predictions two and three, bare verbs were much more common in Spanish speakers’ speech but Spanish speakers did not use more manner modifiers, which did not support the first prediction. Thus, there were several language differences in motion event speech in this study, both for children and adults.</p>
<sec id="section21-0142723713490599">
<title>Influence of parent language on child language</title>
<p>While in this study English-speaking parents used more general path motion event verbs with children than would be suggested by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713490599">Naigles et al., 1998</xref>), this is not because children are incapable of understanding and using more specific verbs. In fact, the youngest children in this study were 3 years old, and fully capable of using both manner and path verbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723713490599">Hohenstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713490599">Oscaliskan &amp; Slobin, 1999</xref>). However, they have not yet acquired the language typical patterns shown in adult language. It may be that children, in part, do not display these speech patterns because the language they engage in with adults around them does not include the same variety of manner or path verbs that is found in language to adults and older children.</p>
<p>Of course, this study has not shown any reason to believe that children learn motion event language later than some other types of language <italic>because</italic> the language they are exposed to is not typologically like that of adults. However, this study does demonstrate the <italic>potential</italic> for children to acquire different language patterns over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723713490599">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723713490599">Hohenstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723713490599">Maguire et al., 2010</xref>) through the ways that parents address their children. Children may be receiving different cues about motion event language from the way their parents speak, depending upon the children’s age. To investigate this, children in this sample were divided into those under and over 5 years of age to be compared using a 2(Language) × 2(Age) ANOVA. It must be noted that the <italic>n</italic>s are small and a larger sample will be required to examine this question. However, this analysis revealed that Spanish-speaking parents used specific path verb tokens at a proportionately greater rate with older than with younger children and more than English-speaking parents did, <italic>F</italic>(1, 21) = 38.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .65;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142723713490599">1</xref></sup> whereas English-speaking parents used manner verb tokens at a marginally proportionally higher level with older children than with younger children and more than did Spanish-speaking parents, <italic>F</italic>(1, 21) = 3.72, <italic>p</italic> = .067, η<sup>2</sup> = .15. Future studies may help to clear up whether this pattern has a causal effect on the development of children’s motion event expressions. For instance, it would be useful to carry out a similar study, following parents and children longitudinally, starting from when children were in the second year of life, which would provide a way of linking parent and child language in a time-lagged fashion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0142723713490599">
<title>Variation in expression of manner information</title>
<p>One interesting finding from this study is that, although English and Spanish speakers used manner information in similar amounts, they did so to a much lower extent than did speakers in previous studies. In the adult studies, both Spanish and English monolinguals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713490599">Naigles et al., 1998</xref>) as well as bilinguals in both languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723713490599">Hohenstein et al., 2006</xref>) mentioned manner, either in the verb or in a post-verbal phrase, most of the time. However, in this study of parent–child speech, there was relatively little manner information. There are at least two explanations for why this might have occurred. First, parents may use less manner information with their children in order to simplify the language directed to them. However, if this were the case, based on these data, it would seem that even 7-year-olds ought to have less inclination to use and learn manner verbs in English. Yet, research has shown that by this age, English-learning children have ample facility with manner of motion verbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723713490599">Hohenstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713490599">Ozcaliskan &amp; Slobin, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The other possibility is that the context of playing a board game may limit the amount parents and children feel it necessary to mention manner. Previous studies have typically measured the kinds of motion verbs and syntax that are used when elicited in pseudo-experimental settings with specific stimuli. Some of these include wordless picture books (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723713490599">Berman &amp; Slobin, 1994</xref>), whereas others used videos of people engaged in motion events (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713490599">Naigles et al., 1998</xref>). Unlike those studies, this one made use of people’s incidental motion event expressions while playing a game, an activity that may have made parents and children less aware of the manner of motion overall. Even so, as a group, English speakers managed to find a total of 17 manner verbs in this context and Spanish speakers only came up with 6. Certainly, further studies with a greater variety of settings to look at motion event language (e.g. sporting events, journeys) would provide more information about the kinds of language that are directed towards children of different ages in different languages.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study has demonstrated differences across the language environments of children learning a satellite-framed and a verb-framed language at a point in development when children are solidifying their learning of motion event verbs. Moreover, this study suggests potentials for learning from adult speech with a group of children who are much older than most in child-directed speech studies. Furthermore, it has shown this in a study of motion event language, which has not been looked at in the child-directed speech literature previously. Spanish-learning children and their parents used a higher proportion of specific path verbs than did their English counterparts. In contrast, English speakers used a higher proportion of manner verbs and general path verbs. While not demonstrating any causal relationship between what children experience and their speech production, at the very least, this study shows that children have the opportunity to learn about motion event language typology through conversation. However, further study is needed to determine the exact relationship between parent language and children’s comprehension and production.</p>

<p>Several children were excluded from these analyses because of the presence of siblings, sometimes near the age of the other group (e.g. 3-year-olds with a 6-year-old sibling) in order to limit talk that was directed at children of multiple ages.</p>
