<p><bold>Japan Report: Nuclear Crisis Was “Man-Made.”</bold> By Yoko Wakatsuki and Jethro Mullen, CNN, July 5, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-05/asia/world_asia_japan-fukushima-report_1_fukushima-daiichi-fukushima-residents-tepco?_s=PM:ASIA">http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-05/asia/world_asia_japan-fukushima-report_1_fukushima-daiichi-fukushima-residents-tepco?_s=PM:ASIA</ext-link>. A report by the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission concluded that the nuclear crisis was a “man-made disaster . . . that unfolded as a result of collusion between the facility’s operator, regulators, and the government.” The report attributes much of the blame to Japanese culture, outlining errors and willful negligence at the plant before the earthquake and tsunami, and a flawed response in the hours, days, and weeks that followed. It also offers recommendations and encourages the nation’s parliament to “thoroughly debate and deliberate” the suggestions.</p>
<p><bold>How Steve Jobs’ Love of Simplicity Fueled a Design Revolution</bold>. By Walter Isaacson, <italic>Smithsonian Magazine</italic>, September 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/How-Steve-Jobs-Love-of-Simplicity-Fueled-A-Design-Revolution-166251016.html">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/How-Steve-Jobs-Love-of-Simplicity-Fueled-A-Design-Revolution-166251016.html</ext-link>. The author describes Steve Jobs’ obsession with functional design. Particularly telling is a quote from Jobs: “It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.” The article describes the iterative and demanding process utilized by Jobs, who is described as “consciously positioning himself at intersections of the arts and technology.” The author describes the need for collaboration among designers, developers, engineers, and manufacturers.</p>
<p><bold>Air Force Insiders Foresaw F-22 Woes</bold>. By Eric Talmadge, <italic>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</italic>, September 27, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajc.com/ap/ap/aerospace/ap-impact-air-force-insiders-foresaw-f-22-woes/nSM5t/">http://www.ajc.com/ap/ap/aerospace/ap-impact-air-force-insiders-foresaw-f-22-woes/nSM5t/</ext-link>. The F-22, the U.S. Air Force’s premier fighter ($190 million each), recently returned to flying (with altitude and range restrictions) after being grounded for several months following a fatal crash and reports of breathing problems from aircrew and two pilots on CBS’s <italic>60 Minutes.</italic> The Associated Press uncovered documents indicating that Air Force officials were aware of the potential problem as early as 2002 but did not fund efforts for a corrective initiative. A back-up oxygen system and an upgraded valve should be implemented by the end of 2012. The following comments should be noted by members of the human-systems integration community: “Over the past 20 years, the capabilities and expertise of the USAF to perform the critical function of Human Systems Integration have become insufficient,” said Gregory Martin, leader of the study into its oxygen problems for the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board investigation that began in 2011, to the House subcommittee. Martin also said that the program’s decline cost the Air Force expertise on life support systems, altitude physiology, and pilot health and safety. He said that was compounded by “inadequate research, knowledge, and experience for the unique operating environment of the F-22.”</p>
<p><bold>The Astronaut Question: In the Age of Robots, What’s Left for Astronauts to Do?</bold> By James R. Chiles, <italic>Air &amp; Space</italic>, September 2012, pp. 28–33, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/The-Astronaut-Question-">http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/The-Astronaut-Question-</ext-link>. This article discusses the future role of astronauts in space. Insights include a discussion of the “4 As”: authority, automation, autonomy (including sliding autonomy with adjustable levels depending on the task and events), and awareness (situation awareness). On the basis of comments from a number of astronauts, he describes situations in which astronaut intervention “saved the day.” The argument is not antirobot; one astronaut said, “There’s nothing worse than wasting men on doing robotics stuff.” The roles of both humans and robots in any future space exploration will be determined by the mission’s objectives, tempered by budgetary constraints.</p>
<p><bold>Tiredness &amp; Human Error Led to Wrong Procedure, Consultant Tells Medical Inquiry</bold>. <italic>RTE News</italic>, Ireland, September 18, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0918/expert-gives-evidence-at-medical-inquiry.html">http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0918/expert-gives-evidence-at-medical-inquiry.html</ext-link>. A tongue-tie operation was mistakenly performed on a 2-and-a-half-year-old girl instead of an operation to release an upper lip frenulum. The procedure was incorrectly labeled by a consultant, and “the hospital computer system only allowed one code for a number of possible types of the procedure.” Also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-07-19/hospitals-preventable-errors-report/56343348/1">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-07-19/hospitals-preventable-errors-report/56343348/1</ext-link>.</p>
