<abstract>
<p>The fire resistance of composite floor systems depends on the interaction of the concrete slab with steel beams. To evaluate the fire resistance of composite floor systems, the temporal and spatial variations of temperatures must be accurately determined. The temperature profiles in a concrete section are a function of concrete thermophysical properties and boundary conditions. However, there can be considerable uncertainty in their values. A sensitivity study using an orthogonal full-factorial design approach was conducted to determine which of these parameters most significantly influenced the thermal response of the slab. The time–temperature data from a Cardington fire test were used to validate a heat transfer model of a representative section of the composite floor system. The orthogonal factorial design analysis indicated that the thermal behavior of the concrete slab is most sensitive to, in decreasing order, thermal conductivity, effective emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficient at the exposed surface, and enthalpy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The behavior of a composite steel–concrete floor system under fire exposure is an important problem. The fire behavior of such construction depends on the interaction of the concrete slab with steel beams, shear studs, and steel reinforcement. Recent National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112463678">1</xref></sup> has shown that the structural behavior of these composite floor systems at elevated temperatures is greatly influenced by the thermal behavior of structural components. It may be noted here that while the structural steel beams and the concrete slabs are exposed directly to fire, the shear studs are heated indirectly. Although there have been a number of fire tests conducted to study the thermal behavior of steel components, there is considerably less information available in the literature on the time-dependent temperature profile in the concrete slab. The recent investigation by NIST of World Trade Center (WTC) building 7<sup>1</sup> concluded that thermal expansion resulting from fire exposure led to the eventual structural failure. Therefore, the temporal and spatial variations of temperature in the structural members during fire exposure must be fully understood. This is also necessary in applying a performance-based approach in fire resistance design of structures. Predicting structural behavior under fire requires an accurate knowledge of the thermal behavior of structural elements when exposed to a structurally damaging fire. There are uncertainties in computed results because of variability in the values used for key input parameters in the heat transfer model. While analyzing the effects of uncertainty on the computed results, it is important to identify key input parameters and determine how sensitive predicted temperatures are to the variability in these input parameters. Effects of variability of these key parameters can be understood by conducting an appropriate sensitivity study. Such a study can be undertaken on a validated numerical model using an experimental design technique. Orthogonal factorial design technique can be used to conduct such a study.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop a heat transfer model and to validate this model by comparing time-dependent predicted temperatures in a steel beam and concrete slab of a composite floor system with experimental data obtained from a fire resistance test conducted at Cardington, United Kingdom. Finally, the critical factors that affect the thermal profile in the concrete slab are investigated using an orthogonal factorial design approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, the objectives of this study are to (a) model the heating behavior of a representative section of a composite floor system when exposed to a real fire as encountered in the Cardington test, (b) validate the numerical model by comparing the predicted temperature results with experimental data, and (c) determine the key factors that affect the thermal profile in the concrete slab by using an orthogonal factorial design approach. The sensitivity study using orthogonal factorial design technique shows that uncertainties in fire parameters (concrete effective emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficient at exposed surface) and concrete thermal conductivity have strong influence on concrete temperatures. Additionally, the study highlights that interaction effects among key input parameters need to be understood to determine how their uncertainties influence concrete temperatures in the composite floor assembly during a fire.</p>

<title>Description of the Cardington test</title>
<p>The Cardington Test 1<sup>2</sup> was conducted on a composite floor assembly from the seventh floor of an eight-story frame. A single UB305 × 165 × 40 restrained beam and the surrounding concrete floor spanning about 9 m between a pair of columns were heated using a gas-fired furnace. Lightweight concrete was used for the slab. The gas-fired furnace was constructed on the sixth floor to heat the specified structure between the two columns. The dimensions of the furnace used are as follows: 8 m in length, 3 m in width, and 2 m in height. The columns and end connections were not subjected to heating. The steel was unprotected. During the fire test, the beam was heated over the middle 8 m of its 9 m length at a rate ranging from 3°C/min to 10°C/min until a temperature in the range of 800°C–900°C was reached through the profile of the beam section. The voids in the region between the top flange of the beam and the underside of the concrete slab were filled with mineral wool. This was done to reduce the temperature gradient through the steel beam. The temperatures in the steel beam were recorded at various locations along the steel beam. The temperatures through the slab depth were measured at four points in the test compartment.</p>

<title>Heat transfer model</title>
<p>The analytical model was built in half symmetry. A type “B” wide roof decking was used for metal deck. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112463678">Figure 1</xref> shows an elevation view of the model. The cross section of the shear stud is assumed to be a square with an area equal to the cross-sectional area of a cylindrical shear stud of 9.525 mm radius to obtain a regular mapped finite element mesh of the entire model. The temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of steel (thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity) are taken from Ref. 3. The concrete thermophysical properties (thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity) are taken from Ref. 4. The density and heat capacity values were used to compute temperature-dependent enthalpies of concrete.</p>

<p>A finite element model of a composite steel–concrete floor section was built in ANSYS 12.1 software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112463678">5</xref></sup> using eight-noded solid thermal elements as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112463678">Figure 2</xref>. (Certain commercial software or materials are identified to describe a procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation, endorsement, or implication by NIST that the software or materials are necessarily the best available for the purpose.) Note that the model extends to half the furnace width (e.g. 1.5 m) in the <italic>x</italic> direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112463678">Figure 2</xref>). The profiled steel metal deck was not specifically modeled since the metal deck is only 0.9 mm thick when the slab is about 130 mm thick. Also, Lamont et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup> results did not show a significant difference in the temperature prediction in the slab when a metal deck was specifically modeled in comparison with the case when the metal deck was not included. In order to simulate the furnace heating conducted in Cardington test, the exposed surfaces of the composite floor system were subjected to convective and radiative heat exchanges. In order to accomplish this, surface effect elements were generated in ANSYS and they were overlaid on the exposed surfaces of the solid elements. Two types of these surface elements were created: one for convective heat exchange and the other for the radiative heat exchange. All these surface elements were created with a particular reference node representing the furnace heating as conducted in the Cardington test. Appropriate convective heat transfer coefficients and emissivity values were used while defining these surface elements. View factor effects in the radiation heat transfer were not considered, and therefore, view factor values were set to 1 for all elements since the furnace was not explicitly modeled in this study. Instead, furnace heating was included through an imposed time–temperature curve (as obtained in the Cardington test) with the use of this reference node while generating these surface elements. In other words, a Dirichlet-type boundary condition (prescribed temperature as a function of time) was assigned to this reference node. A convective heat exchange boundary condition was used for heat transfer from the unexposed surface of the slab top to the ambient atmosphere.</p>

<p>Adiabatic conditions were maintained at each end of the model in the longitudinal direction (<italic>z</italic> direction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112463678">Figure 2</xref>). As mentioned earlier, the voids between top flange of the beam and underside of the decked floor were insulated from direct heat exposure in the Cardington test (see section “Description of the Cardington test”). Therefore, these regions were also insulated from direct fire exposure in the ANSYS heat transfer model. This was accomplished by not creating any convective or radiative surface effect elements on these surfaces.</p>
<p>The effective emissivities for radiative heat exchange depend on many factors such as flame emissivity and compartment walls. For the surface emissivity of the steel member, a base value of 0.7 is used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup> For concrete, a base value of 0.6 is used for effective emissivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup> A convective boundary condition with a film coefficient of 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K and ambient temperature of 25°C was used on the top (unexposed) surface of the concrete slab. This value of the film coefficient was suggested by Lamont et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup> and other researchers. The same convective heat exchange boundary condition was used at the far end of the model along the <italic>x</italic> direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112463678">Figure 2</xref>) corresponding to a value of <italic>x</italic> equal to 1.5 m.</p>

<title>Concrete slab temperatures</title>
<p>The temperature data obtained from the simulation were compared with experimentally recorded temperatures from the Cardington Test 1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734904112463678">2</xref></sup> This comparison was made for the thermocouples positioned in the fluted region of the slab. The experimental data are those that were obtained at location “B1” as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112463678">Figure 4</xref> of Ref. 2. This location is 700 mm away from the beam centerline. Thermocouples were placed near both the exposed and unexposed surfaces and at 20, 40, and 55 mm from the unexposed surface into the concrete. Therefore, average ANSYS temperatures at these depth levels for the fluted region 700 mm away from the beam centerline were used for comparison with the experimental data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112463678">Figure 5</xref> shows a comparison of the simulated and experimental temperatures at several locations through the thickness of the slab. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112463678">Figure 5</xref> also shows computed temperatures for a location 71.1 mm from the unexposed surface, which is located very close to the exposed surface. It can be seen that the ANSYS temperatures at the exposed surface (e.g. “75 mm, ANSYS” legend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112463678">Figure 5</xref>) follow the furnace heating trend. The node at 71.1 mm from the unexposed surface shows a gradually slower heating toward the end of the test (characteristic of thermal behavior of an interior node). The measured temperatures mostly lie between these two computed temperatures. This indicates the difficulty in capturing the true measured temperatures at the exposed surface. This is because of the difficulty in positioning a thermocouple exactly at the exposed surface.</p>

</fig>
<p>It can be seen that there is a good match in the temperatures of the interior locations within the slab. However, the agreement is not as good at the exposed and unexposed surfaces, especially during the later part of the test. Potential contributors to this discrepancy are as follows: (a) the thermocouples cannot be exactly on the surface, (b) moisture in concrete can play a significant role on the concrete thermal conductivity, and (c) the convective boundary condition on the unexposed surface may need to be represented more accurately. In the ANSYS analysis, <italic>h</italic> was assumed to be 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K at the exposed surface following Lamont et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concrete temperatures will vary as a function of the thermophysical properties of concrete, the heat diffusion in steel, and the convective and radiative heat transfer in fire. According to Phan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112463678">4</xref></sup> the density of the concrete does not vary appreciably in the temperature range typically associated with common fires and can be assumed to be constant. The thermal conductivity is a key parameter that controls how heat diffuses in a body. Both thermal conductivity and heat capacity of concrete are influenced by the type of concrete (normal, lightweight, or high strength) and the moisture level. Moisture migration is not considered in this model. The latent heat of vaporization of water in concrete should be included in the heat capacity function. If the heat capacity is increased, the temperature rise will be lower for a given amount of heat.</p>

<title>Sensitivity study of concrete slab temperatures</title>
<p>There is uncertainty associated with many of the key input parameters (thermophysical properties, emissivity, and heat transfer coefficients associated with heating due to fire) needed for performing robust calculations for heat transfer during fire. Sensitivity studies need to be conducted to determine the effect of key input parameters on computed temperatures of structural elements in a fire. Such a study can help to determine the critical parameters that could contribute the most toward variability of the temperatures of structural elements.</p>

<title>Sensitivity study of concrete slab temperatures using orthogonal factorial design</title>
<p>In experimental design, experiments are usually conducted to provide information on an unknown response surface of a system, which depends on a number of factors. If there are <italic>k</italic> factors, the objective of the experiment is to determine the relative importance of <italic>k</italic> factors on the response. In the so-called one-factor-at-a-time (1FAT) approach, <italic>k</italic> experiments are conducted where each factor is changed from a baseline value to an alternate value. It has been shown that such an approach can result in estimates that are biased and imprecise (pp. 312–313, 510–513).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112463678">11</xref></sup> Significant features of the response can be missed if one factor is changed at a time as opposed to all factors changed together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734904112463678">12</xref></sup> For such an estimate to have relevance, it needs to be assumed that the effect would be the same at other settings of other variables, with no interaction effect between the variables.</p>
<p>The main effect of a factor is the average of all the effects of that factor. The main effect plot shows the average response for each setting of every factor. For each factor, the difference between average responses corresponding to two settings is the main effect of that factor as one moves from one level to the other. All the observations are used to calculate the main effects for a factor.</p>
<p>The two level settings represent typical low and high values of the factor and are provided from expert knowledge in the field of study. In the main effect plot, steep lines (with higher slopes) indicate important factors, while nearly horizontal lines (with shallow slopes) demonstrate unimportant factors. A 2<sup>4</sup> full factorial design was considered in this study. These four factors are expected to influence concrete temperatures. For each factor, two levels of values (minimum and maximum) were considered following a simple experiment laid out by Box et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112463678">11</xref></sup> (pp. 307–308). Lamont et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup> performed a sensitivity study (1FAT) on concrete temperatures considering a number of factors: density, specific heat, thermal conductivity, moisture content of concrete, evaporation temperature, convective heat transfer coefficient at the exposed surface, convective heat transfer at the unexposed surface, effective emissivity, and thickness of concrete slab. The moisture content of concrete and evaporation temperatures are not included in this study. Based on a review of Lamont et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112463678">6</xref></sup> article and review of literature, it was determined that the four most important factors to be considered are emissivity (A); thermal conductivity, K (B); convective heat transfer coefficient at the exposed surface, <italic>h<sub>coef</sub></italic> (C); and enthalpy of the concrete (D). Enthalpy is the product of density and heat capacity. An effective heat capacity of concrete includes the heat of vaporization associated with evaporation of moisture at temperatures between 100°C and 120°C. The enthalpy versus temperature curve used here includes both density and effective heat capacity. Following minimum and maximum values used by Lamont (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734904112463678">Table 2</xref> of Ref. 6) as well as values used by other researchers, the levels of values for the four factors were chosen as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112463678">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Calculation of main effects of factors</title>
<p>For each run, the response (temperature) at 75 mm (Yield 1), 55 mm (Yield 2), 40 mm (Yield 3), 20 mm (Yield 4) from unexposed surface, and at unexposed surface (Yield 5) at 1 and 2 h into the fire are obtained from the numerical model. These data are then used to compute the main effects of each factor and interaction effects among the factors. For example, the main effects of A at 75 mm (Yield 1) are computed as follows: (a) at higher level of A (+), the mean response is obtained by averaging the Yield 1 values in Column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112463678">Table 3</xref> for Runs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734904112463678">Table 2</xref>); (b) at lower levels of A (−), the mean response is obtained by averaging Yield 1 values in Column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112463678">Table 3</xref> for Runs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15; and (c) subtract the computed values in step (b) from those computed in step (a) to obtain the average mean effect.

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The thermal conductivity of concrete has a negligible influence on the response at the exposed surface, but its effect becomes pronounced at all other locations within the slab.

<p>The effects of these factors are more pronounced at 2 h than those at 1 h (notice that the scale on the <italic>y</italic>-axis is different for the two plots). However, the trends remain similar. Based on these observations, it appears that three factors govern the temperature inside the slab. However, both emissivity and convective heat transfer coefficients have significant effects on the temperature at the exposed surface and, consequently, on the subsequent heat transport into the slab through laws governed by Fourier’s heat conduction equations.</p>
<p>According to Box et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112463678">11</xref></sup> one needs to study both the main effects of the factor and the interaction effects among factors in order to fully discern the effects of the factors on the responses. This is because the study of main effects alone provides an incomplete influence of the factor on response, since one needs to capture whether the levels of other factors have influences on the responses.</p>

<p>Using normal theory assumptions, the estimated error (SE effect) can be used to produce reference <italic>t</italic> distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734904112463678">12</xref></sup> Under assumptions of normal distributions, it can be stated that 95% of the distribution will be contained within the interval ±<italic>t</italic><sub>5, 0.025</sub>× SE effect, where <italic>t</italic><sub>5, 0.025</sub> defined here can be obtained from a standard <italic>t</italic> table containing ordinates of <italic>t</italic> distribution with varying degrees of freedom. This interval for Yield 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112463678">Table 6</xref> is equal to ±2.57 × (0.72) = ±1.85. Such calculated values of ±<italic>t</italic><sub>5, 0.025</sub>× SE effect for all yields are shown in the last three rows of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112463678">Table 6</xref>. On this basis, the values of effects that are greater than the ±<italic>t</italic><sub>5, 0.025</sub>× SE effect values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112463678">Table 6</xref> demonstrate real effects and should therefore be included in consideration of effects. Those values of effects that satisfy this condition are marked in bold face in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112463678">Table 6</xref>. It can be noted that for most of the responses, the main effects of each factor as well as the interaction effects AB, AC, and BC can be considered significant. The interaction effect BD appears to be significant only for Yields 4 and 5.</p>
<p>The following comments can be made based on the data given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112463678">Table 6</xref>. For most of the responses (Yields 1, 2, and 3 for 1 h and Yields 1 and 2 for 2 h), an increase in the enthalpy values of concrete (D) will result in a decrease of 15.6°C at 75 mm, 11.5°C at 55 mm, and 9.7°C at 40 mm at 1 h into the fire. Since at 1 h the interaction effects BD are significant at 20 mm and at the unexposed surface, the effects of enthalpy at these locations cannot be determined independently. The interaction effect of enthalpy and thermal conductivity (BD) must be considered at these locations to ascertain the influence of enthalpy on temperature.</p>
<p>Since there are appreciable interactions involving AB, AC, and BC, the influence of these factors need to be investigated with the use of contrast diagrams as explained below. As an example, let us study the responses at 55 mm (Yield 2) and 20 mm (Yield 4) at 2 h into the fire. Using response data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112463678">Table 3</xref> and factors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734904112463678">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0734904112463678">Table 7</xref> is constructed. For example, for lower levels (−) of factor A, the average response corresponding to the lower levels of factor B (−) at 55 mm (Yield 2) is 214.2 (average of Runs 1, 5, 9, and 13 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112463678">Table 3</xref>). Other computed values are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0734904112463678">Table 7</xref>.</p>

<title>Emissivity–thermal conductivity interaction (AB)</title>
<p>For response 2 (at 55 mm), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0734904112463678">Table 7</xref> shows that at lower thermal conductivity (B) values, an increase in the emissivity values results in an increase of 31.08°C (245.28 − 214.2), while the same increase is 74.45°C (365.66 − 291.21) at higher thermal conductivity (B) values. Therefore, we can say that at higher thermal conductivity values, an increase in the emissivity values has a much greater influence on the response in the concrete slab temperature at 55 mm from the unexposed surface. This is shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734904112463678">Figure 7</xref>. Similar effects for Yield 4 (20 mm) are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734904112463678">Figure 7</xref>. The corresponding changes are 9.34 (82.55 − 73.21) at lower thermal conductivity and 39.57 (198.36 − 158.79) for the case of Response 4. So, the interaction effects are much stronger (higher slopes) for Response 2 than for Response 4. This is expected since effect of emissivity is more pronounced near the exposed surface and it diminishes toward the unexposed surface of the concrete slab. Another indication of the fact that there are different levels of interaction between emissivity and thermal conductivity is that slopes of the curves for lower and higher levels of conductivity are different.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<list id="list2-0734904112463678" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>A heat transfer model for a composite floor system section was developed in ANSYS to investigate thermal profile in steel and concrete during fire resistance test conducted at Cardington.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Average computed temperatures for the top and bottom flanges of the steel beam matched reasonably well with the recorded temperatures. The temperatures computed at several locations in the flute region of the slab also matched recorded temperatures.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>This validated numerical model was used to conduct a sensitivity study to understand the influence of key factors (e.g. thermophysical properties of concrete, emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficients associated with a fire) on computed temperatures of concrete. A sensitivity study using 2<sup>4</sup> orthogonal factorial design approach was conducted.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The orthogonal factorial design study showed the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0734904112463678" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainties in concrete emissivity and convective heat exchange parameters have most influence on concrete temperatures at exposed surface, and this influence gradually diminishes inside the slab.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainties in thermal conductivity have strongest effect on temperatures in the interior region of the slab.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Enthalpy of concrete has an inverse effect on concrete temperatures as demonstrated by the main effect (an increase in enthalpy results in lower concrete temperatures).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There are considerable interactions between concrete effective emissivity and concrete thermal conductivity, concrete effective emissivity and convective heat transfer coefficient at exposed surface, thermal conductivity of concrete and convective heat transfer coefficient at exposed surface, and thermal conductivity of concrete and enthalpy of concrete:
<list id="list4-0734904112463678" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainty in concrete effective emissivity has more influence on concrete temperatures at higher level of concrete thermal conductivity than those at lower level of concrete thermal conductivity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainty in concrete effective emissivity has more influence on concrete temperatures at lower values of convective heat transfer coefficient at the exposed surface than those at higher values of convective heat transfer coefficient at the exposed surface.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainty in concrete thermal conductivity has similar effects on responses at both lower and higher values of convective heat transfer coefficient at exposed surface.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainty in concrete thermal conductivity has similar effects on responses at both lower and higher values of concrete enthalpy.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
</list></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Levels of factors (e.g. the variability in the parameters) in the orthogonal factorial design study should be determined with the help of experts in the field as values used could mask effects of other factors not considered adequately in this study.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The analysis shows that the thermal behavior of the concrete slab in a fire is most sensitive, in decreasing order, to the concrete thermal conductivity, the concrete effective emissivity, the convective heat transfer coefficient at the exposed surface, and the concrete enthalpy.</p>
