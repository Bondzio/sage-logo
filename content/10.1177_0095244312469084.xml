<p>The present invention relates to a method of producing a flexible elastomeric composite polyurethane skin wherein a polyurethane reaction mixture is sprayed onto a mold surface and the polyurethane reaction mixture is allowed to cure to produce the skin layer. The polyurethane reaction mixture is composed of components comprising at least an isocyanate component, isocyanate-reactive components, and a catalyst component; the isocyanate component is composed of at least one isocyanate having at least two NCO-groups that are not directly attached to an aromatic group. The catalyst component is substantially free of lead, which leads to a lower flexibility. In accordance with the invention, the flexibility of the polyurethane skin is increased by means of at least one flexibilizer that reduces the flexural modulus of the skin and that comprises at least one isocyanate-reactive group. The flexibilizer is preferably a monofunctional flexibilizer that comprises only one isocyanate-reactive group.</p>

<p>An electrically conductive, fully vulcanized, thermoplastic elastomer, and preparation method thereof. The fully vulcanized, thermoplastic elastomer is produced by a one-time melting and blending of cross-linking rubber particles having an average particle diameter of 0.02–1 μm, carbon nanotubes acting as the electrically conductive filler and thermoplastic resin. The weight ratio of rubber particles to thermoplastic resin is 30:70 to 75:25; setting the total weight of rubber particles and thermoplastic resin as 100 units, the weight of the electrically conductive filler is 0.3–10 units. The electrically conductive, fully vulcanized, thermoplastic elastomer thus produced has low quantity of electrically conductive filler and can be produced by conventional rubber and plastic processing methods. The elastomer can also be used as decorative material for electronic manufacturing devices, tools, electronic instruments, meter casings, and dust-free workshops that require being free of static electricity, electromagnetic interference, and dust.</p>

<p>A manufacturing method of polyetherester resins is provided to improve heat resistance and lower contents. A manufacturing method of polyetherester resins comprises the following steps: manufacturing a prepolymer by transesterification reacting dicarboxylate or dicarboxylic acid with diol; manufacturing a polyetherester elastomeric resin by reacting polycondensation reaction after adding antioxidant to the prepolymer; and solid-phase polymerizing the polyetherester elastomeric resin. In the prepolymer manufacturing step, a polyol is added when the ester interchange rate is at 80–93%. In the polyetherester elastomeric resin manufacturing step, an antioxidant is added while the prepolymer is transferred to the polycondensation reactor.</p>
