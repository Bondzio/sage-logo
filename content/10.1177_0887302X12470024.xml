During the early 1960s, a major shift occurred within C&amp;T, from domestic science to one focused on industry. This conceptual paper takes an updated approach to discuss the relevance and uniqueness of C&amp;T at a time when universities face reorganization or adaptation. After reviewing the scientific nature of C&amp;T, the authors defined C&amp;T as the science of investigating the satisfaction processes of humans' clothing needs and wants. These satisfaction processes are described and classified by hypotheses, theories, generalizations, and/or laws, through scientific methods built from both logics of discovery and justification. Therefore, the authors argue that C&amp;T are closely linked with human science units because of its ultimate goal --human satisfaction of clothing needs and wants. More importantly, the authors argue the clothing satisfaction processes occur through supply chain management, from history and forecasting to retailing and distribution, in the global marketplace. The global supply chain management framework of C&amp;T offers homes to all types of research, creative, and educational activities that C&amp;T scholars conduct every day, and demonstrates how each component is inter-linked with other components. Finally, visions for the future of C&amp;T are offered if the model is adopted, and the authors suggest further conversations about the nature and domain of C&amp;T.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>discipline</kwd><kwd>clothing</kwd><kwd>textiles</kwd><kwd>science</kwd><kwd>domain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0887302X12470024"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clothing and Textiles (C&amp;T) was established as an academic discipline in higher education more than 100 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12470024">Parsons, 2000</xref>). During the early years, C&amp;T was one of the disciplines housed within Home Economics, whose mission has been to advocate for and strengthen the economic, social, and psychological well-being of individuals, families, and society through education (International Federation of Home Economics, 2005). With the establishment of the Morrill Act of 1862, C&amp;T, as part of Home Economics, gained the strength within society as one of the most viable disciplines in higher education until the first part of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12470024">Niehof, 2011</xref>).</p><p>As societies change and industrialize, the nature of C&amp;T has also changed. Originally, C&amp;T focused on women’s home activities related to C&amp;Ts, such as clothing construction and laundering (Chowdhary &amp; Meacham, 1983–1984). By the 1960s and 1970s, social and psychological aspects of clothing were added as formal courses and research topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12470024">Roach-Higgins &amp; Eicher, 1992</xref>). Today, C&amp;T includes design, product development, textiles, consumer behavior, history, forecasting, merchandising, marketing, retailing, and much more.</p><p>All of these changes make C&amp;T very different from its origins. These changes mainly reflect the shifts in C&amp;T production sources—from home to businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12470024">Dickerson, 1999</xref>). Through these shifts, more often than not, we see that the objective of clothing construction no longer seems to focus on satisfying clothing needs and wants of family members; rather the focus seems to be on profit maximization for C&amp;T businesses. The beneficiaries of clothing construction have also changed from sons and daughters to consumers and customers. C&amp;T businesses are interested in understanding these <italic>customers</italic>’ (as opposed to family members’) behavior and the psychology behind such behavior. Therefore, businesses invest a great deal of resources to develop new merchandising and marketing strategies. The content of C&amp;T research and education has also changed to accommodate such needs of businesses. Researchers show the evidence of these shifts, particularly during the latter part of the 20th century (Chowdhary &amp; Meacham, 1983–1984; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12470024">Laughlin &amp; Kean, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12470024">Oliver &amp; Mahony, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Although adapting to social change was necessary, some of the changes made to C&amp;T have resulted in negative outcomes—blurring the identity of C&amp;T as an independent and scientific discipline within higher education. In our opinion, today’s C&amp;T no longer appears to have one cohesive, clear identity—at least in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887302X12470024">1</xref></sup> Some programs were closed, merged with other programs, and even changed to become something new, mostly due to budget cuts and low number of students. In our opinion, consumer behavior, marketing, and retailing components seem very similar to those of business. Design aspects of curricula appear to be overlapping with research and curricula in arts, and clothing’s social psychology curricula seem similar to psychology. Although this multidisciplinary nature makes C&amp;T unique, it also raises a question on whether or not it would still remain a viable and justifiable academic discipline in future higher education.</p><p>In response to these unique challenges that C&amp;T is currently facing in higher education, we are initiating new dialogues through this article with an attempt to reassess the identity of C&amp;T. Between the two authors, we have over 57 years of experience in C&amp;Ts industries and education. As industry members, educators, and researchers in the United States, we have seen changes and shifts within the discipline as well as the unique challenges that C&amp;T have faced in the United States. Therefore, we believe our views reflect C&amp;T in the United States.</p><p>In this article, Clothing and Textiles with capitals C and T refers to an academic discipline in higher education and represents all types of academic programs/units related to clothing, apparel, fashion, and textiles found in today’s higher education. The examples of such academic programs found in the United States include (but are not limited to): “Design and Merchandising”; “Apparel Studies”; “Fashion Design and Retailing”; “Apparel and Textiles”; “Consumer and Family Studies”; “Fibers and Biopolymers”; “Fashion Studies”; “Textile and Apparel Management”; “Consumer, Apparel, and Retail Studies”; “Fashion Design”; “Fashion Marketing and Merchandising”; and/or “Textiles, Fashion, Merchandising and Design.” These programs belong to colleges of design, arts, business, agriculture, engineering, human sciences, human ecology, and/or human environmental sciences. The term <italic>clothing</italic>, with a small letter c, is used in this article to include all concepts of body covering, such as clothing, dress, apparel, adornments, body modifications, cloths, and so on. We understand the term <italic>dress</italic> has been proposed to be inclusive of body modifications and other supplements to the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12470024">Roach-Higgins &amp; Eicher, 1992</xref>). Other researchers prefer the term <italic>apparel</italic>. Different people have different foci and agendas; these terms are often interchanged with each other. However, the intent of this article is to use the term <italic>clothing</italic> as implied in the name of the discipline, C&amp;Ts, including all types of body covering activities and products.</p><p>Through this dialogue, we would like to have three major takeaways for readers. First, readers would be able to reevaluate <italic>who we are</italic> as a discipline and clearly see what we commonly share as academic professionals, even if we all have different unit names, research foci, and teaching emphases. This could help strengthen the core mission for professional organizations in our discipline, such as International Textile and Apparel Association (ITAA) in the United States. Through these reflections, second, we hope to be able to envision the future of our discipline, completely transformed from a discipline of home-based Home Economics into a global industry-based discipline still focused on the human factor. Through this vision, we hope to be able to picture what type of students we would train and what roles our students would play in the future C&amp;T industries. Finally, these visions for the future would also offer lessons to peer disciplines in other countries and help prepare for their futures in those countries. For these purposes, first, we start with the nature of C&amp;T as a scientific discipline. Next, we review the current situation of the environments in which C&amp;T lies. The global supply chain perspective is discussed as a new framework to define the domain of C&amp;T, followed by the proposed model of its domain. Future research and educational opportunities are presented and the article concludes with visions of the future for C&amp;T.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0887302X12470024"><title>C&amp;Ts as a Scientific Discipline</title><p>Before we envision the future of our discipline, we believe it is extremely important to evaluate <italic>who we are</italic> and clarify what we commonly share as academic professionals. Today, C&amp;T-related academic units are so fragmented and diversified, it is almost impossible to call ourselves by one simple term. Yet, we still gather annually at our professional conferences, such as ITAA, and exchange our teaching and research ideas and outcomes. What makes ITAA “our” organization and what do we commonly share? To answer these questions, we must define our discipline as a scientific discipline within the higher education communities first. Without this clear identity for our discipline, we will be constantly challenged on our existence as an independent academic unit offering unique educational content and opportunities.</p><p>Then, what is a science and what makes a science a science? To answer such a question, we review the basic nature of science and describe C&amp;T as a scientific discipline. Philosophers agree that science involves explaining, predicting, and understanding certain phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt, 2002</xref>). After reviewing hundreds of manuscripts, monographs, and books related to the nature of science, Shelby D. Hunt, a Marketing professor at Michigan State University, explains that most philosophers agree there are four basic characteristics of science. That is, all sciences (a) involve a distinctive subject matter; (b) describe and classify the structure and properties of that subject matter; (c) presume that there are underlying uniformities and regularities that science seeks to discover; and (d) employ scientific methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt, 2002</xref>). In the following, we discuss the detailed examination of each of the four basic characteristics of science in order to explain C&amp;T as a science.</p><p>First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt (2002</xref>, p. 20) and many philosophers argue that any science or a scientific discipline, must have “a distinct subject matter, a set of phenomena that serves as a focal point for investigation.” Hunt claims that the distinct subject matter of chemistry is <italic>substances</italic>, while that of marketing is <italic>transactions</italic>. This makes marketing different from economics, the focal point of which is <italic>allocation of scarce resources</italic>. That said, we raise the following questions: what is the distinct subject matter of C&amp;T? What type of phenomena do C&amp;T scholars commonly investigate? What creates distinct identities of C&amp;T from other sciences?</p><p>We believe that the focal point of our science is C&amp;Ts—one of the three basic necessities of human survival besides food and shelter—that we humans<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0887302X12470024">2</xref></sup> use to satisfy our needs and wants. During the early years, C&amp;T research and education were conducted to satisfy family members’ clothing needs and wants. As the industries develop, research has centered on business aspects of the industries. During this transition, humans have become consumers or customers of businesses. Therefore, research on consumer behavior, social/psychological aspects, and merchandising has become popular in C&amp;T. All of this research, both past and current, however, shares one focal point of investigation: how can individuals or businesses produce and consume C&amp;Ts to satisfy our needs and wants?</p><p>In this light, the distinct subject matter of C&amp;T can be said to be <italic>the process of</italic> <italic>satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants</italic>. The process of satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants is different from that of other goods and services. For example, clothing consumption is different from food consumption in that food disappears when it is eaten or consumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12470024">Winakor, 1969</xref>). Food can be eaten or consumed only once, and once it is consumed, it cannot be stored or restored for further use. Clothing consumption also differs from housing consumption in that the inventory and usage of housing is constant and the acquisition and disposal of housing occurs relatively infrequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12470024">Winakor, 1969</xref>). Therefore, clothing satisfaction processes are much more complicated, providing a wider range of different stages than those of food or housing. Furthermore, each stage of clothing consumption, from product information search, acquisition, usage, storage, and disposal to postdisposal evaluation, is experienced on a regular basis by everyone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12470024">Winakor, 1969</xref>).</p><p>In the statement of the distinct subject matter of C&amp;T—<italic>the process of</italic> <italic>satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants</italic>—needs refer to the essentials without which humans cannot live, while wants refer to the desires of something that humans like to have. Both needs and wants are shaped through various internal and external environments. Warm clothing in cold regions is necessary for humans to survive and, therefore, warm clothing in cold regions is a need; on the other hand, a high-end designer brand leather jacket can be wanted by a certain segment of humans with a desire to show off status or wealth. Some may purchase such clothing to satisfy their clothing needs and wants. Others may produce clothing on their own or acquire from other family members to satisfy their clothing needs and wants. In either case, humans satisfy their clothing needs and wants in many different ways, and C&amp;T research investigates all of these satisfaction phenomena.</p><p>In recent years, much research in C&amp;T has concentrated on <italic>transactions </italic>related to textile and clothing products.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0887302X12470024">3</xref></sup> Therefore, a great portion of C&amp;T research in the area of merchandising, consumer behavior, and marketing has been centered on transactional (or business) aspects of related businesses. Particularly, these studies share an assumption that humans are customers or consumers of related products and, therefore, an understanding of their needs and wants has become priority for the goals of sale and profit increases. This research trend has created blur between marketing and C&amp;T, resulting in some C&amp;T programs currently housed within the College of Business.</p><p>However, we argue that transactions of C&amp;Ts are not the only research topics in C&amp;T. C&amp;T research investigates all phenomena related to humans’ clothing satisfaction, such as production, consumption, and postconsumption that also may affect new production and consumption. Transactions are part of the consumption process. Furthermore, we use historic analysis to inform future human needs and wants. Consequently, C&amp;T research offers important implications for businesses, consumers, policy makers, nonprofit organizations, and humans ourselves. This distinct subject matter makes C&amp;T different from marketing, business, economics, psychology, sociology, arts, and other sciences. This distinct subject matter provides unified identity of C&amp;T scholars as we all share this particular focal point of investigation.</p><p>Next, philosophers of science also argue that a science must describe and classify the structure and properties of the subject matter based on the assumption that there are underlying uniformities and regularities among the phenomena that comprise its subject matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt, 2002</xref>). Hunt argues that just as chemistry has certain theories and generalizations on substance reaction, marketing also has certain theories, generalizations, and regularities among transactions made by humans. A plethora of consumer behavior research related to transactions supports the fact that there are uniformities and regularities in consumer transactions. For example, for the same quality, if the price of a particular item is lower in Company A than in Company B, consumers are most likely to choose Company A for their transactions. This preference can be used to predict future consumer behavior. Therefore, this particular consumer behavior theory explains, predicts, and helps in understanding consumers’ behavior. Hunt concludes that marketing satisfies these requirements of science.</p><p>Thus, we ask: Does C&amp;T research describe and classify the structure and properties of the subject matter (satisfaction processes of humans’ clothing needs and wants) based on the assumption that there are underlying uniformities and regularities among the phenomena that comprises its subject matter? Our answer to that question is, “Yes, it does.” There are underlying uniformities and regularities in meeting the ways in which humans satisfy their clothing needs and wants. For example, from the biological perspective, when the weather is cold, humans seek clothing that would produce multiple layers between the body and the outside in order to create and sustain warmth. This theory describes and classifies the structure and properties of the satisfaction process (i.e., wearing multiple layers of clothing) of humans’ biological needs of clothing in cold weather. From the design perspective, design scholarship investigates a systematic body of evidence through color theory, anthropometrics, esthetic theory, and so on. These theories suggest certain design elements, such as colors, shapes, and/or arts, and regularly affect how humans perceive/understand themselves as well as others. More often than not, these perceptions and understandings are expected to impact overall satisfaction and dissatisfaction of clothing consumption.</p><p>From the social perspective, we choose certain outfits to meet social expectations. When a college graduate is preparing for an interview for potential employment, we, as a society, expect him or her to wear a professional outfit that will be well received by the employment community. To satisfy such social expectations, an applicant may choose particular clothing and the society and community will decide whether the applicant’s choice of clothing is satisfactory or not. This feedback will then be used again for the applicant’s future clothing choice for similar occasions. Many theories in C&amp;T consumer research, design, social/psychological aspects, merchandising, and retailing show the evidence of underlying uniformities and regularities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0887302X12470024">4</xref></sup> Therefore, we conclude there are certain regularities in satisfaction processes of humans’ clothing needs and wants, and many theories have been discovered, proposed, verified, and concluded in C&amp;T. Therefore, C&amp;T research meets these criteria of science as well.</p><p>Finally, scientific methods used within scientific communities are in question for any discipline to be considered a science. Most philosophers of science argue that scientific methods must follow the <italic>logic of justification </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12470024">Kuhn, 1962</xref>). That is, scientific methods consist of the rules and procedures that show the criteria of accepting and rejecting hypotheses, theories, and laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt, 2002</xref>). This view is consistent with the paradigm of quantitative research and most hard sciences accept this view. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt (2002</xref>) argues that there is no one method that is truly scientific. Instead, we must consider different contexts when evaluating a research method for its scientific nature. Some scientific methods follow the <italic>logic of discovery</italic>—that is, scientific methods have a set of systematic rules and procedures that are optimal for the discovery of hypotheses, theories, and laws. The logic of discovery is well aligned with the paradigm of qualitative research. More importantly, both logics of discovery and justification offer unique and different contributions to the body of knowledge, and both are scientific methods. In fact, the logic of discovery has helped produce many major scientific discoveries through perceptual insights and observations, while the logic of justification has helped test and verify existing theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12470024">Hunt, 2002</xref>). We believe that C&amp;T research has employed scientific methods to describe and classify the satisfaction processes of humans’ clothing needs and wants in the context of both justification and discovery. For example, the variety of research methods used in manuscripts published in <italic>Clothing and Textiles Research Journal</italic> and other scholarly journals related to C&amp;T demonstrate C&amp;T researchers have used and continue to use both quantitative (logic of justification) and qualitative (logic of discovery) methodologies, and these approaches are reviewed by other fellow scientists for their scientific validity and reliability. Again, C&amp;T meets this criterion of science.</p><p>By reviewing the four basic natures of science, we were able to conclude that C&amp;T is a science and a discipline with a distinct subject matter that is different from other sciences. <italic>C&amp;T is the science of investigating satisfaction processes of humans’ clothing needs and wants. These satisfaction processes are described and classified by hypotheses, theories, generalizations, and/or laws, through scientific methods built from both logics of discovery and justification.</italic> Just as in any other sciences, knowledge gained through C&amp;T research or scientific achievements, is shared within society by textbooks or other educational materials. Textbooks are filled with accepted theories and knowledge, successful applications of such knowledge, and comparisons between these applications and exemplary observations and/or experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12470024">Kuhn, 1962</xref>). This process produces scientific knowledge transfer to other generations and leaves room for future generations’ new scientific inquiries. C&amp;T research has done and continues to do this.</p><p>The discussion on the basic nature of C&amp;T as a science is helpful for the discipline’s identity and sustainability within the future higher learning communities. However, this dialogue alone does not show various research opportunities and possibilities for C&amp;T scholars. Certainly, research foci, even paradigms, shift as society, environments, and industries change. While maintaining the core focus of the discipline, it is also imperative for any discipline to discover new knowledge that reflects such changes, trains the future workforce with new knowledge, and disseminates the knowledge throughout society. Without such adaptation, disciplines would be less likely to advance and scientific discoveries would be less relevant to society. With a clear understanding of the scientific nature of C&amp;T, the next section discusses the current environment C&amp;T faces.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0887302X12470024"><title>Current Status of C&amp;T Environment</title><p>One of the most distinct and undeniable facts of today’s consumption and production activities related to C&amp;Ts is that these activities are occurring in the global environment. Factories in Vietnam manufacture clothing with Korean fabrics for U.S. consumers. Throughout this process, dozens of other businesses from different countries get involved—designers from France, product developers from the United Kingdom, fibers from Egypt, fabrics from Turkey, zippers from Japan, buttons from China, shipping companies from Taiwan, import/export clearing houses in Hong Kong, and inspection service companies from Canada. Consumer advocacy groups in the United States may get involved and the U.S. government oversees product imports and exports. All of these business and nonbusiness activities are coordinated to produce and deliver the right amount of finished goods in the right quality in the right time at the right price. As a result, consumers from all over the world have access to globally produced products. From fiber producers to end users, each and all of these entities exist as an important member of the global supply chain<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0887302X12470024">5</xref></sup> of C&amp;Ts.</p><p>Today, from the C&amp;T producers’ perspective, the C&amp;T supply chain is extremely fragmented and globalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12470024">Ha-Brookshire &amp; Dyer, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is very difficult to manage all activities simultaneously. Effective and efficient management of such a global supply chain has been the focus of many C&amp;T businesses (Seitchik, 2009). In fact, a news article from <italic>Apparel Magazine</italic> reported that, through a nationwide salary survey, the supply chain management job, such as sourcing, purchasing, importing, production scheduling, trends research, consumer research, merchandising, and/or vendor selection, is the most highly sought after and compensated position in the C&amp;Ts industry, even during the recession in 2009 (Seitchik, 2009).</p><p>From the consumers’ perspective, most of C&amp;T consumers now purchase or acquire finished goods from other people or businesses. Very few people make their C&amp;T products for family members’ daily usage. The marketplace is saturated with goods made in foreign countries with distance between production sites and consumption sites now far greater than the past. This long distance between production and consumption sites has created new problems, such as distrust in business practices in foreign countries, diminished loyalty toward producers, and product safety issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X12470024">Bhaduri &amp; Ha-Brookshire, 2011</xref>). Therefore, knowledge of the global supply chain of C&amp;T products, transparency of product movements, and the abilities to evaluate different aspects of product performance are now new and critical problems when satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0887302X12470024"><title>Global Supply Chain Management as a Main Framework of C&amp;T</title><p>Considering the current market environments that C&amp;T faces, we propose the global supply chain management perspective as one of the approaches to help solve the aforementioned problems in C&amp;T and reduce the gap between foreign production and domestic consumption sites of C&amp;T products. Indeed, all aspects of production-related activities of C&amp;Ts take place in the global environment with dozens of different supply chain members. In addition, a great deal of consumption-related activities of C&amp;Ts affects and is influenced by such production-related activities. To explain global supply chain management in more detail, we first start with the definition of supply chain management found in the business literature.</p><p>One of the most popular and accepted definitions of supply chain management is offered by John Mentzer, a leading supply chain management researcher in the United States. He defines supply chain management as “the systemic, strategic coordination of the traditional business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12470024">Mentzer, 2004</xref>, p. 4).” He suggests the overall goal of supply chain management is to achieve customer satisfaction, value creation, increased profitability, and strong competitive advantages. To achieve this goal, he suggests supply chain management must be embedded into almost all aspects of traditional business functions, such as marketing, sales, research and development, forecasting, production, purchasing, logistics, information systems, finance, and customer service. Through intercorporate and interfunctional coordination, successful supply chain management is achieved; successful supply chain management is one of the most important business functions in today’s global marketplace.</p><p>Mentzer’s (2004) approach to traditional business functions and the role of supply chain management in each of these functions is different and unique from past perspectives. His perspective points out that traditional business functions must fall under the umbrella of the supply chain management framework, whereas previously it was thought supply chain functions were executed to support traditional business functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12470024">Mentzer, 2004</xref>). In this light, supply chain management is a higher level business function than traditional business functions; thus, all of the traditional functions must feed information and services to other supply chain functions under the overarching supply chain management framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12470024">Mentzer, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12470024">Mentzer (2004</xref>)’s approach is useful, we cannot just blindly adopt his approach to C&amp;T. The goal of supply chain management from Mentzer’s view is to satisfy shareholders as its domain lies within that of business. Therefore, it is obvious to see his argument of high profits and strong competitive advantages as the main goals of supply chain management. However, if the distinct subject matter of C&amp;T is satisfaction processes of humans’ clothing needs and wants, the goal of C&amp;T supply chain management must be human satisfaction. Some humans may gain satisfaction through bargain purchases or making products on their own. Others may be satisfied by consuming products that are socially and environmentally responsible. Some of these satisfactions may directly benefit businesses’ profits. Others may not. In fact, some consumption activities, such as boycotting products from irresponsible businesses, may cause negative effects on businesses’ profits, while yielding positive impacts on society and/or environment. In addition, all of these supply chain activities and human satisfaction processes take place in a global environment.</p><p>Therefore, by setting the objective of global supply chain management in C&amp;T to achieve human satisfaction from C&amp;T products, including all humans’ economic, social, and environmental satisfaction, C&amp;T is now clearly different from business or marketing. In addition, human satisfaction through socially and environmentally responsible consumption and production is directly related to the sustainable development initiative of the United Nations (UN) launched in 1987. This initiative seeks that we, as humans, must think about our future generations while consuming resources today. This is for human survival and sustainability in the future on Earth. Therefore, we must engage in “developments that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X12470024">United Nations General Assembly, 1987</xref>, p. 8). Social and environmental dimensions of human satisfaction are also aligned with Elkington’s (1998) triple bottom-lines of sustainability—economic, environmental, and social improvements. In short, by incorporating the distinctive subject matter of C&amp;T and supply chain management, we now can build the unique domain of C&amp;T.</p><sec id="section5-0887302X12470024"><title>Domain of C&amp;T From the Global Supply Chain Management Perspective</title><p>Discussion on C&amp;T as a scientific discipline and the role of global supply chain management in today’s marketplace yielded a conceptual model of the domain C&amp;T. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref> shows three major sections of the domain of C&amp;T: (a) humans’ needs and wants; (b) C&amp;T supply chain; and (c) humans’ satisfaction as an outcome.</p><fig id="fig1-0887302X12470024" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Domain of Clothing and Textiles in the Global Supply Chain.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0887302X12470024-fig1.tif"/></fig><sec id="section6-0887302X12470024"><title>Humans’ needs and wants for C&amp;Ts</title><p>Humans have different needs and wants for C&amp;Ts. Some needs and wants are shaped on the individual level, such as biological and psychological needs. For example, some people have less tolerance for cold weather than others. Others may be more conscious with self-image reflected by what they wear. Therefore, their needs and wants for C&amp;Ts could be different from the majority of people. At the collective level, needs and wants for C&amp;Ts are shaped through social norms and cultural expectations, such as wants for a certain wedding dress and needs for defined religious garb for a Catholic priest. All of these needs and wants are influenced by our environment—political, social, economic, technological, and natural. These humans’ needs and wants for C&amp;Ts affected by various environmental factors are represented in the oval shape on the left-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0887302X12470024"><title>C&amp;T supply chain</title><p>By definition, a supply chain consists of suppliers’ suppliers, suppliers, core organizations (typically businesses), customers, and customers’ customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12470024">Mentzer, 2004</xref>). This is true for the C&amp;T supply chain. The ultimate suppliers in the upstream of the C&amp;T supply chain would be fiber producers and the ultimate customers would be users of C&amp;Ts. To deliver the most desired and needed goods to ultimate users, various functions are necessary within the C&amp;T supply chain. By reviewing past history, one must forecast future needs and wants. Consumer research, including social/psychological aspects of consumers, is extremely useful to carefully predict consumers’ purchase, use, and disposal behavior. Design is another important supply chain function to satisfy various human clothing needs and wants. Creativity in design satisfies humans’ clothing needs and wants through artistic expression and appreciation, and, in longer term, driving fashion change in our society. Product development is fundamental to interpret designs and effectively engineer the finished goods in a way to satisfy humans’ needs and wants.</p><p>Production (or manufacturing) and sourcing must take place to implement design and product development strategies. Sourcing activities are involved in global supply chain management by identifying ideal places to manufacture finished goods, inspecting finished goods, and coordinating logistics. Merchandising helps the supply chain to produce the optimal amount of goods in a timely manner so producers still gain profits while consumers find the needed and/or wanted products. Finally, retailing, such as brick-and-mortar retailing, e-commerce, and m-commerce, is responsible for creating transactions between consumers and all members of the global supply chain. All of these supply chain functions are illustrated in the rectangular shape in the center of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref>, representing the core activities of the C&amp;T supply chain.</p><p>These supply chain activities require interfunctional coordination within an organization, as well as interorganizational coordination. These functions and coordination are managed through creative problem solving, leadership, and education. Without these supporting activities, individual supply chain activity alone cannot be successful in satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants. These five key supporting activities of the supply chain are represented in the main rectangle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref>, surrounding all of the seven supply chain functions. With these supporting activities, supply chain members are highly interdependent with each other, and the dotted lines within the rectangle symbolize this characteristic. Vertical organizations may have all of these core functions within the global supply chain. Others may focus on only one function, reflecting the fragmented nature of C&amp;T industries. This is not to say all C&amp;T products are produced through all of these functions. Yet, these are the core functions found within today’s C&amp;T supply chain. The large oval shape in the center of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref> shows the C&amp;T supply chain, including suppliers’ suppliers, suppliers, firms, customers, and customers’ customers.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0887302X12470024"><title>Human satisfaction</title><p>The goal of C&amp;T supply chain management is to satisfy humans’ clothing needs and wants. In addition to biological, psychological, social, aesthetic, and cultural needs and wants, some humans achieve satisfaction by economic gains as bargain-hunting consumers. Employees working for C&amp;T businesses also are satisfied through financial gains their businesses may get from this process. These economic gains, however, must not ignore social and environmental consequences the global supply chain processes may cause. By responsibly meeting the current generation’s needs and wants, humans also gain satisfaction for a better society and environment. The oval shapes on the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref> illustrate the goals of C&amp;T supply chain activities.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0887302X12470024"><title>The domain of C&amp;T</title><p>Overall, this model explains that humans’ needs and wants create demands for certain C&amp;T products, and such demands motivate supply chain members to work together. The results of global supply chain management can be actual products, services, and/or information. Products refer to tangible C&amp;T products, while services refer to intangible aspects of products such as salesmanship, returns, repairs, or delivery. Information could be certain messages, including corporate social responsibility, brand image, or status symbol. Through these products, services, and information, humans achieve satisfaction or dissatisfaction related to C&amp;Ts. The postconsumption experiences are then shared with society through various ways, including online reviews, reports from consumer advocacy groups, and even word of mouth. The postconsumption experiences then influence new demands and even new policies through feedback systems. The feedback loop is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref> from human satisfaction for clothing to new clothing needs and wants. People who are dissatisfied because of poor supply chain management may demand changes in policies or new policies. These policies then affect the way supply chain members function. All of these processes take place in the global environment. Therefore, the focus of the C&amp;T is not just to satisfy humans in developed economies. It should also include humans in developing economies as producers as well as consumers.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section10-0887302X12470024"><title>Research and Educational Opportunities in the Future C&amp;T</title><p>We believe that the domain of C&amp;T presented in this article provides important and interesting opportunities for C&amp;T researchers and educators. First, multifaceted and human-focused objectives of C&amp;T offer whole new sets of research topics and variables. In the past, most studies on consumer research related to C&amp;Ts focused on businesses’ profit growth. Therefore, consumers’ willingness to pay, purchase intention, shopping frequency, and perceived value were important topics or variables. However, these are not the only dimensions of satisfaction humans gain from clothing consumption. The degree of human satisfaction, consumers’ financial gains, social improvement, and environmental protection from C&amp;T products, services, and information provided by the C&amp;T supply chain members could also be important research topics. The results of such studies will then be disseminated through publications, textbooks, and educational materials. Therefore, the focus of C&amp;T education would extend beyond businesses’ profits to include overall human satisfaction.</p><p>Second, the role of each supply chain member’s function and its relationship with other functions within the global supply chain environment also provide countless research opportunities for C&amp;T researchers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12470024">Figure 1</xref> helps explain how all of these functions, such as history, forecasting, design, product development, consumer research, sourcing, production, merchandising, and retailing, are coordinated together to achieve one ultimate goal: satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants. Clearly, one function cannot exist without others. While deep understanding of best strategies for each specific function is important, research centered on interfunctional and interorganizational collaboration would be extremely useful to achieve the overall objectives of global supply chain management. In addition, it would be very important to research how creative problem solving and leadership affect such collaboration, as well as how education helps such interfunctional and interorganizational coordination.</p><p>Third, the impact of feedback from humans’ clothing satisfaction experiences on new needs and wants could be another critical research topic for C&amp;T researchers. In the traditional business research setting, more often than not, consumers, particularly as transaction makers, lack options to make a meaningful impact on businesses’ practices and policies. Today, with the help of technological advances in communication and social media, consumers could influence policy making and business practices in a much easier and more powerful way. Research on this topic will help satisfy humans’ clothing needs and wants. In this light, it is also important to teach our students to understand that users of C&amp;T are humans whom all supply chain members seek to satisfy, not just purchasers of finished goods or shareholders of businesses. Students also must understand that addressing these human concerns must be at the core when they are policy makers and be able to make changes in policies and market situations.</p><p>Fourth, the focus on the global aspects and impacts of humans’ C&amp;T consumption and production is extremely critical for humans’ sustainable development on this Earth. Some products may satisfy a certain group of humans’ clothing wants in developed countries, while the needs of employees in the supply chain in developing countries are not being met. Other products may satisfy other people’s clothing needs in the Western hemisphere, while natural environments in the Eastern hemisphere are being compromised. Too much focus on a narrow scope of research and education, as well as concentrating on C&amp;T businesses in a single country, may jeopardize the livelihood of humans’ futures in the long run. The domain of C&amp;T presented in this article clearly shows that businesses’ financial gains are just one aspect of C&amp;T activities. Furthermore, C&amp;T research and education is involved in our overall efforts to be sustainable in a responsible manner.</p><p>Last, but not least, the domain of C&amp;T presented in this article does not claim that all of our curricula and research agendas must be changed completely and immediately. Rather, we believe we can regain the true identity of C&amp;T by slightly modifying our teaching and research agendas to include human satisfaction beyond businesses’ profit satisfaction. In fact, many of our courses and research are already focused on human satisfaction beyond profits. For example, the objective of apparel product development has always been to achieve the wearer’s comfort, safety, and creative wants, while engineering products to be produced within the budget. Reemphasizing this objective throughout product development courses would help students achieve the ultimate goal of C&amp;T. Recent popularity of sustainability research also reflects C&amp;T scholars’ interests in human satisfaction aspects. For any other courses within C&amp;T, we believe we could emphasize the human satisfaction aspects of our curricula by asking a few more questions at the end of each class; now that we learned this technique (whether it is branding, consumer behavior, marketing, merchandising, retailing, sourcing, or creative design), how does this knowledge help improve business profits, consumers’ economic gains, societies, and environments?</p></sec><sec id="section11-0887302X12470024"><title>Visions for Future C&amp;Ts Industry Leaders</title><p>Implementation of C&amp;T research and education affects the future leaders of the C&amp;Ts industry. Well-trained and educated students with the proper understanding of the goals of C&amp;T would have clear ideas on the goals and roles of global supply chain members in human satisfaction of clothing needs and wants. When facing problems, they would have the proper skill sets to solve them creatively—without jeopardizing the overall goals of C&amp;T—throughout the global supply chain. Throughout their careers, C&amp;T graduates would become the leaders who are able to provide holistic assessment and perspectives of global supply chain management that leaders from other disciplines, such as business, may not be able to offer. C&amp;T graduates would be the advocates of balancing firms’ financial gains with other goals, such as consumers’ financial gains, social responsibility, and environmental impact.</p><p>In our vision, successful apparel product developers in the future would be able to not only engineer new products in a cost-effective manner, but also make products comfortable and safe for users as well as responsible for communities and environments. Successful sourcing managers in the future may consider workers’ rights and education in developing countries and environmental impact of long-distance shipments beyond costs associated with the bottom-line. We also hope to see advertisers and marketing directors in the C&amp;Ts industries promote responsible consumption, postconsumption, and purchase behavior. Leaders in retailing would truly appreciate long-term effects on employees’ career development and community services. Therefore, we hope that such programs are truly rooted in genuine concerns for society, rather than used as marketing gimmicks to promote companies’ profits in short term.</p><p>Finally, all of these decisions cannot be made without shareholders of C&amp;Ts businesses who understand the grand view of our industry. C&amp;T graduates, as potential shareholders and/or supporters of C&amp;Ts businesses, would help society understand that C&amp;Ts businesses exist to satisfy humans’ clothing needs and wants, and financial profits are just one component of many aspects of human satisfaction. C&amp;T graduates would communicate with their shareholders the fact that successful global supply chain management may yield long-term results, with direct contributions to global communities, environments, and the well-being of the entire human race on this Earth.</p><p>On March 14, 2012, Greg Smith, a former executive director and head of Goldman Sachs’ United States equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, confessed the true reality of today’s business world through an article titled, “Why I am leaving Goldman Sachs,” in the <italic>The New York Times </italic>(Smith, 2012). In this article, he describes the business environment of Goldman Sachs as “toxic” and “destructive” because the company’s main goal has been on profit increase even at the expense of clients’ loss. Therefore, the clients’ interests have been sidelined while the company’s earnings have been growing. He concludes this article with the statement that this type of business practice is not sustainable in the long term and the company must “make the client the focal point” of its business again. We envision graduates from C&amp;T would not face this type of moral challenge at the peak of their careers. C&amp;T graduates would always put humans at the focal point throughout the global supply chain management and have the ethical courage to push forward the company’s objective—human satisfaction for clothing—even when near-term profits may not be maximized.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0887302X12470024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To reexamine the domain of C&amp;T and understand its identity, we showed that C&amp;T is a science with a distinct subject matter that would set us apart from other disciplines while bonding C&amp;T scholars together. We believe that the distinct subject matter of C&amp;T research is the process of satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants. In order to satisfy such needs and wants, a variety of supply chain members from all over the world are coordinated and collaborate through creative problem solving, leadership, and education. Coordination and collaboration are the main function of global supply chain management with the goal of satisfying humans’ clothing needs and wants, not only through financial gains, but also through social and environmental improvement.</p><p>The domain of C&amp;T presented in this article offers several advantages to C&amp;Ts scholars. First, C&amp;T as a scientific discipline now has a clear identity different from business, arts, psychology, or other sciences. By focusing on humans, C&amp;T now has a convincingly justifiable reason as to why it belongs to the academic divisions related to human sciences, such as College of Human Environmental Sciences, College of Human Ecology, College of Human Science, and so on. Most importantly, C&amp;T scholars will now be able to articulate the nature of the discipline. It is critical to have a clear domain and identity for what we do. Otherwise, we will be left vulnerable for budget cuts, program closings, and/or consolidations.</p><p>Second, by understanding that today’s businesses in the global C&amp;T industries are supply chain members seeking to satisfy humans’ needs and wants, the priority of such supply chain members’ activities can now be described as human satisfaction, rather than business profit maximization. This is not to say profit orientation is not important. Indeed, businesses’ profits enable them to continue to employ people and to produce products that humans need or desire. Therefore, business profits are important for overall sustainability. However, we also believe that we must acknowledge not all business decisions and strategies need to be made based on the profit maximization criterion. Some argue that profit optimization must be considered, especially when considering businesses’ social and environmental practices. Therefore, the goals of supply chain members’ activities must gauge both financial and nonfinancial consequences, and, we believe, C&amp;T research and education advocate such practices. This helps C&amp;T be in the forefront of the UN’s sustainable development initiative, uniquely different from business while continuously shaping our own sustainable identity.</p><p>Third, the domain of C&amp;T presented in this article offers homes to all types of research, creative, and educational activities that we conduct every day. Therefore, we argue, C&amp;T does not need to be divided into multiple disciplines as all of supply chain functions, from history to retailing, must be coordinated together under one objective. Our framework also emphasizes the need for interfunctional research and education, calling for closer collaboration among functions. We emphasize there is no one function more important than others. Rather, we believe all of these functions feed critical information to other functions, resulting in an effective and sustainable supply chain. Therefore, the domain of C&amp;T presented in this article shows that we cannot afford to lose any of these functions from our curricula as well as research agenda. In sum, the framework helps us appreciate all of the functions within the C&amp;T global supply chain equally and greatly.</p><p>Michael Foucault (1926–1984), a French philosopher, said that “People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don’t know is what <italic>what they do</italic> does”(as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12470024">Dreyfus &amp; Rabinow, 1982</xref>, p. 187). He is telling us that, sometimes, we need to get out of our daily lives and see “what <italic>what we do</italic> does” from a grand view. We hope we have provided a grand view of C&amp;T as a scientific discipline and gives purpose to what we do every day. Certainly, we do not claim to say what we offer here is the final version of <italic>who we are</italic> and what C&amp;T covers. Rather, we wish this to be the beginning of a new conversation about C&amp;T as a discipline that would have a viable and sustainable future in higher education, research, and business communities. Particularly, in today’s higher education environment in which much of the C&amp;T discipline has been divided and transformed into different disciplines, discussions on what would happen to C&amp;T in the short and long term are critical for us to have. Some may have resources and abilities to refocus the mission of C&amp;T research and education even in new homes. Others may not have necessary support and foundations to do so. In this reality, we could sit behind and contemplate what we cannot do. We could also start raising this important topic ourselves and communicating the unique mission and objective of C&amp;T research and education with external stakeholders. We are the source of the agent of change for the future. We hope our discussion starts that process. We invite any suggestions and counterarguments on our views for continued improvement of our understanding.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn6-0887302X12470024"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn7-0887302X12470024"><label>Funding</label><p>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0887302X12470024"><label>1.</label><p>Through personal interactions with European researchers and educators, we learned that C&amp;T in European countries has not gone through these types of changes as extensively as in the United States.
