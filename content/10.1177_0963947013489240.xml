<abstract>
<p>This article analyses the constructive potential of synecdoche as a text-building mechanism. All too often not properly distinguished from its close and better-known relative, metonymy, synecdoche deserves to be treated as a separate figure, with its own individual function to perform. In this capacity it has already been mentioned by Giambattista Vico (1984 [1744]) as <italic>the trope of essentiality</italic>, pointing to outstanding features that pertain to individuals and objects. Synecdoche has retained its unique status among Kenneth Burke’s (1962 [1945]) <italic>master tropes</italic> and among Hayden White’s (1973, 1985a [1978], 1985b [1978], 1999a, 1999b) <italic>basic tropes</italic>, which organize various forms of narrative discourse. Synecdoche as a <italic>microfigure</italic> is usually confined to phrases or, at most, clauses but its genuinely discursive function becomes visible when it acts as a <italic>macrofigure</italic>, forming <italic>synecdochical chains</italic> that structure larger stretches of texts. Following the cognitivist claim about the predominance of the experience related to our own bodies over other types of perception, I turn my attention to one of frequent types of synecdoche that represents living organisms through their body parts. The chains of <italic>body parts synecdoches</italic> will be examined, drawn from Marcel Proust’s prose, as well as from a set of poems by Sylvia Plath and a set of poetic works by Czesław Miłosz. The structuring force of synecdoche becomes visible in the texts’ <italic>overall cohesion.</italic> Finally, an important theoretical aspect of the application of <italic>macrosynecdoche</italic> is its smooth transition into a <italic>megafigure</italic>, a tacit rhetorical strategy that underlies the entire text and influences its ultimate interpretation.</p>

<title>1 Introduction: The twisted history of synecdoche as a figure</title>
<p>A long evolution of the concept of synecdoche, paralleling an equally long story of ponderings on the rhetorical and stylistic potential of human language begins with Aristotle’s well-known definition of metaphor:<disp-quote>
<p>Metaphor is the application to one thing of a name belonging to another thing; the transference may be from the genus to the species, from the species to the genus, or from one species to another, or it may be a matter of analogy. As an example of transference from genus to species I give ‘Here lies my ship’, for lying at anchor is a species of lying. Transference from species to genus is seen in ‘Odysseus has indeed performed ten thousand noble deeds’, for ‘ten thousand’, which is a particular large number, is used here instead of the word ‘many’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489240">Aristotle, 1988 [1965]</xref>: 61)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Upon a close reading, it appears that this description can be classified as ‘all-inclusive’, in the sense that it carries in itself the germs of the future subdivision of this broadly (too broadly, we might say) conceived metaphoricity into three distinct tropes: metaphor, metonymy and synecdoche. Hence, their borderlines are fuzzy and family-resemblance quite strong.</p>
<p>Diodotus Tryphon (ca 60–10 BC), a Greek grammarian from Alexandria, seems to be the first one historically to use the term <italic>synecdoche</italic>, which in Greek means an ‘act of taking together’, ‘understanding one thing with another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489240">Lausberg, 2002 [1960]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947013489240">Preminger, 1974</xref>: 840).</p>
<p>The Roman theoretician of oratory Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (ca 35–ca 95 AD), an inheritor of the Greek tradition, discusses synecdoche under its Latin term <italic>intellectio</italic>, in his famed treatise: <italic>Institutionis oratoriae libri duodecim</italic> (Institutes of Oratory). It is there that he classifies synecdoche as the ‘metonymy of quantitative relationship’ between the word used and the meaning expected (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489240">Lausberg, 2002 [1960]</xref>: 328, §572). This quantitative nature of synecdoche can assume three basic forms: (1) <italic>pars pro toto</italic> (part-for-whole) and <italic>totum pro parte</italic> (whole-for-part), where on the basis of a fragment we infer the nature of the whole to which it belongs and vice versa; (2) the mutual relationship between a species and a genus; (3) the numerical relationship when the grammatical category of singularity stands for plurality and vice versa, for example, ‘The Roman won the battle’ meaning ‘The Romans won the battle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489240">Lausberg, 2002 [1960]</xref>: 328–330, §573). In Lausberg’s opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489240">2002 [1960]</xref>: 195, §555), reconsidered in this light, the earlier-quoted Aristotelian definition of metaphor contains two clear instances of type 2 synecdoche: from genus to species (verbal synecdoche ‘to lie’ – ‘to lie at anchor’) and from species to genus (synecdoche based upon a numeral ‘ten thousand’ – ‘many’).</p>
<p>The classical Graeco-Roman theory of figuration found its continuation in the Renaissance studies on tropes. Its late, neo-classical version came to voice forcefully in the writings of the Neapolitan philosopher Giambattista Vico (1668–1744), who propounded the so-called <italic>poetic logic</italic> in the series of treatises <italic>La Scienza Nuova</italic> (1725) and <italic>La Scienza Nuova Seconda</italic> (1730, 1744). The Vichian figurative cycle (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947013489240">Chrzanowska-Kluczewska, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947013489240">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947013489240">White, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963947013489240">1985a [1978]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947013489240">1985b [1978]</xref>) puts into focus four tropes: <italic>metaphor–metonymy–synecdoche–irony</italic> (the tetrad attributed to Petrus Ramus). Metaphor is still guaranteed a privileged position as the primeval figure of conceptualization, funded by similarity and analogy, but which – with time – gives place to metonymy, whose essence boils down to the reduction and dispersal of things perceived into adjacent fragments. The tropological development of the human mind evolves into a <italic>synecdochical pattern</italic> that – contrary to the metonymical fragmentation – oscillates around a conspicuous feature of an entity, thus starting the process of <italic>generalization</italic> and <italic>integration</italic> around what we would call nowadays <italic>salient qualities</italic>. We shall return soon, in Sections 2 and 3, to this positive, generalizing and integrative capacity of synecdoche that will make it a perfect candidate for enhancing the coherence of artistic discourse, whether written in prose or assuming a poetic form (epic or lyric). The following quotation from Vico is of particular interest as it refers directly to the kind of synecdochical formations that lie in the centre of my attention, namely synecdoches concerned with the human body and its parts: ‘The word “man” itself is abstract, comprehending as in a philosophic genus the body and all its parts, the mind and all its faculties, the spirit and all its dispositions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489240">Vico, 1984 [1744]</xref>: 130). Vico, in a very modern fashion, voices here his belief in the inextricable connections between the somatic, intellectual and psychological aspects of a human being, in whom it is difficult to point to a clear demarcation line separating the physical corpus, the brain-mind and the spirit-soul emotional constitution. This orientation makes Vico a genuine predecessor of the cognitive current in stylistics and poetics, the more so as he perceives his four leading tropes as elements of ‘mental language’, thus turning them into figures of both thought and language. The fourth member of the Vichian tetrad, irony, is – actually – an ‘odd man out’. Whereas metaphor, metonymy and synecdoche are dubbed ‘naive’ and ‘sincere’ tropes by Vico, irony boasts a mixed and morally disturbing nature. Based on hidden negation, it conceals truth and highlights falsity, hence – albeit a trope of self-criticism and sophistication – it stands for decline and decadence in the conceptual evaluation of reality. With it, the Vichian circle closes and returns to metaphor.</p>
<p>The writings of the American literary theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947013489240">Kenneth Burke (1962 [1945]</xref>) display an important return to the Vichian tetrad of major tropes. Burke calls them <italic>master tropes</italic> and proposes an alternative set of names to define their characteristics, namely <italic>perspective</italic> for metaphor, <italic>reduction</italic> for metonymy, <italic>representation</italic> for synecdoche, and <italic>dialectic</italic> for irony. Burke claims that the master tropes tend to overlap, thus the metonymical reduction of necessity borders upon the synecdochal representation. Burke continues the ‘cognitive’ line of thinking about tropes extending back to Vico in that he perceives in tropes the <italic>styles of thinking</italic> and not just <italic>styles of writing</italic> or <italic>speech</italic>.</p>

<title>2 Synecdoche as a macro- and mega- or metatrope</title>
<p>Until the mid-20th century the discussion of synecdoche (and other figures, with the exclusion of metaphor and allegory) was largely limited to its functioning at the microstylistic textual level. According to a triple functional subdivision of semantic figures, which I offered earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947013489240">Chrzanowska-Kluczewska, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947013489240">2009</xref>), synecdoches of this type are instances of microtropes. Their functional scope is usually that of a single lexeme or phrase and never extends beyond the range of a clause. The classical examples of synecdoches adduced in section 1 (nominal, verbal and numerical) are all of this type. Thus, ‘my roof’ instead of ‘my house’, ‘to drive’ for any kind of driving, or a ‘gold medal’ for a ‘gilded medal’ exemplify common usage of highly conventionalized <italic>microsynecdoches</italic> (with the last example being the case of adjectival synecdoche).</p>
<p>With the growing interest in text and discourse studies and the identification of text-building mechanisms, it soon struck the stylisticians’ attention that tropes tend to cluster. Thus, in my terminology, <italic>macrotropes</italic> (<italic>big figures</italic>) organize sequences of sentences, fragments of texts such as paragraphs, stanzas or even entire texts (short lyric poems). The classical rhetoric knew them especially in the guise of <italic>extended</italic> (<italic>Homeric</italic>) <italic>similes</italic> and <italic>extended metaphors</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947013489240">Semino, 2008</xref> for the discussion of macrometaphorical patterns). Crucially, both micro- and macrotropes are instances of <italic>overt figuration</italic>, which means that they are physically present within the text.</p>
<p>The idea of a yet higher level of figural analysis entered the stylistic research most forcefully with the well-known proposal of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947013489240">Roman Jakobson (1956)</xref> to dichotomize all human artistic discourses into two polar opposites: metaphoric and metonymic, that is paradigmatic (based on selection) and syntagmatic (based on combination, i.e. actual adjacency of elements). These <italic>large figures</italic>, which I call <italic>megatropes</italic> (and which include self-reflexive <italic>metatropes</italic>) lie at the tacit level of interpretation and have to be deduced, that is read off the entire text or discourse. Hence, they require a more mature readership and have to be processed by what I have dubbed <italic>rhetorical inferring mechanisms</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947013489240">Chrzanowska-Kluczewska, 2009</xref>: 103).</p>
<p>Within the Jakobsonian scheme of two axes of language and semiotic creation in general, synecdoche was treated as a subspecies of metonymic construal (see his famous example of close-ups in the cinematographic art, which are nothing else but instances of <italic>pars-pro-toto</italic>, often bodily-based, as when a camera focuses on the character’s face or the eyes). More practically, the megatropical potential of metaphor as opposed to metonymy-synecdoche was corroborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489240">David Lodge (1977)</xref> in application to 20th-century fiction.</p>
<p>Hayden White is the theorist to whom we owe thanks for bringing to our attention Vico’s poetic logic and its translation into more modern parlance. In his first book concerned with tropology and its application to historical discourse, that is <italic>Metahistory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947013489240">1973</xref>), White espouses the Vichian and Burkean tetrad of figures, calling them <italic>basic tropes</italic> and treating them as large conceptual models of consciousness and of discourse organization. He thus refers to these four figures as the linguistic reflections of <italic>modes of consciousness</italic> or, alternatively, as Metaphoric, Metonymic, Synecdochic, and Ironic styles. Commenting on Vico’s <italic>La Scienza Nuova Seconda</italic>, he explains the deconstructive power of metonymy as ‘a movement of thought from the most sensible idea to the less sensible’, from ‘the abstract’ to ‘a tangible or concrete reality’. Unlike metonymy, synecdoche restores a ‘conceptual unity’ of objects through the ‘elevation’ of particulars into universals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947013489240">White, 1985b [1978]</xref>: 207).</p>
<p>Finally, from the perspective of cognitive psycholinguistics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489240">Gibbs (1994)</xref> defends the poetic make-up of human mental capacities very much in line with the Vichian fourfold paradigm. The main tropes he discusses include metaphor, metonymy (of which synecdoche is a type or subclass) and irony (which covers also hyperbole and oxymoron). It appears, then, that despite its not very clear-cut distinction from metonymy, synecdoche has gained a due theoretical ground in modern stylistics and rhetoric, especially as a phenomenon worthy of analysis at higher discursive levels.</p>

<sec id="section3-0963947013489240">
<title>3 Body parts synecdoches at the macrolevel of stylistic analysis and their narrative potential</title>
<p>In line with one of the major claims of second-generation cognitive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489240">Lakoff and Johnson, 1998</xref>) concerned with the prevalence of bodily experiences in our dealings with the surrounding world, in this section I intend to turn my attention to a numerous group of synecdoches that select body parts as their ground. At this point it is worth reminding the reader that synecdoche is a figure centred around the problem of <italic>selectivity</italic>, discussed already by Aristotle. Synecdochical operations should be regulated by the proper selection of fragments in relation to their wholes (<italic>synecdochic selectivity</italic>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947013489240">Ziomek (1984</xref>: 188) calls the fragments selected by synecdoche <italic>relevant</italic>. Thus, ‘hand’ and ‘head’ are synecdochically relevant in relation to their <italic>totum</italic>, that is, ‘man’, but ‘foot’ or ‘liver’ are less likely to serve as candidates for synecdoches. The first two lexemes are also commonplace instances of conventional synecdoche (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489240">Gibbs, 1994</xref>: 322). Yet, once we pass from the level of micro- to macrofiguration, which relies on synecdochical chains, less salient body parts will also be chosen creatively in description. This is an issue called by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489240">Lodge (1977</xref>: 94 ff.) <italic>literary motivation for selectivity</italic>. A good illustration of such macrosynecdochic chains that build the prosaic narration consistently through the description or presentation of particular characters is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947013489240">Markiewicz (2009)</xref>. And so, Emily Brontë in <italic>Wuthering Heights</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947013489240">1994 [1847]</xref>) uses the following <italic>embedded synecdoche</italic>: ‘my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand’, where ‘fingers’ are a part of ‘hand’ and ‘hand’ stands for Catherine (or rather, her apparition). In turn, William Faulkner in <italic>The Wild Palms</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947013489240">1961 [1939]</xref>) represents an important female figure through the following chain of bodily attributes: ‘dark hair’, ‘queer hard yellow eyes’, ‘face whose skin was drawn thin’, ‘prominent cheek-bones’, ‘a heavy jaw – sullen and afraid’. All these synecdoches (with a multiple embedding: parts of face – face – woman) are nominal phrases with epithets that play an important role in building an emotional and not only physical image of this person. Finally, Scott Fitzgerald in the short story ‘Bernice bobs her hair’ (from <italic>The Diamond as Big as the Ritz and Other Stories</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489240">1996</xref>) describes the eponymic character through such synecdoches as ‘dark hair’ and ‘high colour’. All these three descriptions are female portraits with a different number of features mentioned, thus requiring a varying degree of completion on the reader’s part. The only male synecdochic portrayal adduced by Markiewicz and drawn also from Fitzgerald relies on a more sophisticated selectivity: ‘the unusually long eyelashes’, ‘the blue semicircles of ill health’, ‘unnatural glow colouring his face’. In fact, this chain is a skilful combination of the three related tropes: synecdoche–metonymy–metaphor.</p>
<p>All these highly figurative descriptions of characters play an important part in the plots of their respective narrations. This corroborates my belief that description can be not only ‘narration-enhancing’ but also ‘narration constructing’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947013489240">White 1999b</xref>, who uses the term <italic>description-narration</italic>).</p>
<p>Equipped with this theoretical apparatus, let us turn our attention to some chosen examples of synecdochical selectivity in modern European prose and poetry.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963947013489240">
<title>3.1 Macrosynecdoches in Marcel Proust’s prose</title>
<p>Acclaimed by critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489240">de Man, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947013489240">White, 1999b</xref>) as a master of figurative language, whose feeling for tropes by far surpassed the theorizing of experts on stylistic and rhetorical devices, Marcel Proust had recourse to all major tropes in his writings. And although some critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489240">de Man, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947013489240">Pimentel, 1990</xref>) focused their attention mainly on the Proustian predilection for metaphor and metonymy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947013489240">White (1999b)</xref> in his essay on the Proustian figuration, demonstrates that Proust made a balanced draw from the pool of the four basic tropes.</p>
<p>Since our concern is limited to the use of body parts synecdoche, I have selected some excerpts that are structured by a consistent use of synecdochic chains. These are prime instances of macrofiguration that impose cohesion and coherence upon textual units, namely individual paragraphs or their sequences covering sometimes a stretch of a few pages. The descriptions of bodily experiences of Marcel (a partial alter-ego of the author himself) well illustrate <italic>literary selectivity</italic>, as they pick body organs far surpassing the hackneyed set that orbits around the lexemes ‘head’, ‘hand’, ‘eye’ or ‘heart’. All the excerpts in the following examples come from the first volume of <italic>In Search of Lost Time</italic>, that is, <italic>Swann’s Way</italic> (with synecdoches in bold face by me):<disp-quote>
<p>(1) I would lay <bold>my cheeks</bold> gently against the comfortable <bold>cheeks of my pillow</bold>, as plump and fresh as <bold>the cheeks of childhood</bold>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489240">Proust, 2005 [1955–1956]</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Within this complex sentence we encounter a chain of synecdoches all centred around the notion of ‘cheek’. This bodily part is relevant for the Proustian prose because of its straightforward link with the experience of sleep and of long hours spent in bed by the protagonist. We can find here a rhetorical figure called <italic>the list of three</italic>. Whereas the first occurrence of ‘cheeks’ (instead of ‘head’) is a simple case of synecdoche, the two remaining ones are skilful fusions of synecdoche and personifying metaphor (the second of them embedded in a simile). This quotation epitomizes a masterful combination of different tropes within a sentential functional domain.</p>
<p>Two paragraphs later we come across the following passage, again a description of the borderline experience between dream and the waking state:<disp-quote>
<p>(2) Sometimes, too, as Eve was created from a <bold>rib</bold> of Adam, a woman would be born during my sleep from some misplacing of <bold>my thigh</bold> … <bold>my cheek</bold> was still warm from her kiss, <bold>my body</bold> ached beneath the weight of <bold>hers</bold>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489240">Proust, 2005</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A ‘rib’ gathers its salience from a common Judeo-Christian tradition flowing from the <italic>Old Testament</italic>, where the creation of woman is linked to a rib of Adam, while procreation is often associated with thighs. Structurally, these two synecdoches are embedded within a simile. The ‘cheek’, Proust’s favourite synecdoche, looks back to an earlier paragraph, thus building a <italic>figural cohesion</italic> of the text.</p>
<p>We move two paragraphs forward to face another, quite intricate synecdochical sequence descriptive of the state just after the awakening:<disp-quote>
<p>(3) My <bold>body</bold>, still too heavy with sleep to move, would endeavour to construe from the pattern of its tiredness the position of its various <bold>limbs</bold>, in order to deduce therefrom the direction of the wall … Its memory, the composite memory of its <bold>ribs</bold>, its <bold>knees</bold>, its <bold>shoulder-blades</bold>, offered it a series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept … And even before my <bold>brain</bold> … had reassembled the circumstances sufficiently to identify the room … The stiffened <bold>side</bold> on which I lay would, for instance … imagine itself to be lying <bold>face</bold> to the wall … and my <bold>body</bold>, the <bold>side</bold> upon which I was lying, faithful guardians of a past which my <bold>mind</bold> should never have forgotten. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489240">Proust, 2005</xref>: 4–5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The best commentary to this prolonged macrosynecdochic pattern that builds the warp of the passage is the following citation from White, who thus describes the discursive form dominated by synecdoche:<disp-quote>
<p>In this view of the matter, narrative can be characterized as a kind of discourse in which synecdoche functions as the dominant trope for ‘grasping together’ (Greek <italic>synecdoche</italic>, Latin <italic>subintellectio</italic>) the parts of a totality apprehended as being dispersed across a temporal series into a whole in the mode of identification. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947013489240">White, 1999a</xref>: 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And although he mainly refers to the megatropical structure underlying the text, in this case his description applies equally well to the overtly given level of macrosynecdoche.</p>
<p>The body parts prominent from the physical perspective of a bed-ridden person, namely limbs, ribs, knees, shoulder-blades and sides are the elements through which not only the body (<italic>totum</italic>) is ultimately reconstructed but which help the personified brain (fusion of personification with metonymy: ‘brain’ for ‘mind’) to reassemble the room as a self-contained space and to recover the memories of the past in the obsessive temporal reconstruction. The unifying role of macrosynecdoche, working anaphorically and cataphorically, not only builds the text’s cohesion but also enhances its coherence.</p>
<p>The last exemplification of the Proustian body-oriented synecdochical chain, selected out of dozen similar occurrences, is the following sentimental image of the young Marcel’s grandmother during their summer stays at Combray:<disp-quote>
<p>(4) in the course of those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening, during which we used to see her handsome <bold>face</bold> passing to and fro … its brown and wrinkled <bold>cheeks</bold> … while upon them either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an involuntary <bold>tear</bold>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489240">Proust, 2005</xref>: 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The salient feature of the grandmother’s figure becomes, unsurprisingly, her face – not only because it is still good-looking and dear to her grandson but also because it is the focus of her personality and carrier of her emotions. The cheeks return again, in what looks like one of Proust’s favourite synecdoches. The macrosynecdochic sequence ends with an instance of the <italic>singular for plural synecdoche</italic> (‘tear’ standing generically for ‘tears’).</p>
<p>All of the four citations (a humble choice from a multitude of synecdochical descriptions that pervade the Proustian oeuvre) illustrate the functioning of macrosynecdoche, a trope visibly present in the text as a succession of microsynecdoches. Yet White underscores the fact that the Proustian narrative in several places becomes organized by large tropological models (our mega- or metatropes). Despite the fact that the figuration at the micro- and macrolevel of description may be meagre or even non-existent in certain passages, what counts is a large tacit trope that structures them from behind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947013489240">White (1999b)</xref> provides an instance of such <italic>latent figuration</italic> with an excerpt drawn from the volume <italic>Sodome et Gomorrhe</italic> (in the original), a famous description of an 18th-century fountain on the premises of the Guermantes’ residence. Despite the fact that the excerpt itself appears in White’s opinion ‘so literalist, so barren of figures of speech’ at the <italic>manifest levels</italic> of interpretation (micro- and macrolevel), it is actually organized by the succession of four ‘modalities of figuration’: ‘… a movement from a metaphorical apprehension of the <italic>interpretandum</italic>, through a metonymic dispersion of its attributes and a synecdochic comprehension of its possible nature, to an ironic distancing of the process of interpretation itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947013489240">White, 1999b</xref>: 131). What is more, not only the fountain passage but the entire volume is structured analogically as a tetrad of basic tropes at the megalevel of figurative reading. This has led White to maintain that:<disp-quote>
<p>… it is legitimate to read Proust’s narrative as an allegory of figuration itself, with the modalities of figuration as he construed them serving as the basic units of his strategies for emplotting the drama of consciousness which is its manifest subject matter. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947013489240">White, 1999b</xref>: 142)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A similar opinion had already been voiced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947013489240">Paul de Man (2004 [1979])</xref>, who claimed that Proust ‘dramatizes tropes’, especially in descriptions of landscapes or objects. This means that <italic>tropological models</italic> (the term appears in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947013489240">de Man, 1984</xref>), such as synecdoche, endow descriptions with the power equal to regular narration. Consequently, successions or clusters of descriptions become closer to sequences of activities in building a full-fledged narrative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947013489240">de Man (2004 [1979]</xref>: 25–26) highlights as well the metafigural capacity of language in Proust’s prose, analysing an excerpt in which Marcel reminisces on the summer concert of flies buzzing around. The metatextual comments on the choice between metaphor, metonymy and synecdoche to describe this seemingly trivial event is illustrative of the way in which the macrolevel of tropological description imperceptibly merges into a metafigural commentary.</p>

<title>3.2 Selected macrosynecdoches in Czesław Miłosz’s poetry</title>
<p>The Proustian prose, rich in descriptions so forceful that they function as narrative proper, is not the only interesting instance where macrosynecdoche appears at work. Poetry, especially of the epic kind, can display a similar tropological structure. One of the most famous instances of the mixed metonymic–synecdochic macrochain responsible for the construal of the poetic text is the famed passage describing Satan’s army marching to battle in John Milton’s <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947013489240">Chrzanowska-Kluczewska, 2004</xref>). The salient elements through which the image of the fallen angels is constructed comprise various weapons and musical instruments.</p>
<p>Let us turn now to some contemporary instances of macrofiguration in poetry that deftly combines lyrical with epic episodes. In the following, we shall first scrutinize synecdochic sequences in poems by Czesław Miłosz (1911–2004), a Polish émigré poet awarded the Nobel prize in 1980, to be followed (in Section 3.3) by an analysis of synecdochal chains drawn from the poetry of Sylvia Plath (1932–1963). The excerpts analysed have been carefully selected according to a specific key that needs some explanation. Miłosz and Plath, though differing in male and female sensibility and coming from different national backgrounds, can be expected to share some very general (possibly universal) <italic>topoi</italic>, the themes of concern and interest to a long succession of poets and writers in the western tradition. One of such <italic>topoi</italic> is a preoccupation with human corporeality and its juxtaposition with an animal body. The fascination with birds and their capabilities, strongly instilled in the European consciousness by the myth of Icarus, finds reflection in the creations of Miłosz and Plath alike. Secondly, the excerpts should be looked at in parallel sequences that oscillate around the following problematics: (1) the experience of child-birth, (2) the experience of parental presence, (3) the experience of animality (the most difficult to comprehend as never given to us in direct experience). But there is also the third reason behind the choice of the following passages, cutting across the prose–poetry duality. Miłosz, in a manner similar to Proust, managed to create the textual universe of an idyllic childhood, in which people, animals and plants have their important share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947013489240">Chrzanowska-Kluczewska, 2012</xref>). Plath’s textual world, in turn, reflects a more sombre and disturbed reality, pervaded with a repressed fear of motherhood, mixed memories of her own childhood, eclipsed by the figure of the domineering father, and a certain awe at the confrontation with the ‘animal’ and more generally ‘non-human existential experience’.</p>
<p>Several of Miłosz’s poems refer thematically to the cherished memories of the poet’s early years spent in Lithuania (in what had once been a Polish territory). The first stanza of the poem ‘Lessons’ falls into two figuratively distinct parts, with the first seven lines referring to the birth of the lyrical I (author):<disp-quote>
<p>(5) A doctor from the town cut the <bold>navel-string</bold> …</p>
<p>I have been in the <bold>hands</bold> of humans. They could have strangled</p>
<p>My first <bold>scream</bold>, squeezed with a giant <bold>hand</bold></p>
<p>The defenceless <bold>throat</bold> that aroused their tenderness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947013489240">Miłosz, 2008 [1996]</xref>: 131)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A newly arrived infant is shown through his most conspicuous features: a ‘navel-string’, ‘scream’ and ‘throat’ (the last two are metonymically related). The terrifying ‘hands’ of an adult (a doctor) are in this context the most relevant body organ. A ‘giant hand’ is a singular for plural synecdoche with a hyperbolic epithet attached to it. The ‘hand’ synecdoches create a powerful imagery, overshadowing the connotations of motherhood evoked by the ‘navel-string’.</p>
<p>Soon, the nostalgic memories of the poet’s father are brought to us in the poem ‘Father in the library’:<disp-quote>
<p>(6) A high <bold>forehead</bold>, and above it tousled <bold>hair</bold></p>
<p>On which a ray of sun falls from the window.</p>
<p>And so father wears a bright fluffy <bold>crown</bold></p>
<p>When he spreads before him a huge book.</p>
<p>His <bold>gown</bold> is patterned like that of a wizard. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947013489240">Miłosz, 2008</xref>: 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The opening stanza contains two body parts synecdoches, which look cataphorically to their <italic>totum</italic>, namely ‘father’. ‘Tousled hair’ and ‘fluffy crown’ are partly synonymous phrases. The latter is a metonymic metaphor, pointing indirectly to the father’s high status in his son’s eyes. The invocation of the synecdochical/metonymic ‘gown’ strengthens the image of the father as a wizard and king. All nominal synecdoches are accompanied by epithets that play an important role in imagery creation.</p>
<p>In turn, a single-stanza poem ‘Magpiety’ is a metaphysical pondering on the essence of being a bird:<disp-quote>
<p>(7) A magpie was screeching and I said: Magpiety?</p>
<p>What is magpiety? I shall never achieve</p>
<p>A magpie <bold>heart</bold>, a <bold>hairy nostril</bold> over the <bold>beak</bold>, a <bold>flight</bold> …</p>
<p>If however magpiety does not exist</p>
<p>My nature does not exist either. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947013489240">Miłosz, 2008</xref>: 129)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This four-item string of synecdoches, illustrates what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947013489240">de Man (2006 [1986])</xref> calls the <italic>totalizing</italic> and White <italic>essentializing</italic> power of synecdoche to reconstruct the <italic>totum</italic> (‘magpiety’ as the bird’s essence) around its prominent part(s). While ‘beak’ and ‘flight’ (fusion of metonymy and synecdoche) are clearly the bird’s attributes and its essential properties, ‘nostril’ is a more general animizing organ and ‘heart’ a humanizing one.</p>
<p>The fascination with ‘birdiness’, not uncommon in European poetry (to wit: Keats, Shelley, Hopkins, Frost and Stevens, among others), continues in the ‘Ode to a bird’, construed as a series of apostrophes to a winged creature:<disp-quote>
<p>(8) O composite …</p>
<p>Holding your <bold>feathery palms</bold> behind you,</p>
<p>Propped on your gray <bold>lizard legs</bold>,</p>
<p>On <bold>cybernetic gloves</bold> …</p>
<p>… your <bold>foot</bold> loosens its hold, your <bold>arm</bold> extends. …</p>
<p>You take your warm palpitating <bold>heart</bold>. …</p>
<p>An impeccable <bold>motion</bold> …</p>
<p>… your <bold>wings</bold> beat, …</p>
<p>But your half-opened <bold>beak</bold> is with me always.</p>
<p>Its inside so <bold>fleshy</bold> and amorous. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947013489240">Miłosz, 2008</xref>: 135, 137)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The macrosynecdoche that construes the backbone of the poem consists of several elements. The first part plays on synecdoches embedded within metaphors while the remaining part of the sequence imparts a humanizing tinge to the bird of prey (like in ‘Magpiety’). All of these quoted synecdochal chains prove Miłosz’s dexterity in applying them as text-building strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963947013489240">
<title>3.3 Selected macrosynecdoches in Sylvia Plath’s poems</title>
<p>Let us consider now three synecdochal chains drawn from the poetry of Sylvia Plath, a real master of particularizing and essentializing rendition of the surrounding world.</p>
<p>The poem ‘Morning Song’ ties in with Miłosz’s ‘Lessons’, at least in the opening part. It also refers to the birth of a child, though now the point of view has shifted from that of the baby to the poetic persona (largely impersonating the empirical author, namely the mother) as well as the relatives:<disp-quote>
<p>(9) The midwife slapped your <bold>footsoles</bold>, and your bald <bold>cry</bold></p>
<p>Took its place among the elements.</p>
<p>… your <bold>nakedness</bold></p>
<p>Shadows our safety.…</p>
<p>All night your <bold>moth-breath</bold></p>
<p>Flickers …</p>
<p>Your <bold>mouth</bold> opens clean as a cat’s.</p>
<p>… And now you try</p>
<p>Your handful of <bold>notes</bold>;</p>
<p>The clear <bold>vowels</bold> rise like balloons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947013489240">Plath, 2004 [1985</xref>]: 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Apart from the body parts and their functions (‘footsoles’, the metonymically tinged ‘nakedness’ standing for ‘naked body’, and ‘breath’ that is also metonymically related to ‘mouth’), the interweaving synecdoches refer to the sounds emitted by the child (‘bald cry’ – a synecdochic synaesthesia, ‘notes’, ‘vowels’), thus the visual effect of ‘infantness’ becomes complemented with the salient acoustic side of the phenomenon of birth and babyhood. The epithet ‘moth’ and the simile ‘clean as a cat’s’ impart the animalizing aspect to the image of a young human, witnessing a sort of bafflement experienced by the mother (likened to a cow later in the poem) at this new encounter (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489240">Semino, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The next poem, titled ‘Daddy’, could be paralleled with Miłosz’s portrayal of his father. Yet, this is no longer a picture of a respected and loved parent but a settling of scores with excruciating experiences connected with the terrifying personality of the poetic persona’s father, likened to a devil and vampire. The title is, obviously, ironic. Here I quote only the salient characteristics that build the framework for the representation of a despised parent:<disp-quote>
<p>(10) Ghastly statue with one grey <bold>toe</bold> …</p>
<p>And a <bold>head</bold> in the freakish Atlantic</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>… your <bold>gobbledygoo.</bold></p>
<p>And your neat <bold>mustache</bold></p>
<p>And your Aryan <bold>eye</bold>, bright blue.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The boot in the <bold>face</bold>, the brute</p>
<p>Brute <bold>heart</bold> of a brute like you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A <bold>cleft</bold> in your <bold>chin</bold> instead of your <bold>foot</bold></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There’s a stake in your fat black <bold>heart</bold>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947013489240">Plath, 2004</xref>: 48–50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The synecdochic selectivity mechanism has this time drawn both from the staple names of body parts such as ‘head’, ‘face’, ‘heart’, ‘eye’ and ‘foot’ but also from a less common set including ‘moustache’, ‘chin’ (and the ominous ‘cleft’ in it, a substitute for ‘foot’) and even ‘gobbledygoo’, metonymically related to the face and adding an acoustic quality to this predominantly visual picture, infused with negative emotional associations.</p>
<p>The poem ‘Elm’, with which I close the descriptive part of my considerations, is a soliloquy of a personified elm tree addressed to a human being. She narrates her experience of the long years of elements affecting her: rain, scorching heat, violent winds and the radiance of the moon. The synecdochic sequence comes with the following episode:<disp-quote>
<p>(11) I am inhabited by a <bold>cry</bold>.</p>
<p>Nightly it <bold>flaps out</bold></p>
<p>Looking, with its <bold>hooks</bold> …</p>
<p>… this dark thing</p>
<p>That sleeps in me;</p>
<p>… its soft, <bold>feathery turnings</bold>, its <bold>malignity</bold>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947013489240">Plath, 2004</xref>: 40–41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is, obviously, a description of a night bird, an owl in all likelihood. Plath’s masterly synecdochical selectivity is shown from the perspective of the elm-tree that feels the nightly creature amidst her branches, is terrified by it but tries to understand its nature. Thus, it picks as relevant the acoustic features of the ‘owlness’ such as ‘cry’ and ‘flapping’ but, more importantly, the tactile sensations represented by ‘hooks’ and ‘soft feathery turnings’, the visual aspect (‘the dark thing’), and – finally – the emotional connotations (‘its malignity’). This macrosynecdochic chain calls to life a picture of a mysterious bird, predatory and malicious, yet – in a sense – pleasant to the elm-tree (softness of feathers), which contrasts with Miłosz’s more objective selectivity connected with specifying the nature of a magpie or his fascination with an awe-inspiring bird, also predatory (a hawk or falcon?).</p>
<p>Apart from the indubitable skill in using macrosynecdoches, both poets make an abundant use of other tropes (metaphor, metonymy, irony, etc.), which often results in tropological blends.</p>

<sec id="section7-0963947013489240">
<title>4 Closing remarks</title>
<p>A few points offer themselves as a summary of this concise overview of the nature and role of synecdoche. I definitely take side with all those researchers who like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489240">Gérard Genette (1982 [1972])</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947013489240">Tzvetan Todorov (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947013489240">Ziomek (1984)</xref> oppose a bi-aspectual theory of tropes, due mainly to Jakobson. Instead, either the traditional subdivision of tropes or at least the tetrad of master tropes discussed in this article seem to allot a deserved place to such figures as synecdoche or irony, overlooked in the simplifying metaphor-metonymy paradigm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947013489240">Chrzanowska-Kluczewska, 2013</xref>). Synecdoche, which has been our main concern in this article, possesses its own cognitive functionality, namely through bringing relevant and salient qualities or parts of entities into focus of attention, it helps to generalize and reconstruct the <italic>totum</italic>. Synecdoche appears, then, to play a positive, constructive role as a figure of consciousness and mode of discourse. As a result, its text-creating and narrative-enhancing value should come as no surprise. The fragments analysed in this article are intended to show that macrosynecdochic chains, in prose and poetry alike, can thread their way through extended portions of texts, thus imposing a figurative backbone upon them. Traditionally, the notion of <italic>cohesion</italic> has included mainly syntactic and semantic devices of ‘gluing’ the text together, such as – among others – lexical repetitions, parallelism and, prominently, the mechanisms of substitution visible in anaphora and cataphora. In Section 3.1 I introduced the term <italic>figural cohesion</italic> in order to complement the repertoire of standardly invoked cohesive devices. Since the conceptual coherence of the text remains inextricably bound with cohesion, it can be claimed that macrofigurative chains, of which macrosynecdoche is just an instance, play an important role in the construal of <italic>text worlds</italic> (in the case of prose narrative and epic poetry) or of <italic>scenarios or scenes</italic> (in the case of lyric poems).</p>
<p>Our out of necessity sketchy analysis of body parts macrosynecdoches in selected prose and poetry excerpts seems to partly corroborate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489240">Lakoff and Johnson’s (1998</xref>: 3) well-known creed: ‘The mind is inherently embodied’ and even a more radical thesis of embodiment voiced by Feldman:<disp-quote>
<p>In a general way, the embodied basis for abstract meanings can be seen as inevitable. … All cultural knowledge must therefore arise from embodied experience. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947013489240">Feldman, 2008</xref>: 199)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And even though literary and non-literary discourses will contain several instances of synecdochic sequences that are not ‘body-based’ at all, the ubiquity of figures that reveal their authors’ or users’ conscious or subconscious concern with human, animal and even vegetal bodies cannot be overlooked.</p>
