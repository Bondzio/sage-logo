<abstract>
<p>Historians have reconstructed the past mainly by the study of texts; only recently have they turned their attention to the analysis of images. They have abstained almost entirely, however, from using their ears when exploring the past: they have been content with the sound of silence. This can be explained in part by the scarcity of authentic acoustic sources which have existed only for the time period since about 1900. Historical studies focusing on the function of listening in the past, the soundscapes of earlier epochs and the significance of acoustic signals are rare. This article attempts to sketch the social and cultural meaning of listening and the impact of our perception of sounds on our view of the world; it shows what historians can hear of the past and what remains inaudible; it discusses the effects of the inaudibility of the past on our historical understanding; and finally it presents some new perspectives for historical research dealing with the history of listening, with historical soundscapes and their meaning.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1354067X12456716"><title>Introduction: The sound of silence</title>
<p>Historians are in an almost singular position with regard to the object of their academic research. Unlike most other disciplines, the study of history concentrates on phenomena that are no longer present. Historians try to explore people, events and processes that have passed. This means that they have no immediate access to what has happened, whether something occurred only yesterday or 2,000 years ago. There is only one way to preserve and to pass on the knowledge about bygone times: the creation and tradition of memory. Historians are craftsmen of memory, because they use the more or less random relics of the past to form and arrange a mental image of something that is no longer physically present. These relics, or, as they are called in historical research, sources, may be physical objects such as ruins of buildings, tools, clothes etc. They may be social and political structures or powerful ideas that still have an influence on the present. Yet for historians, the most important sources in their effort to reconstruct the past have been texts, that is, written documents. The invention of writing in the first advanced civilizations about 5,000 years ago made it possible to record events, ideas, and intentions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354067X12456716">Robinson, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354067X12456716">2009</xref>). His-torical research relies to a very considerable extent on the written sources.</p>
<p>Another method of permanently recording fleeting events and thereby making the past available to the memory of later generations is the making of pictures. The oldest pictures that have been preserved date from the Mesolithic, the period about 30,000 B.C., when our ancestors began to draw on the inner walls of caves graphic depictions of events and impressions that were important to them. Drawing and painting, and later on sculpting, remained for a very long time the only methods to produce images. Since the middle of the 19th century, new techniques such as photography and the motion picture film have vastly expanded the possibilities to create images that are true to the original. In recent times, historians have increasingly paid attention to images of the past preserved in pictures of all sorts, as the so-called “iconic turn” made it clear that our conception of the past relies to a very considerable extent on the depictions of past events and persons. Nowadays, serious historians can no longer ignore the visual sources in their research.</p>
<p>Written documents of all kinds, and, more recently, pictures and images, have been the materials used by historians to recreate the past. Both kinds of sources are perceived visually, that is by means of our eyes. Historians rely in their research almost exclusively on their power of vision. They <italic>look</italic> at the sources and they form an <italic>image</italic> of the past – this has always been and still is the primary, often the only, form in which the past is perceived and consequently interpreted. Very rarely, historians become aware that knowledge of the past might be acquired by other means. This is certainly to a considerable extent a consequence of the fact that for the more remote historical periods there are only written texts, physical relics or pictures that may be used as source material, but no acoustic documents. Only for the period since the late 19th century, when technical innovations made it possible to make sound recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354067X12456716">Morton, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354067X12456716">2004</xref>), do we have the opportunity to listen to the original sound of history. This means that for the greatest part of the history of humanity we do have only a very restricted way to appropriate the past – our historical memory is full of images, but almost void of sounds. The inaudibility of the greatest part of history cannot be overcome, since the sounds of history have irrevocably died away. As historians we must apparently be content with the “sound of silence”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354067X12456716">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In historical research, as well as in academic teaching, the silence of history is usually taken for granted. Historians do not seem to require in their daily tasks the human capacity of hearing, because the object of their work does not offer anything that one might hear – yet we do not only abstain from straining our ears for sounds of the past, we also ignore the role which listening plays in specific historical situations. This is a self-imposed deafness with serious consequences for historical cognition and interpretation. One of the few historians who have been studying the history of listening, the Canadian Peter Bailey, reproached his colleagues with a “glaring/blaring deficiency in their reconstruction and understanding of their own and other cultures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X12456716">Bailey, 1996</xref>, p. 49).</p>
<p>The cognitive bias in the way most historians do their job has been unchallenged for a very long time. We have a firm belief that we must be able to see in order to research the past, and at the same time we think that we can do without listening. The places where historians do their research – the archives, libraries, museums, and the original historical sites such as castles, churches or landscapes – do not tell anything to those who cannot see. It is virtually impossible for blind persons to work as historians, because they cannot read the historical texts or see the pictures of the past. On the other hand, there are plenty of deaf historians, and this is not meant in the literal sense that their capacity of hearing is impaired in a physiological way. Such a handicap would perhaps make it impossible to work as an academic teacher, but it would in no way prevent a person from doing historical research and writing academic history books. Yet, astonishingly, most historians behave as if they were deaf. They believe that they cannot hear the sounds of past times, because these sounds have vanished, and in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy they do not even try to make use of their capacity of hearing in their research or in their teaching. This is why the history of listening and the sounds of the past have been and still are so blatantly neglected by most historians. Few of them pay close attention to these aspects and do try to investigate the historical importance of hearing and the sound spheres of the past. Only in recent years has historical research begun to pay attention to the sound of history. On the whole, however, historical sound studies remain a peripheral field of research that is barely registered in the mainstream of historical work. The numerous general introductions into the study of history almost completely ignore the epistemological problem of the inaudibility of the past; acoustic sources and their possible value for a history of listening remain undiscussed.</p>
<p>So much for the general situation. In the following I will try to discuss some central aspects of the topic “history and hearing” by focusing on four questions: 1) What is “hearing”? 2) What can historians hear when listening to the past and what not? 3) What does it mean that we cannot hear the greater part of history? 4) What is the intention of the history of listening and what may be its results? Finally, the article will come to an end with some remarks on the possibility of an “aural turn” in historiography.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1354067X12456716"><title>What is “hearing”?</title>
<p>The question “What is hearing?” does not refer to the physical and physiological aspects of hearing, that is, the human capacity to perceive acoustic signs transmitted via sound waves and absorbed by special sense organs. “Hearing” shall rather be regarded as a social and cultural capacity that shapes men’s and women’s concepts of their world and influences their actions in given historical contexts. So far the anthropology of hearing has been treated mainly by ethnologists and musicologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X12456716">Baumann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354067X12456716">Matussek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354067X12456716">Ricci, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354067X12456716">2005</xref>). A systematic <italic>historical</italic> anthropology of hearing based on the various medical, physical, and psychological aspects involved has not been developed. The following remarks can therefore only be an attempt to sketch some fundamental functions of hearing in order to point out the potential of acoustic perception for historical research and historical explanation.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1354067X12456716"><title>Hearing is a source of information</title>
<p>The capacity of hearing enables men and women to perceive an almost unlimited number of different sounds, and thereby it gives access to a wealth of information that would otherwise be lost, as certain pieces of information can be transmitted only acoustically. In our modern world, we rely in virtually all areas of everyday life on the acoustic transmitting of information, so much so that those persons who have a hearing handicap cannot fully take part in certain spheres of life – concerts, debates and radio broadcasts, for instance. In all human societies, the acoustic transfer and exchange of information has always been a very important form of social intercourse, the more so the farther we go back into the past.</p>
<p>The ability to record conversations, commands, intentions and ideas in writing, and to visualize events, ceremonies, impressions and feelings in images is justly regarded as a mark of intellectual progress in history. Yet we must also admit that a human society may exist without writing and pictures, but not without the capacity to produce and hear sounds. The fundamental importance of the ability of human beings to make sounds and to perceive them is shown by the fact that newborn children have only a very dim visual impression of their environment, whereas they have a perfect command of the method of acoustic information exchange: at the very beginning of their lives they rely almost exclusively on their ability to give articulation to their needs by producing sounds, and they also can perceive the acoustic signs of their environment. The capacity of hearing as a means of information exchange emerges even before birth, as the foetus is able to perceive sounds in the uterus. Ontogenetically, as well as phylogenetically, the capacity of hearing is the earliest of the human senses. Human perception of the environment begins with listening; the ear is the first and possibly most important organ in the process of anthropogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354067X12456716">Karst, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1354067X12456716">Tomatis, 1981</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1354067X12456716"><title>Hearing is a tool of orientation</title>
<p>The multitude of different sounds that we are able to perceive and discriminate makes hearing a very sophisticated tool of orientation. Individuals as well as groups use hearing as an aid to navigate in physical space, but also in political, social and cultural space. Each of these spaces has a typical sound sphere or soundscape which is subject to historical change – this is why historians may learn a lot about a given historical period by listening to its particular sounds. The term soundscape was coined in the 1960s by the Canadian composer, music educator and acoustic ecologist R. Murray Schafer, who in his “World Soundscape Project” tried to analyze the specific ensembles of sounds prevailing in and characteristic of certain periods and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354067X12456716">Murray Schafer, 1977</xref>). Particular sounds and combinations of sounds define historical eras as well as historical places: a village sounds different from a town, a shop and a monastery produce very dissimilar acoustic signs, a classroom in an elementary school has a different soundscape than a lecture hall in a college. Not only do actual rooms have a specific soundscape, but also symbolic rooms such as nations which quite often make collective acoustic experiences which help to shape the national identity. In Germany, a very characteristic example is the euphoric radio broadcast of the soccer world cup final in 1954, when 9 years after World War II the German team won the title. This sound event became a fundamental element of the national and political identity in post-war Germany, a hearing experience that immediately turned into a universally known and shared emotional point of reference in the German historical consciousness. We have learned in the course of the 20th century that sounds and listening experiences can turn into powerful “lieux de memoire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354067X12456716">Nora, 1984–1992</xref>), symbolic places that provide orientation in the continuum of history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1354067X12456716"><title>Hearing is a means to gather experience</title>
<p>Closely related to the function of hearing as a tool of orientation in physical or symbolic spaces is the fact that individuals, as well as groups that are accustomed to and familiar with the specific soundscapes of their environment, are in a position to gather a complex set of experience which enables them to act adequately in certain expected or even unexpected situations. This is quite obvious in the case of sounds that we associate with imminent danger. The howling of wolves alerted the medieval traveller to be on his guard in the same way as the noise of an approaching vehicle warns the modern pedestrian. In both cases the inability to hear could be fatal. The importance of hearing sounds in order to be alert to danger may also be deduced from the fact that we cannot close our ears. Our ears are always open, even in our sleep. And sometimes they give us warnings even when they do not hear anything at all, that is, when the expected soundscape is interrupted: In the morning of 9/11 many people in the big cities in America and in Europe registered that something important and unexpected must have happened, because all of a sudden the aircraft noise ceased altogether. Similar examples for the power of acoustic perceptions to influence men’s experience and expectations can be looked for in any historical period, and if historians begin to do so they will certainly find particular types of auditive experience that are specific for certain historical contexts. The “history of experience”, which has in recent years been established as a new access to the exploration of bygone worlds and their psychological setting, could probably benefit from a closer look at, or rather listening to, the noises of the past and their impact on the actions of men and women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1354067X12456716"><title>Hearing is a prime component of communication</title>
<p>The capacity of hearing is a necessary requirement for oral communication. In this respect, hearing is also an indispensable premise for the evolution of human civilization. Hearing and speaking are prior to writing and reading, in the life of individual people as well as in the development of human cultures. For a very long time in the history of mankind, the dominant means of communication – which by the way does not require any technological aids and skills – was the most elemental form of telling and listening. Western culture, and probably most others too, was originally not a culture of looking, but of listening. Spoken, not written, language was for the longest time of our history the predominant form of communication and social as well as political interaction. Even today in our highly sophisticated modern world, which seems to rely mainly on written and visual communication, orality still plays a very important role, and it is, in some ways, a more exacting challenge for historical research than the former: By far the greatest part of oral communication, for instance personal talks between politicians, is lost to the historians, because it is not recorded. Yet sometimes oral communication can have a crucial effect, if it is inadvertently listened to or illegally overheard: A famous example that changed the course of American history is the Watergate tapes that led to the end of Richard Nixon’s presidency in 1974.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1354067X12456716"><title>What can historians hear when listening to the past and what not?</title>
<p>To begin with, historians can hear next to nothing from the past with their own ears. The first sound recording was made in the year 1860 by the French scientist Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville (1817–1879). He developed a so-called “phonautograph”, on which recently was found a recording of the song “Au clair de la lune”, performed by a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354067X12456716">Rosen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>All acoustic phenomena previously produced by man are irretrievably lost – the greatest part of our history is inaudible. We can gain an idea of what is missing, if we try to imagine what our picture of the 20th century would be like without sound recordings: We would have no idea of the way the speeches of Hitler, Goebbels, Churchill, Kennedy, Martin Luther King and other important figures sounded; we would have no acoustic impression of the noise of the bombings in World War II – instead we should be forced to have recourse to descriptions of witnesses. And this is just the situation that we find ourselves in for the time before 1900.</p>
<p>There are, however, some exceptions which allow us to have an immediate and authentic impression of the original sound of history. First of all, there still exist some artefacts that produce the same noises as they did hundreds of years ago: most obviously the church bells, for instance the five old bells in the Magdeburg cathedral which were made between the 13th and 18th centuries and still continue to strike the hours. Another example are old steam engines of the 19th century which are kept running on historic railway lines as a tourist attraction and which reproduce a bygone travelling experience and the noises connected with it. And there are mechanical typewriters whose typical clicking used to be an essential element of the soundscape of office rooms, before they were replaced by electronic word processing devices at the end of the last century. In the sphere of high and popular culture, the sounds of the past are permanently kept alive by historic musical instruments – Stradivari violins made and played more than 300 years ago are still being used by contemporary virtuosos in concerts and studio recordings, vintage saxophones made in the 1940s and 1950s are still held in high esteem by musicians and can be heard at almost any Jazz venue.</p>
<p>In the sphere of musical performances, we do not only have historic instruments producing the same sounds as in former times. The various systems of musical notation, the earliest of which seem to have been devised in ancient Egypt, made it possible to write down musical compositions and to perform them not only in the time of their origin but hundreds of years later, thereby reproducing a musical event of the past in an almost authentic form. Presumably, it will be impossible to recreate the complex soundscape and listening experience of an opera, as it was originally performed in the 18th or 19th centuries. However, historically-informed performances attempting to come as near as possible to the style of musical events in the past can certainly give us an adequate impression of what our ancestors were hearing when attending a concert.</p>
<p>Soundscapes of the past can in this way be partially revived, if period instruments, tools, and machines or reconstructions of them are available. With human utterances this is absolutely impossible, nothing that was spoken, shouted or sung in the past can be re-enacted in its original acoustic form. We have no access to the authentic soundscapes of court proceedings in ancient Greece, political discussions in the Roman senate, medieval services or parliamentary debates of the 19th century. This means that a very considerable and vital part of the sounds of history is shut off from our perception. Modern historians cannot hear the complex soundscapes of the past prior to 1900 – the direct access to an enormously important dimension of historic experiences is blocked.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354067X12456716">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1354067X12456716"><title>What does it mean that we cannot hear the greater part of history?</title>
<p>A list of acoustic phenomena of the past that cannot be reproduced and listened to would be very extensive. I will concentrate on a single form of historical source material which is used by historians over and over again and which is in itself a medium that relies heavily on an acoustic impression: political speeches. A great number of speeches of almost all historical periods from antiquity to modern times have been preserved, yet – apart from the 20th century – not in their original, authentic form as spoken words before an audience, but rather as written texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456716">Ader &amp; Krüger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354067X12456716">Brodersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1354067X12456716">Stüwe &amp; Stüwe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1354067X12456716">Suriano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1354067X12456716">Tönnies &amp; Viol, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1354067X12456716">Wende &amp; Recker, 1999</xref>). “The power of speech”, as a recently published study of rhetoric in ancient Greece is entitled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1354067X12456716">Stroh, 2009</xref>), unfolds primarily in the spoken, not in the written word, speeches in the first place are directed towards listeners, not to readers. From the beginning in ancient Greece up to the present time, rhetoric, the art of speaking, has been based on auditive effect, the intention being to impress and convince the listeners not only by stringent argument, but also by the power of sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1354067X12456716">Ueding, 1996</xref>). In the light of this, it will be obvious how much is lost when the acoustic dimension of speeches is lacking. Historians have resigned themselves to their inability to hear the voices of the great orators of antiquity, the middle ages, and the greater part of the modern era – no Pericles, no Cicero, no Abaelard, no Luther, no Jefferson, no Lincoln, no Bismarck. The severe constraint to which historical research is submitted by the fact that the volume of past speeches is completely turned off becomes evident when we listen to Martin Luther King’s famous speech “I have a dream”, delivered before a mass audience in Washington on 28 August, 1963 – and recorded, so that we can still hear the original voice of the speaker, his intonation, and the reactions of his audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354067X12456716">King, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>In the recent history of Germany, political speeches and orators, or rather agitators, played a very important, though singularly infamous role, I mean the Nazi leaders, above all Hitler and Goebbels, whose public speeches have been recorded. These recordings show how limited our knowledge of the oratorial impact must remain, if we can only read but not hear the speeches. Hitler’s oratorical style, his intonation and articulation, his phrasing sound bizarre, even ridiculous to our ears, and it is almost unconceivable that his speeches had such an immense mobilizing power. Another prominent figure in modern German history, who also was a very convincing speaker, is Otto von Bismarck, the chancellor of the German Empire founded in 1871. Prominent contemporaries who witnessed his speeches have reported that Bismarck had a rather high-pitched voice which made for a curious contrast to his imposing bodily stature. Due to this acoustic peculiarity, Bismarck’s spoken words certainly made an impression on his audience that is quite different from the effect his speeches have when read by later historians. Likewise, the provincial accents of British politicians such as Robert Peel, William E. Gladstone or David Lloyd-George would sound odd to contemporary audiences. The role of spoken words, of speeches that are heard by large audiences, was recently brought home to the public by the film about King George VI, who overcame his speech impediment by the aid of a speech therapist and delivered a very impressive radio address to millions of listeners at the beginning of World War II in September 1939 (The King’s Speech, 2011).</p>
<p>Furthermore, historians sometimes tend to overlook – or over<italic>hear</italic>, to be more precise – that speeches may lose their intended effect, when the audience does not hear what is being said. The immediate emotional impact is linked to and dependent of the act of speaking and listening, and it cannot be reproduced by a later publication in a written or printed document. I found an example for this in the course of my research about the German national movement of the 1860s, when German nationalists were publicly urging the reigning monarchs of the many petty German states to make way for the creation of a unified nation state. Many national associations held big mass meetings and national festivals, where their leaders spoke to the people. When, in July 1862, the First National Festival of the German Shooting Clubs took place in Frankfurt, an observing diplomat wrote in a reassuring report to his government, that the speeches did not have an immediate effect, “for the simple reason, that very few listeners could actually hear the words in the deafening noise of the festival hall” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354067X12456716">Müller, 2012</xref>, p. 716).</p>
<p>The speakers themselves consider the acoustic and sensory aspect of their speeches to be very important. In the beginning of the 20th century, when sound recordings had just become possible, some historic speeches were recorded some time after they had been held, in order to preserve them as valuable acoustic documents. The proclamation of Emperor Wilhelm II to the German people, originally delivered at the beginning of the war on 6 August, 1914, was spoken on tape by the monarch on 10 January, 1918, and published shortly afterwards. A few months later, on 9 November, 1918, another epoch-making speech was delivered by the German member of parliament, Philipp Scheidemann, from the balcony of the parliament building in Berlin. He proclaimed the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the German republic, yet the recording of his speech did not take place at the original occasion, but no less than 14 months later, when Scheidemann’s speech was belatedly recorded in a broadcasting studio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354067X12456716">Meyer-Kahrweg, 1998</xref>, compact disc 1, chap. 9 and 14).</p>
<p>It is quite remarkable that in more remote periods, when sounds could not be recorded, the mobilizing power of public speeches played an important role in the political calculation. A fine example is the so-called Tilbury speech of Queen Elizabeth I, a proclamation which later became a central expression of English national identity. Elizabeth purportedly held this speech in the year 1588 in front of the troops which had been assembled at the mouth of the river Thames, in order to deter invasion by the Spanish Armada. Historical research has shown, however, that the famous speech cannot have been delivered <italic>before</italic> the wreck of the Spanish fleet, as the national legend has always claimed. If the speech was given at all, which is not beyond doubt, it could not have been earlier than eleven days <italic>after</italic> the defeat of the Spanish ships. Moreover, the earliest source of the text is a letter written by the Queen’s former chaplain 35 years after the event, in 1623, and first published in 1654 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354067X12456716">Key &amp; Bucholz, 2009</xref>, p. 89ff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1354067X12456716">Williams, 1998</xref>, p. 323). This is not a very reliable evidence for the authenticity of Elizabeth’s speech, yet in historical books it is usually quoted without a shadow of doubt, and in some recent movies about the reign of Elizabeth I, the Tilbury speech is staged as an indubitable historical fact in a way designed to carry the audience away.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354067X12456716">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The short glance at the importance of speeches in history has revealed a fundamental characteristic of acoustic resonance. What we hear has – and this applies also to what we smell, taste and touch – a very powerful emotional effect which we are seldom fully aware of, particularly in our capacity as academic researchers of history bent over written documents and books which are mute to our ears. That we cannot hear the noise of the past, is a severe limitation to our understanding of historical events and processes. If we are unable to hear the sound of history, our understanding of the past must remain fragmentary and deficient. But this is a limitation that also applies to our sense of vision, on which we rely so much: When we look at historical pictures, we perceive the past mainly in black and white, not in colour.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1354067X12456716"><title>What is the intention of the history of listening and what may be its results?</title>
<p>The history of listening is a relatively new field of research working on acoustic phenomena and their functions and effects in given historical contexts. It uses a variety of methods and source materials, and it focuses on different aspects of the auditory dimension of history. An important object of research is orality as a system of communication and perception that has been at the centre of political and social interaction in the history of mankind. Another trend that is becoming increasingly important is devoting its efforts to the reconstruction of historical soundscapes and acoustic spaces. There are also studies focusing not on complex sound spheres, but on the structuring or mobilizing power of specific sounds or kinds of noise that are typical for historical situations or periods.</p>
<p>Before I take a closer look at the various approaches, it is necessary to point out that the history of listening or sound history did not originate within the academic discipline of historical studies. The impetus came from outside, namely from the “sound studies” which were established in North America in the 1960s under the guidance of R. Murray Schafer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354067X12456716">Murray Schafer, 1977</xref>). Up to the present time, the sound studies constitute an array of various disciplines and research strategies, the most prominent being media and communication studies, anthropology, sociology, philosophy, psychology, musicology, literary studies and theatre studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354067X12456716">Pinch &amp; Bijsterveld, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354067X12456716">Schulze, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354067X12456716">Smith, 2004</xref>). Studies based on a specific historical approach and methodology are still scarce, the few “proper” historians actively involved in sound studies constitute a very small minority operating at the margin of historical research.</p>
<p>The significance of sound as an historical agent was brought to the historians’ attention by an acoustic phenomenon that was very loud and can still be heard today: I mean the enormous increase of mechanically produced noise originating in the industrial revolution beginning at the end of the 18th century. The invention of many new machines and the rapidly expanding use of the often very noisy technical devices in workshops and factories, shortly afterwards the modern means of transport such as railways, tramways, automobiles and finally airplanes, brought about a complete change of the public soundscapes, at first in the big cities, but soon in the countryside as well. From the very beginning the contemporaries perceived the transformation of their acoustic environment that for hundreds of years had remained stable and was now all of a sudden completely different. Most observers or rather listeners exposed to the loud and grating noise of machines and combustible engines thought that circumstances had changed very much for the worse. Charles Dickens (1812–1870) called London a “monster, roaring in the distance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354067X12456716">Dickens, 1848</xref>, ch. 33), and his German contemporary Adalbert Stifter (1805–1868) described the noise in the Austrian capital Vienna as “a single heavy, muffled, continuous pounding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354067X12456716">Payer, 2003</xref>). Many others spoke more prosaically of an unbearable “noise plague” which caused nervous disorders and physical diseases.</p>
<p>Around the year 1900, in Europe as well as in North America, a public movement for noise protection or noise control came into life and began to fight against the “diabolical symphony of the mechanical age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X12456716">Bijsterveld, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X12456716">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354067X12456716">Braun, 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, the modern “age of noise” has become the object of an increasing number of historical studies, which mostly focus on the urban soundscapes of big cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354067X12456716">Payer, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354067X12456716">Payer, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354067X12456716">2004/2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354067X12456716">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354067X12456716">2009</xref>). The earlier concentration on the big noise producers such as factories and metropolitan traffic has given way to a more encompassing approach which also takes into consideration the musical culture, the public leisure activities or the forms and effects of public speaking in town.</p>
<p>One of the most ear-splitting events of the 20th century, the First World War, has recently been analyzed with particular emphasis on the sensorial perception of the war. In her study of the “moments of danger”, Julia Encke sounded out, among others, the acoustic stimuli to which the soldiers at the front were exposed. She didn’t, however, base her research on sound recordings, but on accounts in war diaries, press reports, contemporary scientific treatises – namely by physicians and psychiatrists describing the effects of shell-shock – and literary sources such as war poems and novels. Encke used these sources to reconstruct the conditions of hearing and the listening experiences on the battlefields and the interpretation of the sound of the war in the post-war years, or, in other words, the creation of a distinct acoustic memory of wartime sound experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354067X12456716">Encke, 2006</xref>, p. 111 ff.).</p>
<p>The soundscape of modernity and the American culture of listening in the early 20th century have recently been examined by Emily Thompson, who focused on architectural acoustics, that is the deliberate design of particular sound patterns for buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354067X12456716">Thompson, 2002</xref>), a process where the cultural and psychological dimensions of sounds and their perception under certain spatial and temporal circumstances become very obvious. Sound design, acoustic conditioning and sonification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354067X12456716">Schoon &amp; Volmar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1354067X12456716">Spehr, 2009</xref>) are nowadays very important factors in modern architecture, automobile manufacture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354067X12456716">Cleophas &amp; Bijsterveld, 2012</xref>), and in entertainment electronics. From a historical point of view, this is not an entirely new phenomenon, although historians so far have not paid much attention to the sound design of past eras which was motivated by cultural, political and religious intentions. One could, for instance, inquire to what extent and by which means sound design was practiced in the planning and construction of cathedrals, palaces and opera houses, or whether the generation of specific sound patterns was a premeditated factor in the manufacture of machines and weapons.</p>
<p>The technological innovations of the 19th and early 20th centuries – telephone, phonograph, broadcasting, microphone etc. – and their effect on the creation of a specific modern soundscape are the subject of a study by the Canadian historian Jonathan Sterne published a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1354067X12456716">Sterne, 2003</xref>). Sterne refutes the wide-spread opinion that there has been in modern Western culture a movement away from listening in favour of looking, resulting in a preponderance of the visual. Instead he insists on the continuing centrality of sound: “sound, hearing, and listening are central to the cultural life of modernity, where sound, hearing, and listening are foundational to modern knowledge, culture, and social organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1354067X12456716">Sterne, 2003</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>So far, historical sound studies have focused mainly on modern history with particular emphasis on the urban societies of Europe and North America. In contrast, the pre-industrial, predominantly rural world before the 19th century is a very poorly tilled field in terms of the history of sounds and of listening. This is to a large extent due to the dearth of perceptible authentic sounds from the pre-modern periods. Historians attempting to reconstruct the soundscapes of early historical ages cannot fall back on personal listening experiences, nor do they have at their disposal original sound recordings. Instead they must completely rely on written sources.</p>
<p>The further we go back in time, the more difficult is it to research the constituent acoustic phenomena of a political, social and cultural structure and its specific auditive code. It is nonetheless not entirely futile to research the soundscapes, the hearing conditions, and the listening experiences of distant historical periods. Older works about ancient history have described the urban noise in Rome or explained the function of music in the life of the Roman population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456716">Bélis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354067X12456716">Friedlaender, 1908–1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1354067X12456716">Wille, 1967</xref>). In the histories by Greek and Roman authors we can find plenty of reports about the noisy debates and vociferous quarrels in the courts, popular assemblies, and senates. In a recent study, the Italian historian Maurizio Bettini tried to answer the question “Qual era la fonosfera degli antichi?” (“What was the sound sphere of men in the ancient world like?”). He combed through the writings of ancient authors in order to find out how the sounds produced by animals were described, interpreted, imitated and sometimes imported into human language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456716">Bettini, 2008</xref>). It must also be mentioned that musical archaeology and ethnology are becoming an increasingly important field of research in the study of ancient societies, as researchers try to reconstruct ancient music and its function in daily life as well as in religious and secular ritual practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354067X12456716">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Proceeding to medieval history, one might be tempted to say at first glance that this was not only a dark age, but also a mute one. There are at present only very few studies on the history of listening in the Middle Ages. Apart from a short sketch of the specific aspects of medieval sounds and their perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1354067X12456716">Wagner, 2006</xref>), I could find only one major work about “listening and seeing” in medieval times, in which various acoustic features are treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354067X12456716">Wenzel, 1995</xref>). In particular, the author, Horst Wenzel, analyzed church buildings as acoustic spaces, the soundscape of princely courts, the way how acoustic perception is described in medieval texts, and distinct forms of medieval orality. Medieval government, argues Wenzel, was based to a considerable extent on “acoustic representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354067X12456716">Wenzel, 1995</xref>, p. 143) being performed in special physical and symbolic spaces. “Representative sound” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354067X12456716">Wenzel, 1995</xref>, p. 143) was an expression of the political, social, and economic organization of medieval Europe.</p>
<p>The acoustic world of early modern England has been surveyed by Bruce R. Smith in a book published in 1999. Smith describes the specific soundscapes of the towns, the countryside, and the court, and he analyzes the acoustic sphere of the London theatres in the era of Shakespeare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1354067X12456716">Smith, 1999</xref>; for the noise of London see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X12456716">Ackroyd, 2000</xref>, pp. 71–80). Other studies investigate music and society in early modern England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354067X12456716">Marsh, 2010</xref>) or the acoustic relationship between English preachers and their audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354067X12456716">Hunt, 2010</xref>). The soundscapes of early America and of Victorian Britain have been explored in two books published in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354067X12456716">Rath, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354067X12456716">Picker, 2003</xref>). The acoustic impact of early American industrialization is the subject of a newly published article by Mark M. Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354067X12456716">Smith, 2012</xref>). For the 19th century, the French historian Alain Corbin has shown in a masterly study, first published in 1995, how the church bells shaped the rural culture, the emotional culture, and the collective identity in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354067X12456716">Corbin, 1998</xref>).</p>
    <p>The emotional impact of music has in recent years been examined in a number of historical studies: Celia Applegate and others looked into the connection between music and German national identity in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354067X12456716">Alter &amp; Koepnick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354067X12456716">Applegate, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354067X12456716">Applegate &amp; Potter, 2002</xref>); Jessica Gienow-Hecht wrote about music and emotions in transatlantic relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354067X12456716">Gienow-Hecht, 2009</xref>); Hansjakob Ziemer described the concert as an “urban forum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1354067X12456716">Ziemer, 2008</xref>); Alex Ross investigated the acoustic characteristics of musical culture in the course of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354067X12456716">Ross, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The political function of music in history is a field of study that is attracting an increasing amount of research. In 2001, the German historian Dieter Senghaas published a book about symphonic compositions from the 17th century onwards as “listening experiences” and “musical events” in their respective political and social contexts, where they played a significant role in the shaping of the particular cultural identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354067X12456716">Senghaas, 2001</xref>). The same author is also co-editor of a collection of articles investigating the functions and effects of music in various historical periods, with a particular focus on the question: “Can music make peace audible?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354067X12456716">Lück &amp; Senghaas, 2005</xref>). This volume contains, among many others, a fascinating article about the use of music in the German Empire at the end of the 19th century, showing that the public performing of and the listening to music and songs was an important element of national identity and political mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354067X12456716">Giesebrecht, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, the opera was not only a typical form of artistic expression, but also a relevant factor in social and political life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354067X12456716">Johnson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354067X12456716">Müller, Ther, Toelle, &amp; zur Nieden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354067X12456716">Ther, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1354067X12456716">Walter, 1997</xref>). Opera performances, ceremonial cantatas and musical tournaments were more than cultural events and public entertainments: the ruling elites used them to make politics “by sensorial means”, operas and festivals funded by and performed at the princely courts were “acoustic demonstrations of government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354067X12456716">Werr, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354067X12456716">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The studies about the political and social impact of operas and other musical events benefit by the fact that these works can still be made audible today by performing them. Historians are able to have an authentic acoustic impression of the original compositions, although the entire sensorial experience of the historic performance can apparently not be reproduced. Apart from musical works, the actual audibility of the past does not reach back farther than the 19th century, when the invention of machines for acoustic recordings induced the “birth of authenticity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354067X12456716">Osterhammel, 2009</xref>, pp. 76–83). This means that most historical research about the impact of sounds cannot be based on acoustic sources actually heard by the historians. Instead, they must attempt to reconstruct the sounds of the past and their historical relevance from written sources. Yet even under this constriction, historical sound studies can give access to the acoustic dimension of past experience and cultural as well as socio-political knowledge. From this point of view it might be argued that historians should no longer resign themselves to their deafness to the sound of history. Historical research claiming to give an account of the past that is as accurate and comprehensive as possible must direct its attention to the sounds, their perception, and their effect on the course of things. There are different ways of doing this:
<list id="list1-1354067X12456716" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Regarding recent history from about 1900 onwards we should make a more extensive use of the recorded sound documents both in research and in academic teaching. These acoustic sources are stored in the broadcasting archives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354067X12456716">Lance, 1983</xref>) and can be easily accessed by the modern electronic media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354067X12456716">6</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The soundscapes of earlier historical periods can be reconstructed through written accounts of the specific noises of the past and their effects on the cultural, social, and political life. As historians are studying pictures and visual memories, they may also investigate the auditive codes of past epochs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Another promising approach might be to concentrate on particular sources of sound and to explore their role in a given historical context. Objects of research could be the town criers of the early modern age, or the factory horns that came into use during the 19th century, or the ubiquitous noise producers of the 20th century: cars and airplanes in combination with their increasingly complex infrastructure like roads and airports which have generated permanent political and social conflicts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A very instructive line of research seems to be the question how oral communication works in different historical situations. How, for instance, is it possible that the speeches of famous military leaders to their armies in critical situations are answered by the cheering of thousands of soldiers, although the speaker didn’t have a microphone? What did the audience hear at all? How was rumour being spread in situations of political crisis such as the <italic>journées</italic> of the French Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354067X12456716">Schulze, 1989</xref>)? What is the effect of the intonation and articulation of a public speech on the ensuing actions and decisions?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, it is necessary to research systematically and thoroughly the aims for which certain sounds were being used in history. The frequent instrumental use of sounds for political or ideological objectives in history is all too obvious, yet there are hardly any comprehensive studies on this phenomenon. In our own time the use, or rather abuse, of sounds for ideological purposes has been brought to our ears by Camp Guantanamo where the prisoners were exposed for hours to loud music in order to wear them down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354067X12456716">Goodman, 2010</xref>; see also: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.watoday.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/the-torture-never-stops-death-by-a-hundred-decibels-20091026-hgbw.html">http://www.watoday.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/the-torture-never-stops-death-by-a-hundred-decibels-20091026-hgbw.html</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28144557">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28144557</ext-link>). As “terror arrives first through the ear” (J. B. Priestley, quoted by Bailey, 1996, p. 51 ff.; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354067X12456716">Gess, Schreiner, &amp; Schulz, 2005</xref>), blaring noise was frequently used in history as an instrument of attrition and terror, for instance, the “rough noise” in 18th-century England which aimed to intimidate or mock persons who had deviated from traditional norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1354067X12456716">Thompson, 1991</xref>), or the ceremonial caterwauling in early modern France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354067X12456716">Darnton, 1985</xref>). On the other hand, music need not necessarily be loud or cacophonous to have a deterrent effect. The German national railway company tries to keep drug addicts out of Hamburg Central Station by permanently playing classical music in the pedestrian subways. The same method is used by town councils with the object to keep away unwelcome persons from posh pedestrian zones and shopping malls. Noise, whether melodious or cacophonous, soporific or irritating, low or loud, is a powerful medium of public manipulation which historical research must take into account.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec10-1354067X12456716"><title>An “aural turn” in historiography?</title>
<p>The short sketch of the various approaches towards a history of sounds and listening makes clear that this line of research promises to be very fertile. There are, of course, many methodical and epistemological problems, as the cognitive barrier between the inaudible past and the modern historian will always be a serious challenge to the reconstruction of historical soundscapes and acoustic memories. These obstacles, however, are by no means a unique feature of historical sound studies. When historians rely on written sources and pictures to gain access to the past, they also must develop research methods and instruments to decode their source material and to extract historical knowledge from the more or less accidental, always fragmentary, and often quite unintelligible remains of past ages. From this point of view, there is no reason why it should be impossible to find methods that allow us to gain access to the sound of history, even if there are now acoustic documents which enable us to listen to the authentic sound.</p>
<p>In the past decades, historical research has taken several “turns” which have widened our understanding of the past. An “aural turn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1354067X12456716">Yablon, 2007</xref>, p. 629) could open another dimension of historical experience to modern research, and in recent years the concept has emerged in the writings of cultural anthropologists, (musical) ethnologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X12456716">Bendix, 2000</xref>) and sociologists. The leading role in this debate is played by Anglo-American scholars exploring the auditory or hearing cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354067X12456716">Bull &amp; Back, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354067X12456716">Erlmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354067X12456716">Smith, 2004</xref>), but there are an increasing number of scholars in Europe, and Germany in particular, who direct their attention to aural or acoustic phenomena. It seems to be incontestable that a greater attention to the importance of sound and listening will considerably enhance our knowledge of history. Historians must learn to listen to the sound of history and thereby avail themselves in their research as well as in academic teaching of the opportunities which acoustic experience and acoustic memory offer for a deeper understanding of the actions and decisions of men and women in the past.</p>

<fn id="fn1-1354067X12456716"><label>1</label><p>I am very indebted to the American pop duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel whose immortal song, first recorded in 1964 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1354067X12456716">Simon &amp; Garfunkel, 1964</xref>, side 1, track 6), is not only a lasting acoustic impression of my youth but also proved to be a very adequate metaphor for the problem discussed in the present article.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1354067X12456716"><label>2</label><p>There are of course, beyond academic historical research, sophisticated reconstructions of past soundscapes in movies and radio broadcasts about historical events. Yet these sound tracks, which have certainly an enormous influence on the public reception of history, are acoustic artefacts motivated primarily by artistic and commercial, not by scientific, considerations. For the representation of history in films, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354067X12456716">Cartledge &amp; Greenland (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354067X12456716">Kiening &amp; Adolf (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354067X12456716">Korte &amp; Paletschek (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354067X12456716">Lindner (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354067X12456716">Meier &amp; Slanička (2007)</xref>.</p></fn>
