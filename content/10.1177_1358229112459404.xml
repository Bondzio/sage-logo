<abstract>
<p>The Court of Appeal in <italic>Hounga v Allen &amp; Anor</italic> [2012] EWCA Civ 609 had to decide whether someone working illegally in the United Kingdom, was entitled to bring a claim for dismissal discrimination under the now repealed Race Relations Act 1976. The Court of Appeal, unlike the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal, which had accepted Ms Hounga's claim, refused to allow her to bring the claim because she was working under an illegal contract of employment. The decision was on the grounds of public policy. The Court of Appeal was anxious to avoid being seen as condoning her illegality and would not allow her to enforce the illegal contract of employment. Consequentially, Ms Hounga’s employers were not liable for discriminating against her. Taken to an extreme, the effect of the decision in <italic>Hounga v Allen &amp; Anor</italic> would appear to provide a defence to employers who employ illegal immigrants and then discriminate against them.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Is someone who is illegally working in the United Kingdom protected from being discriminated against by their employer? It would appear from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <italic>Hounga v Allen &amp; Anor</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229112459404">1</xref>
</sup> that the answer is no. In this case the Court of Appeal had to decide whether someone working under an illegal contract of employment was entitled to bring a claim for dismissal discrimination under the now repealed Race Relations Act 1976 (RRA 1976).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229112459404">2</xref>
</sup> Delivering the only opinion, Rimer LJ, with whom Longmore LJ and Sir Scott Baker agreed, held that the appellant Ms Mary Hounga should not have been able to bring a claim. This was because she had knowingly worked in the United Kingdom illegally, and for public policy reasons could not be allowed to benefit from her own criminal acts. Both the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1358229112459404">3</xref>
</sup> had held that Ms Hounga could successfully bring a claim for dismissal discrimination pursuant to the RRA 1976, notwithstanding both the tribunals’ decision to dismiss her claims for non-dismissal discrimination and unfair dismissal on the grounds of the illegal nature of her employment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1358229112459404">
<title>Facts of the case</title>
<p>Ms Mary Hounga is a Nigerian national, who was employed in the United Kingdom by the respondent, Mrs Allen and her husband Mr Allen. Whilst still living in Nigeria, Ms Hounga had been informed by Mrs Allen’s mother that her daughter required an au pair to look after her three children. It was agreed that Ms Hounga would earn £50 per month for looking after the children. In order for Ms Hounga to work for the Allens, it was decided that Ms Hounga would obtain a Nigerian passport in the name of Adeyinka Mary Aboyade-Cole, in order to travel to the United Kingdom on a six-month visitor’s visa. Mrs Allen’s family in Nigeria had helped Ms Hounga concoct a story that she was visiting the United Kingdom to visit her grandmother. This was the story that Ms Hounga told UK immigration officials upon her arrival. Ms Hounga was employed by the Allens between 28 January 2007 and 17 July 2008. Ms Hounga was then dismissed by the Allens and claimed that she had been unfairly dismissed, that her dismissal had been for racially discriminatory grounds and that she had been racially discriminated against during the period of her employment. Ms Hounga additionally claimed breach of contract and that there had been unlawful deductions from her wages and holiday pay. Ms Hounga claimed that she had suffered physical abuse from Mrs Allen, and despite finding some of her accounts to have been exaggerated, this claim was accepted by the Employment Tribunal. Ms Hounga also claimed that she had been threatened by Mrs Allen. Mrs Allen had allegedly informed her that if she left the house she would be arrested by the police as an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>The case was heard by the London Central Employment Tribunal in July 2009. The fact that Ms Hounga was working under an illegal contract of employment was central to the tribunal’s dismissing on public policy grounds her claims for unlawful deduction of wages and holiday pay, unfair dismissal and breach of contract. However, the tribunal held that for the purpose of the RRA 1976 Ms Hounga was employed and that her dismissal amounted to unlawful race discrimination. Ms Hounga’s claim for non-dismissal discrimination was not successful, because she had failed to raise a grievance as required under the now repealed s. 32 of the Employment Act 2002 (EA 2002) with her employers prior to bringing the claim. The tribunal awarded Ms Hongua £6,186.90 in damages. Both Ms Hounga and Mrs Allen appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, with the former arguing that the tribunal had the jurisdiction to hear the claim, and the latter that the claim for dismissal discrimination should be barred on public policy grounds. The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed both appeals. Ms Hounga appealed and Mrs Allen cross-appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1358229112459404">
<title>The law relating to Ms Hounga’s appeal</title>
<p>Central to Ms Hounga’s appeal were s. 32 and Schedule 2 of the EA 2002. Section 32(1) makes reference to Schedule 4, which lists the jurisdictions to which the requirement to submit a grievance prior to bringing a claim applied. The non-dismissal discrimination fell within the jurisdiction of s. 32, whilst the dismissal discrimination did not. The key provisions are outlined below. It must be noted that there is no longer a statutory requirement to submit a grievance procedure prior to commencing a claim.</p>
<p>Section 32(2) stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>An employee shall not present a complaint to an employment tribunal under a jurisdiction to which this section applies if –</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) it concerns a matter in relation to which the requirement in paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2 applies, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) the requirement has not been complied with.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Subsection (3) stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>An employee shall not present a complaint to an employment tribunal under a jurisdiction to which this section applies if –</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) it concerns a matter in relation to which the requirement in paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2 has been complied with, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) less than 28 days have passed since the day on which the requirement was complied with.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Schedule 2 of the EA 2010 established two grievance procedures (paragraph 6 covers the standard procedure and paragraph 9 the modified procedure) with which an employee must comply in order to bring a claim.</p>
<p>The Employment Act 2002 (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2004 (S1 2004/752) gives further guidance on both procedures. Regulation 11 outlines the circumstances when the employee does not have to comply with the grievance procedure prior to bringing their claim.</p>
<p>According to regulation 11(3) these apply where:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) the party has reasonable grounds to believe that commencing the procedure or complying with the subsequent requirement would result in a significant threat to himself, his property, any other person or the property of any other person;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) the party has been subjected to harassment and has reasonable grounds to believe that commencing the procedure or complying with the subsequent requirement would result in his being subjected to further harassment; or</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(c) it is not practicable for the party to commence the procedure or comply with the subsequent requirement within a reasonable period.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Regulation 6(4) stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>Neither of the grievance procedures applies where –</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) the employee has ceased to be employed by the employer;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) neither procedure has been commenced; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(c) since the employer ceased to be employed it has ceased to be reasonably practicable for him to comply with paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2.</p>
</list-item>

<title>The failure to consider the argument that the tribunal had jurisdiction under regulation 11(3)(b) and (c)</title>
<p>Ms Hounga’s representative, Mr Reed (from the Free Representation Unit), had argued that the tribunal had the jurisdiction to hear Ms Hounga’s claim for non-dismissal discrimination. Both the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal had dismissed the argument that under regulation 6(4)(c) it was not reasonably practicable for Ms Hounga to have complied with the Schedule 2 procedure requirements for serving the grievance on the employer. Mr Reed had also argued that the exception under regulation 11(3)(b) applied. The argument under regulation 11(3)(c) that it ‘is not practicable for the party to commence the procedure or comply with the subsequent requirement within a reasonable period’ was not expressly dealt with by either tribunal. Neither was regulation 11(3)(b) addressed by the tribunal. At the Court of Appeal, Ms Hounga was represented by Mr Reade QC. Considering the submissions of Mr Reade QC, the Court of Appeal dismissed the submission from Ms Prince (Mrs Allen’s representative) that the tribunal had implicitly considered the regulation 11(3)(c) argument, at the same time as it had considered and rejected the regulation 6(4)(c) argument.</p>
<p>Rimer LJ stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>I regard as wholly fanciful the suggestion that the regulation 6(4)(c) holding carried with it an implied finding that a ‘reasonable period’ for presenting a grievance for the purposes of regulation 11(3)(c) had not yet expired. The questions posed by regulations 6(4)(c) and 11(3)(c) are manifestly different and the tribunal’s finding in relation to the former carried no implied finding in relation to the latter. The tribunal’s reasoning for refusing a review is, on its face, less than careful.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, the EAT [Employment Appeal Tribunal] also failed to deal with the regulation 11(3)(c) point, although there is no doubt that it was raised. In my judgment, Ms Hounga is justified in complaining that her case under regulation 11(3)(c) has been wrongly overlooked by both tribunals below.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1358229112459404">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>However, Rimer LJ dismissed Ms Hounga’s appeal on the grounds of regulation 11(3)(b), but did allow her appeal on regulation 11(3)(c) grounds, subject to Mrs Allen’s cross-appeal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1358229112459404">5</xref>
</sup> Ultimately, as Mrs Allen’s cross-appeal was successful, Ms Hounga’s claim for non-dismissal discrimination failed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1358229112459404">
<title>Did illegality prevent a claim being brought for dismissal discrimination?</title>
<p>Mrs Allen had cross-appealed, arguing that the illegal nature of Ms Hounga’s employment should prevent her from being able to bring a claim for dismissal discrimination under the RRA 1976. Ms Prince had argued on behalf of her client that if the unfair dismissal claim could not be brought for public policy reasons, then neither should the dismissal discrimination claim.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1358229112459404">6</xref>
</sup> This was regarded as an oversimplification by Mr Reade QC. Commenting on the tribunal's reasoning or lack of it, for allowing Ms Hounga’s claim for dismissal discrimination, but not allowing a claim for unfair dismissal, Rimer LJ stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>The tribunal, unhelpfully, provided no explanation as to why, although it was rejecting Ms Hounga’s claims on public policy grounds insofar as they arose under her contract of employment, it upheld her claim that her dismissal from her employment was a discriminatory act for which she was entitled to compensation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1358229112459404">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The Employment Appeal Tribunal attempted to justify its decision for upholding Ms Hounga’s claim for dismissal discrimination. In doing so the tribunal made reference to the Court of Appeal's decision in <italic>Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1358229112459404">8</xref>
</sup> and <italic>Vakante v Governing Body of Addey and Stanhope School (No 2).</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1358229112459404">9</xref>
</sup> Both of these cases involved illegal contracts. In <italic>Hall</italic> the appellant was claiming that there had been wrongful discrimination pursuant to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The respondent had argued that the appellant could not bring a claim for sex discrimination, because she was aware that her employer was not deducting tax and national insurance, and therefore was defrauding the Inland Revenue. The Court of Appeal in <italic>Hall</italic> had allowed her to bring a claim because according to Peter Gibson LJ:<disp-quote>
<p>No benefit is shown to have been received by her from the employer’s failure to deduct tax and national insurance contributions and to account for the same to the revenue. Her acquiescence in the employer’s conduct, which is the highest her involvement in the illegality can be put, no doubt reflects the reality that she could not compel the employer to change its conduct. That acquiescence is in no way causally linked with her sex discrimination claim.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1358229112459404">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>As a claim for discrimination was a claim in tort, Peter Gibson LJ held that the employer could rely upon the defence of illegality where there was a causal link between the illegality and the claimant’s loss.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1358229112459404">11</xref>
</sup> However, as the claimant in <italic>Hall </italic>only had knowledge of the respondent’s fraud, she could still bring a claim for discrimination. Importantly, the contract had not been tainted from the outset. As Peter Gibson LJ stated, there was no causal link between Hall’s acquiescence to her employer’s actions and her claim for sex discrimination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1358229112459404">12</xref>
</sup> Rimer LJ commented on the decision in Hall that:<disp-quote>
<p>the fact that the employee may be barred by illegality from enforcing her contract of employment will not automatically lead also to the conclusion that she will be barred from claiming compensation for a discriminatory dismissal from her employment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229112459404">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>In <italic>Vakante</italic> the employee was a teacher from the Czech Republic, who had lied to his employer about his eligibility to work legally in the United Kingdom by claiming that he did not require a work permit. He was dismissed and brought a claim for race discrimination. The Court of Appeal refused to allow him to bring a claim. Mummery LJ had stated that the court should not ‘assist litigants to benefit from illegal conduct, if it is inextricably bound up in their claim’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1358229112459404">14</xref>
</sup> Mummery LJ distinguished the decision in <italic>Vakante</italic> from <italic>Hall</italic>, because in the former it was the employee who had caused the illegality by lying to his employer.</p>
<p>Rimer LJ distinguished the decisions in <italic>Hall</italic> and <italic>Vakante</italic>, as in <italic>Hall</italic> the claimant ‘was – at most – only on the very fringe of the illegality tainting her employment contract’, whereas in <italic>Vakante</italic> ‘the whole employment relationship had been achieved by Mr Vakante’s dishonest and criminal conduct’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1358229112459404">15</xref>
</sup> This meant that in <italic>Hall</italic> the contract was not illegal from the outset, whereas in <italic>Vakante</italic> the claim was based on ‘the duty not to discriminate … [that] arises from an employment situation which, without a permit, was unlawful from top to bottom and from beginning to end’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1358229112459404">16</xref>
</sup> Rimer LJ held that Ms Hounga’s situation was similar to Mr Vakante’s, because her contract was ‘illegal in its inception’ and that the only difference was that her employers were involved with the illegality.</p>
<p>The Employment Appeal Tribunal had upheld Ms Hounga’s claim for dismissal discrimination. In doing so it focused on Mrs Allen’s conduct in dismissing and evicting Ms Hounga, and not Ms Hounga’s own illegality. The Employment Appeal Tribunal had stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Such conduct of [Mrs Allen] is not connected with or inextricably linked with the illegal conduct by which [Ms Hounga] entered this country and worked here. [Ms Hounga’s] position as a servant of the Respondent working and living illegally in this country was not inextricably linked with the act of eviction or dismissal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1358229112459404">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Therefore, in considering the opinion of Mummery LJ in <italic>Vakante</italic>, the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that there was no link between the dismissal discrimination claim and the fact that Ms Hounga was working illegally. The Employment Appeal Tribunal was of the opinion that the Allens were more at fault here. In its opinion there was no link between the claim and the claimant’s illegality, and so in dismissing the appeal the Employment Appeal Tribunal would not be condoning Ms Hounga’s illegality.</p>
<p>Rimer LJ rejected the Employment Appeal Tribunal’s decision, which His Lordship called ‘flawed and wrong’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1358229112459404">18</xref>
</sup> His Lordship stated that, based on the similarities between this case and <italic>Vakante</italic>, he could ‘not regard her as being in a better position’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1358229112459404">19</xref>
</sup> His Lordship observed that in order to bring a claim Ms Hounga was invoking her own illegality; that is, she was employed only because of her own illegal acts, and therefore ‘[s]he was making a direct link between the discriminatory treatment of which she complained and the circumstances in which she came to be, and was, employed by the Allens’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1358229112459404">20</xref>
</sup> To permit Ms Hounga to recover would be to condone her own illegal actions. Rimer LJ stated that the tribunal could not rely upon the fact that the Allens’ involvement with the illegality was greater than Ms Hounga’s, because, ‘[w]hichever party bore the greater responsibility for making of the illegal contract, she was a willing participant in it’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1358229112459404">21</xref>
</sup> His Lordship commented that the Employment Appeal Tribunal had overlooked the link between Ms Hounga’s illegality and her claim for the dismissal discrimination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1358229112459404">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The argument in the present case had focused on whether the tort claim for dismissal discrimination could be pursued, regardless of the fact that the claim for unfair dismissal could not. Rimer LJ in allowing both the appeal and the cross-appeal was clear that there should be no remission to the Employment Tribunal, as the claim for non-dismissal discrimination would also be tainted with illegality. His Lordship focused on the direct link between the claim and the illegal status of Ms Hounga’s employment, which differed from the approach of the Employment Appeal Tribunal. The Employment Appeal Tribunal had regarded the claim as linked to the dismissal, and therefore not the original illegality. It is clear that the Court of Appeal’s approach was to trace the claim back to the illegal status of the employment, rather than to stop at the discriminatory acts of the employer. The Employment Appeal Tribunal had dealt with the problem of condoning Ms Hounga’s illegal acts by stressing the greater culpability of her employers. This approach was rejected, as Rimer LJ had emphasised the fact that Ms Hounga had been a willing participant. There was no need, in the circumstances, for the Court of Appeal to weigh up which party was more at fault.</p>
<p>Arguably, the approach of Rimer LJ is in line with the reasoning in <italic>Vakante</italic> and the opinion of Mummery LJ because of the initial tainting of the contract of employment with illegality. However, it is possible to see why the Employment Appeal Tribunal chose to emphasise the relative complicity of the parties. By doing this it was possible to argue that it was not Ms Hounga but the Allens who were most at fault, and therefore to avoid condoning Ms Hounga’s illegality.</p>
<p>The decision in <italic>Hounga</italic> is interesting as it reinforces the position that a claim for discrimination will not succeed where the claimant is tainted with illegality from the outset. Both the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal had accepted that Ms Hounga was a victim of dismissal discrimination. However, despite the treatment of Ms Hounga by the Allens, it is clear that a claim for discrimination can be defeated by reference to the claimant’s willing participation in an illegal act. The decision of the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal enabled the victim of race discrimination to bring a claim. By contrast, the Court of Appeal viewed Ms Hounga’s contract as inherently illegal and refused to countenance condoning her illegal acts.</p>
<p>The result of the Court of Appeal’s decision is that there is little recourse in employment law if an employer were to discriminate against an employee in these circumstances. However, the problem with the approach of the Employment Appeal Tribunal is that by protecting the employee and permitting a claim for discrimination, both tribunals had overlooked the fact that Ms Hounga’s contract was inherently illegal – she had no legal right to work in the United Kingdom and had been complicit in this state of affairs. Taken to an extreme, the effect of the decision in <italic>Hounga</italic> would appear to provide a defence to employers who employ illegal immigrants and then discriminate against them. This is not what the Court of Appeal intended and those who employ illegal immigrants are not immune from legal sanction, notwithstanding the effect of this decision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1358229112459404">22</xref>
</sup> Ultimately, the decision in <italic>Hounga</italic> is interesting as the case demonstrates the different considerations that weighed heavy in the reasoning of the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>The employees themselves may well be prevented from bringing a claim for discrimination in these circumstances. However, the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 makes it an offence to employ an adult who ‘has not been granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom’ or whose ‘leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom’ is invalid, has ceased or is subject to a condition that could prevent him/her from working. Under s. 15 of the Act an employer could face a fine of up to £10,000. Additionally, under s. 21 of the Act an employer could face a maximum custodial sentence of up to two years. The Act provides for no defence to either ss.15 or 21, where the employer has knowingly employed someone who had no right to work in the United Kingdom.</p>
