<p>This anthology offers sixteen scholarly papers that grew out of a 2005 conference held at the University of Lincoln, where both editors teach. Speakers and case studies are offered from Britain (including the BBC classic <italic>Culloden</italic> from 1964), France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Yugoslavia. One seeming result is that Europeans take their televised history more seriously than we do.</p>
<p>The essays are arranged in four sections, the first of which is “Perspectives,” which includes studies reviewing visual design and documentary openings, the problem of sources, writing the history documentary, commissioning history, and the layering of historical testimonies on British television.</p>
<p>Part 2, “Televised History and National Identity,” discusses three examples—Napoleon on French television, British depictions of the bitter Battle of the Somme during World War I, and a Spanish historical series.</p>
<p>“Televised History, Memory and Identity” includes discussions of retelling the past on Dutch television, pain and reconciliation with historical television, women and war, and portraying the Flemish past.</p>
<p>The final part, “History Programming: Form, Genre, Technique” turns to bodily reenactment and reality documentary, German television docudrama and historical biography, nostalgia and lifestyle on British daytime television, and family history and memory in the British series <italic>Who Do You Think You Are?</italic></p>
<p>The European team of authors provides a good sense of the serious work being done on historical presentation across the Continent. It’s not <italic>all</italic> serious, but somehow seems so much better than much of what is on this side of the pond.</p>
