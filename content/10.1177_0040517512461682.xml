<abstract>
<p>The paper reports an experimental study on the influence of spacer fabrics' structures, that is, different surface stitches, fabric thicknesses, and diameters of spacer yarns, on the impact and compression-after-impact properties of warp-knitted spacer fabrics. Low-velocity impact tests, damage deformation characterizations, and compression tests after impacts were performed on six spacer-fabric specimens knitted on a double needle bar Raschel knitting machine. The impact method was flat-sphere (a flat striker contacted with a fabric wrapped on a hemispherical steel anvil). Deformation processes of typical spacer fabrics, force–displacement/time and energy–time curves, impact damage, and residual strength were analyzed and discussed; moreover, peak force, absorbed energy, damage depth, and the drop-off rate of residual strength were involved to estimate impact and compression-after-impact properties of the spacer fabrics with different structures. The results show that with the closed surface structure and coarser spacer yarns, the fabrics have the characteristics of lower peak forces, higher energy-absorption ability, lower damage depths, and higher drop-off rates of residual strength. Fabrics with higher thickness are of the features above but they do have lower drop-off rates</p>

<p>Warp-knitted spacer fabrics are three-dimensional textile structures consisting of two separate outer fabric layers joined together while being kept apart by spacer yarns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512461682">1</xref></sup> As a cushion material, warp-knitted spacer fabrics have much better moisture transmission features,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461682">2</xref></sup> better pressure relief properties, higher air permeability, and lower heat resistance than polyurethane (PU) foam;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461682">3</xref></sup> thus, they have been widely used in areas such as automobile textiles (cushions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461682">3</xref></sup> or car seats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512461682">4</xref></sup>), sports textiles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512461682">5</xref></sup> and foundation garments (bra cups, pads for swimwear), etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512461682">6</xref></sup> Many studies have been conducted on warp-knitted spacer fabrics, which mainly focus on their static compression properties, as well as sound absorption behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512461682">7</xref></sup> pressure distribution,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461682">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512461682">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461682">9</xref></sup> air permeability, heat resistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461682">2</xref></sup> etc.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0040517512461682"><title>Samples</title>
<p>Six warp-knitted spacer fabrics were used in this study. They were produced on a double needle bar Raschel knitting machine (GE 296, E18) at Wuyang Textile Machinery Co., Ltd, China. Surface structures of spacer fabrics can be divided into two types: closed structures without meshes and open structures with small/large-size meshes according to their different shapes. As their typical representatives, pillar + weft insertion, rhombic mesh, and hexagonal mesh were used for the surface layers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461682">Figures 1(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461682">c</xref>), respectively.

</fig></p>
<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461682">Figure 1</xref> that the fabric surface with pillar + weft insertion is plain, while there are smaller meshes on the fabric with rhombic mesh surface layers and larger meshes on that with hexagonal mesh surface layers.

<p>Despite the same distances between two needle bars (10.2 mm) in warping, actual thicknesses of F1, F2, F3, and F6 were slightly different, but they were all near 7 mm; thus, it was considered that thicknesses of these fabrics were close to each other.

<p>The impact tests referred to BS EN1621-1:1998 (Motorcyclists' protective clothing against mechanical impact) and were conducted with an Instron Dynatup 9250HV, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512461682">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>The drop hammer falls freely and is automatically arrested by a secondary impact preventer after rebounding to keep it from a second strike. The striker face is made of polished steel with dimensions of 40 mm × 80 mm and 5 mm radius edges. The weight of the drop hammer is 6.3080 kg. A polished steel anvil, set on a firm plane support, is hemispherical with a radius of 50 mm. The warp-knitted spacer fabric was wrapped on the hemispherical steel anvil and four sides of the fabric are caught by eight clamps on the plane support. Incident impact energies used for the work were 3.51, 6.51, 10.49, and 15.44J. For each spacer fabric type, three samples were tested, and every sample was impacted one time. The ultimate value of each type was the average of the three tests. The samples were conditioned in an atmosphere with a temperature of (20 ± 2)℃ and a relative humidity (RH) of 65 ± 5%. After positioning a sample on the steel anvil well, the test was completed within 3 min.</p>
<p>An XSM-LC three-dimensional laser scanner was used to evaluate damage deformations and depths of all the specimens after impact. The working principle of the scanner is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512461682">Figure 3</xref>. A transmitter sent out a laser to the top surface of a fabric and collected the reflection to calculate the distance between the fabric and transmitter; thus, the height of each point on the fabric surface could be obtained. By a given scanning area, the laser beam, guided by the transmitter, moved along the <italic>X</italic>-axis and <italic>Y</italic>-axis directions alternately. The interval of the <italic>X</italic>-axis was 0.001 mm and that of the <italic>Y</italic>-axis was 0.1 mm.

<p>The deformations of fabric during an impact event are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5(a)</xref> presents the side elevation of an original sample: the top and bottom surfaces of the fabric are plane and all the spacer yarns bend slightly on their nature state. When it is wrapped on a steel anvil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5(b)</xref>), tensile and compressive stresses are produced on the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. During the loading stage of the impact process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5(c)</xref>), the spacer fabric stores and absorbs energy given by the striker, meanwhile, it produces elastic and plastic deformations so as to reduce the force transmitted to the steel anvil. Stress in the contact area is non-uniform due to the specific contact method (flat-sphere); in particular, the maximum stress σ<sub>max</sub> occurs at the center of the contact zone (<italic>x</italic> = 0) and spacer yarns in the central zone are compressed more seriously than those in surrounding zone. In the unloading process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5(d)</xref>), the striker is rebounded and elastic energy stored in the spacer fabric is released, the spacer fabric recovers to some extent as well. After removing the specimen from the steel anvil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5(e)</xref>), under the compressive and tensile stresses on the top and bottom surface, an approximate circular pit is formed on the surface of the specimen and irrecoverable deformation occurs on spacer yarns in the contact zone, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512461682">Figure 5(f)</xref>.

At peak forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461682">Figures 6(a</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461682">b</xref>)), the maximum displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461682">Figure 6(b)</xref>) increases while contact duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461682">figure 6(a)</xref>) decreases with the rising of impact energy in the loading stage. Forces drop sharply and displacements decline to some degree in the unloading stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461682">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Accompanied by vibrations of the machine, force values fluctuate around zero and incline ultimately to their value. Moreover, the vibrations occur between the drop hammer and secondary impact preventer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512461682">Figure 2</xref>). Since they are both rigid bodies, the drop hammer cannot stop immediately after rebounding and being arrested by the preventer; instead, it will stop gradually with the reducing of vibrations or collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461682">Figure 6(a)</xref>).</p>
<p>The change of force is related with two factors as follows. First is the variation of displacement. Compression strength increases with the increasing of displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461682">2</xref></sup> The change of contact area resulted from that of displacement, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461682">Figure 7</xref>, also has effects on force values.

</fig></p>
<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461682">Figure 7</xref> that when the striker falls from Pos. 1 to Pos. 2, its displacement increases from D1 to D2, then the contact area ascends from S1 to S2. Contact area and displacement satisfy the following relationship:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0040517512461682"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-0040517512461682"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-0040517512461682" xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512461682-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>S</italic> is the contact area, <italic>D</italic> is the displacement of the striker, <italic>R</italic> is the radius of the steel anvil, and <italic>T</italic> is the thickness of specimen.</p>
<p>Thus, contact area increases with the increasing of displacement. That more spacer yarns exert force on the striker produces a rising force on the striker.</p>
<p>Second is failure of spacer yarns in the central zone. Due to the non-uniform stress on the contact zone, spacer yarns in the center are damaged more seriously than others. The declination of load-bearing capacities of these damaged spacer yarns leads to the decrease of the force. Normal spacer yarns and damaged spacer yarns impacted under lower (3.51J) and higher energy (15.44J) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461682">Figures 8(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461682">c</xref>), respectively.

</fig></p>
<p>The two factors above have an effect on the total force exerted on the striker and the change of force depends on which factor plays a major role. A continual rise of force in the loading stage for fabric subjected to lower impact energy is the result of increasing of displacement and relatively slight failure of spacer yarns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461682">Figure 8(b)</xref>). While spacer yarns are damaged more seriously when they are impacted under higher energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461682">Figure 8(c)</xref>), the force drops at some instants where the specimen is subjected to higher energy is due to the failure of spacer yarns resulted from the change of contact area during loadings.</p>
<p>The energy–time curves of F1 impacted under different energies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461682">Figure 9</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>When the striker impacts with the specimen surface, the given impact energy by the striker can be classified into two quantities. One is rebounded energy (elastic energy), which is stored elastically in the specimen and transferred back to the striker. The other is absorbed energy, which is the sum of absorbed energy in the specimen by forming irrecoverable deformations, and the energy absorbed by the impact system in vibration, heat, inelastic behavior of striker, and supports; thus, the following relationship exists:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512461682">18</xref></sup>

where <italic>E</italic><sub>total</sub> is the total impact energy, <italic>E</italic><sub>reb</sub> is rebounded energy, and <italic>E</italic><sub>abs</sub> is absorbed energy.</p>
<p>There is an assumption that the energy absorbed by the impact system can be ignored; thus, the total energy is the sum of rebounded energy and absorbed energy by specimen. In particular, the energy-absorption rates (<italic>E</italic><sub>abs</sub>/<italic>E</italic><sub>total</sub>) of fabric subjected to different energies are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461682">Figure 9</xref>; the ratio decreases with the increase of impact energies, and the undamaged material still can absorb a substantial proportion of the impact energy for all energy levels.</p>
<p>With the aim of examining the effects of fabric structure, thickness, and yarn diameter on the impact behavior, force–displacement curves for all samples subjected to different impact energies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512461682">Figure 10</xref>.

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512461682">Figure 10</xref> that change of forces for each specimen impacted under different energies has a tendency of that force’s drop at some instants in the loading stage in higher energies.

<p>F1, F2, and F3 represent spacer fabrics with the same needle bar distance and same fineness of spacer yarns, but different surface structures, which are pillar + weft insertion, rhombic mesh, and hexagonal mesh, respectively. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461682">Figure 11(a)</xref> that the <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> value of fabric with the large-size meshes on surface layers is higher than that of fabric with the small-size ones, so the former can be used to absorb less energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461682">Figure 11(b)</xref>). Two main factors can account for this phenomenon. Firstly, spacer yarns' angles of the three samples are <italic>A</italic><sub>F1</sub> &gt; <italic>A</italic><sub>F2</sub> &gt; <italic>A</italic><sub>F3</sub>, which can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461682">Table 2</xref>. The fabrics with higher spacer yarn inclination angles can be used to absorb more energy in compression behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461682">2</xref></sup> Secondly, spacer yarns of fabric with large-size meshes are more inclined to collapse and fail to deform normally to absorb impact energies; in addition, these spacer yarns are easier to damage, since parts of them are exposed in the open air and are not covered by surface layers perfectly.</p>
<p>F1, F4, and F5 represent spacer fabrics with the same surface structure and same fineness of spacer yarns, but different needle bar distances, which are 10.2, 7.2, and 13.2 mm, respectively. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461682">Figure 11(a)</xref> that the <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> value of fabric with the larger thickness is lower than that with the smaller one, so the former can be used to absorb more total energy than the latter, which can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461682">Figure 11(b)</xref>.</p>
<p>F1 and F6 represent spacer fabrics with the same surface structure and same needle bar distance, but different finenesses of spacer yarns, which are 0.2 and 0.16 mm, respectively. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461682">Figure 11(a)</xref> that the <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> value of fabric with the coarser spacer yarns is lower than that with the finer ones, so the former can be used to absorb more energy than the latter, which can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461682">Figure 11(b)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461682">Table 3</xref> shows that the effects of surface structure, fabric thickness, and spacer yarns' fineness of fabrics impacted under different energies on peak force and absorbed energy are all highly significant.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0040517512461682"><title>Damage deformation and depth</title>
<p>Although the same method (flat-sphere) was adopted for all impacts, the damaged surfaces of specimens and their depth values differed from each other. However, deformation and depth give an indication of a fabric's ability to resist impact: small damage depth demonstrates good impact resistance in the same conditions.</p>
<p>Typical damaged surface deformations of specimens examined with the XSM-LC three-dimensional scanner are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">Figure 12</xref>.

The deformations of fabrics with different surface structures (F1, F2, and F3) impacted under the same energy (15.44J) vary from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">Figures 12 (d)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">f</xref>)). In addition, there are many height lines around the damaged areas for F2 and F3. As the surface layers of F1 are plain and tight, while those of F2 and F3 have many meshes on the outer layers, laser beams derived from the transmitter could irradiate the closed top surface of F1, while parts of them irradiated directly to the inner or even the bottom of the fabrics F2 and F3 because of the open structures on outer layers. The damaged deformation of specimen F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">Figures 12(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">d</xref>)) reveals that the damaged zone tends to become localized and is more or less a round pit in shape: the deepest point occurs in the center of the pit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">Figures 12(d)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512461682">f</xref>) show that the damaged area appearances of F1 and F2 are similar (a round pit); however, for F3, the hexagonal sides have been broken.

This means that the impact resistance of fabric with a closed surface layer (F1) is better than that with small-size meshes on surface layers (F2) (significance test <italic>F</italic>(1, 4) = 71.525, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). While the damage depth of F3 (with large-size meshes on the surface layers) has no comparability with that of F1 and F2, for their damage conditions are different, the surface yarns of F3 are broken while those of F1 and F2 are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0040517512461682">Figures 13(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0040517512461682">c</xref>)). Almost all absorbed energy is converted into irrecoverable deformation energy of spacer yarns. Thus, a pit is produced on the fabric surfaces for F1 and F2. While part of the absorbed energy of F3 is consumed on the breakage of surface yarns, the depth of damage zone for F3 decreases. Viewed from this perspective, fabric with hexagonal meshes is not a perfect protector for the surface is easy to be damaged, and that large-size meshes on outer layers cannot protect spacer yarns in the middle layer effectively. The depths of fabrics with larger thickness and coarser spacer yarns are less than those of their opposites (significance test <italic>F</italic>(2, 6) = 227.953, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; significance test <italic>F</italic>(1, 4) = 32.272, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The results reveal that the former have better impact resistance.</p>
<p>Depth values of F1 subjected to different energies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0040517512461682">Figure 14(b)</xref>; it can be concluded that depths increase with the increasing of impact energies. Moreover, depth values of fabrics under two lower impact energies (3.51 and 6.51J) approximate to each other, and those under the two others (10.49 and 15.44J) are similar, while the latter is larger than the former. The results show clearly that the damage of fabrics impacted under higher energies is more serious than those under the lower ones.</p>

<p>All curves can be divided into two stages, that is, initial stage (stage I) and elastic stage (stage II), according to slope changes of the curves. Moreover, compression resistances of fabrics before and after impacts are not obviously different in stage I, while in stage II, those of the damaged fabrics decline by a large margin. Since the compression in stage I derives from fastening the multifilament loops and monofilaments, while that in stage II is mainly due to bending of spacer yarns, unfortunately, the spacer yarns have been damaged and their load-carrying capacities were diminished after impacts.</p>

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0040517512461682">Figure 16</xref> that residual strength values of fabrics before impacts (<italic>RB</italic>) are <italic>RB</italic><sub>F3</sub> &lt; <italic>RB</italic><sub>F2</sub> &lt; <italic>RB</italic><sub>F1</sub>, <italic>RB</italic><sub>F5</sub> &lt; <italic>RB</italic><sub>F1</sub> &lt; <italic>RB</italic><sub>F4</sub> and <italic>RB</italic><sub>F6</sub> &lt; <italic>RB</italic><sub>F1</sub>. This demonstrates that undamaged fabrics with smaller size meshes on outer layers, smaller fabric thickness, and coarser spacer yarns have better compression resistance. However, residual strength values for each specimen under various impact energies (except 0J) vary within a small range. In other words, these values incline to be stable, and damage of a specimen impacted under relative smaller energies tends to saturation. Therefore, the average residual strength value of each sample in various impact energies (except 0J) is used to evaluate the compression resistances after impacts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512461682">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512461682">Table 4</xref> that the sequence of average residual strength after impacts (<italic>RA</italic>) is <italic>RA</italic><sub>F3</sub> &lt; <italic>RA</italic><sub>F2</sub> &lt; <italic>RA</italic><sub>F1</sub>, <italic>RA</italic><sub>F5</sub> &lt; <italic>RA</italic><sub>F1</sub> &lt; <italic>RA</italic><sub>F4</sub>, <italic>RA</italic><sub>F6</sub> &lt; <italic>RA</italic><sub>F1</sub>. The logics remain coherent with those of <italic>RB</italic>. Therefore, fabric with better compression resistance before an impact performs better after it as well. The drop-off rates (<italic>DO</italic>) of compressive strength for all the specimens can be calculated (<italic>DO = </italic>(<italic>RB – RA</italic>)<italic>/RB</italic>), as shown in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512461682">Table 4</xref>, and the sequence is <italic>DO</italic><sub>F3</sub> &lt; <italic>DO</italic><sub>F2</sub> &lt; <italic>DO</italic><sub>F1</sub>, <italic>DO</italic><sub>F5</sub> &lt; <italic>DO</italic><sub>F1</sub> &lt; <italic>DO</italic><sub>F4</sub>, <italic>DO</italic><sub>F6</sub> &lt; <italic>DO</italic><sub>F1</sub>, which is identical to the two above. This demonstrates that fabrics with better compression resistance also have higher drop-off rates. For fabrics with the same thickness, higher drop-off rates of fabrics (closed surface structure and coarser spacer yarns) mean that these fabrics can absorb more energy in an impact event by forming irrecoverable deformation to reduce peak force. For fabrics with different thicknesses, those with higher thicknesses can absorb more energy and have lower drop-off rates.</p>

<p>As a cushion material, the impact behavior and damage characteristic after impacts of warp-knitted spacer fabrics were investigated in this study. Four parameters, including peak force, absorbed energy, damage depth, and drop-off rate of residual strength, were involved to evaluate the two behaviors above of spacer fabrics with different structures. A spacer fabric with good protection performance was considered to have lower peak force, more absorbed energy, lower damage depth, and a lower drop-off rate of residual strength. According to the experimental results and analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn.
<list id="list1-0040517512461682" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The variation of force in an impact event is the result of the co-effect of two factors: displacement and failure of spacer yarns in the center zone. In addition, force increases with the increasing of the former and decreases because of the latter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For fabrics with the same needle bar distance (different surface structures and finenesses of spacer yarns), fabrics with coarser spacer yarns and close surface structure have several satisfying results, such as lower peak force, larger absorbed energy, and lower depth value, but higher drop-off rate of residual strength. While considering the specific impact method (flat-sphere), fabric with a mesh structure is body-fitted, for meshes can open and shut more freely according to the shape of wrapped objects. However, meshes that are too large on surface layers makes the mesh sides inclined to collapse and means that spacer yarns cannot be protected perfectly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For fabrics with different needle bar distances (same surface structure and fineness of spacer yarns), fabric with higher thickness performs perfectly in the experiments (lower peak force, more absorbed energy, lower damage depth, and lower drop-off rate), but a person’s body may feel uncomfortable if the protector is too thick. The balance between the protective performance and comfort should be taken into consideration by selecting a suitable thickness of fabric for the specific protective application.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For a fabric subjected to different energies, peak force, absorbed energy, and damage depth increase with the increasing of energy levels, while residual strengths approximate to each other.</p></list-item>
