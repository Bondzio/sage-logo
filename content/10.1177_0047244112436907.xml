<abstract>
<p><italic>Room at the Top</italic> was unique among British social-realist films, not only in its depiction of upward mobility as opposed to social immobilization, but also in its choice of genre – high tragedy over popular melodrama. Paradoxically, Joe Lampton’s working-class pride drove him to educate himself out of the working class, then compelled him to try to get a piece of the upper class. Tragically, the pride that enabled him to endure years of poverty and social humiliation is the same pride that undoes him spiritually in the end. In a sense, the class of his origin finally has its revenge on him for leaving it, while he proves that class is no barrier to someone with strength, ability and determination. But Joe pays a great price in order to prove his point – he ‘wastes’ the outsider Alice Aisgill for marriage to the moneyed Susan Brown. Alice may be the ‘tragic waste’ of this story, but one could argue that in killing herself she has also ‘killed’ Joe and thus had her revenge on him too. In short, far from cheapening its action by resolving it through melodrama, <italic>Room at the Top</italic> enriches that action throughout by consistently suggesting its tragic underpinnings. There are no black-and-white characters in the film, no heroes or villains, no defeat of the guilty and reward of the innocent: each of the central characters wins, and each one loses.</p>

<p>The working class has been a major subject of British art since the mid-1950s, when novelists such as John Braine and Alan Sillitoe, together with dramatists like John Osborne and Arnold Wesker, began treating anti-establishment themes in a style that can be accurately characterized as ‘social realism’. Soon social realism crossed over into film, where it became known as ‘New Cinema’, a movement whose ethos or social commitment was borrowed from Italian neorealism; whose own techniques were modelled upon those of the French New Wave; and whose scripts were often adaptations of plays and novels by blue-collar writers. One thinks especially of Jack Clayton’s <italic>Room at the Top</italic> (1958), based on the novel by Braine, Tony Richardson’s <italic>Look Back in Anger</italic> (1959), from the play by Osborne, and Karel Reisz’s <italic>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</italic> (1960), a version of the Sillitoe novel.</p>
<p>Social-realist art in Britain was the product of the ‘angry young men’ – angry at a society that had educated them above their class origins yet had inevitably failed to provide sufficient opportunities for them in so small a country as England; and angry at a government that had improved the living and working conditions of the proletariat but had done nothing to remove class barriers – had in fact locked those barriers more firmly in place by giving the workers what they wanted, up to a point. Witness, in addition to the works cited above, such films as Richardson’s <italic>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</italic> (1962), from a Sillitoe story, as well as his <italic>A Taste of Honey</italic> (1961), from the play by Shelagh Delaney; Lindsay Anderson’s <italic>This Sporting Life</italic> (1963), from the novel by David Storey; and Guy Green’s <italic>The Angry Silence</italic> (1960), from an original screenplay by Bryan Forbes.</p>
<p>The United States produced its own class of angry young men during the 1930s, led by Clifford Odets and represented by the workers’ theatre movement, but American anger at the plight of the underclass (as opposed to the exclusively black underclass) has largely disappeared from art, primarily because, after World War II, America’s white blue-collar workers became de facto members of the middle class as wages and standards of living rose. Even those workers who have not benefited materially tend to identify with those who have. And American films reflect this state of affairs: with the possible exception of an occasional fiction film such as <italic>Northern Lights</italic> (1979) or <italic>Matewan</italic> (1987) and the documentaries of someone like Barbara Kopple, American workers tend to be featured in heroic, solidarity-promoting plots that will culminate in their common betterment (for example, Elia Kazan’s <italic>On the Waterfront</italic> (1954) and Martin Ritt’s <italic>Norma Rae</italic> (1979)); or they find themselves successfully struggling to become their own boss, to run their own business and thus shed the title of mere ‘worker’, in such films as <italic>An American Romance</italic> (1944) and <italic>Mac</italic> (1992).</p>
<p>British workers, by contrast, continue to be the subject of unsentimental, unglorified tales that depict their hostility toward the ruling-class establishment, their disillusionment with the welfare state, and often their own narrow-minded, cynical resistance to change, which is as much the result of a misplaced pride as it is of a moral poverty bred of isolation, hopelessness and improvidence. These workers persist in being the subject of narrative, dramatic and cinematic art (by such filmmakers as Ken Loach, Mike Leigh, and Terence Davies) for two simple reasons: a blooded working class continues to subsist in England, and like the blooded aristocracy in that country it tenaciously defines itself by accent, occupation and attitude; and British artists’ anger at the plight of the underclass – an anger that first expressed itself in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century under the banner of naturalism – has not subsided.</p>
<p>When the plight of that underclass is depicted on film, something happens that will be vital to this discussion, and which happens in all films, namely: by placing a working-class life on screen, the cinema automatically makes that life fascinating for having been so framed. By thus attracting our interest in a proletarian protagonist, film confers a kind of importance on him or her – a lower-echelon person to whom we would not normally give a second thought in real life. (Film in this way holds a special, intriguing power over us: the power to engage simply by the act of isolating and framing, by embodying images.) Some novels attempt to do the same, of course, but one could argue that they are not as successful as films because in a book a working-class protagonist remains an abstraction, a composite of words. The pleasure we take in paying rapt attention to, and caring a lot about, such a person <italic>on film</italic> (or, to a slightly lesser extent, in the theatre) is naturally as damning as it is astonishing.</p>
<p>The subject here is <italic>Room at the Top</italic>, partly because it was unique among British social-realist films not only in its depiction of upward mobility as opposed to social immobilization<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047244112436907">1</xref></sup> but also in its choice of genre – a choice intimately related to the issue of a character’s rise and fall. At least five critics have written that the film of <italic>Room at the Top</italic> leans toward popular melodrama, particularly from the moment the industrialist, Mr Brown, offers the protagonist Joe Lampton his daughter Susan in marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047244112436907">Houston, 1959</xref>: 58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047244112436907">Manvell, 1969</xref>: 43–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112436907">Garbicz and Klinowski, 1979</xref>: 402; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047244112436907">Gaston, 1981</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047244112436907">Sinyard, 2000</xref>: 57). According to this view, the ‘evil’, greedy Joe agrees to the marriage, which then causes his ‘good’, abandoned lover, Alice, to get so drunk that she kills herself in a car accident. This essay will go against such a reading of the film, and it will do so primarily through an investigation of Joe’s behaviour at several crucial moments in the action.</p>
<p>Only the film of <italic>Room at the Top</italic> will be considered in depth here, not John Braine’s 1957 novel of the same title on which it is based, because the film version is probably better known, and in any event is essentially true to its source. Neil Paterson’s screenplay, approved by Braine, strengthens the storyline of the novel through the rearrangement of some incidents, the cutting of others, and the development of still others and of certain characters. In other words, the film heightens the <italic>drama</italic>, the interaction and clash of character in the story; it pares the plot down to the essentials while it keeps, and enhances, the detail and atmosphere of the novel’s locations in England’s industrial north simply by photographing them. <italic>Room at the Top</italic> has been described as a male weepie, but this is truer of the novel than of its cinematic adaptation, because the film eschews the special pleading of Joe Lampton’s first-person narrative in the book and gives more prominence to the characters of Alice Aisgill and Susan Brown than Braine does.</p>
<p>Before receiving Mr Brown’s offer of marriage to his daughter over lunch at the exclusive Conservative Club of Warnley, in Yorkshire, Joe Lampton had declared his love for Alice Aisgill during a weekend at the coast. In the film, though not in the novel, Alice is a Frenchwoman – possibly because of the casting of Simone Signoret in the role – of obscure origins, perhaps from a working-class background similar to Joe’s (he reminds her, she says, of a boy she once knew), who is married to an upper-class Englishman; Alice is thus, like Joe, an outsider in Warnley. Upon returning home from the coast for work in the city’s Treasury Department, Joe is confronted by her husband George, who has learned of the illicit affair. George tells him that he will not grant Alice a divorce and that Joe must never see her again. If he does not comply, George Aisgill declares that he will drag Joe into court – which will break him financially as well as expose him to scandal – in addition to withholding monetary support from his wife.</p>
<p>When Joe meets Mr Brown, therefore, he is in a somewhat desperate situation: he knows that he does not love Susan and that he loves Alice, but may not be able to remain with her. Mr Brown at first offers to set Joe up in business and make him a rich man in exchange for leaving Susan alone. Mr Brown is testing Joe here, but he also means what he says. Joe is presented, in other words, with a way out of his desperate situation: if he gives up Susan for good, her father will buy him his own accounting firm, the income from which will enable Joe to fight George Aisgill in court and take Alice (whom George holds onto out of spite, not love) away from him.</p>
<p>Out of pride, out of a desire not to be manipulated in such a way by a member of the moneyed class – <italic>not</italic> out of love for Susan – Joe refuses her father’s first offer, despite Mr Brown’s threat to ruin him if he does not accept. Impressed with Joe’s show of character and with what appears to be his love for Susan, Mr Brown then offers him both his daughter in marriage and a top job in the Brown family business, provided that he never sees Alice Aisgill again. Tellingly, Mr Brown also reveals to Joe that Susan is pregnant. Himself once a member of the working class, the father thus has been testing this working-class young man’s suitability for marriage. Joe is now confronted with the choice, on the one hand, of a good job in the Brown firm and Susan as a wife, whom he cannot betray for Alice; and, on the other hand, the choice of remaining in his job as an accountant for the city and risking everything by continuing to see Alice in the face of George Aisgill’s warnings not to do so.</p>
<p>Joe’s pride – his belief in himself as the equal of his so-called ‘betters’ and his consequent desire to love and be loved by one of them, as well as to share, through marriage, the upper class’s power and fortune – had in the first place caused him to seek Susan’s favour upon his arrival in Warnley from his dreary hometown of Dufton in Gloucestershire. Now his pride has placed him in a terrible tragic dilemma, marked by strong internal division: either he weds Susan and lives comfortably, if miserably, or he refuses to marry her and attempts against all the odds to win Alice as his wife. And one can be certain that if Joe refuses Mr Brown’s second offer, the latter will ensure that George Aisgill succeeds in his attempts to ruin Joe and Alice. As Mr Brown (who calls Alice an ‘old whore’) says, he can fix just about anything. Joe knows all this and therefore, after downing a double Scotch, he chooses Susan and a job in the Brown business. Later he courageously decides to tell Alice of his decision in person rather than writing her a letter, as Susan suggests. That, during their meeting, Joe says to Alice over and over again, ‘<italic>I’m going to marry Susan!</italic>’ seems to indicate, however, more that he is talking himself into this decision than that he is declaring his mind made up.</p>
<p>Far from veering toward popular melodrama at the end, then, the film of <italic>Room at the Top</italic> approaches high tragedy. Joe is no villain who gets what he wants at some poor woman’s expense. His spiritual life, awakened by his love for Alice, began its descent once he gave up his love for her and is over the moment she dies in the automobile crash. The film suggests as much in the office scene at the Town Hall and its aftermath. Amid congratulations from the secretaries and his fellow workers on his impending marriage to Susan and his appointment to the Brown firm, Joe overhears a conversation in which Alice’s death is reported. He then smashes his champagne-filled glass to the floor and hastily exits, winding up late that night at a working-class pub where he gets thoroughly drunk in the company of a local girl.</p>
<p>Her jealous boyfriend and some of his cronies subsequently give Joe a vicious beating. In the novel Joe fights back, but here he is masochistically passive, as if tragically willing his own (deserved) punishment. We sense this partly because, as he is being beaten in the film, a train whistle can be heard in the distance, so shrill that Joe looks up: for this is a ghostly reminder of the painful farewell scene between him and Alice after their idyllic few days together at the coast, during which they both seemed to sense the end of their relationship. After the beating, Joe gets thrown into a dirty canal which has a surface that aptly reflects the neon sign of one of Mr Brown’s factories. Joe’s descent is now complete – for the moment, physically as well as spiritually. His spirit will remain in the gutter, despite the place he will soon take at the top through marriage to Susan. Correctly, he blames himself for Alice’s death; just as correctly, if you will, he has chosen an unhappy marriage over bankruptcy and disgrace for himself and Alice at George Aisgill’s hands. Hence Joe Lampton’s tragedy is not quite proletarian and not aristocratic, but something in between, and all the worse for it.</p>
<p>When <italic>Room at the Top</italic> was released in the USA, Robert Hatch wrote that ‘the film repeatedly suggests that there is something important about Joe Lampton, but what it is never becomes clear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112436907">Hatch, 1959</xref>: 395). Philip Hartung echoed Hatch with the line, ‘I’m not sure that Joe Lampton is worth all this attention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047244112436907">Hartung, 1959</xref>: 22). Joe would argue, as he does in the film, that he is ‘working class and proud of it’: that is, he is important by virtue of <italic>his</italic>, and by extension the film’s, belief in his importance, in his own special humanity. Joe’s tragedy is that he remains working class at heart at the same time as he assumes the manners and dress of the middle class, and then of the upper class: he remains working class in his pride, one might say. Further, Joe’s tragedy is that, not satisfied with his sense of self-importance as the son of working-class parents who gave their lives during the war, and as the subsequent ward of a loving aunt and uncle, he strives to become important to people like the Browns.</p>
<p>The great irony is that at the moment he becomes ‘important’ through marriage into the Brown family, Joe has ceased to be of importance to us. At the moment he reaches the top, he has in fact reached the bottom. Braine’s novel ends with Joe’s expression of remorse that no one understands him, but Clayton’s film goes one step further by depicting the marriage itself, Joe’s accompanying recognition, and the most ironic of happy endings. Joe hesitates a long time before uttering a tepid ‘I do’ during the wedding ceremony that will formally admit him to the top, as if he is completely aware of the finality of the ‘sentence’ he is imposing on himself and wants to extend his freedom just a few more moments before losing it. His hesitation here is the externalization of the hesitation he inwardly felt at his decision to wed Susan in the first place, and which he tried to dispel by affirming again and again, ‘<italic>I’m going to marry Susan!</italic>’</p>
<p>The tears Joe sheds in the car as he and his bride are driven away from the church are thus for himself as well as for Alice. Susan thinks these are tears of joy and emotion as she happily declares ‘Till death do us part’ to her new huband. But ‘death’ for Joe in this instance means the death sentence that is his marriage and the death of all that was once good in him. Alone in spirit if not in body, he is seemingly encapsulated in the limousine – the image of luxury that had triggered his ambition, and one of a number of status-related car images that appear in both the novel and the film of <italic>Room at the Top</italic> – as we watch the open road quickly disappear behind him through the rear window. The last shot of the film is of the Bentley itself as it disappears into the distance and heads to the ‘top’ – Joe Lampton’s ultimate goal, at last achieved – yet at the same time travels down what seems to be an overpoweringly deserted, lonely street.</p>
<p>In connection with the issue of tragedy versus melodrama in <italic>Room at the Top</italic>, Penelope Houston posed the following question, without answering it, at the time of the film’s British release: ‘Is [Joe] the victim of his own character, or of a social system which has formed him and given him bitterness?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047244112436907">Houston, 1959</xref>: 57). Joe is the victim of his own character <italic>and</italic> of the English social system: his tragedy is at once of his own and his society’s making. The pride that makes it impossible for him to accept Mr Brown’s offer of an accounting firm, in return for leaving Susan alone, was born, not in a vacuum and not to every working-class man in England, but of the resentment Joe in particular felt as a member of the oppressed labouring class in his native Dufton as well as in the Royal Air Force (where, he reports, as an enlisted man who rose to the rank of sergeant, commissioned officers bossed him about). In other words, <italic>he</italic> felt the resentment, even bitterness, and his society supplied the discrimination that made him feel it.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is precisely the inevitability of Joe’s fall that stems in considerable part from the nature of his own character, formed as it was by his experience during the war as well as by his life of poverty and social humiliation in Dufton. The war gave Joe a taste of freedom, a kind of holiday from class restrictions, and it was this period aspect of <italic>Room at the Top</italic> – not Joe Lampton’s working-class origins – that attracted the director of the film, war veteran Jack Clayton, who, along with fellow veterans Neil Paterson and Freddie Francis (cinematography), was not born into the working class, unlike John Braine, the novel’s author. According to Clayton, ‘Holidays abroad for the English … prior to 1939 were basically for rich people. But in the war there was this enormous flowing population, going all over the world, having totally new experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047244112436907">Gow, 1974</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>The war also fuelled Joe’s feelings of resentment toward the upper class, represented by his haughty, sneering superior officers in the Royal Air Force. He admits that he did not try to break out during his three years in a German prisoner-of-war camp, unlike Susan’s suitor Jack Wales, an officer who was successful in his escape attempt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047244112436907">2</xref></sup> Joe’s pride caused him to wait out the war in prison, for he preferred detainment in one place by the Nazis to a kind of subjugation all over Europe by British officers.</p>
<p>On account of his pride, in other words, Joe chose to ‘entrap’ himself in a German jail. Similarly, after experiencing the freedom of a larger, more variegated town like Warnley, he traps himself in marriage to Susan as the result of his pride, after refusing Mr Brown’s first offer – to set him up in business in return for leaving Susan alone – during lunch at the Warnley Conservative Club. Just as Joe did not want to be ordered about wilfully and contemptuously by Royal Air Force officers, he does not wish to be pressured to do something, for a price, by the commanding Mr Brown.</p>
<p>The inevitability of Joe’s fall is even reflected in <italic>Room at the Top</italic>’s visual style, as composed by the cinematographer Freddie Francis and the art director Ralph Brinton. Even as he is ostensibly enjoying his relative economic and social freedom in classier, ‘cosmopolitan’ Warnley, the camera is ‘trapping’ Joe the whole time through tight framing in restrictive settings. He lives in very cramped quarters, just as he did in Dufton: when he visits his aunt and uncle there, the scene is confined to one dark, dreary room whose low-hanging ceiling presses down on the characters. When Joe gets on the bus for work in Warnley with his fellow employee and housemate Charles Soames and has to stand, not only does the camera cut him off just below the waist, but many other passengers crowd around as well, hemming him in.</p>
<p>The camera also presses in on Joe when he telephones Susan after his return from Dufton, only to be told by her mother that she is vacationing in the south of France. We get a close-up of his face here, less to emphasize his emotional state than to stress his confinement, in character if not ultimately in career, within the working-class world of his origins. Moreover, this close-up is harshly juxtaposed against the full-body shot of Mrs Brown answering her telephone in a spacious living room. Ironically, Joe is exultant after this call, declaring to Charles that the Browns are falling into his trap, and by removing their daughter from his sight they are only increasing her fondness for him. Joe barely has space to express his happiness in this scene, since the low walls and angled ceiling of his attic room seem to be collapsing in on him.</p>
<p>The camera’s tight framing of Joe Lampton continues during his love scenes with Alice. Naturally, when they are framed together in bed, their intimacy is underlined. But when the lovers are photographed, sometimes from the neck up, at other times from the waist up, as they walk about their trysting place (the tiny apartment belonging to Alice’s friend, Elspeth) during an argument, something other than intimacy is being indicated. The camera is cutting them off, limiting their already limited space, and thereby suggesting that the world is closing in on them. At issue here, significantly, is Joe’s pride, which has flared up in response to Alice’s revelation that she had once posed nude for a photographer. Just as he was too proud to be subjugated by Royal Air Force officers during the war and will later be too proud to capitulate to Mr Brown by accepting his offer of an accounting firm in return for breaking off with Susan, Joe is too proud to submit, in a manner of speaking, to all the men who are ‘having’ Alice (through nude photographs) – and ‘having’ her younger, more voluptuous self at that – at the same time as he has her. Joe at is so upset Alice’s revelation that he ends the affair, only to reunite with her following his conquest of Susan. It is after they get back together that they sojourn on the coast, where, once it stops raining and they can leave their small cottage, they still seem confined: as they walk on the beach in the middle distance, the piles of a pier frame them on either side in the foreground.</p>
<p>Let us be clear: <italic>Room at the Top</italic> does not argue that Joe Lampton should have stuck to his own people, as his uncle advises him to do; that he should have been happy to live among the working class of Dufton at the same time as his accountant’s salary enabled him to live above them, so to speak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047244112436907">3</xref></sup> <italic>Room at the Top</italic> is not reactionary, it is not a cautionary tale, and neither is it revolutionary. The film does not emphasize the class struggle, as Peter Cowie maintains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112436907">1969</xref>: 224). Nor does it give, in the words of Thomas W. Bohn and Richard L.Stromgren, human form to social protest through the character of Joe Lampton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047244112436907">1978</xref>: 306).</p>
<p>Joe knows that he is any man’s equal, if not his better. He comes to Warnley with the city accountant’s job in hand, so ‘equal opportunity’ is not an issue in the film. As Stanley Kauffmann has written, in his pursuit of Susan, Joe ‘yearns for power, not equality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047244112436907">1959</xref>: 21); he yearns to join the upper class, not dismantle it. Joe is out for himself, not for the class of his origin; he is out to avenge past wrongs done to <italic>him</italic>, out for what he can get. His alienation from the working class becomes clear when, back in Dufton for the job interview Mr Brown has secretly set up, he returns to his boyhood home, which is now a bomb site. When he tries to be friendly to the mother of a little girl he has been talking to and tells her that he used to live next to her house, she dismisses him as a total stranger and slams the door in his face.</p>
<p>For better or worse, then, the social classes are in place in <italic>Room at the Top</italic> and on the evidence will remain in place – <italic>have</italic> remained in place. The issue is not the proletarian revolution, on the one hand, or the preservation of the class system, on the other, but Joe Lampton’s attempt to rise through the classes. The film is timeless, not timely; its subject is a complex human being, not an oversimplified socio-political cause. Paradoxically, Joe’s working-class pride drove him to educate himself out of the working class, then compelled him to try to get a piece of the upper class. Tragically, the pride that enabled him to endure years of poverty and social humiliation is the same pride that undoes him spiritually in the end. In a sense, the class of his origin finally has its revenge on him for leaving it, while he proves that class is no barrier to someone with strength, ability and determination.</p>
<p>Of course, Joe pays a great price in order to prove his point – he ‘wastes’ Alice Aisgill. She may be the ‘tragic waste’ of this story, but one could argue that in killing herself she has also ‘killed’ Joe and thus had her revenge on him. This, however, is revenge of an especially spiritual kind, adumbrated by Polonius’s famous line in <italic>Hamlet</italic>, which is quoted by Joe and Alice together during their cottage idyll by the sea: ‘This above all: to thine own self be true.’ In his courtship of Susan, Joe had seemed quite consciously <italic>untrue</italic> to himself by playing the role of the abused and misunderstood lover, at one stage even going down on his knees to her and having Susan the schoolgirl romantic fall for it. It is in the scenes with Alice, though, that the tension between identity and ambition, self and performance, becomes uncomfortable for Joe. Significantly, he later cannot remember Polonius’s words, and it is Alice who has to complete Shakespeare’s line for him. Not cited in Braine’s novel, this line from <italic>Hamlet</italic> emphasizes the insistent theme or motif of authenticity that runs throughout the film, and it contains the core of Alice’s ultimate, vengeful rebuke of the man she loves: not that he has betrayed her, but that he has betrayed himself.</p>
<p>In short, far from cheapening its action by resolving it through melodrama, the film of <italic>Room at the Top</italic> enriches that action throughout by consistently suggesting its tragic underpinnings. There are no black-and-white characters in the film, no genuine heroes or thoroughgoing villains, no defeat of the guilty and reward of the innocent: each of the central characters wins, and each one loses. Put another way, that’s life – or its tragedy.</p>
