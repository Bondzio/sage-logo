<abstract>
<p>The history of housing policy in Berkeley over the past thirty-five years provides a case study in the limits that state government can place on local government efforts to increase social equity. In 1976, a group of visionary planners and activists wrote <italic>The Cities’ Wealth: Programs for Community Economic Control in Berkeley, California</italic>. Berkeley’s progressives won control of the city government and tried to implement the proposed housing policies, which included strong rent controls to shield tenants from rising rents and using taxes and exactions to divert part of the city’s increasing real estate values toward production of nonprofit affordable housing. Conservative antitax activists and real estate interests were able to use appeals to the state courts, lobbying the state legislature and statewide initiatives to weaken or block many of the progressive programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>State and local government are often referred to as the “laboratories of democracy,” following Justice Brandeis’ statement that “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538513211429932">1</xref></sup> Innovations at the local level often lead to expanded innovation at the state and then the national level, sometimes in liberal directions, as with the rise of urban liberalism in the thirty years before the New Deal and sometimes in conservative directions, as with the privatization of government services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538513211429932">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are limits to the kinds of experimentation that is possible at the local level, however. In his widely cited book <italic>City Limits,</italic> Paul E. Peterson pointed to the importance of competition between cities for population and business. Each city must balance its services and the taxes necessary to support those services, finding the mix of services supported by the level of taxation that will best attract and hold people and businesses that have the ability to choose other places to locate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538513211429932">3</xref></sup> Peterson argues that competition for business places severe constraints on efforts to redistribute income and wealth at the local level.</p>
<p>In addition, there are legal as well as economic limitations to what cities can do. The powers of cities are granted by the states, which define and limit their extent. Political conflicts over local government policies may take place at the state as well as the local level. The most extensive discussion of this is Gerald E. Frug and David J. Barron’s <italic>City Bound: How States Stifle Urban Innovation,</italic> a detailed study of the limited powers granted to the City of Boston by the State of Massachusetts, accompanied by brief comparisons with several other major American cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538513211429932">4</xref></sup> Frug and Baron argue that the legal limitations on cities receive far less attention than they should in the academic literature, which usually focuses on economic competition.</p>
<p>The state–city relationship is particularly important for city governments that are trying to create social change rather than simply manage themselves well within the existing system. Cities governed by elected officials with progressive policies that are on the left side of the American political spectrum—seeking greater social equity, a stronger public domain, and more democratic control over the economic and physical development of their city—are often in conflict with business owners’ and investors’ desire to maximize profits. This ensures that they will face a sustained opposition that has the resources to use all available avenues for the exercise of political power and is highly motivated to prevent such policies from being established and spreading to other localities. Local-level opposition is likely to be supplemented by efforts to use the state, as the higher level of political authority, with appeals to the courts, lobbying the state legislature and state initiative measures.</p>
<p>A number of major cities have had at least a brief period of “progressive” influence on city government in recent decades, among them Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Hartford, and San Francisco, but there are only a handful of relatively small cities where progressives have controlled city government for most of the last thirty years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1538513211429932">5</xref></sup> The best known of these “progressive cities” are Burlington in Vermont and Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Santa Monica in California. This article examines the history of state-level “intervention” in the politics of Berkeley, California, the largest of these four cities with a 2010 population of 112,500.</p>
<p>There is a modest literature on these “progressive cities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1538513211429932">6</xref></sup> These studies mostly focus on the process of building a progressive political movement within the city, on the progressive urban program and on the local political conflicts associated with gaining political power and implementing their program. W. J. Conroy’s 1990 study of Burlington is notable for its attention to constraints resulting both from competition for business and from other layers of government. The State of Vermont granted its cities very limited powers of taxation, so that when efforts to make the Burlington’s tax system more progressive failed to gain approval by the state legislature, the effort at progressive taxation was largely abandoned in favor of simply finding ways to increase tax revenue to adequately support city services. Conroy argues that the left will need to gain control of the state government in order to enact programs that significantly increase social equity and thinks this is very unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>Some cities are largely exempt from the need to compete economically and can more easily contemplate extensive regulation of certain sectors of the economy and higher taxation in order to provide greater government services. Berkeley is one such city, due to both its location within the San Francisco Bay Area and the nature of its major institutions. For that reason Berkeley provides a particularly clear example of constraints on public policy based on state law rather than on economic competition.</p>
<p>Berkeley is centrally located within the San Francisco Bay area, which has been characterized by extremely high land values (a good measure of demand for access to any location) since at least the late 1970s due to its combination of a successful economy, extensive public investment in transportation, education and parks, a regional culture that is diverse, tolerant and creative and the natural beauty of the Bay and the Pacific coast.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1538513211429932">7</xref></sup> Since the late 1970s, the central Bay area has been characterized by strong economic growth and rising home prices and rents. This growth has often taken place in disruptive cycles such as the “dot.com” bubble, which rapidly drove up both commercial and residential rents in 1999–2001 only to collapse and see them go back down again, but the overall trend has continued upward. Since 1980 real (inflation-adjusted) rents in the Bay area have increased by more than 50 percent, while the real incomes of very low-income tenants have declined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1538513211429932">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Berkeley itself is the home of the University of California at Berkeley, with a budget of more than two billion dollars annually, 14,000 faculty and staff and 35,000 students; as well as a number of other major educational and research institutions such as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and the Graduate Theological Union. Over the past century, its highly educated residents have created a walkable, interesting and diverse residential community that is generally considered a highly desirable place to live. Buffered by its location and the presence of the University, even the collapse of the housing bubble, followed by the financial collapse and nationwide recession of 2008 has had only a modest effect on rents and home prices in Berkeley. In 2010 Berkeley, like San Francisco and certain sections of Silicon Valley, was one of the areas with the least decline in home prices since 2006 and one Berkeley zip code was among three in the Bay area where values had actually increased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1538513211429932">9</xref></sup> The median market rent for newly vacated one-bedroom rent stabilized apartments in Berkeley in 2010 was 11 percent higher than it had been in 2006 and had declined by only 4 percent from its peak in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1538513211429932">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>For much of the past thirty-five years, the City of Berkeley has been governed by a progressive coalition with views well to the left on the American political spectrum. Berkeley’s voters and its city council have used the full extent of Berkeley’s powers as a city to support progressive policies whose aim is to shield low-income tenants from market forces through rent controls, to provide nonprofit affordable housing, and to tap into increases in real estate values to fund development of affordable housing. During the same period, political control over the State of California has been shared between Democrats and Republicans and a coalition of conservative activists and interest groups representing real estate investors have used the state courts, state legislation, and the state initiative process to limit the powers of local governments such as the City of Berkeley to tax real property, control rents, or require exactions from developers.</p>
<p>This article is a historical case study of the efforts of Berkeley’s progressives to use city government to increase social equity through housing policy and the efforts of conservative activists and real estate interests to use the powers of the state to override such local efforts. It has been an interactive process, in which state law and its interpretations are constantly changing, sometimes in direct response to city programs and policies, and city programs change as the city’s progressive majority tries to maintain its policies within the changing constraints of state law.</p>
<sec id="section2-1538513211429932">
<title>The Cities’ Wealth</title>
<p>Berkeley’s political history during the 1960s and 1970s has been described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1538513211429932">11</xref></sup> In brief summary, Berkeley’s city government had a Republican majority from its early years until 1961 and while early in the twentieth century it led the way in certain areas of public administration such as professionalizing the police force and establishing land-use regulations, by mid-century it was doing nothing out of the ordinary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1538513211429932">12</xref></sup> In 1961, liberal candidates backed by the Berkeley Democratic Club gained control of Berkeley’s City Council and School Board and began to take actions to end de facto racial segregation and to deal with social problems such as unemployment and lack of affordable housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1538513211429932">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>During the late 1960s, as happened in many cities, Berkeley’s Democrats became deeply divided over many issues. The war in Vietnam was an initial source of division, along with the shift among some African Americans from demands for civil rights to demands for black power. The movement against the war became increasingly militant and erupted into violence, mostly but not entirely from the forces of order, when antiwar activists claimed vacant university-owned land as “People’s Park.” Tenant activism was accompanied by rent strikes and demands for rent controls and there were many other manifestations of increasing militancy and radical activism in local politics. By the 1970s, city politics was divided between two loose coalitions. The “moderates” centered on the Berkeley Democratic Club had their major voting strength in the affluent Hills. The “progressives” brought together radicals and antiwar liberal Democrats who eventually formed Berkeley Citizens Action (BCA) and were strongest in the heavily student neighborhoods around the Berkeley campus of the University of California and the nearby lower-income “flatlands” neighborhoods. Berkeley’s African American community in the flatlands areas of South and West Berkeley held the balance of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1538513211429932">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In 1971, three progressive candidates, two of them African American, were elected to the nine-member Berkeley City Council. From that point on, whether they held a majority or not, the progressives had major influence on city policies and were often able to get the voters to pass initiatives when the Council would not approve their proposals. The success with the City Council was followed by passage of a strong rent control initiative in November 1972 (later overturned by the courts) and another initiative, the Neighborhood Preservation Ordinance (NPO), in 1973, which down-zoned certain parts of the city and prevented demolition of existing housing to clear sites for construction of new and higher-priced housing unless affordable replacement housing was also included in the development.</p>
<p>In 1976, several people active in these initiative campaigns, including two, Eve Bach and Ed Kirshner, who had degrees in city planning, formed the Community Ownership Organizing Project. They published a comprehensive program statement called <italic>The Cities’ Wealth: Programs for Community Economic Control in Berkeley, California</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1538513211429932">15</xref></sup> (Planning historian Pierre Clavel has said “<italic>The Cities Wealth</italic> should stand as one of the key documents in the visionary history of the planning profession….”)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1538513211429932">16</xref></sup> It expressed a communitarian vision of participatory democracy and a locally oriented economy that was widely held among the activists of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s and received national distribution through the Conference on Alternative State and Local Public Policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1538513211429932">17</xref></sup> Such programmatic statements are usually quickly forgotten, but in Berkeley, the progressives gained sufficient political power to implement many of the proposed programs and some of its authors played significant roles in carrying them out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1538513211429932">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>
<italic>The Cities Wealth</italic> argued that the people who live and work in the local community generate substantial income that is siphoned off by outside businesses, such as privately owned utilities, retail chains, absentee landlords, and national and international banks. The well-being of the community, particularly its low-income members, would be improved if the money was instead paid to locally and community-owned businesses. The booklet proposed that consumer and worker cooperatives, credit unions, municipally owned utilities and small, locally owned for-profit businesses could provide housing, utilities, banking and insurance, retail stores and recycling, and that nonprofit community organizations should replace or supplement government social service agencies. It also proposed ways to make local government more democratic and responsive to citizens and neighborhoods by increasing public participation, transparency and oversight, and improving the planning process.</p>
<p>The housing policies in <italic>The Cities’ Wealth</italic> are based on the idea that since the public creates increases in land values through public investment in infrastructure and public services this value should be retained for the community rather than becoming the unearned “speculative” wealth of private land owners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1538513211429932">19</xref></sup> Community ownership and resident control of housing would retain this value for the community and protect the interests of low-income residents. The intellectual roots of these housing policies were in two long-standing reform traditions: the cooperative movement and the Garden City planning movement, itself an offshoot of the Henry George reform tradition. Clavel interviewed the lead author of <italic>The Cities Wealth</italic>, Ed Kirshner, who described how he was inspired by Ebenezer Howard’s visionary book <italic>Garden Cities of Tomorrow</italic> and by subsequent study of European new towns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1538513211429932">20</xref></sup> Ebenezer Howard had been inspired in part by Henry George, whose proposal to use socially created increases in land values for public benefit sparked a worldwide reform movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1538513211429932">21</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1979, the progressive BCA slate won a majority on the City Council, led by its candidate for Mayor Gus Newport, a left-wing African American who later became an important advocate for Community Land Trusts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1538513211429932">22</xref></sup> The BCA lost its majority in 1981, and then regained it again in 1984 after successfully passing an initiative that moved local elections to coincide with state and national elections, which increased turnout among their supporters. In June 1986, the voters passed an initiative measure that changed City Council elections from citywide to districts. It was sponsored by people angry at the City Council for approving sixty-one units of scattered-site public housing on surplus school district land in several sites around the city but was also supported by many progressive neighborhood activists. District elections reduced the importance of citywide slates and of the BCA, with the result that over the subsequent decade BCA gradually faded into unimportance. Despite this, candidates identified with progressive policies held their majority on the city council in the November1986 election and have continued to do so every two years since then, with the sole exception of the election of November 1994.</p>
<p>The city council’s progressive majority proceeded to implement the major programs proposed in the “Real Estate and Housing” chapter of <italic>The Cities’ Wealth</italic>. The council passed laws to shield tenants from market forces by protecting existing housing from demolition for higher-cost development, limiting condominium conversions, fully enforcing housing codes, and regulating rent increases. They put in place programs to purchase and hold land that could be leased for development as limited-equity cooperatives and assist tenants in purchasing existing rental housing for limited-equity cooperatives. They established programs to provide loans and grants to low-income homeowners who cannot afford to rehabilitate their homes and to small local landlords in areas where redlining prevents them from obtaining loans to rehabilitate their housing. The authors of <italic>The Cities’ Wealth</italic> also proposed that a local capital gains tax on “speculative” increases in real estate values could help provide funding to build or buy cooperative housing before continued increases in property values made acquisition financially infeasible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1538513211429932">23</xref></sup> Although they did not follow that specific suggestion, the city council made repeated efforts to implement the principal of tapping into increased real estate values to support production of affordable housing.</p>
<p>While the years leading up to the progressive victory in the struggle for control of Berkeley’s city government are well documented, very little has been written about the fate of the progressive programs once the progressives were in charge. Perhaps, this is because the challenges of public administration and implementation of public policy lack the high drama of electoral and protest politics. There is much to be learned, however, from what happens in City Hall after the elections are over.</p>

<title>Tax Limitation and Rent Stabilization: A Tale of Two Movements</title>
<sec id="section4-1538513211429932">
<title>The Conservative Antitax Movement in California</title>
<p>While progressives and radicals competed with moderate and liberal Democrats for control of Berkeley’s city government, a reactionary conservative movement was also under way with particular strength in Southern California and the Central Valley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1538513211429932">24</xref></sup> This movement had already won passage of a 1964 initiative to repeal state legislation barring racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing, arguing that the law was an infringement on private property rights. It also helped elect Ronald Reagan as Governor of California in 1966 and 1970, drawing in part on public anger over violence in student protests against the war, which Reagan portrayed as both unpatriotic and as criminal behavior by highly privileged youth. The movement’s major achievement in terms of effects on local government came in June 1978 with the passage of proposition 13, a voter initiative to amend the state constitution to reduce property taxes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1538513211429932">25</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Proposition 13 reduced all property taxes by more than half, limited increases in assessed value to no more than 2 percent annually until the property was sold, banned increases in value-based property taxes except to pay for bonds approved by a two-thirds majority of the voters, required a two-thirds majority of the voters for “special taxes” proposed by local governments and banned any special taxes based on property value. In addition, it banned the state government (but not local governments) from increasing taxes on the sale or transfer of real estate or on real estate values and required a two-thirds majority of the state legislature to approve any other increase in state taxes. The State of California, whose income tax revenues were increasing as the state’s economy grew, was able to step in to transfer funds to local governments and reduce the impact of proposition 13, but even so in the initial years it resulted in major service and staff reductions in local governments throughout the state, including in Berkeley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1538513211429932">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The leader in the campaign for proposition 13 was Howard Jarvis, a retired businessman and lifelong conservative political activist. In 1965, he helped found and became the leader of the United Organizations of Taxpayers (UOT), an antitax coalition that supported a series of statewide initiative measures to limit and reduce taxes. His organization joined with others in supporting unsuccessful statewide property tax limitation measures that were put on the ballot in 1968 and 1972. In 1972, he also became the executive director of the Los Angeles Apartment Owners Association, which then provided space and support for the UOT. He used the resources provided by the Apartment Owners Association to hire professional campaign consultants and to bring together a coalition of conservative homeowners associations, local business antitax groups, landlord associations, realtors, and other real estate interests to gather signatures and support the tax limitation campaigns, finally getting his own measure on the ballot in 1978.</p>
<p>Most of the organizations backing proposition 13 had been involved in previous tax limitation efforts and in efforts to oppose racial integration. California realtors and homeowners associations had worked to enforce racially restrictive covenants in response to the influx of African Americans and Mexican Americans during the Second World War and the postwar economic expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1538513211429932">27</xref></sup> Proposition 14, the 1964 initiative measure to repeal California’s fair housing laws, was backed by landlords, realtors, builders, and homeowners associations. The proposition 14 campaign argued that it was defending a fundamental private property right, the right to refuse to sell to anyone for any reason including to maintain racial segregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1538513211429932">28</xref></sup> It was passed by the voters but found unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court in 1966 and by the US Supreme Court in 1967. Then, as schools desegregated, there was extensive organizing at the local level to gain control of school boards in order to prevent busing for purposes of racial integration. Leaders and activists from these organizations also joined the proposition 13 campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1538513211429932">29</xref></sup> Together, white backlash against racial integration and opposition to taxes intended to pay for a government whose programs could now be portrayed as supporting non-white “undeserving others” proved to be powerful electoral forces in the ensuing thirty years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1538513211429932">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Among the reasons, proposition 13 succeeded where previous tax limitation initiatives had failed were two important changes, one in public finance and the other in the state economy. First, court decisions had resulted in changes in local school finance, so that schools were no longer entirely supported by local property taxes. This fed the narrative that taxes were going to “others.” Second, California’s rapidly growing economy and population were driving up urban residential land values and as a result home prices began to increase rapidly in the 1970s. Since property taxes were based on assessed value, this lead to rapidly increasing taxes and created hardship for millions of homeowners whose incomes did not increase as fast as the value of their homes. The idea of preventing this hardship was both sensible and popular, but the state legislature deadlocked on various proposals. This created an opening for proposition 13.</p>
<p>Proposition 13 reduced property taxes on all real property, not just real property occupied by homeowners, and thus protected investors’ windfall increases in real estate values from taxation as well. After proposition 13 real estate taxes no longer covered the cost of the basic local government services such as fire and police protection which give real estate its value and which had previously been paid for through the property tax. If the progressive local policy agenda owed much to Henry George and his analysis of the “unearned increment” in land values, proposition 13 embodied the anti-Georgist agenda of protecting real estate investors.</p>
<p>The proposition 13 campaign inadvertently created a political opening for progressive supporters of rent regulation. The campaign had done outreach and mailings to tenants telling them that recent rent increases were caused by increased property taxes and promising tenants that if they voted for the proposition it would lead to reduced rents. This did not happen.</p>
<p>In a fully competitive rental housing market, decreases in cost would result in higher profits which in turn would lead to increased production of housing and the increased supply would then decrease the price. California’s rental housing market was unresponsive to the increased profitability resulting from the tax reduction for two major reasons. In the short run, of course, it was unresponsive because under the best of circumstances, it requires a period of years before developers can substantially increase the supply of rental housing. However, in coastal California, there is a long-term scarcity of land available for higher-density development, so that supply never increases sufficiently to hold rents down to the level that would be found in a fully competitive land market. There is debate over whether this scarcity of land is the result of excessively restrictive land-use regulations supported by California’s homeowners or whether it is inherent in densely developed coastal metropolitan areas, but in either case the result is that rents are largely set by what the market will bear rather than by competition between housing providers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1538513211429932">31</xref></sup> Despite the major decrease in operating costs resulting from the tax reduction, rents continued to increase. As a result, the promises made by the proposition 13 campaign unexpectedly gave new life to efforts to regulate rents in California.</p>

<title>Rent Regulation <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1538513211429932">32</xref></sup></title>
<p>After the courts invalidated Berkeley’s 1972 voter initiative to establish rent controls, the appeals worked their way up to the California Supreme Court, which ruled in 1975 that local governments did have the power to control rents, but that the specific provisions of the Berkeley measure were unconstitutional. The Berkeley Tenant Union placed another rent control initiative on the ballot in 1977 but it failed to get a majority of the vote. In the wake of passage of proposition 13 in June 1978, Berkeley’s tenant advocates quickly wrote and gathered signatures for a November 1978 initiative measure to require both residential and commercial landlords to not only freeze rents for one year but also to reduce rents sufficiently to rebate 80 percent of the tax savings to the tenants. Berkeley voters passed this measure and followed up by passing a permanent residential rent control measure in June 1980. In April 1979, Santa Monica voters approved a permanent rent control measure after defeating one in June 1978 at the same time as proposition 13 was approved. By 1980, the City Councils of Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose, and several smaller cities also passed rent stabilization ordinances. Berkeley and most other cities with rent stabilization also required good cause for evictions and passed strict regulations controlling conversion of multifamily rental property to condominiums in order to prevent that potential means of escaping from rent controls. All of these rent regulation ordinances also exempted new construction.</p>
<p>The Berkeley and Santa Monica ordinances were quite different from those in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. The Berkeley and Santa Monica ordinances established strong rent controls that allowed limited rent increases for each unit without regard to changes in tenancy, a system called “vacancy control.” The other cities established moderate rent stabilization ordinances that allowed the landlord to restart the rent at the current market rate whenever a new tenancy began, and then limited further rent increases from the new starting point, a system of “vacancy decontrol—recontrol.” Strong rent control systems prevent landlords from imposing rent increases that are not necessary to operate and maintain the property or to maintain a fair return on their investment. Moderate rent stabilization systems provide stability to current tenants but do not hold rents down over the long run as apartments turn over. The new cities of East Palo Alto and West Hollywood incorporated in 1984 specifically to gain the power to implement rent regulation and joined Berkeley and Santa Monica in employing strong rent control systems.</p>
<p>The landlord associations tried to head off these developments by placing proposition 10 on the June 1980 statewide ballot. Proposition 10 would have required that all local rent stabilization ordinances be passed by the voters rather than the city council, required decontrol of units on vacancy, required that allowable annual rent increases be no less than the annual increase in the consumer price index (CPI) and permanently exempted newly constructed units from rent stabilization. This measure was defeated, receiving only 35 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>For the next twenty years, rent control was Berkeley’s largest and most contested housing program. Berkeley landlords strenuously resisted rent control, engaging in massive resistance to the provisions of the law and refusing to register or pay the registration fees that were supposed to pay for implementation of the system. Local resistance was overcome when the city council lent start-up money to the program and the ordinance was amended to establish punitive penalty fees for late payment, along with the power to place liens on properties that failed to pay. In 1981, the moderate Berkeley Democratic Club slate regained a majority on the city council after forming a coalition with local Republicans. Their appointees to the Rent Board approved a substantial rent increase. In response, tenant activists then won passage of an initiative measure making the rent board elective beginning in November 1984, believing (incorrectly) that in a majority tenant city, this would ensure a permanently protenant board.</p>
<p>Landlord organizations made ongoing efforts to override Berkeley’s residential rent controls using lawsuits and efforts to change state law through legislation and ballot initiatives. Direct court challenges to rent controls had limited success. In 1975, the California Supreme Court had invalidated Berkeley’s 1972 ordinance on the grounds that it made no provision for across-the-board increases and that it was administratively impossible to process enough individual rent adjustments to provide owners with increases to which they were entitled. However, the court also affirmed the right of a local government to control rents. The 1980 ordinance provided for an annual general adjustment for increased operating expenses and was upheld in various court challenges. In 1990, the courts held that any rent regulation was constitutionally required to provide an inflation adjustment for the landlords’ net operating income (NOI) as well as for increasing costs. This limited the strength of the ordinance but left strong rent controls basically intact.</p>
<p>Other court decisions in the 1980s were also at least partially favorable. Berkeley, like other cities with strong rent controls, has ordinances intended to protect rental housing from being converted to other uses. These include ordinances that prevent the demolition or removal of rental units under most circumstances. In 1984, the State Supreme Court upheld a Santa Monica ordinance requiring owners to obtain a permit in order to go out of the rental business and vacate tenants from the building. In 1982, Berkeley voters passed an initiative measure that established commercial rent stabilization in the Elmwood neighborhood, followed several years later by similar regulations in the Telegraph Avenue area and West Berkeley. These measures were passed with the support of neighborhood merchants as part of an effort to protect local small businesses from the greater buying power of national and regional chains. In 1987, the US District Court struck down part of Berkeley’s commercial eviction controls but left its commercial rent controls in place, leaving open the possibility of revising the ordinances to provide more limited protections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1538513211429932">33</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In 1990, the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of Berkeley’s landlords, holding that the city’s rent control system needed to provide an annual rent increase to maintain the value of NOI so that the NOI was not entirely eroded away by inflation. Later in 1990, the prolandlord slate won control of the Rent Board, having successfully and not entirely incorrectly portrayed the protenant Board majority as insensitive to the problems faced by small minority landlords. They were then able to settle the lawsuit on terms very favorable to their landlord sponsors, passing a full inflation adjustment and an annual general adjustment that together raised rent ceilings by one-third in 1991. This brought the rent ceilings of many units close to (and sometimes even above) the current market rates. Two efforts to roll back part of this increase by voter initiative in 1992 were unsuccessful, but the protenant slate regained its majority in 1994 and began to gradually undo part of the previously granted increase.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1538513211429932">34</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>When initial court challenges were not successful, the contest moved on to the state legislature and conflicts in the legislature and the courts continued in parallel. In 1976, after the California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of rent control, a coalition of landlord organizations successfully gained passage of state legislation pre-empting local governments from passing rent controls, but the legislation was vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown. In 1983 and every year thereafter legislation was introduced to mandate vacancy decontrol. Berkeley’s strong rent controls were clearly vulnerable because Republicans and business-oriented Democrats made up a majority of the legislature and supported the measure. The leader of the Democratic majority in the State Senate in the 1980s, David Roberti, was a strong liberal who supported rent control and he was able to use his control over the Democratic caucus to prevent override of strong rent controls from moving to a vote until 1995.</p>
<p>Landlord groups did have some successes, however. In 1986, after the California Supreme Court upheld the Santa Monica ordinance requiring a permit to go out of the rental business, the state legislature passed a law overriding the decision, guaranteeing owners the right to go out of business and evict all the tenants. In 1987, after the Federal District Court left open the potential for Berkeley to protect commercial tenants, the state legislature pre-empted local governments from passing commercial rent or eviction controls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1538513211429932">35</xref></sup> A 1990 state initiative measure imposed term limits and this forced David Roberti out of office four years later. The state legislature then passed an override of vacancy control in 1995, with a three year phase-in and full vacancy decontrol in 1999.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1538513211429932">36</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Rent Board’s 2010 economic study found that as a result of vacancy decontrol rents in more than 80 percent of Berkeley’s rent stabilized units had been increased to market rate at least once. As a result, total annual rents were approximately $100,000,000 higher than they would have been if rents had simply increased at the same rate as the overall Bay Area Consumer Price Index since 1978, prior to the beginning of rent controls in Berkeley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1538513211429932">37</xref></sup> (Rent increases roughly equal to the rate of increase of the CPI are equivalent to what would have resulted from either a more balanced housing market or a continued strong rent control system that met constitutional standards for a fair return.) With revenue up by $100 million annually, the resulting increase in the value of rental properties in Berkeley was well over a billion dollars. It is not surprising, with so much money at stake, that political conflicts over rent control were so hard fought at both the local and the state levels.</p>
<p>The effects of these increases were most severe for the lowest-income tenants. Surveys of tenants in Berkeley’s rent stabilized units indicated that the proportion of Berkeley’s nonstudent tenants paying over half of their income for rent had increased from 14 percent in 1988, when rent stabilization was at its strongest, to 28 percent in 2009 among tenants in units that had gone through vacancy decontrol.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1538513211429932">38</xref></sup> Today about 3,600 pre-1999 tenants still benefit from rents substantially lower than market. Two-thirds of them are low-income, nearly half very low-income and nearly two fifths either disabled or elderly. The remnants of strong rent controls are still assisting as many very low-income tenants as the Berkeley Housing Authority with its 1,800 Section 8 vouchers, but the numbers are inevitably declining.</p>
<p>With moderate rent stabilization systems in place in most major California cities and a Democratic majority in the state legislature that depended on the support of those cities, there appeared to be little chance of further legislative action to completely eliminate local government’s powers to regulate rents. Rental property owners moved on to support efforts to pass statewide initiatives. In 2006 and 2008, “property rights” initiative measures were placed on the ballot that would have eliminated rent controls and many land-use controls under the guise of protecting homes from being taken through eminent domain by Redevelopment Agencies. Both measures were defeated. Various public opinion polls show that the majority of the public thinks that rent stabilization is a good idea so it seems unlikely that future initiatives will succeed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1538513211429932">39</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>During the past thirty years, the courts and the legislature have been willing to support or allow extensive protections for sitting tenants but not measures that regulate rent over the long term. Moderate rent stabilization and good cause for eviction provide tenants with stability and predictability of a kind that is otherwise only available to homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages. This was particularly valuable to Bay Area tenants during the dot.com bubble, which created rapid increases in both residential and commercial rents throughout the area in the period from 1997 to 2001 and would have displaced far more tenants if not for rent stabilization in Berkeley, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and East Palo Alto. However, moderate rent stabilization has little effect on the overall rent level and is unable to keep housing affordable to tenants who cannot afford current market rents.</p>

<title>Funding Affordable Housing</title>
<p>Berkeley’s progressive movement supported development of nonprofit housing that would remove housing from the market and shield both current and future residents from rising land values and rents. The progressives had opposed Berkeley’s Redevelopment Agency and its initial “clearance” approach to industrial development in West Berkeley, and they proposed instead to use its resources to help develop and subsidize housing affordable to low-income people. The redevelopment area was small, however, and by the end of the 1980s its resources were largely exhausted after development of four projects totaling just over 200 units.</p>
<p>In 1989, the city council proposed to designate a new South Berkeley Redevelopment District, but this generated strenuous opposition from area residents with vivid memories of how the Bay Area Rapid Transit Agency had taken homes and displaced businesses in South Berkeley to build its rail transit line through Berkeley in the 1960s and of the destructive “clearance” approach Berkeley’s Redevelopment Agency had originally taken in West Berkeley in the 1960s and early 1970s. Faced with overwhelming neighborhood opposition, the city council withdrew the proposal in 1990.</p>
<p>In 1990, the City of Berkeley followed the example of a number of other cities and established a Housing Trust Fund (HTF). The purpose of the HTF was to bring together funding for development of affordable housing from a variety of sources, including Federal programs such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), the small amount of remaining Redevelopment Agency funding, and other state and local sources and provide a unified and rational allocation process. This provided a vehicle and a process but did not provide a source of funds.</p>
<p>After the landlord-supported slate gained control of Berkeley’s Rent Board in November 1990 and passed major across-the-board rent increases in 1991, the progressive majority on the city council began a much more urgent effort to come up with a revenue source for the HTF. In 1991, in an effort to supplement its limited resources, the Berkeley City Council passed an increase in the real estate transfer tax from 1 percent to 1.5 percent with the intention of using the revenue from the additional 0.5 percent to provide a dependable local revenue stream for the HTF and other community development activities. (An additional provision of the transfer tax ordinance provided a rebate of the 0.5 percent tax increase for owner-occupied homes where either the seller or the buyer could document that they had spent at least that much on seismic reinforcement. This became one of the most successful earthquake safety programs in California. After about fifteen years nearly half of Berkeley’s single-family homes had turned over and had carried out such necessary protections as bolting them to their foundations and installing shear walls.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in 1992 and 1993, the State of California entered a budget crisis. Liberal organizations gathered signatures for a tax reform initiative to lower the sales tax, raise the income tax on corporations and the highest-income people, and allow more frequent reappraisal of commercial real estate. Proposition 167 failed, gaining the support of only 41 percent of the voters in November 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1538513211429932">40</xref></sup> Instead, California solved the crisis by shifting the allocation of property tax revenues to give less to city and county governments. This cost Berkeley around a million dollars annually, and in order to balance its own budget, the council chose to use the additional transfer tax revenue to cover the shortfall rather than put more money into the HTF. However, in 1993, the city received a substantial and unexpected refund from the state employees’ pension plan, which also served the city, and allocated nearly two million dollars of it to affordable housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1538513211429932">41</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, new federal funding sources became available to the City of Berkeley and to local affordable housing developers through the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the HOME Investment Partnership program. These were created in the late 1980s and early 1990s during a brief convergence of liberal and conservative thinking about antipoverty programs during the Reagan and Bush I administrations. The LIHTC began as a pilot project in 1986 under Reagan and was made permanent under Clinton. It took some of the savings from a tax reform measure that eliminated accelerated depreciation for rental property and put it into a tax credit, which appealed to conservatives, in return for providing affordable housing, which appealed to liberals, and as part of the tax code was not subject to the need for annual reauthorizations by Congress, which also appealed to liberals. This was followed in 1990 by the National Affordable Housing Act, whose HOME program provided housing funding to local governments in the form of a block grant, following the same formula as the CDBG program.</p>
<p>LIHTC and HOME supported local initiatives and were often used by local nonprofit organizations, many of which were begun by or affiliated with churches. LIHTC funding was distributed by the states, while HOME funding went directly to cities. Liberals supported these programs because they promised more effective delivery of affordable housing subsidies, while conservatives saw them as reducing the role of the Federal government and increasing the role of markets and volunteerism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1538513211429932">42</xref></sup> By 1994, the moment of uneasy policy agreement had passed, Republicans began repeated efforts to repeal the LIHTC, and funding for nonprofit organizations was as likely to be targeted as part of a plan to “defund the left” as it was to be considered support for “a thousand points of light.”</p>
<p>HOME provided Berkeley with about one million dollars annually for affordable housing development and gave a dependable base level of funding to the city’s HTF. During the 1990s, with the combination of stable Federal and sporadic local funding, the HTF enabled Berkeley’s nonprofit housing development organizations to develop several hundred units of permanently affordable housing in Berkeley and to develop the experience and organizational capacity to successfully construct or acquire and rehabilitate affordable housing throughout the East Bay, becoming successful regional developers. With increasing need for affordable housing in the wake of vacancy decontrol and the capacity to produce it if only the money were there, the city council renewed its efforts to find additional local funding for affordable housing.</p>
<p>In 1996, the statewide tax limitation movement, led by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, responded to local governments’ efforts to raise money in the wake of proposition 13 by placing proposition 218 on the ballot. This measure, passed with 56 percent of the vote statewide, barred local governments from raising any taxes without a vote of the people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1538513211429932">43</xref></sup> In order to make such increases less appealing to the voters, the measure also defined any tax increase that specified the use of the money as a special tax. Under proposition 13, special taxes require approval by two-thirds of the voters. General taxes, whose use was unspecified, could be passed with a majority vote. The two-thirds requirement made any effort to pass an affordable housing tax very difficult, but in November 2002, the Berkeley City Council placed a measure on the ballot to increase the real property transfer tax from 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent to pay for affordable housing, homelessness prevention, and seismic retrofits in rental properties. It received only a 51 percent majority and failed to pass.</p>
<sec id="section7-1538513211429932">
<title>Use of Fees to Fund Housing Programs</title>
<p>The most important sources of revenue that the city can still increase without voter approval are mitigation fees, which compensate for the effects of development on the rest of the city, and fees for use of city facilities and services.</p>
<p>In 1993, the city passed a Linkage Fee Ordinance, which required that developers of commercial buildings pay fees to the city to mitigate the need the additional jobs would create for affordable housing and child care. The linkage fee principle was incorporated into a major development agreement that gave the Bayer Corporation rights to expand its research and manufacturing facilities in West Berkeley over a thirty-year period. In return, Bayer agreed to a schedule of payments to the city for the purposes of providing housing and child care, ultimately paying the city nearly a million dollars over a ten-year period. Subsequent office development in Berkeley, however, has mostly been by the University of California, which is exempt from local taxes and land-use controls because it is a state institution.</p>
<p>Real estate values in Berkeley rose dramatically from about 1997, with the dot.com bubble, to 2007, when the succeeding housing bubble deflated. During this period, the city made two efforts to tap into rising values to fund affordable housing, drawing on its right to set requirements for approval of new development and to require mitigation from developers in return for development and subdivision approvals. These involved changing the inclusionary zoning requirements to allow payment of “in-lieu” fees and allowing limited condominium conversions in return for substantial mitigation fees. In both cases, the efforts began too late in the housing boom, close to the time when the bubble would begin to deflate and were not successful in raising money, although the ordinances are in place and ready to take advantage of future market developments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1538513211429932">
<title>Condominium Conversion Fees</title>
<p>In 2005, close to the end of the housing bubble, Berkeley made an effort to tap into rising real estate values by allowing limited conversion of rental property to condominiums in return for payment of a fee into the HTF. In 1980, the Berkeley City Council had passed an ordinance banning conversion of multifamily rental units to condominiums and market-rate cooperatives in order to prevent use of conversion to evade rent controls.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, a number of rental property owners tried to evade rent controls by claiming that residents of a multifamily building were not tenants but rather homebuyers whose payments to the owner were mortgage payments rather than rent. As the efforts to create a plausible format gained sophistication and home prices in the area increased in the late 1980s, it started to become profitable for owners to carry out actual sales of undivided interests in the property (tenancies in common [TIC]), accompanied by an exclusive right to occupy a particular unit in the building. These TICs were a risky form of home ownership because financing was limited. Often the converting owner took back mortgages and some new owners were unable to refinance at a lower interest rate or find a source of financing for a new buyer when they wanted to sell. By 1992, home prices had leveled off and many owners were desperate to convert to condominiums in order to sustain the value of their purchase. In 1992, the city council amended the condominium conversion ordinance to ban conversion of multifamily rental properties with four units or more to owner-occupancy through tenancy in common. The amended ordinance also allowed the existing TICs to convert to condominiums and allowed some conversion of other multifamily rental properties under extremely limited circumstances.</p>
<p>In 2004, the California Supreme court denied review of an appellate decision that overruled San Francisco’s ordinance banning conversion of rental properties to owner-occupancy through tenancy in common, holding that the ordinance violated the owners’ constitutional right to privacy. This decision in <italic>Tom v. San Francisco</italic> invalidated Berkeley’s ordinance as well and gave owners of rental property a new right to create an entirely unregulated type of subdivision, exempt from the many consumer and public protections built into California law governing condominiums, cooperatives and planned developments.</p>
<p>The ruling created a major hole in Berkeley’s regulations protecting its rental housing stock. After vacancy decontrol, the increased rents had greatly reduced landlord interest in converting properties to owner-occupancy. Now, with the national housing bubble well under way and home prices in Berkeley reaching record levels, the potential value of conversion was again rising and the city faced the possibility of renewed conversion of rental property to TICs. In response, the city decided to loosen the near-ban on condominium conversion so that owners who wanted to convert would find it preferable to convert to condominiums.</p>
<p>The city reasoned that condominium conversion would be better for the homebuyers than TICs, and that since condominiums would sell for higher prices than TICs owners would prefer to do condominium conversion even if the city required that owners doing condominium conversions protect sitting tenants and make mitigation payments to the HTF so that the city could replace the lost units with new nonprofit housing. In 2005, council passed the proposed revisions to the ordinance and set the conversion fee at 12.5 percent of sales price of the unit, estimated to be half to two-thirds of the increase in value of a condominium conversion over a TIC.</p>
<p>Implementation of the new ordinance was slow and by the time serious processing began in 2007 the housing bubble was coming to an end. In 2008, the financial crisis brought condominium conversion to a halt. Only a few converted units were actually sold, with fees paid to the city, although a number of owners completed the process so that they could be ready when the market turned around. In response to claims by property owners that the program was not working because fees were too high, council cut the mitigation fees to 8 percent of sales price in 2009, but with no financing available this has no effect. The program had, at best, given owners an alternative to TIC conversions and likely prevented some TIC conversions from occurring.</p>

<sec id="section9-1538513211429932">
<title>Inclusionary In-lieu Fees and Housing Impact Mitigation Fees</title>
<p>The 1974 NPO contained a broad requirement that new multifamily housing construction include units affordable to low-income people. In 1986, this was replaced by a more detailed Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance that required that when developers built new housing on a property zoned to allow five units or more, 20 percent of the housing had to be set aside for low-income people at a rent no greater than 30 percent of the income of a household making 81 percent of the area median income. This ensured that rents would be limited on some of the new units and had the further advantage that the regulated units would be rented only to income-qualifying tenants. Unlike most other cities’ with inclusionary ordinances, Berkeley’s did not allow the developer to pay fees or to provide land for affordable housing to be built elsewhere.</p>
<p>Berkeley’s inclusionary zoning ordinance closely mirrored a 1979 state law that required local governments to provide a “density bonus” of 25 percent more units (later amended to allow up to 35 percent more units) if a developer set aside a certain percentage of units at a below-market rent or a sales price affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Developers who met Berkeley’s inclusionary requirement could, with little additional cost, meet the requirements for a density bonus. The effect of both the state density bonus law and the city’s inclusionary zoning ordinance was to require the developer to forgo part of the potential increase in land value that resulted from permission to build housing at higher densities since some of the apartments would rent or sell for less than the maximum market value. By 2008, for-profit developers had set aside 222 units of rental housing and twenty-three condominiums at below-market rates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1538513211429932">44</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>As both home prices and construction costs rose in the 2000s, the inclusionary formula that applied to condominiums became a source of concern. Construction costs had increased faster than incomes, with the result that the sales price set by the ordinance was now lower than the cost of construction of an inclusionary unit. In addition, the high market values and low inclusionary prices meant that the program would provide each family lucky enough to be able to buy an inclusionary unit with a discount that, paid into the HTF, would be sufficient to finance development of two or three new permanently affordable rental units. The city council decided that in light of the Bay area’s housing affordability crisis, it was more important to maximize the number of new affordable units than to have economic integration in all condominium developments. In 2004, council amended the ordinance to allow developers to pay a fee rather than sell the unit at a discount. The formula meant that the developer would pay two-thirds of the inclusionary discount into the city’s HTF and keep one-third for themselves, a sufficient incentive to assure that developers would almost always choose to pay the fee.</p>
<p>At the time the ordinance was amended, however, most new developments under way were rentals rather than condominiums. One major luxury condominium development was about to start construction, but before it was completed the 2008 financial crisis hit and it remains unclear whether the project will be sold or simply rented out. As a result, so far the HTF has received little from the new “in-lieu” fees on condominium projects.</p>
<p>Problems also emerged with the inclusionary rental requirements. The inclusionary ordinance set the required rent according to changes in area incomes, but incomes in the Bay area increased faster than the rate of inflation, so that the inclusionary rents also increased faster than the rate of inflation. Adjusted for inflation, the income that was 80 percent of area median in 2009 was equivalent to 139 percent of the area median for 1986, so that the inclusionary program was serving people at a much higher level of economic well-being than originally intended. In addition, the city found itself in frequent disagreements with building owners over whether the tenants they rented the units to really qualified as low income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1538513211429932">45</xref></sup> Review of these issues had just begun when, in 2009, the California Supreme Court declined to review an appellate ruling that invalidated inclusionary zoning requirements for future construction of rental housing.</p>
<p>Inclusionary zoning ordinances had been upheld against many previous legal challenges, but the new ruling in <italic>Palmer v. Los Angeles</italic> applied the state’s 1995 rent control override to invalidate such requirements, despite the fact that when the law was passed in 1995 over a hundred local governments, including the City of Berkeley had inclusionary zoning ordinances and that no one at the time believed these ordinances would be affected. In 2011, affordable housing advocates made an effort to get the state legislature to override the <italic>Palmer</italic> decision but they were unsuccessful, reflecting the greater difficulty of gaining affirmative legislative support to allow local government action compared with simply allowing local governments to continue doing something already within their normal powers.</p>
<p>In 2010, the city responded to the <italic>Palmer</italic> decision by commissioning a “nexus” study to provide the basis for imposing mitigation fees on construction of new market-rate housing based on the economic impact of market-rate development on the housing market. The study proposed fees that would be paid into the HTF and used to subsidize construction of additional housing at below-market rents that would be affordable to the low-paid retail, service, and other workers necessary to serve the residents of new market-rate housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1538513211429932">46</xref></sup> As an alternative, developers could mitigate the impact of the project by renting 9 percent of the units in the project at a below-market-rate affordable to low-wage working people. This would have the advantage of qualifying the project for a density bonus under state law. The value of the density bonus would largely offset the cost of providing the below-market rent units, so that the main role of the fee would be to encourage developers to provide below-market rent units, qualify for a density bonus and maximize the amount of housing they build.</p>
<p>The City Council passed an enabling ordinance for an affordable housing mitigation fee in June 2011 but postponed setting the fee until later in the year because they were faced with controversy between a staff recommendation of a $20,000 per market-rate unit fee, citizen advisory groups calling for a higher fee and developers calling for a lower fee. With the financial industry crisis and the lingering effects of the recession there is little new development underway, so Berkeley is basically putting the ordinance in place in order to be prepared for a future upswing in the housing market.</p>

<title>A Successful Fee Increase and a New Initiative to Limit Fees</title>
<p>Parking fees and fines for parking violations are paid for use of the city’s streets, parking lots, and parking structures. As a relatively dense, centrally located city in which the university generates tremendous transportation demand, on-street parking meters generate substantial revenue. In 2007, the city increased parking fees by 25 cents per hour and dedicated the expected $1,000,000 annual revenue increase to services and temporary housing assistance for the homeless.</p>
<p>In November 2010, the antitax movement again succeeded in passing a state initiative measure, proposition 26, which defined many government fees as special taxes, which means that new fees and increases in existing fees of the kind redefined by the initiative would require approval by two-thirds of the voters if set by a local government or two-thirds of the state legislature if set by the state government. The measure exempts charges for use of government property, which likely exempts parking fees, and also exempts charges imposed as a condition of property development, which likely exempts the various affordable housing fees. It exempts “reasonable regulatory costs to a local government for issuing licenses and permits” but the Berkeley Property Owners Association immediately began issuing threats to sue the city over registration fees used to support the Rent Stabilization Program.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Berkeley’s progressive activists and city council have made repeated efforts over the years to regulate rents and to use taxes and development exactions to raise money for affordable housing. Underlying this approach is an economic analysis that considers rising real estate values and rents to be unearned “windfall” increases. Conservative activists and the real estate industry that absorbs much of the benefit of these rising values were able to weaken and block many of these efforts through appeals to the state courts, lobbying the state legislature and using the statewide voter initiative process.</p>
<p>Local governments are creatures of the state and their powers are defined by state law. Local governments are a strong lobby for maintaining local control over as many issues as possible, but if one or a few local governments get too far out in front of statewide politics, they can be reined in by the courts, the state legislature or state ballot measures. When the progressives gained control of the City of Berkeley, they had the powers necessary to implement their program, unlike the situation in Burlington, Vermont, but in the end, many of these powers were taken away from them. Perhaps, one reason that there is so little written on Berkeley’s experience with progressive city government is that even when Berkeley’s progressives were able to establish innovative programs that other cities might implement, conservatives were able to change the rules to make such programs far more difficult to put in place. If, for example, another California city wished to follow Berkeley’s widely admired and successful seismic retrofit program for single-family houses, it would have to be able to get a two-thirds vote of the electorate to increase its real property transfer tax to a level from which it could then provide an exemption or rebate when seismic work is done.</p>
<p>Through its moderate rent stabilization program, the city has successfully provided three quarters of its tenants in the private housing market with protection against future displacement after they move in at a market rent. In addition, using mostly Federal funds, Berkeley has gradually developed a nonprofit housing sector with 1,950 units, amounting to about 7 percent of Berkeley’s rental housing units. The nonprofit housing organizations continue to grow, providing both affordable housing for those lucky enough to get in and a lobbying voice for further expansion of nonprofit housing and supportive social services. Berkeley has also put in place a comprehensive set of mitigation fees to tap into increases in real estate values resulting from new construction and conversion of multifamily rental properties to condominiums, but with the continuing national financial crisis and economic stagnation it is not clear whether these programs will ever bring in more than occasional and modest amounts. These programs and accomplishments are not unusual in coastal California, however, and similar ones can be found in the liberal cities of Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose.</p>
<p>Still, California has become increasingly liberal in its voting patterns over the last decade and it is possible that at some point the state’s voters will agree to change the undemocratic provisions of state law that allow 34 percent of a city’s voters or 34 percent of the state legislature to block tax increases desired by the majority. If the opportunity arises, the majority of Berkeley voters will likely support future efforts at the redistribution of wealth at the local level and other cities would then be able to follow suit.</p>
