<abstract>
<p>This article describes the development of a system to indirectly monitor the combustion characteristics of individual burners based on measurement and analysis of the signals detected from photodiodes detecting flame radiation signals. A series of experiments were conducted on a 500 kW pilot-scale furnace and on two 4 MW industrial burners located in two steel reheating furnaces. The flame radiation signals were monitored using a lens that transmitted the flame radiation to ultraviolet, visible and infrared photodiodes through a trifurcated optical fibre. The experiments covered a wide range of burner operating conditions including; variations in the burner load and excess air levels and simulations of burner imbalance. The relationships between the dynamic flame radiation signals and the burner operating parameters and conditions were made off-line using neural network models. The present work indicates that the measurement of flame radiation characteristics, coupled with neural networks, provides a promising means of monitoring and adjusting burner performance.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650912458859" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The need to reduce fuel costs, improve product quality and meet stringent environmental regulations all require the steel industry to investigate new technologies for steel reheating. Improvements are sought as the reheating of steel consumes large amounts of energy through the combustion of gaseous fuels, such as natural gas. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912458859">Figure 1</xref> shows a multi-zone furnace that is used to reheat steel billets to a uniform temperature prior to being rolled for use in other industries such as the automotive sector. This multi-zone arrangement is typical of those used in the steel reheating industry and is used to ensure efficient and even heat transfer to the steel billet load. The furnace is normally monitored, and to some extent, optimised for a desirable overall excess air through monitoring the oxygen in the common stack and the temperature profiles of the different furnace zones and the air and fuel flow rates to these zones. However, this level of information is not sufficient to detect local imbalances in, for example, the air/fuel ratio of individual burners, which can result in reduced combustion efficiency and increased emissions of the oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912458859">1</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0957650912458859" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Typical multi-zone furnace (courtesy of Tata).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912458859-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It seems that measurement of the flame radiation characteristics provides first hand diagnostic information, as the flame represents the core of the combustion system and therefore largely determines the outcome and quality of the combustion process. Consequently, it can be used for the implementation of advanced monitoring and/or control strategies, which will allow immediate notification and correction to potentially non-optimum burner operating conditions. The main challenges to the development and subsequent deployment of flame diagnostic instrumentation are often practical aspects related to cost, installation locations and also the reliability and durability of the sensors for routine use in an industrial environment. In this respect, the use of a commercially available infrared flame detector, coupled with advanced data analysis and modelling techniques to control a pilot-scale pulverised coal fired burner has had some encouraging results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912458859">2</xref></sup> This type of flame detector is normally installed in a utility power station boiler to detect the presence of the flame and so can be readily integrated with additional systems to provide more comprehensive diagnostic information.</p>
<p>Over the past decade or so, the importance of flame diagnostics at the individual burner level, using both optical and acoustic sensors, has been recognised as a potential means to optimise combustion processes in furnaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912458859">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912458859">5</xref></sup> A number of different techniques have been applied, including, imaging of the flame using charge coupled arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912458859">6</xref></sup> and subsequent processing the geometrical and luminous data to relate the flame features to parameters such as the NO<sub>x</sub>. This approach works well for luminous flames that have good access, something that in practice is quite difficult to achieve with industrial gas flames, as in the work presented here. Other work has investigated a similar approach to the work presented here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912458859">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912458859">8</xref></sup> in applying three photodiodes to monitor a coal flame in a 500 kW combustion test facility. Rather than relate the flame to the end products of the combustion process these authors used both fuzzy and neural network techniques to relate the flame signals to the fuel being delivered to the burner. Other work that appears to show promise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912458859">9</xref></sup> in providing detailed diagnostic information of the combustion process uses OH chemiluminescence monitored using a highly selective photodiode together with a photomultiplier to yield a real-time estimate of the emission of OH radicals that are indicative of the precursor reactions of NO<sub>x</sub>. This work coupled a pressure transducer with the selective photodiode to provide a very detailed investigation of the characteristics and stability of air staged flames.</p>
<p>The current article is concerned with the application of a prototype photodiode based instrumentation system to acquire dynamic flame radiation signals across the ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS) and infra-red (IR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The rationale behind of this approach was that it enabled the relative distribution in intensity of the flame spectral radiation over three different wavelength regions to be resolved simultaneously. Nonetheless, the complex nature of the flame signals poses significant challenges as determining a set of flame features, which can be related with as wide a range of burner operating conditions as possible is difficult. Many examples of papers can be found from Anjali and Ravikiran,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912458859">10</xref></sup> Sbarbaro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912458859">11</xref></sup> and Wojcik et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912458859">12</xref></sup> which have attempted to address this problem by processing the flame signals in the time, frequency and joint time–frequency domains, depending on the specific application. However, this existing body of published work is almost exclusively applied to single burner applications, so, the aim of the current work was to explore relatively simple signal processing techniques, which when combined with an artificial neural network it was hoped would be able to highlight differences in the burner operating conditions and investigate the applicability of the system to multi-burner installations through an investigation that detected imbalances between two burners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912458859"><title>Experimental methodology</title>
<p>Experiments were conducted both at pilot scale and on two industrial reheating furnaces. The first experiments, to develop the technique, were conducted on a 500 kW pilot-scale gas-fired furnace at the Tata Swinden Technology Centre (STC), Rotherham, UK. The internal dimensions of the furnace were: 3.28 m in length, 1.63 m in width and 1.14 m in height. The furnace was set up to allow continuous single-ended firing with the combustion air being preheated by a separate heat exchanger to allow independent control of the air preheat temperature with the flue gases being discharged through the exhaust. A gas sampling probe was installed on the front wall below the burner to measure the concentration of oxygen, CO and NO<sub>x</sub>. Furnace and air preheat temperatures were also recorded by type R thermocouples installed along the sidewall of the furnace and in the recuperator that were contained in an 8 mm diameter ceramic sheath, which were inserted so that the hot junction was approximately 50 mm through the refractory wall. All furnace operating parameters, including the air and gas flow rates to the burner were recorded by the plant data logging equipment.</p>
<p>The second set of demonstration experiments were conducted on two 4 MW burners of industrial steel reheating furnaces located at a Tata bar mill in the UK and a Arcelor-Mittal hot strip mill in Spain. At Tata a pair of adjacent preheated air burners situated below the level of the steel billets were selected whilst at Arcellor-Mital two opposing burners again located below the billet level were selected to test the flame monitoring system. The furnace at Arcelor-Mittal also burns coke oven gas in addition to natural gas when available. Emission measurements were not available at the burner as the pollutant emissions emanating from both furnaces were monitored globally at the exhaust. However, air and gas flows to each zone, zone temperature and air preheat temperatures were available from the central database of both plants.</p>
<p>Three relatively low-cost photodiodes with spectral responses in the UV (Roithner Lasertechnik EPD-440-0/1.4 190–570 nm with a peak sensitivity at 440 nm), VIS (Hamamatsu S1226-18BK 320–1000 nm with a peak sensitivity at 720 nm) and IR (Hamamatsu G8376-03 900–1700 nm with a peak sensitivity at 1550 nm) regions respectively, were investigated. This arrangement of photodiodes had the advantage that a single source of temporally and spatially resolved radiation from the flame could be collected simultaneously. The flame radiation was collected with a lens and coupled trifurcated fibre optic arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912458859">Figure 2(a)</xref>) that was mounted in a thermo-plastic holder. The fibre optic cable was also connected to a box holding the three photodiodes and the amplifiers and low-pass filters. At the other end, due to temperature restrictions, the thermo-plastic holder was attached to a steel pipe, which was mounted so that the sensor monitored the flame through the centre of the burner via an air-cooled tube. This ensured that no matter what the flame condition was the instrumentation monitored the same part of the flame. This arrangement not only allowed the temperature sensitive photodiodes to be located away from the hot furnace gases but also enabled close coupling to the signal conditioning unit, thereby improving the overall signal to noise ratio. Due to the length of the sighting tube, the solid viewing angle was restricted to around 5°. Focusing of the flame radiation was accommodated by making adjustments to the distance between the lens and optical coupler. This allowed optimisation of the amount of radiation transmitted to the photodiodes thus also improving the signal response. For the industrial trials a similar arrangement to that of the pilot-scale work was implemented with the instrumentation viewing the flame through the centre of the burner at Tata and at an oblique angle of approximately 20° at Arcelor-Mital. At Arcelor-Mital this meant that the instrumentation might have monitored slightly different parts of the flame, particularly when different fuels were being combusted. In practice though this is just the sort of limitation a commissioning engineer might encounter when retrofitting a system to an existing reheating furnace and the system needs to be robust enough to still yield satisfactory results.

<p>For all experiments, the flame signals were acquired into a desktop PC via a data acquisition system with a sampling rate of 8192 Hz. Due to time and plant constraints, for each of the test conditions the data was sampled continuously; however, during the transition from one test condition to another, the burner was allowed to stabilise before data acquisition began. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912458859">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows an overall schematic representation of the instrumentation relative to the furnace at STC while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912458859">Figure 3</xref> shows the full-scale setup at the Tata and Arcelor-Mittal steel reheating furnaces.

<sec id="sec3-0957650912458859"><title>Discussion of selected data</title>
<p>This section aims to investigate some of the major influences of the burner operating conditions on the system response by presenting some of the data gathered from the tests. The root mean square (RMS) averaging method was used to explore the sensor responses to different burner operating conditions. In order to match the sampling intervals of process parameters accessible from each plant, the RMS of the raw signal of each sensor was computed over periods of 10, 30 and 60 s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912458859">Figure 4</xref> presents the RMS of the optical sensors in three-dimensions for the pilot-scale experimental data. As can be seen the effect of different air preheat and burner firing rates on the data clusters can clearly be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912458859">Figure 4(a) to (c)</xref>. The flame features extracted from the two nominally identical full-scale burners at Tata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912458859">Figure 5(a)</xref>) and Arcelor-Mittal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912458859">Figure 5(b)</xref>) are quite different despite being nominally set to operate at the same test conditions. One possible explanation would be that as these features are essentially amplitude related these variations could result from subtle differences in the setup of each burner. Also the alignment of the instrumentation could affect the sensor readings, although every effort was made to ensure the consistency of the instrumentation. Nonetheless, a degree of correlation is evident in the data clusters. It was therefore necessary to utilise a mapping algorithm to relate the clusters to the parameters of interest in this work, namely the levels of excess air and the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions.

<sec id="sec4-0957650912458859"><title>Data modelling</title>
<p>This section describes the details of the modelling work in which the primary aim was to establish a methodology to relate the flame radiation signals to the excess air level and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Additional work is presented that investigates the ability of a self-organising map (SOM) neural network to classify burner imbalance.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0957650912458859"><title>Multiple linear regression and feed-forward neural network modelling</title>
<p>Data analysis and modelling were carried out using the MATLAB™ computational software. In order to examine whether the data clusters were linearly separable, a multiple linear regression algorithm was initial used. Two multiple linear regression models were constructed to predict the levels of excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions separately. As for the non-linear modelling approach, a standard feed-forward neural network with error back-propagation was also trained with the aim of improving the capture of any non-linearity that might exist in the underlying relationships. The feed-forward neural network was constructed with an input layer, one hidden layer of hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function and an output layer with a linear activation function. More background information on this widely used model can be found elsewhere in Ionescu and Candau.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912458859">13</xref></sup> Input variables to these models were the RMS values of the three photodiodes signals (i.e. UV, VIS and IR) and were divided so that 75% of the data was used for training with the remainder being used to test the network. Prior to training the network, the data set was first pre-processed by normalising the inputs and output so that they had means of zero and standard deviations of one, which aimed to reduce any unnecessary influences of any large magnitudes in any of the variables. In the case of the neural network model, different numbers of hidden neurons were considered with the optimum number being selected based on the lowest mean prediction error obtained from the testing data. The trained model was then tested with totally unseen data in order to investigate its generalisation capability.</p>

<p>For a reheating furnace, the excess air levels and NO<sub>x</sub> levels are not measured at the burner thereby increasing the complexity of implementing the flame monitoring system in practice. As a result, an alternative neural network, an SOM was considered. This network would not be used to predict the absolute levels of excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions but to recognise when the flame radiation signals monitored at the burner changed. In contrast to a supervised feed-forward network, the SOM requires no target. Input patterns are presented via the input layer but the neurons on the output layer (also known as the competitive layer) work in a completely different fashion from that of error back-propagation networks. When an input pattern is presented to the SOM, the Euclidean distances between each and every competitive neuron and the input pattern are computed. The neuron whose weight vector is closest to the input pattern is called the best-matching unit (BMU), and the weights are updated so that next time a similar pattern is presented to the network this neuron will better represent it, this is known as vector quantisation. The topological neighbours of the BMU are updated in a similar manner so that they are also moved closer to the input pattern. More background information on this widely used model can also be found in Kohonen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912458859">14</xref></sup> Vesanto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912458859">15</xref></sup> and Tan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650912458859">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The SOM implemented consisted of a grid of 12 × 12 neurons with the inputs to the SOM being the same RMS values of the three photodiode signals gathered from the full-scale industrial furnaces at Tata and Arcelor-Mittal. The data was divided so that half was used for training data and the remainder to test the network performance. To avoid any undue influence of the absolute values of the features, the data were again normalised within a range of −1 to 1.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in addition to using the SOM as a tool for data classification, it can also be used to develop a technique known as ‘novelty’ detection, via neural network modelling, where only ‘normal’ state data is used. A general approach is to model the data density for the training data, and to use the resultant model to monitor the likelihood of new input patterns during operation and compare them with the range of likelihood in the training set. In this case, the SOM has been demonstrated to be an appropriate method for the modelling of the input data density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912458859">17</xref></sup> After training on normal data, a novelty index can be determined as ‘distance’ (i.e. quantisation error) of the input pattern with respect to its ‘best-matching neuron’, with similar patters generating a small Euclidean distance and dissimilar or novel patters generating a large Euclidean distance. By this method, a threshold needs to be selected in order to establish the boundary between normality and novelty. In this case, a global threshold has been set equal to four times the average quantisation error of the training data, as recommended by Ko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912458859">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>The discussion of the neural network results are divided into two sub-sections. The investigation of the flame radiation signals collected from the pilot-scale burner using the multiple linear regression and feed-forward network will be presented first. The second section deals with the signals gathered from the industrial-scale burners using both feed-forward and SOM networks.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0957650912458859"><title>Multiple linear regression and feed-forward network modelling of pilot-scale furnace data</title>
<p>The results obtained when training the multiple linear regression and feed-forward neural network to estimate the excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912458859">Figures 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912458859">8</xref>. The training data used in both cases consisted of the 400 kW and 250 kW firing rates with air preheats of 350°C, 150°C and no air preheat. Based on the assumption of a linearly separable problem, it is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912458859">Figure 6</xref> that the multiple linear regression models have failed to capture the underlying relationship with the mean prediction errors for the excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions of 40.4% and 22.6%, respectively for the unseen test data. It will be worth mentioning that data modelling using a multivariate approach was also used but similar mean predictions errors were obtained due to the similar nature of these two linear algorithms.

<p>In contrast, the neural networks were able to make good estimates with average errors of 2.8% and 0.96% on test data sets using 25 and 15 hidden neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912458859">Figure 7</xref>). These are encouraging as the RMS values used as input variables are quite severe averages of the spectral response in the different spectral bands. These low errors probably arise from the distinct data clusters shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912458859">Figure 4</xref>). In order to evaluate the generalisation capabilities of the neural networks with totally unseen conditions, the trained models were used to predict the same parameters for a thermal input of 325 kW with the three air preheat temperatures not used during the training of the neural networks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912458859">Figure 8</xref> shows the results obtained for the excess air levels and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions with respect to the test number. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912458859">Figure 8</xref>, the trained networks were able to predict the totally unseen data with reasonable accuracy with mean prediction errors for the levels of excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions of 22.5% and 8.4%, respectively.

<p>In order to demonstrate the ability of a neural network to extrapolate rather than interpolate as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912458859">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912458859">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912458859">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912458859">10</xref> illustrate the prediction and simulation results for both the excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions using a different set of data arrangement. In this case, data gathered from Tests 17–40 was used to train the network whilst Tests 1–16 were used as totally unseen data to simulate the trained models. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912458859">Figure 9</xref>, the networks were able to predict the two burner parameters with mean prediction errors of 3.3% and 0.51%, respectively while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912458859">Figure 10</xref> shows slightly higher errors when simulated with totally unseen data with mean prediction errors of 45.6% and 20.2%, respectively.

<sec id="sec9-0957650912458859"><title>Feed-forward and SOM networks modelling of full-scale furnace data</title>
<p>The section presents the results of testing the developed flame monitoring system with the experimental data gathered from the industrial burners located at Tata and Arcelor-Mittal. In parallel to the previous results, the RMS values extracted from the three photodiodes signals were used as inputs to the neural network to estimate the levels of excess air. Predicting the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions was not possible for both industrial furnaces as already discussed. Finally, in order to diagnose burner imbalance a separate SOM network was trained as described previously.</p>
<p>The neural network results relating to Tata will be presented first. It was not possible to measure the air and gas flows to each burner individually as there was no metering to undertake this, therefore, an assumption of equal air flow to each burner had to be made. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650912458859">Figure 11</xref>, the prediction of the excess air levels made by the neural networks (with 10 hidden neurons) follows the actual trends for both burner A and burner B respectively. However, about 20% of predictions exhibit relatively high errors that are perhaps due to fluctuations in the excess air settings, as would be expected as the conditions are less controlled than the pilot-scale results.
<fig id="fig11-0957650912458859" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Neural network predictions of the excess air levels from test data of: (a) burner A, and (b) burner B – Tata test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912458859-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In order to diagnose burner out-of-balance a SOM was trained using the RMS values extracted from the three photodiodes signals. The normal operating data presented to the SOM consisted of the variable zone temperature set points gathered from burner B (Tests 1, 3 and 4 and 7 and 8) whilst abnormal operating data consisted of the data obtained when the gas supply to burner B was turned off (Tests 16 and 17). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650912458859">Figure 12(a)</xref>, the map is stretched more where the input data are sparse and closely organised for the remaining data. The implication of this is that the SOM has learnt the underlying distribution of the input data.
<fig id="fig12-0957650912458859" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Burner B result for: (a) SOM classifications of training data and (b) changes in novelty index, as a result of transition from normal operating condition to abnormal operating condition – Tata test.</p>

<p>The performance of the SOM to distinguish different operating conditions was then assessed by presenting the remainder of the data set as unseen information. The results of this are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0957650912458859">Table 4</xref> and it can be clearly seen that the network was successful in classifying both normal and abnormal operating conditions with 100% success rate on the test data set.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>As for novelty detection, data gathered from the normal operating condition was taken as the initial baseline of process normality for which the SOM was trained in order to demonstrate the differences in operating condition as novel operating states. Upon training of the normal model, the corresponding novelty index can be computed by passing the abnormal data through the normal model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650912458859">Figure 12(b)</xref> shows the novelty index calculated in this manner, when the transition (vertical dotted lines) from normal to abnormal operating condition was presented a large increase in the novelty index occurred. The horizontal dotted lines in the figure represent the global threshold which has been set equal to four times the average quantisation error of the training data.</p>
<p>Next the neural network results obtained from the flame radiation signals gathered during experiments conducted at Arcelor-Mittal will be presented. In common with the Tata results, the comparison between the prediction and measured excess air has been based on the assumption of equal distribution of air and gas flows to each burner.</p>
<p>The analysis of the flame radiation signals was first undertaken for the combustion of coke oven gas under a range of operating conditions (Test 1 and Tests 3–7). Some of the flame radiation results were not included in the modelling process as part of the plant data was not collected by the plant SCADA system. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650912458859">Figure 13</xref>, the predictions and the measured data for both burners A and B using 10 neurons in the hidden layer are in good agreement, with mean prediction errors of 20.1% and 5.8%, respectively. A better performance than with the Tata experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650912458859">Figure 11</xref>), which is perhaps due to the smaller fluctuations in the excess air settings.
<fig id="fig13-0957650912458859" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>Neural network predictions of the excess air levels from test data using coke oven gas of: (a) burner A, and (b) burner B – Arcelor-Mittal test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912458859-fig13.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From the investigation that aimed to detect burner abnormalities using the data from Tata, a similar SOM was also used to classify data gathered from the full-scale tests at Arcelor-Mittal. In this case, the SOM was used to categorise data that either belonged to normal or low excess air cases. This was simulated by manually turning off the gas supply to one of the burners whilst burning works arising gas. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0957650912458859">Figures 14(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650912458859">15(a)</xref> show two distinctive clusters on the SOM representing the normal (Test 3) and low excess air operating condition for burner A (Test 17) and burner B (Test 18), respectively. The level of discrimination between the normal and low excess air data sets is high, again indicating that the SOM would detect the differences in burner operation.

<p>The neural network prediction of the flame radiation signals whilst burning natural gas under varying operating conditions at Arcelor-Mittal (Tests 9–14) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0957650912458859">Figure 16</xref>.

<p>As for the previous tests that have investigated the detection of burner abnormalities <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0957650912458859">Figure 17(a)</xref> shows a very good demonstration of the ability of the SOM to distinguish between the normal operating condition (Test 12) and the tested burner abnormality (Test 15 where the gas isolation valve for burner A was turned off). As can be seen, both normal and abnormal operating conditions are scattered in two regions with no sign of overlapping in the feature space, implying a high success rate in applying the SOM to classify data that belongs to two different operating conditions.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0957650912458859">Figure 17(b)</xref> demonstrates again the novelty detection technique has successfully flagged significant deviations (novel unseen data) from the baseline (normal) model. From this investigation, there is a strong indication that the technique of novelty detection can be practically applied to full-scale multiple-burner steel reheating furnaces, where a large amount of normal operating data can be gathered easily. It even seems that the system is relatively insensitive to the orientation of the instrumentation with the viewing angle being set at 20° not affecting the performance of the system in any measurable way.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0957650912458859" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results presented suggest that it is possible to use three photodiodes monitoring the UV, visible and IR spectral emissions from a natural and works arising gas flame together with a simple signal processing scheme and a neural network to predict the excess air and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions emanating from the burner. In addition, by monitoring two identical burners operating under nominally identical conditions it has been shown that the spectral responses detected can exhibit significant variations. It has also been demonstrated that it is possible to monitor an individual burner and to detect burner imbalance provided that training data are available.</p>
<p>Implementation of this flame monitoring system would require a series of measurements of the flame signal for each burner to be monitored. This data would then be used to commission the flame monitoring system to an industrial furnace. As discussed the approach is promising; however, its successful application in practice requires considerable resources and expertise to be able to collect the data to commission the flame monitoring system.<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650912458859"/>
