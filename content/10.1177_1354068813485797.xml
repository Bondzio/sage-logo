<p>In 2006, Adrienne LeBas published an article in the journal <italic>Comparative Politics</italic> entitled ‘Polarization as Craft: Party Formation and State Violence in Zimbabwe’. That case study has now become part of a broader comparative study on the organization and strategy of opposition parties in Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The result is a forceful demonstration of the importance of party organization on a continent known for its weak parties and a book that forms a very welcome contribution to the budding modern literature on political parties in Africa.</p>
<p>This study investigates the causes of opposition party strength and weakness and seeks to explain ‘why some opposition parties are able to build strong organizations and mobilize large cross-ethnic constituencies … while other African opposition parties tend toward organizational weakness and fragmentation on ethnic lines’ (p. 4). The answer is sought in two factors. First, it helps if opposition parties can build on pre-existing organizational structures, especially ones that transcend socio-cultural differences. These mobilizing structures are said to be a legacy of the type of authoritarian rule: where one-party states relied on semi-corporatist alliances, as in Zambia and Zimbabwe, they inadvertently strengthened their future political opposition; where one-party states repressed organized labour, as in Kenya, they undermined the organizational basis of future opposition to one-party rule.</p>
<p>Second, LeBas uses social movement theory to argue that opposition parties in the context of hybrid regimes benefit from pursuing a polarizing strategy. Polarization results from the strategic decisions of opposition leaders to create boundaries, which are intensified after the authoritarian state reacts with violence, provoking opposition radicalization. Polarization is said to be an effective tool with which to build a strong party and increase party cohesion. This also applies to the ruling party. In an interesting excursion on ZANU-PF, LeBas shows how the ruling party in Zimbabwe concentrated its violent campaigns in party strongholds for the purpose of strengthening its own organization rather than weakening the opposition.</p>
<p>The combination of two variables with two values each leads to a two-by-two matrix of labour legacies and opposition mobilizing strategies. The Zimbabwean Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) emerged out of a strong trade union confederation that constructed a clear boundary between opposition and ruling party. The Zambian Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), while having much the same starting point, did not pursue a strategy of polarization. Kenyan opposition parties, finally, neither had a strong organizational foundation on which to build nor, apart from the brief period of the National Rainbow Coalition, did they succeed in mobilizing effectively against the authoritarian ruling party.</p>
<p>What counts as success? It is surprising to read about the MDC in Zimbabwe as more successful than the MMD in Zambia, even though the MDC has been unable to dislodge Mugabe’s regime and is currently in an unhappy power-sharing government, whereas the MMD ruled Zambia from its victory over Kaunda in 1991 to its defeat in the 2011 presidential elections and Kenya also experienced regime change. Perhaps the MDC is a stronger party in organizational terms, but what good has that done them or indeed Zimbabwe? Although the book intends to deal with both party-building and democratization, in the end it is more about the former than the latter and the possibly awkward relationship between the two could have been addressed more directly.</p>
<p>Everything in LeBas’s analysis suggests that after the opposition has entered on the path of polarization, compromise and accommodation will be very difficult, from both sides. By consequence, the Government of National Unity formed after the 2008 elections in Zimbabwe comes as a surprise to the reader and, one must assume, the author as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, does polarization indeed lead to a stronger party organization? LeBas shows how in Zimbabwe election violence and repression in 2002, and even more so in 2008, severely weakened the opposition party on the ground. In response, the MDC leadership around Morgan Tsvangirai established ‘action committees’ staffed with younger, more militant, party members. These parallel structures operated independently of regular party branches and proved crucial in the campaign of mass action. However, their role and recourse to violence was controversial within the party, resulting in a split in 2005. The case of Zimbabwe reveals that, at the very least, polarization is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>The bulk of the book is devoted to labour relations, the role of trade unions in organizing protest, and the emergence of opposition parties spanning the entire post-independence period. LeBas has collected a wealth of data through field research in all three countries and provides fascinating insights into the lives of their main opposition parties. The case of Kenya is arguably the least developed and as a reader one can only speculate whether the decision to include that third case was by design or, say, an unintended consequence of Oxford University Press selecting an expert on Kenya as one of the reviewers of the manuscript.</p>
<p>All too often the study of African politics is left to Africanists. LeBas’s book does an admirable job in grounding the study of African parties firmly in mainstream comparative politics, although more use could have been made of the European literature on corporatism and on political parties.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter seeks to draw lessons about party-building and the prospects for democracy. It struggles, as do the case studies, with the question how much is explained by legacy and how much room is left for choice. It does not succeed in providing a clear answer on whether, and under what circumstances, opposition polarization is a source of democratization or rather an excuse and trigger for authoritarian retrenchment. The main policy recommendation is to strengthen national associations in the hope that one day they may provide the basis for (opposition) parties that cut across sub-national divisions; although LeBas admits it is unlikely that the story of Zambia and Zimbabwe – where the main opposition parties grew out of labour federations – will be repeated. Finally, despite the almost Leninist belief in the importance of party organization and confrontation displayed in this book, ultimately it does not tell opposition party leaders in hybrid regimes in Africa or elsewhere what to do: ‘To polarize or not to polarize?’.</p>
