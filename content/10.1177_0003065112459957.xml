<body>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to Lawrence Friedman’s “Charles Brenner: A Practitioner’s Theorist” (<italic>JAPA</italic> 59/4).</p>
<p>There are numerous points in Friedman’s reading of Brenner that are both helpful and elegantly rendered. However, there are also several points that might benefit from clarification or elaboration.</p>
<p>First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112459957">Friedman (2011)</xref> states, “I think that the psychoanalytic term <italic>fantasy</italic> functions in the same way as <italic>compromise formation</italic>” (p. 690). For Brenner fantasy and compromise formation are on different levels of abstraction. Fantasy may be a conscious phenomenon or an unconscious inference. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112459957">Boesky (1991)</xref> has emphasized, “we should distinguish the clinical term <italic>compromise formation</italic> as a theoretic concept employed to organize our understanding of the observable data (pp. 77–78). From this vantage point, compromise formations are understood to generate both conscious and unconscious fantasies, as well as derivative actions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112459957">Arlow (1969)</xref> proposed that an “unconscious fantasy function” (p. 158) and the “fantasy activity [it generates] is a constant feature of mental life” (p. 159). Brenner employed the term <italic>compromise formation</italic> to describe the organization of fantasies. All fantasies are conceived of as compromise formations; that is, they are composed of wishes, affects, defenses, and self-punitive trends. It is a tactical decision which aspect of a compromise formation an analyst chooses to interpret at a moment in analytic collaboration.</p>
<p>Second, Friedman equates “<italic>relative</italic> abstractive ability” with objectivity (p. 692; emphasis added). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112459957">Arlow (1969)</xref> proposed that “unconscious fantasy activity . . . supplies the mental set in which the data of perception are . . . interpreted” (pp. 161, 173). Because all perceptions are constantly influenced by unconscious fantasies, they are inevitably subjective. When Friedman employs “relative” as a qualifier for objectivity, he is contradicting himself. Objectivity is an absolute term, as is subjectivity. The concept of the “unconscious fantasy function” renders the concept of objectivity a myth.</p>
<p>Finally, I suggest that Friedman’s understanding of Brenner in regard to therapeutic action is unduly pessimistic. For example, Friedman, referring to Brenner, states, “aren’t we being told that people always configure such inputs in the same basic ways . . . ? Doesn’t Brenner forbid any appeal to improved <italic>modes</italic> of thinking? . . . we hear unsettling echoes . . . that change is an illusion. . . . [and] that nothing has any impact on anything else” (p. 697). Friedman concludes by stating that “Brenner took us back to earth and gave us a chance to recover Freud’s final, realistic pessimism” (p. 699). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112459957">1990</xref> Arlow and Brenner described the role of the analyst’s interpreting in destablizing pathological compromise formations, as well as reorganizing them in less pathological form. Brenner conceived of the mind as constantly <italic>creating</italic> compromise formations and their derivative unconscious fantasies. I suggest that it is implicit in his work that successful analytic work enriches the mind’s creative capacities, lending them greater breadth and flexibility.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I want to thank Friedman for his stimulating paper and for this opportunity to respond.</p>
