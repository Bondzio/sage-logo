<abstract>
<p>There is mounting evidence that mental health courts (MHCs) reduce criminal recidivism and increase use of mental health services. Although not yet empirically tested, procedural justice has been proposed as one potential mechanism that promotes change and improves outcomes for MHC participants. In this article, we investigate MHC participants’ perceptions of procedural justice in interactions with MHC staff as well as the role of procedural justice in participants’ MHC program experiences. Participants from two MHC programs were invited to complete quantitative measures and a semistructured interview about their MHC experiences and perceptions of procedural justice. Univariate and bivariate analyses and qualitative analysis were used to examine the data. Findings indicate that MHC participants perceive a moderate level of procedural justice in interactions with MHC team members. However, perceptions of procedural justice are complex, involve multiple actions and inaction, and are affected by all members of the MHC team, not just the judge. Although scores on quantitative measures of procedural justice do not differ by court, participant perceptions discussed in semistructured interviews do vary. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.</p>

<p>There is mounting evidence that mental health courts (MHCs) are associated with improved outcomes for individuals with serious mental illnesses and criminal justice involvement. Although there is a substantial body of descriptive research on MHCs, there are fewer effectiveness studies and even fewer studies that speak to how and why MHCs promote change. In this study, we begin to address this gap by exploring the role of procedural justice in the MHC experience and as a mechanism of change.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764212465415">
<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>A decade ago, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that just over a quarter of a million people with mental disorders were incarcerated and that, overall, roughly 16% of jail inmates nationally were identified as currently having a mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212465415">Ditton, 1999</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212465415">Steadman, Osher, Robbins, Case, and Samuels (2009)</xref> estimate that 11% to 18.9% of males in custody and 21.7% to 42.1% of females in custody have a serious mental illness. These estimates are substantially higher than estimates of serious mental illness in the community, which are approximately 3% for males and 6% for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212465415">National Institute of Mental Health, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0002764212465415">
<title>The Risks Associated With Incarceration</title>
<p>Individuals with serious mental illnesses who come into contact with the legal system are at risk of negative impacts at multiple points in those interactions. This includes interactions with the police, arrest, booking, trial, incarceration, and release from jail or prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212465415">Baillargeon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212465415">Haney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212465415">Ruiz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212465415">Skeem &amp; Louden, 2006</xref>). There are multiple risks specifically associated with the incarceration of individuals with serious mental illnesses. For example, individuals with mental illnesses spend between 5 and 15 months longer in custody in comparison to individuals without a mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212465415">Ditton, 1999</xref>). People with serious mental illnesses are also at a higher risk of victimization while incarcerated. In comparison to individuals without serious mental illnesses, those with serious mental illnesses are nearly twice as likely to be involved in a fight with other inmates and twice as likely to be sexually assaulted by other inmates or staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212465415">Blitz, Wolff, &amp; Shi, 2008</xref>). People with serious mental illnesses are also at risk of experiencing an exacerbation of symptoms caused by stress surrounding arrest and incarceration and/or a lack of treatment or poor treatment while in custody (as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212465415">Torrey et al., 2010</xref>). Individuals with a serious mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system may also be at risk of frequently cycling in and out of the system with low-level felony, misdemeanor, or disorderly conduct arrests and parole revocation for technical violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212465415">Lamb &amp; Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212465415">Lurigio, Rollins, &amp; Fallon, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002764212465415">
<title>Emergence of MHCs</title>
<p>MHCs emerged from the problem-solving or specialty court model. Specialty courts were created to depopulate jails and prisons by helping individuals who were cycling in and out of the criminal justice system and who had not improved with the traditional judicial model. These courts use a team of court and treatment staff that seeks to address the underlying causes of illegal behaviors in a therapeutic way in an attempt to promote more favorable outcomes for both the court participants and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212465415">Wexler, 1996</xref>). Specialty courts are, in part, based on the principles of therapeutic jurisprudence, first introduced by David Wexler in the late 1980s. Therapeutic jurisprudence acknowledges that social forces, such as the law, legal actors, and legal procedures, can produce therapeutic (favorable and healthy) or antitherapeutic (unfavorable and unhealthy) consequences for some individuals involved in the legal process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764212465415">Winick &amp; Wexler, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764212465415">2006</xref>). Therapeutic jurisprudence assumes that certain populations of people (e.g., people with mental illness, people with substance-use disorders, and other vulnerable populations) are affected by their experience with the justice system and that punishment may not be the most appropriate option for those in need of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212465415">Schneider, Bloom, &amp; Heerema, 2007</xref>). In implementing therapeutic jurisprudence principles, courts involve a team of staff to address the underlying causes of illegal behaviors in an effort to increase the therapeutic effect of the judicial system and to promote more favorable outcomes for defendants and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212465415">Wexler, 1996</xref>). Therapeutic jurisprudence also suggests that through the act of publicly agreeing to treatment and life change, especially when family is involved, court participants will be more likely to adhere to treatment plans and probation terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212465415">Sales &amp; Shah, 1996</xref>). In 1989, drug treatment courts emerged as one of the first specialty courts; the first MHC appeared roughly 10 years after the establishment of drug treatment courts.</p>

<title>MHC Effectiveness</title>
<p>MHCs receive support for their promise to divert individuals from jail, to reduce recidivism and cost, and to increase connection to and use of mental health services. The use of MHCs is growing rapidly across the country. Although the body of outcome research is limited, MHCs appear to be meeting expectations by reducing criminal recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212465415">Council of State Governments Justice Center, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212465415">Herinckx, Swart, Ama, Dolezal, &amp; King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212465415">Hiday &amp; Ray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212465415">McNeil &amp; Binder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212465415">Moore &amp; Hiday, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212465415">Steadman, Redlich, Callahan, Robbins, &amp; Vesselinov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212465415">Trupin &amp; Richards, 2003</xref>), reducing the severity of future criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212465415">Cosden, Ellens, Schnell, Yamini-Diouf, &amp; Wolfe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212465415">Gurrera, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212465415">Moore &amp; Hiday, 2006</xref>), and improving quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212465415">Cosden et al., 2003</xref>). The only randomized controlled MHC study to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212465415">Cosden et al., 2003</xref>) compared outcomes for MHC participants to a treatment-as-usual control group. Although participants in both groups reported improved satisfaction with life, reduced distress, and improved independent-living skills, participants in the MHC also experienced reduced substance use and criminal activity. Few, if any, studies on MHC effectiveness explore the factors that influence outcomes or empirically test mediators. The current study uses an exploratory design to investigate one possible factor that may be involved in positive outcomes among MHC participants.</p>

<sec id="section5-0002764212465415">
<title>Procedural Justice</title>
<p>Although the evidence of MHC effectiveness is growing, there is a limited understanding of both how and why MHCs affect outcomes. Procedural justice is often discussed in both MHC and drug treatment court literature as an important component of the MHC experience as well as a possible mechanism associated with improved outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212465415">Gottfredson &amp; Exum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress, Petrilla, McGaha, &amp; Boothroyd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212465415">Wales, Hiday, &amp; Ray, 2010</xref>). Procedural justice highlights the importance of process relative to outcomes in encounters with authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>). Specifically, the subjective experience of being heard by a decision maker, being treated with dignity and respect, and perceiving concern by figures of authority is influential in the assessment of fairness and cooperation with the decision, regardless of the favorability of the outcome for the individual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind and Tyler (1988)</xref> explain the impact of procedural justice as a mechanism by which individuals feel that they are respected members of a group. Being treated with dignity, having a voice, and perceiving that authorities are concerned are all markers that one is a valued member of a larger group, which ultimately strengthens ties to the social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In relation to encounters with the legal system, when the decision-making process is viewed as fair, an individual is more likely to cooperate and comply with judgments and to report more favorable evaluations of authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212465415">Tyler &amp; Huo, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212465415">Tyler (2009)</xref> argues that the criminal justice system should steer away from deterrence models of regulation and shift focus to models of self-regulation and cooperation with legal authorities to promote law-abiding behaviors. Thus, the perception of procedural justice promotes self-regulation, increases effectiveness of law interventions, and reduces recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212465415">Tyler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Rigorous research has yet to support speculations about procedural justice and the role it plays in MHCs; however, scholars hypothesize that the perception of fairness of the process in MHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>) and the role of the judge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212465415">Wales et al., 2010</xref>) may be key components in reducing criminal recidivism. Although causal hypotheses were not tested, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress and colleagues (2002)</xref> report that MHC participants, in fact, perceive significantly more procedural justice in their experience with court proceedings in comparison to traditional court participants. Another study found that MHC participants overall report positive experiences with entry into the MHC and with the judge, suggesting that participants perceive procedurally just processes while involved in the MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212465415">Wales et al., 2010</xref>). In a study of another type of problem-solving court, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212465415">Gottfredson, Kearley, Najaka, and Rocha (2007)</xref> test the hypothesis that procedural justice is a mediator to positive outcomes among drug treatment court participants. According to their findings, perceptions of procedural justice are associated with a reduction in the number of different types of crimes committed, but no other significant relationships exist.</p>
<p>To better understand the role of procedural justice in MHCs, we investigate procedural justice from the MHC participant perspective. A mixed-method approach is used to capture nuances in the perceptions of procedural justice among this population. On the basis of theory and prior research, it is expected that MHC participants will report perceiving procedural justice in their encounters with the MHC staff and proceedings. For purposes of this study, procedural justice is conceptualized in four parts: (a) having a voice, feeling heard, and/or participating in the decision-making process; (b) being treated with dignity and respect; (c) perceiving concern or compassion from the judge, MHC caseworker, and probation officer; and (d) perceiving fairness in MHC proceedings regardless of outcomes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0002764212465415">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from two counties with MHCs and are referred to as Courts A and B.</p>
<sec id="section8-0002764212465415">
<title>Court A</title>
<p>Court A is housed in an urban, midwestern setting; there are five MHC sites within the county. Participants were recruited from three of the five MHC sites. The MHCs have different judges, but the same casework team follows participants from the three recruitment sites. The first MHC in this county was established in 2004. The maximum caseload for each of the five courts in this county ranges from 50 to 80 participants at full capacity. Court A accepts participants with felony charges only and is primarily postconviction, meaning individuals must plead guilty in a traditional court prior to MHC participation. Participants normally serve two years under MHC supervision. Court A relies on a network of community treatment providers to supply the needed mental health and substance-use treatment. A staff meeting is held with the MHC team prior to status hearings each week. The judge, a court administrator, the probation officer, casework services personnel, and attorneys are present at the staffings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0002764212465415">
<title>Court B</title>
<p>Court B is also located in an urban setting but covers a county that includes rural areas. The program, established in 2005, operates out of a single site. The program has a maximum caseload that ranges from 70 to 80 participants at full capacity. Court B accepts participants with a combination of misdemeanor and felony charges and has participants with both pre- (i.e., individual does not plead guilty prior to MHC participation) and postconviction agreements. In comparison to Court A, Court B has a wider range of supervision times, with as little as one year to as long as three years. Court B also uses treatment providers, but those providers work within one agency and work as a team directly with court personnel. Similar to Court A, Court B also conducts a staff meeting with the MHC team prior to status hearings each week. The judge, a court administrator, the probation officer, casework services personnel, attorneys, and community treatment providers are present during the meetings.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0002764212465415">
<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>English-speaking participants who were enrolled in either Court A or Court B for two to 18 months were eligible for study inclusion. These cutoffs were chosen to ensure that participants had been in the program long enough to engage in treatment and had enough time left in the program to allow for six months of follow-up data collection (follow-up data not reported here). Court staff and treatment teams informed all eligible MHC participants of the study by distributing study flyers and announcements. Ninety-two people with interest in the study called the researcher or asked a treatment team member to call. Eighty MHC participants enrolled and completed baseline structured interviews. In regard to the 12 people who expressed interest but did not enroll, either they did not return the researcher’s phone call when trying to schedule the baseline interview, the phone number provided was no longer a working number, they did not show up for the scheduled interview, or in one case, the individual was too psychotic to complete the consent process.</p>
<p>A subsample of 35 individuals from the pool of 80 study participants was invited to participate in an additional 60-min, semistructured interview focusing on participants’ experiences with treatment within the context of MHCs, perceptions of MHC effectiveness, and perceptions of the components that influence effectiveness. The subsample was purposively selected on the basis of mental illness diagnosis and court affiliation to ensure variation in the subsample. In addition, participants were purposively sampled on the basis of their gender, criminal justice involvement, and substance-use diagnosis, as these are robust predictors of arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212465415">Bonta, Law, &amp; Hanson, 1998</xref>). Length of time in the MHC program was also considered so that we could include a range of experiences. Twenty-six individuals consented to participation and completed the interview (<italic>n</italic> = 13 from Court A; <italic>n</italic> = 13 from Court B).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0002764212465415">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Participants’ perceptions of procedural justice were measured via a modified version of an existing scale used in previous studies to assess with the use of perceptions of procedural justice in MHC proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>) and open-ended questions. The scale comprises six questions meant to assess fairness, having a voice, dignity or respect, showing interest or concern, satisfaction with how the participant was treated, and satisfaction with the process. Response options range from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>definitely</italic> on a 6-point scale. The scale is used in other MHC studies in relation to MHC participants’ interactions with the judge (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212465415">Wales et al., 2010</xref>). The scale is modified for this study to capture participants’ perception of procedural justice in interactions with the MHC team since initial enrollment in the MHC program. The MHC team is defined as the judge, MHC caseworker, and probation officer, collectively.</p>
<p>Data from the semistructured interviews were also used to assess perceptions of procedural justice. Participants were asked, “Can you tell me how you feel about the outcome of your case and probation?” Responses to this question led to probes regarding the process in the MHC; other probes followed regarding having a voice and receiving fair treatment, for example, “Can you talk about the opportunities you have had to share with the MHC staff information about you and your personal situation?” “Do you think you have been treated pretty fairly since you started working with the MHC staff?” and “Can you give me some examples?” In addition to analysis of responses to specific questions, the entire interview transcript was examined for themes related to perceptions of procedural justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0002764212465415">
<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>A concurrent mixed-methods design was used to address research questions. A grounded dimensional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212465415">Caron &amp; Bowers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212465415">Schatzman, 1991</xref>) and thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212465415">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>) were used to explore and analyze data in the open-ended questions. Grounded dimensional analysis is a variation of grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212465415">Strauss, 1987</xref>) and allows the researcher to use an overarching interactionist framework to guide the analysis and uncover the meaning of actions and interactions in the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212465415">Kools, McCarthy, Durham, &amp; Robrecht, 1996</xref>). Thematic analysis is used in combination with the grounded dimensional analysis to identify, analyze, organize, interpret, and present patterns or themes within data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212465415">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>). Themes are intended to capture important components of the data in relation to the research question. The interviews are deconstructed into components through coding using both open coding and the overarching framework and eventually grouped together on the basis of thematic similarities. After chunks of data were grouped, they were compared, contrasted, and synthesized to create an explanatory framework and related themes.</p>
<p>Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted with the quantitative responses. Results from the quantitative analysis were interpreted within the context of the explanatory framework identified in the qualitative analysis. Trends in the quantitative data were compared with themes found in the qualitative data and vice versa to synthesize the data into a cohesive description of MHC participants’ perception of procedural justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212465415">Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutmann, &amp; Hanson, 2003</xref>).</p>

Participants differed in average age, <italic>t</italic>(78) = 2.49, <italic>p</italic> = .02, <italic>d</italic> = 0.55; arrests in the past 2 years, <italic>t</italic>(78) = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> = .02, <italic>d</italic> = 0.55; and number of services received at baseline, <italic>t</italic>(78) = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> = .00, <italic>d</italic> = 0.88, as indicated by independent <italic>t</italic> tests. Specifically, participants from Court A are, on average, older; reported being arrested more often; and received more services in comparison to participants from Court B. Participants also differed in race, χ<sup>2</sup>(4, <italic>N</italic> = 80) = 12.59, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <italic>V</italic> = 0.40, and substance use diagnosis, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 80) = 11.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>V</italic> = 0.37, as demonstrated in Pearson chi-square tests. Court A had more African American participants and more participants with substance use diagnoses in comparison to Court B.</p>

<title>Perceptions of Procedural Justice</title>
<p>First, findings are presented from the structured measure of participants’ perceptions of procedural justice among encounters with the MHC staff. The four sections that follow address the findings from the qualitative analysis of interviews with the subsample of participants.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212465415">Table 2</xref> presents the distribution of responses to the six questions that address aspects of procedural justice as perceived by the 80 study participants in addition to the average summed scale score by MHC. Overall, participants report moderate levels of procedural justice (<italic>M</italic> = 28.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.71). Just more than 80% of participants (84%) report that they were treated fairly and respectfully at least “a lot” of the time by the MHC staff. Approximately three fourths of participants (76%) also report that they were satisfied at least “a lot” with how the MHC staff dealt with their cases. Nearly three fourths (74%) of participants state that they were at least satisfied “a lot” with the decisions made about their cases. Three fourths (75%) of participants believe the MHC staff were at least genuinely interested in them “a lot,” and just more than half of participants perceive they at least had “a lot” of opportunity to tell the MHC staff their personal and/or legal situation.</p>

<title>Qualitative Analysis</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212465415">Table 2</xref>, on average, MHC participants report perceiving procedural justice in six different components. On the basis of those findings, the qualitative methodology analysis of procedural justice explicates the MHC participants’ experiences to better assess what action or inaction is associated with perceptions of procedural justice. The qualitative analysis also highlights any nuances that are unique to the population under study that are not captured in the quantitative measure.</p>
<sec id="section17-0002764212465415">
<title>Voice and validation</title>
<p>Data coded in this section are defined by references made regarding participants’ ability to talk about their personal and legal experiences with the MHC staff. Approximately 14% of references to procedural justice involved having a voice. Just fewer than half of participants reported the MHC provides ample opportunity to share their personal story and legal history, whereas the other half of participants reported that their voices are not heard by the courts or in treatment. Participants perceived having a voice in the MHC not because of their opportunities to share their stories but because of their perception that the MHC staff actually heard what they said; in other words, references to having a voice suggest that participants value validation by staff. One participant shared her experience with the MHC judge in comparison to her previous interactions with a non-MHC judge:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah . . . [the MHC judge] seems like she cares. . . . The other ones [judges] were so frustrating. It just seems like you can’t get your point across and they don’t want to listen where she’s not going to give you any leeway and she’s not going to be easier on you but at least you can stand there and as long as you’re being civil, she’ll listen to what you have to say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Half of participants interviewed reported similar experiences and reported interactions where a member of the MHC staff behaved or responded in ways that caused the participant to report that he or she was heard at that moment. One man with chronic schizophrenia and an extensive history of criminal justice involvement shared that he has a hard time articulating his thoughts in court, causing him to feel that the MHC staff do not hear him or that they misunderstand him. To improve communication, he wrote a letter while in custody for a sanction that asked the judge to consider his situation and release him early from jail. The judge read the letter and decided early release was appropriate. Although the participant felt that the MHC staff do not always hear what he has to say, he also reported that this single incident left him feeling that the MHC staff, especially the judge, will listen if the participant expresses his or her voice in creative ways.</p>
<p>The other half of participants reported that MHC staff do not hear them. A portion of participants reported differential experiences with the opportunity to have a voice in interactions with the MHC staff. One woman felt that the judge listens but the rest of the staff do not value her voice.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And when it [prior treatment] didn’t work, their [MHC caseworker’s] back was against the wall just to find me some place to go before they went to court, because there is—that’s their job to fix it, put Band-Aids on things before it gets to the judge. . . . I’m bringing up [a] place . . . Would you consider it? . . . My voice means very little in this whole process. It means nothing, absolutely nothing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, having an opportunity to share one’s voice is important in the MHC. Equally important is having some kind of validation that staff hear what is being said.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0002764212465415">
<title>Dignity</title>
<p>Dignity refers to one’s perception that he or she is worthy of respect. Passages coded as portraying dignity demonstrate how various actions or inactions transmit the perception of being treated with respect. Approximately 25% of references regarding procedural justice involve data that outline experiences of feeling respected. Participants describe being treated with dignity through a number of different mechanisms. Most often reported is that participants perceive respect and dignity when the MHC staff interact with them in a personalized manner and when the judge speaks directly to them rather than through an attorney. One MHC participant talks about his experience in the MHC as compared to his experiences with previous judges:
<disp-quote>
<p>She [the judge] tells me I’m doing well. First time I’ve ever heard a judge say that. Usually they’re telling me I’m a menace to society and I need to be put away and so yeah, it feels good actually havin’ a judge tell me you’re doin’ good. “Keep it up” and clappin’ for me and usually the judges were clappin’ because I was goin’ to prison.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked why she felt the MHC staff respected her, another participant reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess just everybody being nice to you and treating you as a human being. And to me that’s a big thing ’cause everybody likes to be treated good, and they do—I’ve never even heard the judge raise her voice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most participants report that they are treated with dignity and respect by the MHC staff. However, some participants’ experiences are more complex. Thirty-five percent of participants who discussed dignity referred to their interactions with the judge. When asked about other staff, participants from one court reported feeling little respect from clinical staff because they perceived that they were not able to actively participate in treatment planning. Participants from the other court overwhelmingly reported having more opportunity to participate in treatment planning and reported feelings of respect in their interactions with the staff as a whole.</p>
<p>Only a few participants indicated that they do not think the MHC staff treat participants with dignity and respect. The reasons given had to do with issues relating to control over decision making and general incidents in which participants reported feeling degraded. One woman shared an incident that occurred early on in the program where she felt disrespected and disempowered by staff, which made it difficult for her to believe the MHC could help her.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My charge, prostitution. So people have a preconceived notion. You get the stigma on you of whatever. So I went to court and I was dressed normal. I had on pants with boots and a shirt, a long sleeved shirt and a jacket over it. There’s no skin showing or anything like that. The boots went up to my knees but girls wear those everywhere. . . . Next thing I know apparently the judge made a notation that I was dressed provocatively where I think had I been in there for retail theft he wouldn’t have looked at me in that light. . . . So yeah, then it goes to the [caseworkers] and [they] called some other people and they have like a conference call with the other people who are dealing with me and asks is this like a problem with me. . . . The one lady’s like, “No. I don’t know what you’re talking about. That’s not a problem with her and she’s looking the same as everyone else.” She kind of set the whole thing straight for me. I was pretty upset about it. . . . I did get that from the judge. I didn’t like that. Then [Name], my case manager, she came to a meeting when I was at inpatient . . . because she was telling me I should probably go to this homeless shelter and get on Social Security. I’m like, “I was way more productive than that when I was getting high.” . . . That’s not for me. . . . She’s like, “Well what are you going to do for money?” “I’ll get a job.” She said to me, “Who’s going to give you a job?” That shit came out of her mouth. She said, “Who’s going to give you a job,” like that. She really said that. I couldn’t believe she said that to me. I’m like, “Really?” Why can’t I get a job? I’m fairly intelligent. I have some job skills. I don’t see—anyway, I did get one. . . . I did not like that because I feel like if they’re going to help, they—if somebody does not believe in you, they cannot help you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later in the interview, the participant shares that it took a long time for her to move past this incident, but she used her community treatment providers and her probation officer to help her through it.</p>

<sec id="section19-0002764212465415">
<title>Caring</title>
<p>Data coded as caring includes participant references to perceiving that the MHC staff go “above and beyond,” provide support, and act interested in participants. Participants’ perception of caring is transmitted through five notions consistently referenced in the data: (a) participant perceptions that MHC staff go “above and beyond” their duties or, as multiple participants state, are “not just there for the paychecks”; (b) provision of emotional support; (c) status checks by staff with personalized interactions (e.g., ask how family is doing, follow up on an issue from previous weeks, remember something participant mentioned in previous weeks); (d) provision of compliments; and (e) having a “gentle” approach (e.g., tone of voice, body language, words used to communicate).</p>
<p>Six participants indicate that they perceive the MHC staff as caring because they “are not just there for the paycheck.” One participant was sanctioned to jail right before the interview, and he discussed his perception of the MHC program.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It really is [a good program], even though there are sanctions for getting high or breaking the law or something. You know, in all reality they’re there to help you. You know, they get paychecks, too, but like they need that, you know, and they’re so harsh on their probationers and stuff because . . . They’re like that because they really care. I think they really care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other MHC participants interpret staff’s giving compliments and checking in on participants as caring, as indicated in the two quotes that follow. One participant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>She makes me feel like she really cares. I mean, she’s always complimenting me on doing everything that I’m suppose to be doing, and she lets me know that she’s aware of what I’m doing, and I feel like I’m a name, not a number.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant reported that he enjoys going to court because it shows that the MHC staff care about him. His experience of MHC court hearings is that they are a way the staff can keep up with his progress: “They’re trying to help me, not hurt me. . . . They don’t want to see me back in jail or dead.” Participants also view the provision of emotional support as a means of demonstrating that the court staff care. The participant quoted below reported that the judge cares about him and his progress.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He [the judge] don’t really wanna lock you up, you know? He wants you to make it, yeah, he wants you to get clean, you know? I think he honestly gets a kick out of people being successful in his program.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other reports from participants indicate that the approach the MHC staff use to address court participants is important in imparting perceptions of caring. Specifically, multiple participants discuss the importance of using an appropriate approach, which includes manner of addressing people, words used to communicate, and even the speed at which one communicates, for participants who are managing various symptoms that might interfere with communication and interpretation of actions.</p>

<title>Fairness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212465415">Tyler and Huo (2002)</xref> argue that in procedural justice, the fairness of the process weighs more importantly than the outcomes, regardless of their severity. The MHC participants interviewed present mixed perceptions on the fairness of the process as more important than the outcomes. Approximately 60% of the references regarding the process of decision making by authorities indicated that it is viewed as fair despite outcomes that participants view as being harsh. One participant reported that any decision the judge makes is to help him so he is not troubled by staff decisions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As long as you doing good they love you. Then if you ain’t doing good they still love you. They going to help you and they put you in jail—what—5, 6, 7 days. You know? You know yourself they just want to help. That’s why they do that and stuff, make you act right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other 40% of references regarding decisions about participants’ case, probation, or treatment indicated that they are viewed as “too harsh” or “unfair.” Even though these participants acknowledge that a sanction is appropriate, they felt the given sanction was an unfair punishment. For example, one participant reported that he lied when the MHC staff asked whether he was in a relationship. After finding out that he lied, the judge sentenced him to one week in jail as a sanction:
<disp-quote>
<p>That’s a long time to be sitting in jail. I’m trying to see my kid and I have things going on. It just makes more of a hardship, you know? Put me in the jury box, do something different, you know, whatever. I learned my lesson.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant echoed the above quote:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s got to be a consequence but then—I don’t know. What do you do? I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s right or wrong but I just know that I’m on the other side and I know what I feel like. You know? You can want this help but then it’s the jail and it’s your kids and it’s—they can change your whole life within the snap of a finger.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Variation by court</title>
<p>As measured by the six-item scale used in the structured interview, MHC participants’ perception of procedural justice did not vary by court; however, three major differences between participants’ perceptions did arise in the qualitative analysis between the two courts. First, participants from Court B often made reference to their staff or team. They reported more staff cohesion in their interviews and ultimately discussed perceptions of procedural justice in terms of interactions with their team. When probed, participants could discuss interactions on a more individual level, but overall, the majority of participants viewed staff members collectively. On the other hand, participants from Court A tended to refer to the judge when discussing procedural justice. Most participants reported favorable interactions with the judges from Court A but had more varied experiences with other MHC staff members.</p>
<p>A second difference between courts is in experiences with treatment planning. Court A participants overwhelmingly reported not having a voice in treatment planning. Although the majority of participants from both courts reported having a voice in court, participants from Court B also perceived being heard and having an active role in treatment planning. In comparison, the majority of participants from Court A did not perceive their voices to be of importance in goal setting, obtaining treatment, or placement in housing.</p>
<p>Finally, court participants differed in their perceptions of being treated with dignity as per reports in the semistructured interviews. All participants referenced interactions with the judge more frequently when discussing dignity and respect. Despite having favorable interactions with the judge, participants from Court A reported that not having a voice or an opportunity for shared decision making in treatment led to feelings of frustration and being controlled, which could affect perceptions of dignity and respect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212465415">Tyler (2009)</xref> states that the criminal justice system needs to shift its focus from a deterrence model to one of self-regulation and cooperation with legal authorities and that perceptions of procedural justice encourage cooperation and promote self-regulation. Tyler further argues that perceiving fairness in the decision-making process and feeling as though one is being treated with dignity and respect will affect recidivism and treatment adherence. Thus, this is an important theory to consider in MHC research.</p>
<p>The results from the structured measure of procedural justice in the current study are slightly lower in comparison to previous studies. Perceptions of procedural justice in the current study are slightly lower in comparison to perceptions of procedural justice in previous studies on mental health courts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212465415">Wales et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas previous studies asked participants to specifically rate perceptions based on interactions with the judge, the current study captures perceptions of procedural justice based on interactions with the MHC staff. Furthermore, the current study asks participants to think about perceptions of procedural justice in the period since initial involvement in the MHC, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress and colleagues (2002)</xref> measured perceptions immediately following the initial court hearing. As indicated in previous research, MHC participants perceive more procedural justice than their traditional court counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>), and results from the current study suggest that MHC participants perceive procedural justice in interactions with the entire MHC staff, not just the judge. In addition, as indicated in the semistructured interviews, procedural justice can be transmitted through a number of actions and/or inactions.</p>
<p>Although research is still somewhat mixed about MHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212465415">Frank &amp; McGuire, 2010</xref>), MHCs continue to flourish. Individuals with a mental illness who commit low-level crimes and who encounter the justice system may suffer worse outcomes as a result of incarceration (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212465415">Wexler, 1996</xref>). MHCs, despite critics’ arguments, do potentially divert individuals away from long-term incarceration. MHCs provide a window of opportunity through which individuals’ perceptions of the law can be altered. MHCs also provide a unique opportunity for judges and probation to work directly with treatment providers. Research on procedural justice suggests that perceptions of procedural justice have an impact on cooperation with authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212465415">Tyler &amp; Huo, 2002</xref>), adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>), recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212465415">Gottfredson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212465415">Tyler, 2009</xref>), positive emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212465415">Tyler &amp; Huo, 2002</xref>), the development of relationships with probation and treatment providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212465415">Skeem, Louden, Polaschek, &amp; Camp, 2007</xref>), and long-term effects on self-regulation and improving ties with the social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212465415">Tyler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764212465415">Tyler &amp; Bladder, 2003</xref>). Thus, to promote conditions and interactions in which MHC participants have the opportunity to experience having a voice, being treated with dignity, and trusting that authorities care, staff members must understand how action or inaction could affect court participants. Increasing staff members’ understanding of procedural justice is a very cost-effective way of potentially promoting a myriad of positive outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section23-0002764212465415">
<title>Implications</title>
<sec id="section24-0002764212465415">
<title>Practice</title>
<p>The findings from the current study highlight MHC participants’ perceptions of and personal experiences with procedural justice. Research shows that procedural justice affects outcomes, including the development of collaborative relationships in treatment and probation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212465415">Skeem et al., 2007</xref>) and adherence to decisions made by authorities, especially in marginalized populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212465415">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>). Treatment providers working with MHC participants and, more broadly, criminal justice–involved individuals with mental illnesses should consider the approach they take in working with this population. As clinical practitioners, clients should be treated with dignity and respect, practitioners should take an interest in their clients, and practitioners should care about their clients’ well-being. The findings presented in the current article highlight the importance of considering how core clinical values are being translated to clients and what can be done to improve perceptions of justice and fairness in treatment.</p>
<p>Although not possible for all decisions, MHCs could increase opportunities for shared decision making and incorporate participants’ perspective for some decisions, especially those surrounding treatment. Current findings support the importance of shared decision making in treatment and patient-centered care. Participants’ perceptions of procedural justice are influenced by opportunities to have a voice in treatment and individualized care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0002764212465415">
<title>Policy</title>
<p>Results from the current study also have implications for MHC policies. MHC policies and procedures need to reflect procedurally just operations from MHC recruitment to graduation to maximize the opportunity to improve perceptions of procedural justice for participants. For example, participants in the current study who reported that MHC processes are unfair also perceived that they are being controlled. Creating court-level policies to include participants in treatment planning and decision making will likely help shape participants’ perceptions of control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0002764212465415">
<title>Research</title>
<p>The current study lays the groundwork for future analysis on the long-term impacts of procedural justice on outcomes. On the basis of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212465415">Poythress et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212465415">Wales et al., 2010</xref>) and the results of the current study, MHC participants do perceive moderate levels of procedural justice in their experiences with the MHC judge and other staff. It is now important to investigate the impact of procedural justice as a mechanism of change. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis lends insight into the complexities of how procedural justice is transmitted to participants. Although there are no differences in perceptions of procedural justice between the two courts studied in the current research in the quantitative analysis, differences did appear in the qualitative analysis. Future research needs to address these differences more in depth to explicate the meanings of these differences. Future research should use participant observations and in-depth interviews to create a more extensive quantitative measure of procedural justice in MHC populations. This measure can then be used to assess perceptions of procedural justice across courts to better assess the impact of particular judges, staff members, and individual-level factors in participant perceptions of justice. Finally, future research should also examine perceptions of procedural justice and its association with long-term outcomes for participants, including mental health service participation and criminal recidivism.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0002764212465415">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are a few limitations to keep in mind when considering the results of this study. First, the measures and semistructured interviews represent one point in time. Cross-sectional measurement does not reflect changes that likely occur over time. However, the current analysis is part of a larger study that also includes a longitudinal component. Although procedural justice measures are not being readministered at follow-up, MHC administrative data on various outcomes will help minimize the shortcomings of cross-sectional measurement. Second, the current investigation does not employ a comparison group. The study is meant to explore experiences of the people currently involved in the court. It is likely that certain people choose to participate in the MHC, and thus it is possible that the group of MHC participants involved in this study is different from the people who did not choose to participate in the MHC. However, this study was not meant to draw causal hypotheses regarding participation in the MHC. Rather, the investigation seeks to explicate the subjective experiences of the MHC participants, explore mechanisms, and highlight the impact of MHCs on those individuals who choose to participate in them. Third, the measure used to capture perceptions of procedural justice assesses perceptions through interactions with staff collectively. A better assessment of procedural justice may occur through a measure with staff members individually. Finally, it may be that participants who are in the MHC longer have different experiences than participants who are newer to the courts. Longer-term participants may have more complex cases or more extensive criminal histories. These differences may affect perceptions of procedural justice; however, no significant quantitative differences existed between participants’ perceptions of procedural justice for those in the MHC for less than 12 months and those in the MHC for longer than 12 months. It is important to keep this distinction in mind when interpreting findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>MHC participants have, on average, a moderate level of perceived procedural justice regarding their experiences with the MHC staff. The current study lends insight into the various ways in which MHC participants perceive procedural justice. Many MHC participants are chronically involved in interactions with the criminal justice system whether through arrests, incarceration, parole, and/or probation. As outlined above, research suggests that these encounters with the justice system affect individuals in often negative ways. When individuals encounter the MHCs, procedural justice along with other features may enable individuals to have a more therapeutic experience.</p>
