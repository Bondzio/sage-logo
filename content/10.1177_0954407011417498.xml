<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>To limit the friction between the small end (eye) of a con-rod and the gudgeon pin, a bush is usually press-fitted into the small end bore (e.g. see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]). If the interference between the bush and the small end bore is too small, the bush may rotate with respect to the con-rod small end, thus obstructing the lubrication hole and compromising the lubrication (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011417498">Fig. 1</xref>). As a consequence, seizure may occur, which causes the failure of the piston–pin assembly. The mechanism, which may lower or even annul the initial interference between the bush and the small end, is imputable to the tensile inertial force acting at top dead centre at the beginning of the induction stroke, which pulls the connecting rod shank and elongates the small end hoop fibres.</p>

</fig>
<p>A sound theoretical approach of the above bush loosening mechanism and of the correct selection of the initial interference that prevents bush loosening does not appear to be traceable in the technical literature. In fact, while an approximate method is available for estimating the mean contact pressure between the bush and the small end due to the interference alone, i.e. in the absence of external loads (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], p. 247), the intensity of the tensile inertial load that looses the bush-eye press-fit does not appear to have been thoroughly examined. The only comparable study appears to be that of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011417498">3</xref>], devoted to the con-rod big end, where the initial separation between the cup and the con-rod big end zone adjacent to the shank is analytically correlated to the tensile inertial force acting on the con-rod shank, as well as to the bolt clamping force. An analytical, two-dimensional modelling in terms of an annulus is presented for the con-rod big end.</p>
<p>The situation encountered in the title problem is similar. In fact, the bolt clamping force of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011417498">3</xref>] corresponds in the title problem to the initial interference between the bush and the small end, whereas the initial separation between the cup and the big end zone adjacent to the shank corresponds in the title problem to the loosening between the bush and the small end.</p>
<p>There are two main problems to be considered in the bush loosening mechanism, namely: (a) the determination of the tensile load intensity that causes the bush loosening, and (b) the understanding of the causes that produce the bush rotation with respect to the eye (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011417498">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To answer the second question is difficult but perhaps not so vital. It is in fact more important to analyse the first question and to develop a modelling that expresses the analytical connection between the bush-eye initial interference and the bush loosening force. In fact, this piece of information would permit the designer to select the bush-eye interference according to sound engineering judgement and not only to his personal experience.</p>
<p>Based on an elastic modelling, in this paper a design chart is presented, which allows the interference between the con-rod small end and the bush to be selected so that no bush loosening occurs under the effect of the maximum inertial force. In addition, diagrams are provided, which permit the maximum stress within the small end to be estimated for any tensile inertial force up to its bush loosening threshold. This piece of information permits the occurrence of yielding within the small end to be forecast.</p>
<p>The design diagrams presented in this paper have been compiled with the aid of analytical/numerical tools (see sections 3.2 to 3.4). An experimental validation has been omitted for two main reasons: (a) the finite element forecasts agree perfectly with the analytical two-dimensional modelling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011417498">6</xref> later), and (b) the experimental detection of a very small gap between two bodies loosing their mutual contact is particularly complex (e.g. see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407011417498">4</xref>]).</p>

<title>2 Simplifying Assumptions</title>
<p>As a consequence of the pin bending, the shear load transfer mechanism at the contact between the con-rod eye and the gudgeon pin is three dimensional (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref> of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]). In reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>], however, it is shown that a plane modelling of the above contact well captures the maximum stress within the eye. Moving to the title problem, the bush loosening mechanism has been attributed in the introduction to the elongation of the small end hoop fibres caused by the tensile inertial force. Such elongation depends on the whole distribution of the hoop strain along the eye bore, and not exclusively on its maximum value. In fact, the elongation of the eye circular fibres lying on planes perpendicular to the pin axis and on the eye bore surface does not remain constant in the pin axial direction. Consequently, the bush may lose contact with the eye along its lateral portions but not along its central part. Nevertheless, in the interest of simplicity, a plane modelling has been adopted in this study, since it is deemed to capture the mean value in the pin axial direction of the hoop strain distribution along the eye bore border. In the three-dimensional finite element analysis carried out in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>] for a con-rod/bush/pin assembly, the separation between the small end and the bush has been specifically addressed. Although details have been omitted for brevity in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>], it was found that the separation arc remains reasonably constant in the pin axial direction, thus supporting the plane modelling of the detachment mechanism between the small end and the bush favoured in this study.</p>
<p>To prevent seizure, an initial clearance (gap) is imposed by the designer between the bush and the gudgeon pin, and this gap considerably complicates the modelling of the eye–bush–pin unilateral contact. In fact, the presence of this gap requires that the non-linear aspect connected to this progressive contact (e.g. see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]), be properly accounted for. In addition, the value of this gap affects the contact pressure distribution between the gudgeon pin and the small end, albeit moderately so (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011417498">Fig. 7</xref> of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]).</p>
<p>In reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] it is also noted that, with respect to a perfect fit situation, the presence of an initial gap produces an increase in the small end maximum stress for a given load, because the eye wraps around the pin. However, the examples presented in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] indicate that, in realistic situations, the increase in the eye peak stress due to clearance effects rarely exceeds 20 per cent with respect to its perfect-fit analogue. This relatively moderate increase is due to the initial clearance being very small in practical applications (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]). In the interest of simplicity, in this study reference has been made to a perfect fit between the bush bore and the pin surface. Consequently, the bush–pin unilateral contact is no longer progressive, but it becomes receding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The advantages deriving from the perfect fit assumption between the bush and the pin are typical of the receding contacts: (a) separation between the bush and the pin occurs for a mathematically infinitesimal inertial load, and the separation and contact arcs remain unvaried as the load is increased; (b) the stresses due to the inertial load alone increase linearly with the load level up to the bush loosening threshold, thus allowing such stresses to be rigorously normalized (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>]).</p>
<p>Moving to the eye–bush unilateral contact, the bush is press-fitted into the eye and, therefore, this contact is classifiable as regressive (see ref-erence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>]). In this regressive contact, the separation between the bush and the eye takes place for a certain inertial load threshold, and not for a vanishing load, as it occurs in receding contacts. Unfortunately, no simplification may be adopted in modelling this difficult contact, since it would compromise the mechanical response of the assembly.</p>
<p>The models developed in this paper are purely elastic. The numerical examples developed in section 8 suggest that the tensile inertial load causing the bush loosening does not generally produce plastic yielding in the con-rod eye.</p>
<p>Finally, the contact between the eye and the bush, as well as the contact between the bush and the gudgeon pin, are assumed as frictionless.</p>

<title>3 Modelling of the Bush Loosening Mechanism and of the Con-Rod Eye Deformability</title>
<p>When the tensile inertial force acting at top dead centre at the beginning of the induction stroke pulls the connecting rod shank and it elongates the small end hoop fibres, the initial interference between the bush and the eye diminishes, until the bush becomes loose for a certain inertial load threshold. Consequently, the bush may undergo a detrimental rotation with respect to the con-rod small end, which causes the obstruction of the lubrication hole. The following subsections address the bush loosening mechanism and the evaluation of the con-rod eye deformability under the effect of the tensile inertial load.</p>
<sec id="section4-0954407011417498">
<title>3.1 Modelling of the bush loosening mechanism</title>
<p>To define mathematically the bush loosening mechanism, it is necessary to clarify in which critical circumstances a bush rotation with respect to the eye is likely to occur. Two slightly different reference situations are proposed in this study: under the effect of the tensile inertial force acting at top dead centre at the beginning of the induction stroke, the bush is likely to rotate when (a) the elongated length of the eye bore border equals the initial length of the bush periphery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011417498">Fig. 2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011417498">b</xref>) an initial gap takes place between the small end bore and the bush. (An approximate compatibility condition similar to the assumption (a) has been adopted in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407011417498">7</xref>] with regard to a press-fit problem in the crankshaft realm.)</p>
<fig id="fig2-0954407011417498" position="float">
<label>Fig 2</label>
<caption><p>Bush loosening mechanism</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011417498-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Both of these assumptions imply that the contact pressure between the bush and the eye becomes virtually null when loosening occurs. In particular, in the assumption (a), a negligible contact pressure still survives that is imputable to the ovalization of both the bush and the con-rod small end (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011417498">Fig. 2</xref>). It may additionally be observed that, since the bush radial thickness is small, the bush ovalizes under the effect of a relatively small contact pressure, so that the above assumption (a) is deemed to correctly define the incipient bush loosening. Similar considerations may be developed for the assumption (b).</p>
<p>As a consequence of the virtual annulling of the contact pressure, the bush is no longer circumferentially restrained with respect to the small end, and this circumstance may favour a relative rotation between the bush and the small end. The causes of this rotation are unclear, and they may tentatively be attributed to vibration effects or to cumulative microslip phenomena (e.g. see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011417498">8</xref>]).</p>
<p>A short digression is made at this point to underline the difference between two plausible indicators of possible bush rotation. According to the indicator favoured in this paper, bush rotation is likely to occur when the bush becomes loose, i.e. when the contact pressure between the bush periphery and the small end bore is virtually null. In reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011417498">8</xref>], instead, a microslip approach is proposed that justifies bush rotation even in the presence of some contact pressure throughout the interface. As a consequence, the indicator favoured in this paper may be classified as conventional, although it still permits a comparison to be carried out among several design choices.</p>
<p>The application to practical situations of a microslip approach as a design procedure is undermined by the circumstance that the results retrieved are valid for specific dimensions and that they are difficult to normalize and generalize to a whole family of con-rod assembly geometries. The approach favoured in this paper, albeit approximate, allows a normalization of the results, upon which the design charts here presented rely.</p>
<p>As a conclusion of this digression, the present authors feel that the adoption of bush loosening as the bush rotation indicator constitutes a valuable trade-off between simplicity and general validity.</p>
<p>The main difference encountered in implementing the two above assumptions (a) and (b) within a model of the small end mechanical behaviour is that the assumption (a) does not require the modelling of the contacting surfaces after separation, whereas the assumption (b) does. It is recalled that in this regressive contact between the eye and the bush, separation occurs for a certain inertial load threshold, which defines the load transition value between two load intervals within which the mechanical response of the assembly differs substantially. Consequently, it is relatively difficult to describe the detached surfaces in an analytical model of this regressive contact, whereas it is straightforward in a finite element analysis. It may therefore be argued that the assumption (a) is suitable for both analytical and finite element approaches, whereas the assumption (b) is practically only suitable for a finite element analysis.</p>
<p>The assumptions (a) and (b) permit the intensity of the tensile inertial load that causes bush loosening to be forecast. A comparison between the two corresponding predictions is deferred to section 5.</p>
<p>With regard to the assumption (a), the elongation of the eye inner hoop fibre must be evaluated for a general value of the tensile inertial load. Two analytical elastic simplified approaches are employed in this paper together with a traditional finite element analysis; these approaches are well documented in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]. The three approaches are: (a) a modelling of the small end based upon the curved beam theory (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011417498">9</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011417498">10</xref>]); (b) a plane idealization in terms of the linear theory of elasticity relying upon a Michell-type approach (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011417498">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011417498">12</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011417498">13</xref>]); and (c) a finite element plane study (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011417498">13</xref>]).</p>
<p>In the curved beam model, the form of the contact pressure is assumed a priori, whereas in the Michell-type approach and in the finite element plane analysis, the contact pressure distribution is not imposed, but it is evaluated by solving the corresponding contact problem.</p>
<p>In all three of the above approaches, a dry frictionless perfect fit is assumed between the bush bore and the pin surface. The three approaches are described in detail in the following sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954407011417498">
<title>3.2 Curved beam model</title>
<p>In the curved beam approach, the small end is modelled in terms of an incomplete ring described as a curved beam, clamped to the connecting rod shank at an angle of 135° from the vertical axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]. Two forms of the contact pressure profile between the gudgeon pin and the small end are considered, namely (a) a constant pressure profile, corroborated by many plane- and three-dimensional finite element forecasts (e.g. see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]) and (b) a cosine-squared pressure profile, favoured by Giovannozzi (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011417498">14</xref>]).</p>
<p>It is observed that the two above pressure profiles are adopted regardless of the value of the actual initial clearance between the gudgeon pin and the bush. This simplifying assumption is suggested by the circumstance that the bush loosening generally occurs for high loads, when the contact arc width between the bush and the gudgeon pin has virtually attained its asymptotic limit of about 180° (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]). Consistently, both the above contact pressure distributions, <italic>p</italic><sub>c</sub>, are assumed to act along the top half-circumference (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011417498">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>An analytical modelling of the eye–pin contact has been developed in which a Michell-type approach (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011417498">11</xref>] to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011417498">13</xref>]) has been employed to mimic the con-rod small end in terms of the plane theory of elasticity. Only a perfunctory description of this analytical approach is reported in the following, since it has already been detailed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407011417498">15</xref>] for the comparable problem of a pin–lug connection, and since this paper mainly focuses upon the presentation of practically relevant design charts allowing the correct initial interference between the small end and the bush to be selected.</p>
<p>This analytical model essentially relies upon the classical series solution in polar coordinates credited to Michell (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011417498">11</xref>]), which is particularly suitable for describing rings variously loaded along their inner and outer borders. It is observed that Michell obtained a stress-based solution, whereas this study requires a displacement-based formulation, since it addresses a unilateral contact problem involving mixed boundary conditions. This completion of the Michell analysis is available in, for example, reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011417498">13</xref>], p. 118.</p>
<p>In this analytical modelling, the small end is partially likened to a ring (e.g. see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011417498">12</xref>]), where the differences in shape between the ring and the con-rod small end are overcome by endowing the series solution with degrees of freedom sufficient for adapting the ring solution to the small end actual geometry, in which the eye is connected to the shank and it is stiffened by its presence. Similarly, the hollow piston pin is modelled as an annulus, to which a symmetric ovalization with respect to its horizontal axis is imposed (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>] and section 3.4).</p>
<p>In the interest of simplicity, the bush has not been modelled in this contact problem. In fact, the bush has been considered as being part of the pin, since its presence does not substantially alter the contract pressure distribution. A perfect fit has been assumed between the eye and the pin. Finally, the unilateral, receding contact between the small end and the gudgeon pin is described in terms of the minimization of a functional (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407011417498">15</xref>]).</p>
<p>Once the contact pressure has been determined, the elongation of the circumferential fibre of the small end bore may be computed for a general value of the tensile force per unit thickness, <italic>F</italic>/<italic>t</italic>. The actual bush loosening has been computed for an interval of the small end outer to inner radii ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>, comprised between 1.2 and 2, as in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]. Finally, a single gudgeon pin radii ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.5, has been addressed, since its influence on the contact pressure profile is limited (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011417498">Fig. 6</xref> of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]). These forecasts permits the curve denoted by ‘Michell’ to be defined and inserted in the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>

<title>3.4 Finite element modelling</title>
<p>The plane elastic finite element study addresses the frictionless dry contact between the con-rod small end and the hollow piston pin, and it is analogous to that developed in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]. The commercial finite element program MSC.Marc 2007r1 has been employed. The spider web-type mesh describing the con-rod eye and the gudgeon pin is analogous to that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref> of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] and consists of about 14 000 nodes.</p>
<p>In the contact problem between the con-rod eye and the gudgeon pin modelled as a plane problem, the pin is inevitably loaded or constrained in a physically approximate way, since the actual shear load transfer mechanism is essentially three-dimensional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]. The above load transfer mechanism was modelled in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407011417498">16</xref>] by applying various fictitious forces along the inner circumference of the hollow pin. The model adopted in this study follows similar avenues, but the equilibrating load is applied along the pin outer circumference. This plane idealization has been critically examined and employed in the finite element models of references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>], to which the interested reader is referred. The same idealization has been employed in the analytical, plane Michell-type model of section 3.3.</p>
<p>Two variously accurate finite element models have been developed. In both models, no initial clearance has been considered between the bush bore and the gudgeon pin periphery. The difference between the two models rests on the bush modelling. In the simplified model, similar to the Michell-type approach of section 3.3, the bush has not been modelled, but it has been considered as part of the pin. In the more accurate model, instead, the presence of the bush has been included.</p>
<p>In automotive industrial applications, both the con-rod and the bush are commonly made of steel; a very thin coating of bronze alloy is applied to the bush inner surface to reduce friction. Moving to racing applications, the con-rod is usually made of titanium alloy; in this case, the bush is normally wholly made of bronze alloy to avoid the direct contact between titanium and steel at the bush outer surface. In fact, the resulting high frictional coefficient may promote undesired fretting fatigue at the interface between the bush and small end. However, the authors are aware of applications in which bushless steel and titanium con-rod small ends have successfully been employed, as discussed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011417498">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In this paper, only con-rods made of steel have been addressed; consequently, in the finite element analysis the bush has been considered to be made of steel. In the interest of simplicity, the thin coating of bronze alloy has not been mimicked, as in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>]. In conclusion, in this study the eye, the bush, and the gudgeon pin have been modelled as steel components exhibiting the same Young’s modulus.</p>
<p>Particular care has been devoted to the modelling of the bush press-fitting; a suitable procedure has been implemented to account for the fact that in real applications the bush is machined after being press-fitted. As a result of this machining, the bush inner border is perfectly circular after press-fitting, and it fits perfectly with the pin periphery. The contact between the bush and the gudgeon pin is therefore receding. In the absence of any external load, the contact extends over the whole pin periphery, whereas the presence of an external load causes a contraction of the contact arc towards about half of the pin periphery, where the extent of this contact arc is independent of the intensity of the applied load (e.g. see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011417498">5</xref>]).</p>
<p>In the simplified finite element model, the tensile inertial force that causes the bush loosening has been evaluated according to the assumption (a) of section 3.1, whereas in the more accurate finite element model, the assumption (b) has been adopted. A comparison between the two corresponding predictions is deferred to section 5.</p>
<p>The forecasts supplied by the simplified finite element model refer to small end outer to inner radii ratios, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>, comprised between 1.2 and 2, and to a single gudgeon pin radii ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.5, as in section 3.3. Such forecasts permits the curve denoted by ‘FEM’ to be defined and inserted in the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>
<p>The forecasts supplied by the more accurate finite element model depend on the bush aspect ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub>. To avoid confusion, these forecasts have not been inserted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref>, but they have been presented for comparison purposes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref> and commented on in section 5.</p>

<title>4 Design Chart to Determine the Bush Loosening Force</title>
<p>The three small end models illustrated in sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 have been employed to compile the design chart presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref>. This chart reports the con-rod normalized tensile inertial force producing bush loosening, <italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>/(<italic>E</italic> × <italic>t</italic> × <italic>i</italic>), where <italic>E</italic> symbolizes the eye/pin Young’s modulus, <italic>t</italic> indicates the eye thickness in the pin axial direction, and <italic>i</italic> denotes the initial diametrical interference versus the small end outer to inner radii ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>, ranging from 1.2 to 2, as in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The simplified finite element forecasts of section 3.3 agree perfectly with their Michell-type analytical counterparts; the curved beam models adopting either a constant pressure or a cosine-squared pressure distribution appreciably overrate the finite element predictions, especially for high <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> ratios, and, therefore, they are not recommended for technical calculations. The accuracy limits of the curved beam model have already been evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011417498">Fig. 1</xref> of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]; it was nevertheless decided to include the corresponding forecasts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref> of this paper because of the historical relevance of this modelling (e.g. see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011417498">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011417498">10</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011417498">14</xref>]). The simplified finite element/Michell-type predictions have been interpolated with a polynomial expression reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref>, which will be used in the numerical examples presented in section 8.</p>
<p>The design chart of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref> permits the initial interference to be estimated, for which the bush loosening occurs for a prescribed tensile inertial force. However, in practical applications, a safety factor must be introduced to define the correct initial interference. For instance, if a safety factor of two is considered, the initial interference adopted must be twice that for which the bush loosening actually occurs for a prescribed tensile inertial force.</p>

<title>5 Assessment of Two Simplifying Assumptions</title>
<p>It is recalled that in the Michell-type approach of section 3.3 and in the simplified finite element model of section 3.4, the contact between the con-rod small end and the gudgeon pin has been modelled by neglecting the presence of the bush. Conversely, the bush has been accounted for in the accurate finite element model of section 3.4. In addition, when the presence of the bush has been ignored, the bush loosening mechanism has been described by the assumption (a) of section 3.1, whereas when the bush has been considered the assumption (b) has been adopted.</p>
<p>The effect of the bush presence as well as the difference between the assumptions (a) and (b) in the prediction of the bush loosening force have been assessed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref> for the selection of small end outer to inner radii ratios, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and for four equispaced bush aspect ratios, <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub>, ranging from 1.05 to 1.2. The predictions of the bush loosening force according to the simplified finite element/Michell-type models, which disregard the presence of the bush, have been represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref> with dotted lines, whereas the forecasts according to the accurate finite element model, which accounts for the bush, have been reported with solid curves. Since the simplified finite element/Michell-type models neglect the bush presence, the corresponding forecasts are independent of the bush aspect ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub>; i.e. the dotted lines are horizontal.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011417498-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The relative error between the solid curves and the corresponding dotted lines attains a maximum value of 30 per cent when the bush and the con-rod small end exhibit comparable radial thicknesses (<italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub> = 1.2, low-right zone of the diagram). However, when the bush radial thickness is small when compared with the small end radial thickness, as occurs in technical applications, the maximum error drops down to about 6 per cent, thus both corroborating the assumption according to which the presence of the bush may be neglected and testifying that the two bush loosening mechanisms presented in section 3.1 supply very similar forecasts.</p>
<p>Since the accurate finite element analysis of section 3.4 includes the presence of the bush, it allows the zones of initial separation between the small end bore and the bush periphery to be determined. The bush separation initiates from two different zones depending on the value of the con-rod aspect ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>. When the radial thickness of the small end is high in comparison with the bush radial thickness, the bush separates from the small end starting from the small end sides, zones A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref>. Conversely, when the thickness of the con-rod small end is small and it becomes comparable with the bush radial thickness, the initial gap between the bush and the small end appears at an angle of approximately 135 ° from the midpoint of the contact arc, zones B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref>. The grey region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref> denotes the transition between these two zones.</p>

<title>6 Evaluation of the Maximum Elastic Stress within the Small End</title>
<p>The design chart of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref> permits the bush loosening load to be forecast for an imposed interference, or vice versa. For inertial loads lower than or equal to the bush loosening threshold, it is practically relevant to evaluate the corresponding maximum stress within the eye, in order to assess (a) whether the elastic approach favoured in this paper is applicable and (b) whether an undesired yielding occurs within the eye. To this regard, the following observations may be developed.</p>
<p>While the bush stresses decrease as the tensile inertial load is increased (see section 7), the stresses within the con-rod small end increase with the inertial load, following a relatively complex mechanism. In fact, the stresses within the small end depend on the combined effects of the press-fit and of the tensile inertial force affecting the shank. In particular, when the tensile inertial force is null, the small end stresses are attributable to the bush–eye initial interference fit alone. Conversely, when the shank load reaches the bush loosening threshold, the small end stresses are (essentially) imputable to the inertial load alone, since the bush–eye press-fit pressure vanishes. Consequently, by assuming a linear mechanical response of the assembly (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0954407011417498">Appendix 2</xref> for critical remarks), when the load applied to the con-rod shank is, say, one-third of its loosening threshold, the small end stresses imputable to the inertial force effects are one-third of the stresses computed by considering the whole loosening force, whereas the stresses attributable to the interference effects are two-thirds of the initial interference stresses.</p>
<p>The small end maximum equivalent stress due to the bush loosening load, <italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>, may be extracted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011417498">Fig. 6</xref>, derived from the same studies developed to compile <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011417498">Figure 6</xref> displays, for a general value of the inertial force, <italic>F</italic>, the maximum equivalent stress within the eye, σ<sub>F</sub>, normalized over the mean contact pressure, <italic>p</italic><sub>c,m</sub> = <italic>F</italic>/(2 × <italic>t</italic> × <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>) (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]) versus the eye outer to inner radii ratio, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>.

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011417498-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As a consequence of the above normalization and of the linear response of the structure in the presence of the receding contact between the eye and pin (see section 2), the maximum equivalent stress may be computed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011417498">Fig. 6</xref> for a general value of the force <italic>F</italic>, and not only for its loosening threshold. In addition, since the maximum equivalent stress falls just outside the contact region between the small end bore and the pin periphery, it in fact coincides with the maximum hoop stress along the small end bore (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011417498">6</xref>]). The finite element/Michell-type predictions have been interpolated with a polynomial expression reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011417498">Fig. 6</xref>, which will be used in the numerical examples presented in section 8.</p>
<p>The small end stresses due to the initial interference of the bush alone, σ<sub>int</sub>, may be estimated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011417498">Fig. 7</xref>, in which the finite element predictions derived from the accurate finite element model of section 3.4 are compared to the Lamé forecasts (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], p. 247). The maximum relative error occurs for <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.2 and for <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> = 1.2, and it is approximately 16 per cent. In most practical applications, however, the error is below 10 per cent.</p>

</fig>
<p>The elastic total stresses within the eye may thus be estimated as the sum of the proper percentages of the interference stresses alone and of the stresses due to the loosening value of the tensile inertial force. The numerical examples of section 8 indicate that the proposed approach supplies accurate forecasts of the maximum stress within the eye for a load lower than its loosening threshold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0954407011417498">
<title>7 Evaluation of the Maximum Elastic Stress within the Bush</title>
<p>As already noted in section 6, the maximum stresses within the bush occur during press-fit, since the tensile inertial force releases the bush press-fit stresses. Consequently, if the bush stays elastic when pressed-in, it remains elastic under the effect of the tensile inertial force. The elastic stress within the bush and due to press-fit alone may be estimated by likening the small end and the bush to two thick hollow cylinders and by applying the Lamé theory (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], p. 247). (Although the periphery of the press-fitted bush is loaded by the contact pressure with the eye, whereas its inner border is not pressurized, consistent with the Lamé theory the bush maximum equivalent stress occurs at its inner border and, therefore, it coincides with the compressive hoop stress at its inner border.)</p>
<p>It is therefore possible to forecast whether the bush undergoes plastic deformation during press-fit.</p>

<sec id="section12-0954407011417498">
<title>8 Proposed Design Procedure and Numerical Examples</title>
<p>A design procedure is proposed in the following to determine the correct initial interference for a known tensile inertial force and to forecast the maximum stress within the small end and the bush. Firstly, the normalized loosening load <italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>/(<italic>E</italic> × <italic>t</italic> × <italic>i</italic>) is extracted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011417498">Fig. 4</xref> for the specific eye geometry of interest, summarized by the ratio <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>.

<p>Since a safety factor <italic>n</italic> must be employed, the value of the loosening load, <italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>, must equal <italic>n</italic> times the maximum tensile inertial force, <italic>F</italic>, i.e. <italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub> = <italic>n</italic> × <italic>F</italic>.

<p>The initial interference stresses within the small end may be estimated from the Lamé theory (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], p. 247) or from the finite element forecasts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011417498">Fig. 7</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the ratio between the actual maximum applied load and the bush loosening load is known and equal to 1/<italic>n</italic>, the elastic total hoop stress within the eye may be predicted as indicated in section 6 by performing the sum between (a) 1/<italic>n</italic> times the stresses computed by considering the whole loosening force, and (b) (1–1/<italic>n</italic>) times the stresses attributable to the interference effects alone.</p>
<p>In the following, two numerical examples are presented, aimed at allowing the non-specialist to employ the design charts correctly without excessively dwelling on the underlying theory. The main parameters describing the two test cases are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407011417498">Table 1</xref>. The inner radius of the small end, <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>, nominally (i.e. apart from the interference) coincides with the outer radius of the bush, and the inner radius of the bush, <italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub>, coincides with the outer radius of the gudgeon pin (i.e. perfect fit is assumed).</p>

<p>Results obtained by applying the proposed modelling procedure are compared with those obtained by employing the accurate plane finite element model described in section 3.4, where the combined effects of both the press-fitting and of the inertial force are simultaneously taken into account.</p>
<p>The results retrieved with the proposed procedure agree with the finite element forecasts in terms of the maximum hoop stress at the inner border of the con-rod small end. In particular, for Case 1 the error is approximately 6.2 per cent, whereas for Case 2 the error is about 7 per cent </p>
<p>In both cases, the proposed methodology provides conservative results. This behaviour is rationalized in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0954407011417498">Appendix 2</xref>.</p>

<title>9 Conclusions</title>
<p>The loosening mechanism has been explored of a bush press-fitted into the small end bore of a con-rod. A modelling of the bush loosening mechanism has been developed. Numerical and analytical forecasts of the tensile inertial force responsible for the bush loosening have been presented for a purely elastic model. Proper design charts have been compiled that allow (a) the initial interference precluding any bush loosening to be determined within the respect of an imposed safety factor, and (b) the maximum elastic stress within the small end to be computed for a general inertial load. Selected numerical examples illustrating the proposed design procedure have been presented.</p>

<title>Appendix 2</title>
<p>In this appendix, two main aspects are critically discussed, namely (a) the linearization of the press-fit problem (see section 6) and (b) the fact that the proposed simplified procedure is conservative.</p>
<p>The assembly of the title problem resembles other well-known pre-stressed assemblies, of which the bolted connection probably represents the most classical example (e.g. see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407011417498">18</xref>]). In such assemblies, the initial stress field due to a press-fit mechanism is altered by the application of an external load.</p>
<p>With respect to classical pre-loaded assemblies, the problem of a bush press-fitted into the con-rod small end exhibits a main peculiarity, stemming from the eye stresses due to the bush press-fit alone not staying constant along the inner border of the small end. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Figure 8</xref> details the variation with the angular coordinate <italic>θ</italic> of the equivalent von Mises stress due to the initial interference alone, computed along the inner border of the con-rod small end. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref>, two extremal small end outer to inner radii ratios, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.2 and 2 (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011417498">1</xref>]), and two extremal bush outer to inner radii ratios, <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub> = 1.05 and 1.2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011417498">Fig. 5</xref>), have been considered. The curves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref> address the four combinations of the two above aspect ratios.</p>

<caption><p>Normalized von Mises stress, <italic>σ</italic><sub>int</sub> × <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/(<italic>E</italic> × <italic>i</italic>), within the small end and due to the initial interference alone, versus the angular coordinate, <italic>θ</italic></p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011417498-fig8.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The forecasts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref> have been obtained with the Lamé theory (reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011417498">2</xref>], p. 247) (they remain constant with the angular coordinate) and with the accurate plane finite element model of section 3.4. The deviation between the finite element and the Lamé predictions increases when the bush radial thickness becomes comparable with the eye thickness, i.e. when <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.2, <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>ib</sub> = 1.2, and for <italic>θ = </italic>180 °, where it reaches its maximum relative error of about 39 per cent. However, if only the zones A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011417498">Fig. 9</xref> are considered in which the total stress is computed, the maximum error drops down to 19 per cent. If, in addition, more realistic combinations of the bush and eye aspect ratios are accounted for, the maximum error attains its minimum value of 5 per cent.</p>

</fig>
<p>In general, the finite element equivalent stress oscillates around a mean value correctly represented by the Lamé theory.</p>
<p>Since the eye stresses due to the bush press-fit alone, σ<sub>bush</sub>, are modified by the application of an external force, <italic>F</italic>, and they (essentially) vanish for <italic>F</italic> = <italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>, whereas the stresses σ<sub>F</sub> due to the external force alone, <italic>F</italic>, may be described by a linear expression of the kind σ<sub>F</sub>(θ) = σ<sub>loose</sub>(θ) × <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub> (it is recalled that a perfect fit has been assumed between the bush and the gudgeon pin, as given in section 2), the total stresses within the eye, σ<sub>tot</sub>, may be described by an expression of the kind σ<sub>tot</sub> = σ<sub>bush</sub>(θ) × (1 – <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>) + σ<sub>loose</sub>(θ) × <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub> = σ<sub>bush</sub>(θ) + [σ<sub>loose</sub>(θ)– σ<sub>bush</sub>(θ)] × <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>loose</sub>. (In summing the two above stress contributions, the relevant simplification has been made not to resort to an equivalent stress formula but to carry out a simple sum.)</p>
<p>The above expression shows that (a) for a fixed position within the eye, the components of the total stress vary linearly with the intensity of the inertial force <italic>F</italic>, although not from the origin (they are a linear variation), and (b) the total equivalent stress attains its maximum at an angular position that varies with <italic>F</italic>, and, consequently, it depends non-linearly upon <italic>F</italic>.</p>
<p>The predictions retrieved from the accurate finite element model of section 3.4 confirm the two above analytical expectations (a) and (b). With particular regard to the expectation (b), the finite element predictions clarify that, when only the press-fitting is considered, the maximum stress occurs at the inner border of the small end in the upper region (see the zone lettered A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011417498">Fig. 9(a)</xref>), whereas, upon the application of a tensile inertial force, the position of the maximum equivalent stress moves circumferentially, reaching the eye bore sides (see the zone lettered A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011417498">Fig. 9(b)</xref>) for relatively low loads. Consistent with the numerical result according to which the position of the maximum equivalent stress remains virtually unchanged for high values of <italic>F</italic>, the response of the equivalent stress is appreciably non-linear for low levels of the inertial load <italic>F</italic>, whereas for high values of <italic>F</italic> the above response becomes almost linear.</p>
<p>Consistently, the finite element predictions indicate that a linearization of the above problem constitutes a close approximation to the actual mechanical response, and they show that a linear approximation supplies conservative forecasts, provided that some precautions are adopted in the linearization. The correct precautions are suggested by the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011417498">Fig. 9</xref>, which evidence the fact that the maximum value of the equivalent von Mises stress due to the initial interference alone and computed along the inner border of the small end with finite elements is higher than the one obtained with the Lamé theory. At a first sight, the employment of the Lamé theory might seem unsafe in forecasting the contribution of the small end stresses due to the initial press-fitting. It is observed, however, that, as the tensile inertial force is increased, the maximum equivalent von Mises stress at the inner border of the small end moves from the eye top region towards the eye bore sides (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref> and the zones lettered A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011417498">Figs 9(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011417498">b</xref>)). Consequently, at the eye bore sides the angularly constant stress due to the initial interference alone and computed with the Lamé theory is higher than the corresponding finite element forecast (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref>) and this fact rationalizes the conservative character of the proposed simplified procedure.</p>
<p>In summary, the following conclusion is valid for the prediction of the contribution of the initial press-fitting on the total stress affecting the small end during operating conditions. The use of both the Lamé theory and the maximum value of the equivalent von Mises stress computed with finite elements at the inner border of the con-rod small end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011417498">Fig. 8</xref>) provides slightly conservative results in computing, within the small end, the total stress due to both the initial press-fitting and the tensile inertial load. The above observations rationalize the numerical forecasts of section 8, according to which the total stress computed with the proposed methodology is (moderately) higher than the one computed by employing the accurate finite element model of section 3.4.</p>
