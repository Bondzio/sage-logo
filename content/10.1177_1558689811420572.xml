<p>This article highlights the benefits of jointly using cultural modeling and cultural consensus analysis for the purpose of triangulation in research in which a cultural group’s point of view is desired. Cultural models are those presupposed, taken-for-granted models of knowledge and thought used in the course of everyday life to guide a person’s understanding of the world. These models can be identified by discourse analysis. Cultural consensus analysis is a quantitative-based methodological tool that asks if shared knowledge of a specific cultural domain exists within a group of informants. In presenting their results, the authors recommend the joint use of these two methods in research in which a broad understanding of a cultural group’s perspective on a given topic is needed.</p>

<p>This article discusses a mixed methods research design which combines discourse analysis and cultural consensus analysis to formulate models of New Zealand cultural and national identity. The joint use of the two methods is discussed in the context of a research project focused on understanding New Zealand’s innovation and position as a middling performer in the international innovation rankings. New Zealand ranks 26th on the International Innovation Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689811420572">Andrew, DeRocco, &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>) behind countries such as Spain (classified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1558689811420572">Pro Inno Europe (2009)</xref> as a moderate innovator) and Estonia (classified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1558689811420572">Pro Inno Europe (2009)</xref> as an innovation follower). This article has two aims: (a) to report on New Zealand cultural and national identities and their relationship to the nation’s innovation success and (b) to highlight the logic behind using a mixed methods approach in our research design.</p>
<p>National innovation rates have become one of the tools by which nations and businesses achieve success in the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1558689811420572">Wind, Mahajan, and Bayless (1990)</xref> show that new products, typically derived from innovation, explain one quarter to one third of financial growth in businesses. In many cases countries, businesses and organizations have an “innovation imperative” in which innovation is deemed necessary for both growth and survival. These imperatives are paralleled by government policies, which seek to encourage innovation to achieve economic and other goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1558689811420572">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In contributing to knowledge about innovation, researchers have contended that culture is a significant factor influencing national rates of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1558689811420572">Nakata &amp; Sivakumar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1558689811420572">Shane, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689811420572">1993</xref>). Culture is hard to conceptualize simply and definitions abound. For the purposes of this research, which uses methods from cognitive anthropology, we define culture as “. . . a conceptual mode underlying human behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689811420572">Goodenough, 1957</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689811420572">Keesing, 1972</xref>, p. 300). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689811420572">Goodenough (1961)</xref> believed “Culture consists of standards for deciding what is . . . what can be . . . how one feels about it . . . what to do about it, and . . . how to go about doing it” (p. 522). In other words, culture is the means by which people make sense of reality, that is, understand and organize objects, events, and experiences. In addition to looking at perceptions of New Zealand culture in this study, we also look at perceptions of national identity. National identity derives from the image citizens have of their country and the perceived or actual international image of the nation in world opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1558689811420572">Rusciano, 2003</xref>). How a nation sells and brands itself is based, at least in part, on the nation’s internal actuality and how its citizens perceive the nation.</p>
<p>We used a mixed methods design to formulate models of New Zealand culture and national identity. Mixed methods research has become increasingly common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689811420572">Brannen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420572">Bryman, 2006</xref>) and has gained status as the third major research paradigm alongside both qualitative and quantitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689811420572">Burke Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Turner, 2007</xref>). Historically:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Quantitative researchers have seen qualitative researchers as too context specific, their samples as unrepresentative and their claims about their work as unwarranted—that is judged from the vantage point of statistical generalization. For their part qualitative researchers view quantitative research as overly simplistic, decontextualized, reductionist in terms of its generalisations, and failing to capture the meanings that actors attach to their lives and circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689811420572">Brannen, 2005</xref>, p. 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In recent years, research approaches have followed a more pragmatic trend, rejecting the separation between quantitative and qualitative methods and instead seeing the approaches as potentially complementary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689811420572">Arnon &amp; Reichel, 2009</xref>). Collaboration is seen as a way of using the advantages and minimizing the disadvantages of any one particular approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689811420572">Arnon &amp; Reichel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689811420572">Brannen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689811420572">Burke Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689811420572">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689811420572">Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutman, &amp; Handson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689811420572">Hanson, Creswell, Plano Clark, Petska, &amp; Creswell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1558689811420572">Tashakkori &amp;Teddlie, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689811420572">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1558689811420572">2003b</xref>). It is an approach to knowledge that considers multiple viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689811420572">Burke Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). In line with this trend, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689811420572">Burke Johnson et al. (2007)</xref> surveyed mixed methods researchers asking them to define mixed methods research. Through an analysis of their definitions they derived the following comprehensive definition:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Mixed methods research is the type of research in which a researcher or team of researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches (e.g., use of qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, data collection, analysis, inference techniques) for the broad purposes of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our approach to mixed methods research was a combination of cultural modeling, a qualitative method based on discourse analysis, and cultural consensus analysis, a quantitative method. We used discourse analysis to formulate a picture of the key components of New Zealand culture and national identity, as well as how these elements interact and connect with each other. By their very definitions, culture and national identity are about shared beliefs and perceptions. We used consensus analysis in order to identify if there was sufficient sharing among participants such that it was safe to formulate a single model of culture and national identity.</p>
<p>In this article, we will first describe the theoretical basis of our research methods. This will be followed by a discussion of our sampling and procedure and a presentation of our findings regarding New Zealand culture and national identity. In the final section, we will discuss how culture and national identity have likely influenced innovation within New Zealand as well as address the issues which emerged in our joint application of the two methods. We will conclude by making recommendations for effectively using the two methods in the future.</p>
<sec id="section1-1558689811420572">
<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>Both cultural modeling and cultural consensus analysis are methods used within the field of cognitive anthropology. Cognitive anthropology developed as a reaction to anthropology’s crisis of representation, spurred by the Redfield–Lewis debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689811420572">Colby, 1996</xref>), which caused anthropology to question current ethnographic methods as being biased. Redfield and Lewis both conducted ethnographic research in Tepoztlan, Mexico—Redfield in 1930 and Lewis in 1951. Both researchers looked at multiple aspects of daily life during the course of their research including agriculture, distribution of wealth, politics, and interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1558689811420572">Lewis, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689811420572">Redfield, 1930</xref>). A number of their respective findings disagreed significantly and more than could be explained by the passage of time. For example, Redfield characterized Tepoztlan interpersonal relationships as cooperative whereas Lewis found villagers to be highly individualistic and uncooperative by nature. Furthermore, both researchers made multiple value judgments about Tepoztlan society. Redfield’s ethnography repeatedly characterized folk/rural societies as good and urban societies as bad whereas Lewis often characterized members of folk/rural societies as being inappropriately uncooperative in their social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1558689811420572">Lewis, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689811420572">Redfield, 1930</xref>). Cognitive anthropology and methods such as cultural modeling and consensus analysis developed, in part, to counter this bias in representation by focusing on the indigenous person’s view of things—a cultural group’s point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689811420572">Colby, 1996</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1558689811420572">
<title>Cultural Modeling</title>
<p>Cultural models are those presupposed, taken-for-granted models of knowledge and thought that are used in the course of everyday life to guide a person’s understanding of the world and his or her behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689811420572">D’Andrade, 1984</xref>). They are also the constructed representations made by researchers to describe shared knowledge and perceptions used by groups of people in their daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811420572">Blount, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689811420572">Cooley, 2003</xref>). Cultural models systematically draw on personal discourse—the representations, practices, and performances through which meanings are produced, connected into networks and legitimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689811420572">Gregory, 2000</xref>). Discourse analysis allows researchers to get the insider’s perspective on participant knowledge, thought, and word meaning.</p>
<p>Cultural models are composed of linked and embedded schemata, that is, key elements of meaning. An assumption of cultural modeling is that when individuals engage the world they do so in a simplified and focused manner that does not include all the detail and complexity of a situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811420572">Blount, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1558689811420572">Holland &amp; Quinn, 1987</xref>). The Swiss philosopher and cognitive development theorist Jean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1558689811420572">Piaget (1926)</xref> first introduced the term <italic>schema</italic>—defining schemata as mental representations of related perceptions, actions, and ideas. He believed schemata to be the building blocks of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1558689811420572">Woolfolk, 1987</xref>). Drawing on concepts introduced by Piaget, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689811420572">R. C. Anderson (1977)</xref>, an educational psychologist, developed schema theory to look at the process of learning. As a theory of learning, schema theory contends that knowledge is organized for each individual in an intricate complex of abstract mental structures representing one’s means of comprehending the world. Since its introduction by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689811420572">Anderson (1977)</xref>, schema theory has been adopted and modified to fit several fields of study including anthropology.</p>
<p>Within anthropology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689811420572">Holland and Cole (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689811420572">Strauss and Quinn (1997)</xref> have been strong advocates of schema theory. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689811420572">Holland and Cole (1995)</xref>, schemata are the constituent pieces that comprise cultural meaning. By first analyzing and then organizing the schemata identified via discourse analysis, cultural models of the world can be built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811420572">Blount, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689811420572">Strauss &amp; Quinn, 1997</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811420572">Blount (2002</xref>, p. 9),</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Once a text is created from discourse, one works “backwards,” asking questions about how the text was created, in effect asking what the conceptualizations are upon which the text is based. The conceptualizations are the raw materials of the analysis. They reflect the agent’s underlying mental models, the framework with which the world is engaged. The reconstructed mental models of an individual constitute the cognitive architecture upon which the discourse is generated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In essence, the task of discourse analysis and then cultural modeling is to identify the key components of thought and serialize, embed, and hierarchically organize them into a coherent model.</p>

<sec id="section3-1558689811420572">
<title>Cultural Consensus Analysis</title>
<p>Cultural consensus analysis is a quantitative-based methodological tool. It asks three primary questions. First, cultural consensus analysis asks if shared knowledge of a specific cultural domain exists within a group of informants. Second, consensus analysis assesses the relationship of each informant’s knowledge of the domain in question to the aggregate knowledge of that domain. Third, consensus analysis determines the “culturally correct” answers to survey questions without knowing or assuming the correct answers ahead of time. In other words, consensus analysis does not compare subject’s responses to survey items with an established answer key. Rather, the answer key, the content of “culture,” is estimated mathematically from the patterns of data. Note that it is highly unlikely that people can be collectively in error about their culture because culture, by definition, is made up of shared values, beliefs, or symbols.</p>
<p>In statistical analysis of survey data, reliability is usually considered as a quality that relates to the survey questions. Each set of answers to the question, that is, the scores across all participants, are compared to assess the consistency or stability of the measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1558689811420572">Vogt, 1993</xref>). Consensus analysis uses a kind of reliability testing but on participants rather than on survey questions. The focus is on each participant, specifically on how he or she has responded to each question and how responses across questions compare with the general pattern of other participant responses. It asks: “What is the relationship of each individual informant’s command of the knowledge of the domain to the knowledge possessed by the aggregate?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1558689811420572">Swora, 2003</xref>, p. 343). Cultural competence refers to “How much of a given domain of culture each individual informant ‘knows’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689811420572">Romney, Weller, &amp; Batchelder, 1986</xref>). Cultural competence scores for each person are estimated by factoring a matrix of person-by-person similarity coefficients. Thus, if a participant is estimated to have a cultural competence in a particular domain of 0.8, he or she is estimated to command 80% of the knowledge of that domain. More “expert” participants, those with higher cultural competence scores, agree with each other more frequently, and demonstrate greater cultural competence. Overall, consensus analysis allows the researcher to operationalize findings by estimating the social distribution of knowledge, the “culturally correct” answers to the questions, and the average knowledge possessed by each member of the informant pool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1558689811420572">
<title>A Mixed Methods Approach</title>
<p>Discourse analysis is a qualitative method whereas cultural consensus is a quantitative method. Both types of methods have their strengths and weaknesses but these weaknesses can be lessened when both approaches are used in conjunction. The strength of quantitative methods is that they are easily reproducible and comparable across subject, time, and academic disciplines—these are weaknesses of qualitative research. The strength of qualitative research is the insights it can provide regarding the “dynamic interpretive process that tak(e) form in cultural settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420572">Garro, 2000</xref>, p. 312), something quantitative research cannot provide.</p>
<p>We used discourse analysis to formulate a picture of what the key components of New Zealand’s cultural and national identity were as well as how these elements interact and connect with each other. We used consensus analysis to identify if there was sufficient sharing among participants such that it was safe to formulate a single model of culture and national identity. If the ratio of the first and second eigenvalues obtained during consensus analysis exceed the threshold of 3 to 1, it is reasonable to infer that participants are drawing on a single cultural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689811420572">Romney et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural modeling was our dominant method while consensus analysis provided a cross-check on the perceptions of those interviewed. Our choice of methods allowed us to triangulate our results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1558689811420572">Sandelowski (1995</xref>) contends that the concept of triangulation suffers from definitional drift and “has come to mean so much, it is in danger of hardly meaning anything at all” (p. 569). It has come to a technique for convergence, completeness, and for confrontation of divergent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1558689811420572">Sandelowski, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1558689811420572">Sandelowski (1995</xref>, p. 573) believes that:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the concept of triangulation ought to be reserved for designating a technique for confirmation employed within paradigms in which convergent and consensual validity are valued and in which it is deemed appropriate to use information from one source to corroborate another.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is how we have used triangulation in our study.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1558689811420572">Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, and Sechrest (1966)</xref>, “If a proposition can survive the onslaught of a series of imperfect measures, with all their irrelevant error, confidence should be placed in it” (p. 3). This was the position expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420572">Garro (2000</xref>) when she contended that “. . . both cultural consensus and cultural models approaches could productively be applied in a converging manner to learn about underlying cultural knowledge and intra-cultural variation for a given topic” (p. 285). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420572">Garro (2000</xref>) used consensus analysis and cultural models to study how the Ojibway understood diabetes and its causes. Although Garro suggested the dual use of cultural consensus with various modeling theories as early as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689811420572">1988</xref>, to our knowledge, few other than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689811420572">Garro (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811420572">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420572">2000</xref>) have published works in which this integrated approach is used (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689811420572">de Munck, Dudley, &amp; Cardinale, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We support Garro’s contention that cultural modeling and cultural consensus analysis are a viable form of triangulation and seek to show the benefits of jointly using the two methods in research that seeks to understand a cultural group’s perspective on a given topic.</p>

<title>The Sample</title>
<p>To use discourse analysis and cultural consensus analysis to construct models of culture and national identity, we obtained a convenience sample of adult New Zealanders by approaching high schools and offering a payment of $450NZD in exchange for soliciting adult volunteers and providing a venue. We believed a convenience sample was adequate for our needs because beliefs about culture and national identity are domains of investigation that should be widely shared across the nation and accessible through a sample of high school parents. We chose schools from the largest cities by population on the North and South Islands of New Zealand—Auckland and Christchurch—as our research sites to account for possible cultural differences that might exist between the two islands.</p>
<p>Schools were selected from the mid-tier income bracket (New Zealand Deciles 4-7). Contact with prospective schools was made by telephone and school representatives involved with fund-raising were sought. The school representative was directed to source prospective participants, an equal number of men and women if possible, from people involved with the school or who lived in the local area. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689811420572">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic and socioeconomic breakdown of our sample. Most participants were older than 40 years and classified themselves as New Zealand Europeans. No ethnic background was specified to schools for recruitment and our sample has only one Maori participant, one Indian participant, and one Pacific Islander participant. Such a sample means that the results reflect the cultural viewpoint of New Zealand’s majority population, New Zealand Europeans, rather than showing variation by ethnicity. As of the 2006 census, New Zealand Europeans comprised 67.6% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689811420572">Statistics New Zealand, n.d.</xref>). Future research can build on the initial contribution of this article by exploring variations in cultural expression in New Zealand’s minority ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Our research goal was to obtain 20 participants from each of the two high schools. Consensus analysis, unlike more conventional statistical methods, requires very small sample sizes to reach statistical significance. This can be seen in the works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689811420572">Garro (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1558689811420572">Swora (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1558689811420572">Romney, Batchelder, and Weller (1987)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689811420572">Dressler, Balieiro, and Dos Santos (1998)</xref>, with sampling sizes ranging from 10 to 20 participants. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1558689811420572">Weller and Romney (1988)</xref>, sample size should be determined by focusing on three factors: (a) the cultural competence of the participants, (b) the confidence levels required, and (c) the proportion of questions required to be classified correctly. Assuming an average cultural competence level among informants of 0.5 or higher, which seems reasonable given that we are assessing knowledge of culture and national identity broadly defined, and classifying 90% of the questions correctly, a confidence level of 0.95 can be achieved using only 13 participants. These initial sample size goals were tentative estimations of a sample size thought necessary to achieve informational redundancy within the discourse analysis. Had information redundancy not been achieved with this sample size, further sampling would have been conducted.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689811420572">Table 1</xref>, our convenience sample was skewed toward New Zealand Europeans older than 40 years. Thus, it is important to note that the consensus analysis results, if cultural sharing is indicated, will primarily be generalizable to this ethnic and age group.</p>

<sec id="section6-1558689811420572">
<title>The Procedure</title>
<p>In our research, we obtained participant discourse using either computer-assisted self-interviews (CASIs) or face-to-face interviews (FTFIs). Both CASI and FTFI were used because a secondary objective of our research was to assess the quality of data obtained via FTFI and CASI to see if they were similar. For open-ended questions of the nature used in this research, FTFI has long been the standard as it is believed that the interviewer can help guide participants through the interview process by asking questions to clarify unclear responses and tailoring questions to delve deeper into the subject matter. However, by using CASI, researchers can reach a larger sample of respondents more efficiently compared with FTFI. Instead of FTFIs conducted over weeks or months, a researcher can gather respondents in a computer lab at a single sitting. In addition, by using CASI a researcher can avoid the cost and time of transcribing recorded responses. Our findings, presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689811420572">Fairweather and Rinne, 2011</xref>, show that both methods of obtaining participant discourse produced identical cultural models.</p>
<p>The qualitative interview portion of our research took on average 1½ hours and was scheduled in advance at a designated time and place (namely onsite at the schools) and outside normal daily activities. The researcher began each interview by clarifying its purpose and explaining that participants would be asked questions about New Zealand culture and national identity. Participants were assured that there were no right or wrong answers to any of the questions and we asked that they speak freely about their beliefs and opinions. The FTFIs were recorded and later transcribed whereas the CASIs were saved as Word files. As the research consisted of only one interview with each participant and participants were asked to discuss an area in which they can be considered knowledgeable (e.g., their perceptions of New Zealand culture and national identity), we were advised by the university human subjects board that the research was exempt from the need to seek formal human subjects approval according to New Zealand regulations.</p>
<sec id="section7-1558689811420572">
<title>Interview Content</title>
<p>A total of 50 open-ended questions were asked, grouped into two main domains. For the domain of culture, we asked about important cultural symbols, important figures representing true New Zealand ideals, historical happenings that have influenced culture, words one would use to describe New Zealand culture, colloquial sayings of cultural relevance, the importance of science and technology within New Zealand culture, and so on. For the domain of national identity, we asked about how participants believed that New Zealand was identified internationally, how they would characterize national identity as a citizen of New Zealand, in what ways they believed that New Zealand was better than other nations and also not as good, achievements on the world stage that have influenced New Zealand national identity, words they would use to describe national identity, and so on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1558689811420572">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the discourse obtained during the interview process (either computer based or personal interviews), each interview text was imported into NVivo 7 and coded according to key words and phrases. It was then inductively analyzed for patterns, structure, and linkages of schemata. The resulting cultural models demonstrate how our participants perceived New Zealand cultural and national identities.</p>
<p>Following the open-ended questions, participants were asked to complete a series of Likert-type exercises via paper and pencil (FTFIs) or via computer (CASIs). The Likert-type scale used four categories of importance: 1 = <italic>not really important for most people</italic>, 2 = <italic>slightly important for most people</italic>, 3 = <italic>moderately important for most people</italic>, and 4 = <italic>very important for most people</italic>. Cultural consensus analysis of Likert-type scale data was carried out using ANTHROPAC 4.0 statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689811420572">Borgatti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689811420572">Romney et al., 1986</xref>). The Likert-type scale questions dealt with generalized aspects of culture and national identity. Regarding culture, participants were asked: “For New Zealanders as a whole, how important are each of the following items of New Zealand’s culture?” Items included the following: religion, culinary traditions, music, dance, technology, outdoor activities (tramping, fishing, etc.), playing sports, viewing national and international competitive sports, rural living, urban living, fashion, inventiveness, a common language, a shared set of values, environmentalism, ethnic identity, the arts (painting, literature, etc.), architecture, and shared history. These elements were chosen as they represent commonly studied aspects of culture within anthropology and reflect a range of cultural elements. For national identity, participants were asked: “For New Zealanders as a whole, how important are each of the following items to New Zealand’s national identity?” Items included the following: achievements in sports, the way democracy works, achievements in the arts, economic achievements, the armed forces, political influence on a world stage, scientific achievements, technological achievements, fair treatment of ethnic groups, contribution to world history, international peacekeeping efforts, environmental consciousness, the natural landscape, and unique cultural values. These elements were chosen based on a review of the national identity literature. Each element represents a key way in which a nation can differentiate itself from others in the world.</p>

<sec id="section10-1558689811420572">
<title>New Zealand Culture</title>
<p>The foundational schema or base of participants’ view of their culture was the idea of New Zealand as multicultural (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1558689811420572">Figure 1</xref>). Respondents often mentioned the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi as a significant historical event for New Zealand with the treaty seen as linking Maori and Pakeha into an uneasy union. Pakeha respondents spoke of Maori/Pakeha disputes over land and needing to be politically correct in dealing with the Maori because of past injustices against the community. Although the relationship was characterized as uneasy, respondents often mentioned Maori symbols, such as the koru and tiki, as being important symbols for New Zealand. The Maori were seen as very much a part of general New Zealand culture.</p>
<p>In addition to this idea of an uneasy multicultural blend, respondents saw themselves as a culture in which emphasis is given to lifestyle, sports, an outdoorsy orientation, and pioneer values. These were secondary schemata that rested on the foundational schema of New Zealand as multicultural. It should be noted that these secondary schemata often overlapped with each other indicating a linkage of perceptions. Regarding lifestyle, New Zealand was seen as a playground with beautiful scenery and place where everyone could “get a fair shake.” The following is a representative comment regarding the significance of lifestyle in New Zealand culture:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>NZ is safer. Greener. The quality of life is good. The first time I saw the amount of homeless people in San Francisco I was unprepared. We’ve got a few people who live on the streets but nothing compared to what I saw there. There’s more opportunity here. You’re not one of millions and millions. You’re one a few million. There’s also a whole variety of country here. There is easy access to the outdoors, mountains, rivers, streams. (Female, 41 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sports such as rugby and other outdoor activities such as tramping and sailing were seen as particularly important to New Zealand culture. They were seen as community builders and a way for New Zealanders to get out and enjoy New Zealand’s beautiful landscapes. Regarding sport, one respondent said,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s part of our everyday life. We either participate through doing or participate through watching. There aren’t many households that wouldn’t be tuned into the All Blacks playing or the league finals. Or whatever particular sport they are involved in. I know our kids have always grown up playing a range of sports and we would always encourage them to do that. We have quite an active lifestyle rather than say Americans who live in apartments and sit there watching TV and going to their computers. On the way here I saw my six year old out on her roller blades. The older kids I know would be off bike riding or doing sports practice. It’s a very big part of our everyday life. That’s not different from what a lot of average Kiwis would do. (Female, 41 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding sport as a community builder:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Somehow or other its gotten built into the culture. Again people settled out here and maybe it was people needing to get together and do something. (Male, 51 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With respect to the outdoor orientation, respondents felt a close connection to the New Zealand landscape and felt it was important to get out in nature and do things such as hike, sail, and so on.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I like living in New Zealand because you can be one day in the mountains and the next day at the beach. We travel a lot around the south island. On a whim last weekend we took the kids up to the snow. Last night we were paddling in the river. (Female, 41 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Respondents believed that New Zealanders possess pioneer values and are inventive out of necessity. New Zealand is small and geographically isolated. Early pioneers were strong and had to make do with what they had available to survive and thrive. The small size and isolation of New Zealand is believed to have been responsible for the inventive/innovative nature of Kiwis to the present day:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a #8 wire mentality. People had to cope a long way from home. They lacked resources and infrastructure and had to find a way to do what they had to do. I’m sure that mentality is still hanging around. (Male, 51 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of cultural consensus analysis provided additional support for the findings from discourse analysis. Cultural consensus analysis of the Likert-type exercise data identified eight elements of culture that respondents rated as being moderately important to very important for most New Zealanders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1558689811420572">Table 2</xref> shows the ranking of New Zealand’s culture items and shows that 8 of 19 items received a score of 3 or higher (moderately important to very important). These eight elements in decreasing order of importance include the following: viewing national and international competitive sports, playing sports, outdoor activities, a common language, environmentalism, a shared set of values, technology, and ethnic identity. These consensus analysis results confirm much of what was identified via discourse analysis. Sports, being outdoorsy, ethnic identity (e.g., multicultural blend of Maori and New Zealand Europeans), and shared values (e.g., pioneer values) were all identified as key elements of New Zealand’s culture in discourse analysis.</p>

<title>New Zealand National Identity</title>
<p>The foundational schemata at the base of respondent’s perceptions of New Zealand national identity were New Zealand as small, isolated, and with a low population. Being small, both in population and land area, as well as isolated, made sports, lifestyle, and landscape all the more significant for New Zealanders. Sports, lifestyle, and landscape were secondary schemata embedded within the foundational schemata. It should be noted that these secondary schemata overlapped with each other indicating a linkage of perceptions.</p>
<p>Sports were seen as a way to be present on the world stage. Respondents believed that Kiwis “punched above their weight” as far as sports, and had a high level of achievement for such a small country. Sports were considered an important source of national pride. The following is a representative comment:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A huge role. There is an expectation that we are a sporting nation. Em, its led to a self-belief. Increased our self-belief. Increased our identity on the world stage. Made us a healthier nation because there is that expectation. It’s almost part of the socialization in our society. (Female, 45 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The lifestyle afforded to those living in New Zealand and the landscape were also sources of significant pride for respondents. The New Zealand lifestyle was believed to be relaxed and family oriented. Respondents appreciated the egalitarian nature of New Zealand society and felt that no one stood above another. Being isolated afforded respondents a sense of safety. New Zealand was considered far removed from many of the world’s problems and a safe place to raise children. The close proximity of the ocean and mountains also contributed to the New Zealand lifestyle by serving as playground venues for outdoorsy Kiwis. Respondents appreciated New Zealand’s beautiful landscapes and it was seen as one of the factors which set New Zealand apart from other nations—made it unique. Tourists came to see a landscape that only New Zealand could offer.</p>
<p>Although not as significant as the sport, lifestyle, and landscape/environment schemata, New Zealanders also believed that part of New Zealand national identity was New Zealand being a social innovator and New Zealand being an international participant. These two schemata were embedded within the foundational schemata and were linked to the landscape/environment schema. With respect to being a social innovator, respondents were very proud of the nation’s no nuclear stance, previous prohibitions, and overall level of cautiousness in dealing with genetically engineered food and crops, and the fact that New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant women the right to vote.</p>
<p>In addition to their role as a social innovator, New Zealanders were proud of the nation’s conduct within the international community. Respondents often spoke of the nation’s peacekeeping roles abroad and although a small nation, respondents felt pride that New Zealand was involved in the international community:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s important to be involved in the international community as a player. It’s very important for politics, for NZers to be seen by the rest of the world as being out there and saying yes we are here to be counted. (Female, 57 years old)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It should be noted that innovation and being inventive was not a recognized component of New Zealand national identity as identified by respondents.</p>
<p>The results of cultural consensus analysis provided additional support for the findings from discourse analysis. Cultural consensus analysis of the Likert-type exercise data identified five elements of national identity that respondents rated as being somewhat important to very important for most New Zealanders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689811420572">Table 3</xref> includes the ranking for all national identity items and shows the five items with a score of 3 or more (moderately important or very important). The five elements in decreasing order of importance include the following: achievements in sports, the natural landscape, environmental consciousness, the way democracy works, and the fair treatment of ethnic groups. These consensus analysis results confirmed two of the national identity elements identified via discourse analysis: sports and landscape/environment. Furthermore, although not an exact match to what was discussed during the open-ended questions, the “democracy” element and the “fair treatment of ethnic groups” potentially fit the social innovator component of the national identity model for New Zealand.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-1558689811420572">
<title>Cultural Limits to New Zealand Innovation</title>
<p>By analyzing the model of New Zealand’s culture obtained through research, we were able to identify aspects of New Zealand culture that may limit innovation. First, as part of a New Zealander’s pioneer value set, there is widespread belief that people not only make something useful out of anything but are also willing to make-do with less than the best. A make-do attitude may not be beneficial for innovation as it can lead to products with a subpar standard and can lead to the abandonment of innovation ideas if too many obstacles arise during the innovation process. Second, egalitarianism and a general down-to-earth attitude are highly valued in New Zealand. A recognized result of these attitudes is that those standing above the crowd (tall poppies) are frowned upon or cut down. This syndrome may be linked to the brain drain within New Zealand in which high academic or business achievers, those who are likely to be successful innovators, leave the country, in part, because they are underappreciated, thus, decreasing the pool of New Zealanders with the necessary skills to bring an innovation to its end stage. A third limit to innovation is New Zealand’s lifestyle orientation. Discourse analysis suggested that New Zealanders tend to value time spent with their families and in leisure activities more than they value business success or money. Thus, they limit the time and money they are willing to devote to innovation activities. Related to this is the idea that many innovators are not in it for the money. Money is a form of reward one receives when an innovation reaches the market. With the end goal not being a monetary reward, inventors may feel little drive to take their product to market, instead being satisfied to use it for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Regarding national identity, participants did not include invention or innovation (defined as a new system, method, or device that is brought to market) as a component of how they, as citizens, viewed their national identity. New Zealand sports, lifestyle, and landscape are seen as areas where New Zealand excels in the world (stands above others). Although inventiveness was seen as a part of New Zealand culture it was not an area that respondents saw New Zealand excelling in compared with other nations. If New Zealand is to garner an international reputation as a world-class innovator, it must first cultivate that belief among its citizenry.</p>
<p>By identifying the cultural factors that may limit innovation and the absence of an innovation element in national identity, these areas can be targeted for improvement. Nations, including New Zealand, have the potential to overcome cultural and perceptual deficits to innovation through public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811420572">Fukuyama, 1995</xref>). The key is in identifying the deficit. Our research highlights important areas, which need to be targeted by public policy initiatives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1558689811420572">
<title>Methodological Conclusions</title>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420572">Garro (2000</xref>, p. 312), in her study of diabetes among the Ojibway, we found that consensus analysis helped “. . . to corroborate claims about shared cultural understandings.” Discourse analysis allowed us to gain a nuanced understanding of participant’s beliefs about New Zealand cultural and national identity, something we could not have gained using a quantitative method alone. Consensus analysis served as a cross-check (e.g., consensus analysis confirmed four of the five main elements of the New Zealand culture model) on our findings for discourse analysis and also helped establish a basis for generalizing our findings beyond the sample to a wider population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1558689811420572">Williams (2000)</xref> argues that cultural consistency is needed for researchers to make generalizations from a sample to a population. Cultural consensus analysis is one means to establish the presence of cultural consistency. The eigenvalue ratios obtained for the Likert-type exercises on culture and national identity indicate cultural sharing and support the idea that respondents are drawing on a single cultural model. Thus, we can be reasonably confident in generalizing both our qualitative and quantitative findings to the wider population of New Zealand Europeans. In addition to serving as a cross-check and a basis for generalizations, consensus analysis offered us, and those following in our footsteps, the potential to easily reproduce and compare results across subjects, time, and place, something that discourse analysis does not allow. The two methods worked well in conjunction, providing us with both a nuanced and an easily reproducible/comparable means of evaluating New Zealanders’ views on cultural and national identity.</p>
<p>In our research design, we used these two methods simultaneously, that is, participants completed both the interview and the Likert-type exercises in one session. Based on our research findings we believe that this research design was a major limit of the study. The two methods may be better used sequentially in a multistep research design. Although we reviewed the literature in order to determine which cultural and national identity elements to include in our Likert-type exercises, a number of elements of cultural and national identity emerged from the interviews and the resulting discourse analysis that were not included in our Likert-type exercises. For example, the lifestyle elements (urban and rural living) we chose to include in the Likert-type exercise did not encompass lifestyle as it was discussed in the interviews (i.e., laidback, egalitarian, family-oriented, active). If we used the two methods sequentially, open-ended interviews and discourse analysis followed at a later date by the Likert-type exercises, we could make sure that all elements identified via discourse analysis were included in the Likert-type exercises. In this way, consensus analysis could be a more effective tool for cross-checking the results of discourse analysis. A possible disadvantage of such a sequential method is that subjects may change their beliefs in the interim (maturation effects) but this would be unlikely if the interval was a few weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to elements being left out of the Likert-type exercises, we had elements which were identified in the Likert-type exercises as being important for culture (i.e., a common language and technology) that were not identified as being important via discourse analysis and vice versa (inventiveness). In the case of the common language element, we did not ask any questions directly targeting participant’s beliefs about their language and it was not an element mentioned by participants in other less-targeted questions. With respect to technology, participants were asked targeted questions such as “What role does technology play in New Zealand culture?,” but based on an analysis of participant responses it was not an element emphasized to a degree that would warrant inclusion on the model. Similarly, inventiveness was emphasized in the interviews but respondents failed to classify inventiveness as an important component of New Zealand culture in the Likert-type exercises. A three-part sequential design, in which another interview is given to follow up on findings from the Likert-type exercises would be very helpful in this situation. In this way, any elements identified via the Likert-type exercises, which did not correspond to findings from the discourse analysis, could be investigated and clarification gained. The downside of a three-part research design is the increase in time, cost, and labor involved to conduct the study. Using CASI, the time, cost, and labor would increase but only marginally. Should FTFI be desired, however, this three-part design would significantly increase time, cost, and labor, perhaps to the point of making such a design unrealistic. The desired outcomes need to be weighed against the available resources to determine whether a three-part design is warranted.</p>
<p>In addition to our research design, our use of a convenience sample was a limitation in the study. We obtained a skewed sample of New Zealanders in which upper- and middle-class New Zealand Europeans were overrepresented in the sample and Maori, Pacific Islander, and Asian New Zealanders were underrepresented, as were those within the lower socioeconomic strata. Although it is likely that many elements of culture and national identity identified by our sample would also be identified by New Zealand’s minority ethnic groups and those within a lower socioeconomic group, our current sample does not allow us to comment with any authority. The foundation for our models of New Zealand’s culture and national identity would certainly be stronger had we obtained a more representative sample of New Zealanders and future research should address this omission.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we used both discourse analysis and cultural consensus analysis in our research design to triangulate our results. Our experience suggests that this combination of methods is useful for researchers seeking to understand how a cultural group broadly understands its own culture and national identity. Furthermore, this combination of methods would be useful for researchers seeking to understand a cultural group’s perspective on other topics or in other settings. We recommend the use of a three-part sequential design where an open-ended interview/discourse analysis portion of the design is used to develop the Likert-type scales. In turn, the Likert-type scales could identify areas which need further elucidation in a follow-up interview, that is, elements that did not show up in the discourse analysis during the first interview or elements which showed up but were presented in a contradictory manner than indicated by the Likert-type exercises. It should be noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1558689811420572">Greene, Caracelli, and Graham (1989)</xref> suggested that there are five justified reasons for using a mixed methods research design. Triangulation was one justified reason and “development,” the use of the results from one research method to inform another method, was a second justified reason for a mixed methods approach. We suggest that cultural modeling and consensus analysis be used in the future for both triangulation and development. These modifications aside, the research results we have obtained provide good evidence that cultural consensus analysis could be an effective method for cross-checking the findings from discourse analysis and could be fruitfully used by researchers seeking a cultural group’s point of view on a range of culturally relevant topics.</p>
