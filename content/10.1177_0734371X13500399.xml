<p>John Donahue challenges all of us who have an interest in public personnel administration, by presenting an analysis showing that the governmental and private business workforces have increasingly diverged. The differences impede government competence and performance, he contends. The solutions to the problems impose challenges and raise controversies with which all of us must contend. Whether or not readers agree with his assessment, and he expects that many will react with outrage to some aspects of it, his raising of the issues has been prescient. Controversies over comparisons of public sector and private sector compensation levels, the role of unions, and other matters that Donahue addresses in his book have become increasingly heated since its publication.</p>
<p>Donahue’s analysis indicates that the government workforce has warped in the sense that the compensation levels at the top and at the lower levels have bent back (or stayed back) in relation to each other, as compared with the private sector. He presents evidence that government employees differ sharply from private employees at both the top and bottom of the sectors. The public sector workforce thus resembles the general workforce at roughly the middle of the last century, in that those at the top do not make massively more than those at the lower levels, thus remaining a “middle-class” distribution of compensation. Government employees have been pulled up toward middle-class status, while higher level employees have stayed down closer to middle-class status. Public sector employees at the lower and middle levels—the police, the soldiers, the teachers, the government administrative and support personnel, and others—do well, compared with comparable levels in the private sector. The executives and higher level professionals and managers in government, however, earn far less than their business counterparts. In the private sector, those at the top have compensation levels massively higher than counterparts in the public sector and than those at lower occupational and income levels in business. The lower level employees in the private sector have drifted downward in compensation levels, relative to their counterparts in government and to the business executives. Donahue comes to these conclusions by way of an impressive and informative analysis of facts and figures about the American workforce, and particularly the government workforce. This information in itself makes the book valuable for those who want to be expert, or more expert, in public personnel administration.</p>
<p>The interpretation of this evidence and its effects leads to the more controversial issues. Donahue says that the situation creates a “safe harbor” for government employees. The government workers at lower levels, such as postal workers, police officers, and teachers, attain job security, decent earnings, and excellent benefits, and these conditions are better than those for the lower and middle-level employees in business. Union membership has steadily declined in the private sector, and steadily increased in the public sector. The unions aggressively defend these favorable conditions for public employees, and resist efforts to tie them to individual performance. Donahue contends that this breeds resistance to change. As for the higher administrative levels in government, employees there also have secure benefits, while avoiding the more intense competition and evaluation that Donahue sees in the private sector.</p>
<p>Donahue further concludes that the safe harbor also makes government into a “backwater,” especially for the higher level administrators and professionals. Salaries for higher level administrators are capped by Congressional pay levels. Members of Congress do not want administrators making more than they do, and will not raise their own salaries, so while careerists enjoy higher levels of security, executive pay is lower than in the private sector. Administrators and professionals also struggle with rigid administrative systems. This drives talented and energetic people out of government, or prevents their coming in the first place. Here, Donahue relies more on anecdote and example than on the systematic review of evidence on which he based his analysis of the lower level employees. He cites examples of young “stars” that he knew who worked briefly for the federal government, but left for higher salaries with private consulting firms, and out of disappointment with their agencies’ leadership. He notes that about half of those who win Presidential Management Fellowships leave federal service within 5 years. However, he briefly mentions the point that so many observers of government service have often made, that he knows of dedicated and highly capable career federal employees who serve with distinction. In addition, the claim that federal executives and professionals lag the private sector in performance conflicts with recent examples from major business institutions about massively compensated business bureaucrats who steered their corporations into disaster, endangering the financial system of the United States and other nations. However, the Volcker Commission, the Winter Commission, and other sources have expressed concern about attracting good people to government, and thus support the concerns that Donahue raises. And, of course, the vastly higher compensation packages for higher level executives and professionals in the private sector are so obvious that no one can dispute that point. As indicated above, the more challenging question concerns whether the corporate sector attains talent for the massive paychecks, or simply buys business bureaucrats who illustrate various versions of how to succeed at bankruptcy without really trying. Donahue’s analysis would be more convincing if the claims about government inferiority were grounded in evidence about performance. As hard as it is to compare the performance of government and business, there is evidence that business does not necessarily perform better than government. In addition, there is a logical issue raised by the assertion that higher level government officials are inferior to higher level business managers because the business types receive higher compensation. Can we apply this logic at the lower levels and conclude that government must perform better at those levels because the government employees are better compensated?</p>
<p>Donahue also contends that government has gone through a “twisted transformation” in relation to the business sector. Business has advanced in a variety of ways, especially through outsourcing, while government has lagged. Much of the problem has arisen from government’s failure to outsource “commodity tasks,” such as food service and custodial work in schools, for which outcomes are clear and for which multiple suppliers will compete. Government should outsource more of such tasks, and concentrate on “custom” tasks that require more technical and professional expertise. This will reduce the disparity between the public and private workforces and focus government employees on more significant work.</p>
<p>Here again, controversy can rage. Governments have been outsourcing a great deal in the last several decades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734371X13500399">Donahue (1990)</xref> wrote an excellent book on <italic>The Privatization Decision</italic> and must know well the potential pitfalls of privatization and the challenges of managing it. If governmental personnel perform shoddily, what brings out superlative performance when these same persons turn to managing contracts with private and nonprofit organizations? In addition, one finds abundant evidence that government employees perform routine tasks with clear outcomes—commodity tasks—very efficiently and effectively. The Social Security Administration has recently claimed that the administration of the social security programs cost about 75 cents out of every 100 dollars of outlays—that is, less than 1% goes to administrative costs. Those “bureaucrats” at the Social Security Administration churn out checks quite accurately and efficiently, accounting for about 20% of the outlays of the federal government, to Americans who have spent a lifetime going to work and doing their jobs without benefit of massive bonuses. One can point to numerous other examples of effective and efficient performance on the part of governmental personnel and organizations.</p>
<p>Yet, defending all these public sector employees tiptoes around fundamental questions that Donahue raises. Are they too well cared for? That is, do we have too many government employees who have too many protections such as secure employment, good earnings, health care benefits, and comfortable retirement pensions? Are these conditions too inequitable in comparison with the private sector workforce, and too expensive for all levels of government? Editorial writers and think tank researchers have advanced such claims aggressively, not necessarily because of Donahue’s book, but with more frequency and intensity since he published it. The governor of Minnesota has recently authored an op-ed article saying that several major states are falling into financial difficulties that raise the potential for default on their debts. He attributes the problem in significant part to the high costs of public employee pension funds and other benefits. These and others proclaim that government employees are now a privileged class, because they have safe pensions while private sector employees do not (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734371X13500399">Tumulty &amp; O’Keefe, 2010</xref>). A conservative think tank has recently issued a report concluding that public employees earn more than private sector employees. Most of these sources point to public sector unions as culprits in this drama, who fiercely protect government employees’ pay and benefits and just as fiercely oppose reforms and initiatives to tie these outcomes to performance. In addition, at this writing public employees march and chant in protest against the Governor of Wisconsin’s proposals for curtailing the collective bargaining rights of public sector unions in that state. Defenders of government employees, including the Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and editorialists at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734371X13500399"><italic>The Washington Post</italic> (2010)</xref>, retort that federal employees make higher average salaries than private sector employees because federal employees have higher levels of education. Federal employees are also older on average, with longer tenure in their positions. Defenders of public sector unions contend that problems with public sector pension systems have arisen in large part due to the disastrously poor performance of the major financial institutions that dragged down the value of the pension funds’ investments. Union representatives can raise the question of why government should be considered profligate because government personnel systems do not treat their employees as shabbily as do private sector systems.</p>
<p>Donahue concludes the book by considering additional options besides more outsourcing. He considers a stronger role for private business in addressing social problems, and an expanded role for the nonprofit sector, and considers neither approach adequate. He calls for more collaboration between government and business, and efforts to enhance the prestige of the public service and to encourage mobility between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Whether or not one accepts Donahue’s analysis and his proposals, the importance of the issues he raises and analyzes has become ever more evident with the recent controversies described above. Rather than suggesting that Donahue’s book is valuable because it stakes a strong position on one side of the controversy indicated above, we should consider it valuable because of his thoughtful and careful analysis of these issues, and for raising them in the first place. The controversies will continue and intensify. Public personnel administration experts and stakeholders need to be aware of these developments as very significant dynamics in their operating environments, and need to contribute to clearheaded discourse and deliberation about them. Agree or disagree, we should think and proceed as carefully as does Donahue.</p>
