<body>
<p>Social and economic advantage is one of the most consistent and enduring protectors of health and longevity. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to a wide range of inequalities in physical and mental health and mortality. Although there are variations, a SES-health gradient has been found across countries with vastly different health care systems and health coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764213487344">Dow &amp; Rehkopf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764213487344">Hyde, Jakum, Melchior, Van Oort, &amp; Weyers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764213487344">Olafsdottir, 2007</xref>). The relationship between SES and health and mortality has endured despite identification and elimination of mediating risk factors and the adoption of treatments and tools for preventing many major diseases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764213487344">Link and Phelan (1995)</xref> have proposed that SES serves as a fundamental cause of health and mortality. As a fundamental cause, even with gains in widely accessible health care knowledge and treatment, socioeconomic status will continue to generate new health inequalities. As one intervening mechanism is addressed and health disparities from that source are eliminated, the advantages and resources held by those with greater SES will allow them to find and take advantage of new mechanisms that protect and promote better health and reduce their mortality risk.</p>
<p>Health disparities from SES also persist across the life course, but the magnitude of these differences differs for children, young adults, and those in mid and later life. This variation across the life course offers unique leverage for understanding the processes generating or reducing health disparities. Nearly two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764213487344">James House and his colleagues (1994)</xref> showed that SES differences in various health dimensions tend to be smallest in early life, widen in early to mid-adulthood, and then shrink in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002764213487344">Miech &amp; Shanahan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002764213487344">Ross &amp; Wu, 1996</xref>). While intriguing, these patterns were largely based on cross-sectional and short-term longitudinal data, thus making it impossible to discern the extent to which these differences reflect changing disparities as individuals age or other processes such as cohort differences and selection processes. More recent work has used long-term longitudinal data to confirm that health disparities do change as individuals move through the life course, that these processes are intertwined with selection and causation between SES and health and from variation across cohorts representing vastly different historical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487344">Haas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487344">Hamil-Luker &amp; O’Rand, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764213487344">Pavalko &amp; Wilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002764213487344">Willson, Shuey, &amp; Elder, 2007</xref>). Variations in health disparities across the life course offer unique opportunities to gain traction into understanding the production of these disparities. The life course perspective also offers a rich set of concepts, methods, and a theoretical framework for guiding our inquiry into how SES disparities in health unfold as people live their lives.</p>
<p>The life course perspective began to emerge as an identifiable area of study in the 1970s and 1980s, and has been informed by many disciplines, from sociology and demography to history, psychology, human development, and more recently, epidemiology. Although there is no unified theory of the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764213487344">George, 2007</xref>) there are several core defining principles that define it as an area of study and perspective that guides research questions and analysis design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213487344">Elder, Johnson, &amp; Crosnoe, 2003</xref>). A defining principle of the life course perspective is that human development and aging are lifelong processes. Biological, intellectual, and social development continues to occur throughout life, which means that one’s health at any point in the life course has been shaped, not only by recent, proximal circumstances and resources, but also by a lifetime of opportunities and constraints, or more distal influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764213487344">George, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764213487344">Kuh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764213487344">Pavalko &amp; Wilson, 2011</xref>). Understanding how socioeconomic conditions produce health disparities thus requires that we take “the long view” to examine how health disparities emerge and are shaped as people live their lives. Closely related to the focus on both short- and long-term influences, life course researchers have developed a wide range of temporal concepts such as attention to the importance of timing, duration, and sequencing, as well as distinguishing between short-term transitions and broader trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764213487344">Elder, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213487344">Elder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764213487344">Pavalko, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important contribution of the life course perspective for understanding health disparities is attention to the intersection of individual biography and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213487344">Elder et al., 2003</xref>). Individuals are born and grow up in particular historical, social, and institutional contexts that shape the opportunities and constraints they face throughout their lives. Because of when they are born, individuals from different birth cohorts encounter historical events and changes at different points in their lives. This may have wide-ranging implications for health and for understanding how SES shapes health. Cohort differences mean that current cohorts of elderly in the United States, who grew up and experienced socioeconomic change in the 1920s, 1930s, or 1940s, did so under very different circumstances than future cohorts of elderly, who grew up in the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s. Mortality risk also varies across birth cohorts, which means that characteristics of those who remain alive in old age may differ by cohort. For example, recent research has found evidence that the long-documented mortality crossover between Blacks and Whites in the United States is attributable to cohort-specific experiences of Blacks and Whites who have survived to later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764213487344">Masters, 2012</xref>). A life course approach to SES and health thus raises questions about what SES disparities may mean for different cohorts, and how it might shape health disparities in different ways. Similarly, the institutional contexts that vary across countries are also likely to shape the life course and define the parameters and meaning of SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764213487344">Olafsdottir, 2007</xref>). Attention to long-term paths, different temporal concepts, and the historical and institutional context in which individuals were born and grew up offers potential for unique insights into how SES shapes health and mortality as people age.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus our attention on how socioeconomic conditions experienced as one is growing up relate to health and mortality across the adult life course. We first review recent work exploring the association between childhood SES and adult health and mortality, examining the evidence, and the types of questions raised, for early, mid, and later life. We then turn to a growing body of evidence examining accumulative processes between health and SES across the life course. We conclude with discussion of three major gaps and promising directions that draw upon advances in life course research to advance our understanding of how inequality shapes health throughout the life course.</p>

<title>Does Childhood Disadvantage Have Long-Term Implications for Adult Health?</title>
<p>A growing body of evidence confirms that there is an enduring influence of childhood disadvantage on health and mortality throughout the life course. However, the causal chains through which SES operates vary depending on the health outcome and the point in adulthood being examined. Health risks also change across the life course, and in turn, the way that SES may translate into health outcomes is likely to shift as we age. The connections between childhood disadvantage and health in young adulthood will likely differ from connections to health in midlife, when the prevalence of chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer, and physical limitations begin to increase and potentially become more debilitating. Relationships between childhood disadvantage and health risks and conditions in later life and mortality will also differ from those emerging earlier in the life course. Our ability to identify which health outcomes are most affected by childhood SES, and when in the life course these influences are strongest, depends heavily on the availability of long-term longitudinal data that may have initially been collected for very different purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764213487344">Elder, Pavalko, &amp; Clipp, 1993</xref>). Our knowledge of various health outcomes is thus determined in part by available data, but taken as a whole this research suggests that the long-term risks of childhood SES are manifested in different health outcomes throughout the life course.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood and adolescence clearly impacts the psychological health and well-being of young adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764213487344">Elder’s (1974)</xref> classic study following children who experienced economic hardship during the Great Depression in the United States showed the enduring effects of economic deprivation on physical and emotional health into young adulthood. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764213487344">Power and colleagues (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002764213487344">2002</xref>) have found that SES among British children who were born in 1958 was related to their self-rated health and psychological distress when they reached their early 20s and again when they were in their early 30s. Studies following later birth cohorts of children just reaching adulthood in the United States have similarly found that childhood SES continues to affect the psychological health of young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764213487344">Gilman, Kawachi, Fitzmaurice, &amp; Buka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0002764213487344">Wickrama, Noh, &amp; Elder, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Fewer studies have traced how SES in childhood shapes midlife health, in part because until recently, long-term longitudinal studies following respondents from childhood to midlife have been rare. Recent evidence from some of these emerging longitudinal studies does indicate long-term influences on health in midlife. For example, in the United States, economic hardship in childhood is associated with increased risk for substance abuse in middle age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764213487344">Fothergill, Ensminger, Green, Robertson, &amp; Juon, 2009</xref>), and in the United Kingdom it has been found to predict physical functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213487344">Guralnik, Butterworth, Wadsworth, &amp; Kuh, 2006</xref>). Studies of midlife health relying on retrospective accounts of childhood SES have also found that adults from low-SES backgrounds in childhood have higher allostatic load scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764213487344">Chen, Miller, Lachman, Gruenewald, &amp; Seeman, 2012</xref>) and rates of metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764213487344">Miller, Lachman, Gruenewald, Karlamangla, &amp; Seeman, 2011</xref>) compared to their counterparts from higher SES backgrounds. In Scotland, men’s retrospective reports of their father’s social class predicted indicators of heart disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764213487344">Blane et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Attention to the impact of SES in childhood on health in midlife also highlights the complexity of these processes as we move through the life course. The powerful influence of socioeconomic conditions when growing up extends well beyond health—childhood SES is important in shaping educational outcomes, occupation, and economic resources in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764213487344">Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764213487344">Guo, 1998</xref>), and these adult resources have their own influence on midlife health. While there is some evidence of direct effects of childhood SES on some health outcomes in midlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213487344">Guralnik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002764213487344">Stansfield, Clark, Rodgers, Caldwell, &amp; Power, 2008</xref>), uncovering the influences of childhood SES on health in midlife requires attention to the complexity of both direct and indirect paths and reciprocal relationships between SES and health as one moves through adulthood. Because midlife is when many new health conditions and risk factors emerge or become problematic, closer attention to how, or whether, childhood SES influences health in mid-adulthood offers the potential for unique insights into how SES shapes health. Data resources such as the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth in the United States and the National Child Development Study in Britain that began following birth cohorts of youth several decades ago now have respondents who are in their 40s and 50s. These data resources include a wider range of socioeconomic and health indicators than had been available in many earlier data collections, providing new opportunities for researchers to assess these complex relationships in far more detail than has been previously possible. We will return to advances and challenges in studying these complex paths in more detail in the next section.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of SES and health as it unfolds across the life course, there is growing documentation that childhood SES does have enduring influences on health in later life. Research using retrospective accounts of childhood SES has found evidence that older adults who were socioeconomically disadvantaged in childhood are at increased risk for heart attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764213487344">O’Rand &amp; Hamil-Luker, 2005</xref>), report more functional limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487344">Hamil-Luker &amp; O’Rand, 2007</xref>), and are more likely to suffer from diabetes and arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764213487344">Blackwell, Hayward, &amp; Crimmins, 2001</xref>). Childhood SES also predicts self-rated health, depressive symptoms, and cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, several long-term longitudinal data collections have confirmed that the influence of childhood socioeconomic status extends to mortality. Hayward and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764213487344">Warner &amp; Hayward, 2006</xref>) investigated the connection between childhood SES and mortality among a sample of men born in the first two decades of the 20th century. They found that a number of socioeconomic characteristics from the men’s childhood—including occupation, education, and family status of parents when the men were 15—were associated with mortality risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>), and that childhood SES helped to explain the race gap in mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764213487344">Warner &amp; Hayward, 2006</xref>). Childhood socioeconomic status also predicted mortality in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764213487344">Preston and colleagues’ (1998)</xref> comparison of African Americans who died in 1985 with their peers who outlived them. Childhood SES has likewise been linked to adult mortality in a variety of other countries, including the United Kingdom and those in Scandinavia as well as the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764213487344">Galobardes, Lynch, &amp; Davey Smith, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764213487344">2008</xref>). For example, an analysis of mortality among men in Scotland shows that risk for all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease increase as paternal social class decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764213487344">Davey Smith &amp; Lynch, 2002</xref>). This variation is particularly intriguing given the broad differences in stratification systems and welfare state policies across these countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764213487344">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0002764213487344">
<title>Unanswered Questions in the Long-Term Impact of Childhood SES on Health and Mortality</title>
<p>Despite a growing body of evidence documenting the long-term impact of childhood SES on health across the life course, several gaps remain in our understanding of these relationships. As noted above, the best data for addressing these questions follows respondents for a long period of time, and ideally through their entire life course. Although the range of data resources including long-term longitudinal data is growing, much of our current knowledge about health outcomes has been limited to those included in long-term studies. Almost all research assessing long-term outcomes has also been limited to adults’ retrospective accounts of their SES as children, and children’s knowledge of their parents’ SES may be limited and potentially confounded with their own SES as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213487344">Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, Chen, &amp; Matthews, 2010</xref>). Samples of persons in mid and later life are also more selective than prospective samples that begin earlier in life because those at most risk are also those least likely to still be alive or available in later life. As data resources continue to improve, we should be able to refine our understanding of whether some health conditions are more directly shaped by childhood conditions than others and how those paths unfold.</p>
<p>Beyond data availability and greater variation in health outcomes, our understanding of long-term health influences of childhood socioeconomic status could be significantly refined by closer attention to conceptualization and measurement of childhood socioeconomic conditions. Measures of childhood SES include childhood family income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764213487344">Fothergill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002764213487344">McLeod &amp; Shanahan, 1996</xref>), parents’ education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764213487344">Preston et al., 1998</xref>), and parental occupational prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764213487344">Blane et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764213487344">Gilman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002764213487344">Marmot, Shipley, Brunner, &amp; Hemingway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002764213487344">Peck, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764213487344">Power et al., 1999</xref>). Other research assessing the long-term consequences of childhood conditions focuses on later health disadvantages resulting from family disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764213487344">Cherlin, Chase-Lansdale, &amp; McRae, 1998</xref>), family structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764213487344">Warner &amp; Hayward, 2006</xref>), and childhood health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764213487344">Blackwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487344">Haas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002764213487344">Palloni, 2006</xref>). While all of these concepts tap important dimensions of socioeconomic status, they convey different types of resources that are likely to impact health in varying ways. Closer attention to this variation may offer important clues about the mechanisms underlying these long-term relationships. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764213487344">Herd and her colleagues (2007)</xref> found that education was a more important predictor of the onset of later health problems than income, while income played a stronger role in mediating the course of a disease (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764213487344">House, Lantz, &amp; Herd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002764213487344">Taylor, 2008</xref>). They speculate that this relationship occurs because education provides individuals with psychosocial resources that may lead to better health behaviors, preventing disease onset, while income likely matters more for access to interventions once a person already has a disease.</p>
<p>To summarize the findings of this literature, scholars have found that infant or childhood socioeconomic status is negatively correlated with a broad range of health outcomes at many different points in the adult life course. However, much of what we know about the long-term impact of childhood SES and disadvantage on adult health has been limited by available data. As the range of data sets following individuals over longer periods of the life course expands, our ability to move beyond documenting broad associations will also improve, allowing us to better explore causal ordering and reciprocal relationships between health and socioeconomic conditions. We can then move from basic questions about <italic>whether</italic> childhood SES affects adult health to questions about <italic>when</italic> and <italic>how</italic> these relationships emerge. Below we review several key issues that offer particular promise for shedding new light on how childhood SES shapes health across the life course.</p>

<p>Sociologists and epidemiologists have identified several conceptual models specifying the various paths through which socioeconomic conditions in childhood may impact adult health and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487344">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Davey Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764213487344">Preston et al., 1998</xref>). As succinctly described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward and Gorman (2004)</xref>, childhood SES may affect adult health and mortality either directly, as suggested by physiological scarring or “critical period” models, or indirectly, through adult SES and related processes. Although there is less empirical support for positive influences of childhood disadvantage, they point out that adverse childhood conditions could have positive as well as negative influences on adult health and mortality, such as when those at greatest risk develop immunities from childhood exposures (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764213487344">Preston et al., 1998</xref>). While some models, such as those focusing on critical periods, aim to identify a single path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764213487344">Barker et al., 1991</xref>), more recent developments increasingly seek to identify and understand both direct and indirect paths from childhood SES to adult health and mortality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487344">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Davey Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487344">Haas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002764213487344">Willson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There is some evidence that much of the health impact of childhood SES operates indirectly through adult SES. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward and Gorman’s (2004)</xref> analysis of mortality among U.S. men born in the early 20th century found that most of the influences of childhood socioeconomic conditions, including parental occupation and education, living arrangements, nativity, and the type of community in which one lived as a child, were mediated through socioeconomic achievement and lifestyle in adulthood. There is also evidence that self-reported health, cardiovascular disease, and mental health in mid and later life are linked to childhood as well as adult SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764213487344">Gilman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764213487344">O’Rand &amp; Hamil-Luker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764213487344">Power et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002764213487344">Stansfield et al., 2008</xref>). However, others have found that the association of childhood SES with adult health is fully accounted for by adult SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002764213487344">Marmot et al., 2001</xref>). Data availability has limited comparisons across health outcomes, but there is also growing evidence that the nature of these paths vary substantially across health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>An important next step in tracing the direct and indirect influences of childhood and adult SES on life course health is to examine their interactive effects on health and mortality. One variant of this model is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213487344">Cohen et al. (2010)</xref> describe as a “change model,” hypothesizing that upward or downward socioeconomic mobility may be more predictive of health than absolute levels of SES at either point in the life course. Consistent with this possibility, among earlier cohorts of U.S. men, intragenerational mobility predicted mortality. Men who experienced upward occupational mobility tended to live significantly longer than those who remained in the same occupational group or had downward mobility throughout their career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002764213487344">Moore &amp; Hayward, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002764213487344">Pavalko, Elder, &amp; Clipp, 1993</xref>). When examining mobility from childhood to adulthood, or intergenerational mobility, recent studies have found that the persistence of socioeconomic disadvantage from childhood through adulthood presents the greatest risk for many health outcomes, including self-rated health, functional limitation, chronic health conditions, depressive symptoms, self-rated memory, and cognitive functioning, rather than upward or downward mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764213487344">Kahn &amp; Pearlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764213487344">Turrell et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As we trace the impact of childhood socioeconomic conditions further across the life course, attention to the reciprocal influences of health on socioeconomic achievements becomes increasingly important. Childhood health affects educational attainment and success in adolescence and young adulthood, which is central to income and occupation in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764213487344">Guo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002764213487344">McLeod &amp; Kaiser, 2004</xref>). Analysis of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in the United States traces these reciprocal relationships further across the life course. Low childhood SES predicts poor childhood health, which in turn has a direct negative effect on educational attainment and wealth later in life, which also affects health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487344">Haas, 2006</xref>). Other analyses using the PSID also found that, although maternal SES was not associated with birth weight, being a low birth weight infant was related to poorer educational attainment as an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764213487344">Conley &amp; Bennett, 2000</xref>). Particularly as we move towards understanding how socioeconomic conditions in early life shape health throughout the life course, closer attention to these reciprocal paths will be essential.</p>
<sec id="section4-0002764213487344">
<title>The Cumulative Advantage Hypothesis</title>
<p>Understanding the interactive and reciprocal relationships between socioeconomic conditions and health across the life course requires more dynamic models that more fully capture the accumulative processes underlying health and SES. The combination of life course attention to trajectories and improved methods and data for elaborating these long-term paths provides greater potential for examining these processes. The cumulative advantage hypothesis is one model that specifies testable hypotheses about these accumulative processes. This hypothesis originated from studies of scientific stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487344">Allison, Long, &amp; Krause, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764213487344">Long, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764213487344">Long, Allison, &amp; McGinnis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764213487344">Merton, 1968</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764213487344">Merton (1968)</xref> proposed that early advantages in a scientific career accumulate, resulting in increasing inequality between research scientists who started out with more advantages compared those who began their careers with fewer resources or career opportunities.</p>
<p>Life course scholars have extended this hypothesis to the accumulation of socioeconomic and health advantages across the life course, proposing that cumulative advantage processes will produce increased heterogeneity or “fanning out” of inequality between groups over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764213487344">Dannefer, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764213487344">2003</xref>). The strict extension of this hypothesis specifies that inequality between groups actually increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764213487344">DiPrete &amp; Eirich, 2006</xref>). A more general specification extends from the status attainment literature focusing on sequences of disadvantage, or “chains of risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487344">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Davey Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487344">Hamil-Luker &amp; O’Rand, 2007</xref>) stemming from early inequality. This latter model proposes mechanisms through which group differences in outcomes such as health accumulate over time, even if the level of inequality between groups does not increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764213487344">DiPrete &amp; Eirich, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Cumulative advantage research over the past decade has found considerable evidence that socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages in health diverge through much of the life course. Early empirical support, based on cross-sectional and short-term longitudinal data, found that relationships between education and self-rated health, functional limitations, and illness symptoms increase as adults age, resulting in the most pronounced differences among the oldest adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002764213487344">Ross &amp; Wu, 1996</xref>). More recent studies using longitudinal data have continued to find evidence that socioeconomic advantages associated with health accumulate and expand throughout much of the life course (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002764213487344">McDonough &amp; Berglund, 2003</xref>). Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood, for example, has been linked to risk of heart disease, but also contributes to further health risk as those from disadvantaged backgrounds have more difficulty managing health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764213487344">O’Rand &amp; Hamil-Luker, 2005</xref>). In one of the most comprehensive life course analyses of cumulative advantage and health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002764213487344">Andrea Willson and her colleagues (2007)</xref> use the PSID to examine the link between multiple dimensions of SES and self-rated health across adulthood. They find evidence that early advantages and disadvantages are compounded over time to produce trajectories of health that diverge as people move through adulthood.</p>
<p>However, there is also evidence that these accumulative processes of increasing health inequality may be “bounded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002764213487344">Willson et al., 2007</xref>), and flatten or even converge in the later years. One explanation for this flattening, the “age-as-leveler hypothesis,” proposes that social policies targeted to older adults (such as Social Security and Medicare in the United States) reduce health inequalities in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764213487344">Beckett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764213487344">Herd, 2006</xref>). Alternatively, scholars have proposed that the appearance of flattening health disparities in later life reflects selection processes. As those who are most disadvantaged and in worse health die or are unable to participate in research studies, the remaining respondents in studies of the elderly will be an increasingly more select group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764213487344">Pavalko &amp; Wilson, 2011</xref>). Even after accounting for mortality selection, debate over whether health disparities in later life continue to expand, flatten, or contract continues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764213487344">Beckett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764213487344">S. M. Lynch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002764213487344">Noymer, 2001</xref>). One promising avenue for understanding the degree of expansion and leveling of health disparities in later life is to examine these processes across multiple dimensions of SES and health outcomes. For example, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764213487344">Kim and Durden (2007)</xref> found that after controlling for mortality biases, income and education disparities in functional limitations increased over the life course while income gaps in depressive symptoms narrowed.</p>

<title>New Directions and Unanswered Questions</title>
<p>Several decades of research have documented that socioeconomic conditions shape health in powerful ways throughout the life course. Scholars from a wide range of disciplines have made significant progress in identifying the long-term health effects of early socioeconomic disadvantage and, more recently, the accumulative and interactive pathways through which these health disparities unfold. At the same time, attention to dynamic life course processes also suggests that some health disparities may be malleable. As our understanding of these life course processes improves, we can identify the greatest opportunities for improving health. However, even with the extraordinary progress in sorting out how SES and health interact and influence one another across the life course, we are still at the early stages of this endeavor, and several key gaps remain in our understanding of these processes. In this section we identify and discuss three areas where closer attention holds the greatest promise for illuminating how and why socioeconomic conditions shape health.</p>
<p><italic>First</italic>, we need a much more thorough understanding of the <italic>dynamic processes</italic> that link socioeconomic conditions and health. The life course perspective highlights a number of distinct temporal concepts, such as timing, duration, and reversibility, that have the potential to significantly deepen our understanding of SES and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764213487344">Pavalko, 1997</xref>). Life course epidemiologists have been particularly attentive to questions of timing, testing whether the prenatal period is a “critical period” that shapes adult disease and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764213487344">Barker, Bull, Osmond, &amp; Simmonds, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764213487344">Barker et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213487344">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213487344">Eriksson, Forsen, Tuomilehto, Osmond, &amp; Barker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764213487344">Kuh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764213487344">Lithell et al., 1996</xref>). This model suggests that a childhood disadvantage occurring at a critical developmental point leaves a permanent scar on an individual’s health throughout the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487344">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Davey Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764213487344">Colombo, 1982</xref>). Some evidence for this possibility can be seen in an analysis that suggests SES during infancy predicts vulnerability to infectious diseases more strongly than SES later in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764213487344">Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper, &amp; Skoner, 2004</xref>). While empirical support for strict critical period and scarring hypotheses is mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487344">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764213487344">Preston et al., 1998</xref>), closer attention to whether the timing of disadvantage matters for long-term outcomes is needed.</p>
<p>Other concepts may also be important. We know far less about how, or whether, the duration of socioeconomic disadvantage matters for health, but an emerging body of research points to duration, persistence, or frequency of socioeconomic disadvantage as an important area for further inquiry. Research has found that the duration of hardship is important for health in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002764213487344">McLeod &amp; Shanahan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764213487344">Power et al., 1999</xref>), but to date, few studies have had data that allow a full test of these hypotheses for health in later life. A growing body of research also points to persistent socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood and adulthood as being particularly risky for later life health and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764213487344">Kahn &amp; Pearlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764213487344">Turrell et al., 2002</xref>). Likewise, the frequency with which one experiences poverty in adulthood is associated with declines in functional limitations, clinical depression, and cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002764213487344">J. W. Lynch, Kaplan, &amp; Shema, 1997</xref>). The recent availability of several prospective, longitudinal studies that follow respondents from childhood to midlife offers new potential to examine whether patterns of socioeconomic disadvantage, incorporating attention to the duration and frequency of these experiences, poses particular risks for long-term health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002764213487344">McDonough &amp; Berglund, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002764213487344">Wagmiller, Lennon, Kuang, Alberti, &amp; Aber, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Closer attention to these dynamic processes also offers greater potential to examine another major principle of the life course perspective—the importance of human agency in shaping the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213487344">Elder et al., 2003</xref>). Attention to agency calls awareness to the potential for individuals to reverse paths of disadvantage and risk, and to understand when these may or may not impact health. Individuals encounter turning points, and while structural conditions frame the opportunities available, there are at times opportunities for paths to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002764213487344">McLeod &amp; Almazan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764213487344">McLeod &amp; Pavalko, 2008</xref>). As one example, in their analysis of obesity patterns from early to midlife, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764213487344">Ferraro and Kelley-Moore (2003)</xref> propose two different mechanisms through which respondents could reverse their obesity course: risk factor elimination (i.e., losing weight) and countervailing mechanisms (e.g., exercise). They find that risk factor elimination did not reduce the effect of early life obesity on lower body disability but that incorporating a countervailing mechanism with regular exercise did reduce this risk. More thorough attention to processes of risk reversal, including how people may actively alter these pathways of risk, is clearly needed.</p>
<p><italic>Second</italic>, despite the widespread documentation of associations between childhood disadvantage and adult health and mortality, we know surprisingly little about how, or even whether, these processes differ for men and women and across different racial/ethnic groups. Research comparing across groups is provocative, but has been limited to a few outcomes and has yielded inconsistent findings. A more systematic understanding of how socioeconomic conditions shape health across the life course in similar and different ways across key groups is clearly needed. Gender differences in the relationships between SES and adult health are particularly plausible given both the different biological disease processes for men and women and the varying socioeconomic contexts and opportunities for current cohorts of elderly men and women. Several studies have found, for example, that low SES experienced in childhood is a stronger predictor of adult psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764213487344">Gilman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002764213487344">Power et al., 2002</xref>) and heart attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487344">Hamil-Luker &amp; O’Rand, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764213487344">Kuh et al., 2002</xref>) for women than for men. However, another study found few gender differences in the effects of SES in childhood on a wide range of adult health outcomes, including self-rated health, depressive symptoms, chronic conditions, and functional limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>). This study did find that adult educational attainment was more predictive of later life health for women, while income in adulthood was more predictive of men’s health in later life.</p>
<p>Research on racial/ethnic variation in the life course paths between SES and health is also intriguing but incomplete and inconsistent. We know, for example, that the disability and self-rated health gap between Blacks and Whites increases with age, and that this pattern is partially, but not fully, explained by adult SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002764213487344">Shuey &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002764213487344">Taylor, 2008</xref>). The extent to which childhood and adult SES affect health and mortality differently across racial groups is less clear. An analysis of mortality among U.S. men born in the early 20th century found that parents’ SES at age 15 helps explain racial gaps in mortality, and that much of this influence operated through the differential socioeconomic achievements Black and White men were able to accumulate in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764213487344">Warner &amp; Hayward, 2006</xref>). Another study—using a sample that included more recent cohorts of U.S. men and women—also found that both child and adult SES were predictive of later life health, but that the health impact of childhood SES did not differ for Blacks and Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>More work is clearly needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of gender and racial differences in SES and health. Scholars should also continue to direct their attention to potential variations in the relationship between SES and health by other social characteristics, particularly those representing social cleavages such as immigration, legal status, or place of residence. Unlike race and gender, these other forms of social cleavage are malleable. When viewed from a dynamic life course perspective, attention to these different forms of inequality offers potential for new insights into how social statuses shape health.</p>
<p><italic>Finally</italic>, one of the most promising avenues for advancing our understanding of how SES affects health is through comparative research on these mechanisms. An important contribution of the life course perspective is its call to give more attention to the historical and institutional contexts in which the life course unfolds. Birth cohorts provide one of the most important comparisons for shedding light on these institutional contexts. Birth cohorts of men and women currently in later life, who are the basis for our knowledge about long-term health effects of SES, grew up in the early decades of the 20th century. Historical changes, such as advances in treatment and prevention of major childhood diseases and shifts in opportunity structures and education systems, as well as changes in race and gender relations, mean that comparisons to these processes between earlier and more contemporary cohorts is clearly needed. As just one example, recent research has found evidence that the long-documented mortality crossover between Blacks and Whites may be specific to earlier cohorts of Americans that grew up during periods when hierarchies of racial stratification were even more extreme than they were for cohorts born just a few decades later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764213487344">Masters, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Other forms of comparison are also important, and future research on SES and health could be expanded by attention to two distinctly different comparative avenues. One looks outward to systematically compare mechanisms across countries, while a second looks inward to compare mechanisms across different health outcomes. Countries vary widely in their levels of inequality and their policies for blunting the impact of disadvantage. While much attention has been given to the vastly different levels of income inequality across countries and whether that affects health and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213487344">Beckfield, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002764213487344">Wilkinson, 1996</xref>), we know far less about whether different systems of inequality shape health across the life course. There is emerging evidence that they may (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764213487344">Dow &amp; Rehkopf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764213487344">Hyde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764213487344">Olafsdottir, 2007</xref>), but more research is needed.</p>
<p>Comparative research that looks inward, comparing across different types of diseases, disorders, and mortality causes, may also be a valuable avenue for suggesting the various mechanisms through which socioeconomic conditions “get under the skin” to impact health. A growing body of research has begun to compare the effects of childhood and adult SES on different health outcomes or mortality causes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764213487344">Galobardes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487344">Luo &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>). To date, the health outcome chosen and the extent to which we can compare across health outcomes have been shaped more by the measures available in long-term longitudinal data collections than by theoretically driven questions about how different disorders unfold across the life course. However, the continued development of existing data collections and the maturation of newer generations of data, as well as more sophisticated methods for disentangling life course processes, offer new opportunities for understanding how SES shapes many dimensions of health across the life course, and how these processes may differ across status groups and countries.</p>
