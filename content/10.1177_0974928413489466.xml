<abstract>
<p>South Africa in the post-1994 era has experienced phenomenal growth in foreign tourism. The <italic>Tourism White Paper</italic> (1996) had noted that South Africa missed its tourism opportunity because of the country’s troubled past. The rapid economic growth experienced by the BRICS countries has changed the face of international tourism. The tourism destinations have moved from developed to developing countries. In this context, the article highlights that South Africa enjoys 2.6 per cent of the lucrative Indian outbound tourism market. This market share has the potential to be increased. India has been added to South African Tourism’s (SAT’s) Core Markets List. A longitudinal analysis from foreign arrivals indicates two things, one, that India remains the top Asian foreign arrivals country, represented by 71,587 arrivals in 2010, and two, that India remains resilient to hold to its number one spot in Asian foreign arrivals to South Africa. South Africa must gear itself up to encourage the trend.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘The end of apartheid in South Africa heralded a new chapter in the history of South Africa as it has entered the global community of nations and also become integrated into the global economy.’ The legacy of apartheid has created a high monopolistic economy along the majority of economic activities, with extraction industries, such as mining, as the main economic drivers. The increasing mechanisation of mining and agriculture in an age of global competitiveness meant that machine replaced man in many operations. The demand for labour in the mining and agricultural sector fell in South Africa, and these shrinking sectors also tended to employ relatively less-skilled labour. Furthermore, that there was a decline in demand for low skills, and that there was an influx of low-skilled labour was a ‘perfect storm’. South Africa remains a highly unequal society which contributes to the duality in lives in South Africa, a small rich strata living side-by-side with the majority of poor South Africans. The economic costs of high unemployment rate and low growth have created the conditions for unrest amongst the population. The growth of jobs is not at a steady pace to support the demand for jobs and tourism has been one industry that has been growing with jobs. According to Chandra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0974928413489466">2001</xref>), employment increase of 50 per cent or higher occurred in small, medium and micro entrerprises (SMMEs) located in three service sectors—tourism, IT and retail.</p>
<p>In fact, pre-1994 tourism industry in South Africa was anti-developmental due to apartheid legislation which ensured that the industry almost exclusively catered to whites. This also ensured that the tourism value chain was also catering the white tourists. This also impacted the aviation industry as many international airlines boycotted South Africa and the domestic market served white tourists almost exclusively. Tourism facilitates the process of poverty alleviation and income distribution between countries, thereby contributing to a more balanced development in the world economies according to Satani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0974928413489466">2004</xref>). Tourism businesses have low barriers of entry that create the conditions for the majority of SMMEs being owned by family members, spouses and extended family members. Community ownership is also allowed and joint ventures can also be undertaken with local partners. Tourism is also attractive as it creates the incentive for stimulating domestic production to cater the needs of the tourism and the tourism product owners. Local production should be supported to ensure that the economic expenditure of tourists stays in the local economy and creates further multiplier effect.</p>
<p>The tourism industry is beneficial to the support infrastructure for tourism, such as transport, financial, telecommunication, energy and distribution services. Savings are important as a means of attaining economic growth in a country; therefore, the shortage of local savings can lead to a country borrowing money at interest to facilitate development and infrastructure. According to Landman (2003, 14), ‘low savers like South Africa thus need foreign investment to overcome the shortage of local savings’. The tourism industry is able to bring in much needed foreign exchange into the country as it is an export product consumed at the destination area. The growth of tourism in a country will attract foreign investments as transnational capital will seek to benefit from opportunities that existed. As a result of the development potential of tourism, a separate Ministry of Tourism was established owing to the growth of tourism as an economic sector that demanded separated and dedicated attention. Tourism has featured prominently as a priority sector in government strategy at all levels of government. Tourism outperforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0974928413489466">The Presidency, 2008</xref>) most economic sectors in terms of job and entrepreneurial opportunities created.</p>
<p>‘According to Visa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0974928413489466">2012</xref>) the top ten source markets (United Kingdom, United States, Mozambique, Germany, Botswana, Australia, Angola, Namibia, France and Canada) accounted for 67.3 per cent of total tourism earnings.’ From a competitive position, the emergence of new markets especially in Asia, countries such as India and China, have increasingly required the attention of tourism planners in almost all countries. Already in the year 2010, according to Merrill Lynch and Gemini Consulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), the <italic>World Wealth Report 2000</italic> had already identified that high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in Asia grew from 1.3 million HNWIs in 1998 to 1.7 million HNWIs in 1999. The phenomenal growth of the HNWIs in Asia was identified as having the potential to surpass the number of HNWIs in Europe. In as much as Asia is a growing market for outbound tourism to South Africa, Europe and the USA remain the core international tourism markets, especially the United Kingdom. According to a joint study by Grant Thornton and Kessel Feinstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0974928413489466">2011</xref>) in the Western Cape, Asia only accounts for 8 per cent while Europe accounts for more than 70 per cent of international visitors to the Western Cape. These results are important considering that international visitors spend more days in the Western Cape than other provinces. Therefore, the targeting of emerging tourism markets must be well managed to ensure that core markets are neglected in favour of emerging markets that have the potential in the middle to long term to become core markets. For the economic growth of the BRICS countries, new customers need to be added from the growing middle class who have needs and demands that extend to leisure, recreation and tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0974928413489466">Shaw et al. 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Importance of International Tourism</title>
<p>Tourism is truly a global industry and it is reported to be the world’s largest industry. According to Claver-Cortes et al. (2007, 727), ‘tourism has undoubtedly become the leading leisure activity in the 21st century. The industry employs 160 million people worldwide and generates $US700 billion in fiscal incomes.’ The majority of tourism happens between the developed countries, in the West, which means that the tourism industry is concentrated in the developed Western countries, the countries that least need the benefits of tourism. The tourism industry is sought after by both developing and developed countries because of its developmental ability. In the case of developing countries, Gerosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0974928413489466">2003</xref>) noted that tourism contributes more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 11 of the 12 poorest countries, in almost half of the low-income countries and in all lower middle income countries. In spite of the fact that international tourism to the poor countries remains very low in relative terms, the impact of tourism is huge in these developing countries. Cooper et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0974928413489466">2005</xref>) noted that the tourism industry has had consistent growth for 30 years and it is resilient as an activity and economic sector.</p>
<p>The growth of the services sector has been associated with the emergence of banking, insurance and tourism as services that are produced for consumption. Services have provided a new platform for countries, regions and areas to achieve economic growth and development without industrialisation.</p>
<p>‘As noted by Altman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0974928413489466">2006</xref>) the largest and fastest growing sectors of the South African economy are located in the services sector which is an important location of future job creation.’ According to World Economic Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0974928413489466">2009</xref>), a growing travel and tourism industry contributes to employment, raises national incomes and can improve a country’s balance of payments. The tourism industry is an attracter of foreign exchange <italic>par excellent</italic>. Tourism is aggressively promoted by countries because it can diversify local economies. Taylor and McGlynn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0974928413489466">2009</xref>) noted that in the case of Cuba, tourism has surpassed sugar industry as the main source of foreign exchange, becoming the engine of growth for the economy. ‘Tourism is one of the main sources of foreign exchange for the majority of African countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0974928413489466">Gerosa 2003</xref>, 6). The tourism industry is an export industry because the tourism product offering is consumed at the destination area, and hence it has to be consumed on site, at the destination. Tourism offerings are characterised by fixed location, which means that the highly sought after tourism experience can only be produced at the destination area, and the tourist must travel to the destination area. As noted by Lowitt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0974928413489466">2006</xref>), tourism is an export sector which earns foreign exchange but is consumed domestically, at the destination. In addition, the tourism product offering cannot be physically distributed like normal goods to be conveniently accessible to consumers. This is related to the fixed location character of tourism product offerings, which means that information and communication strategies must be put in place to promote the destinations, thereby creating the interest for tourists to travel to tourism destinations and consume the tourism product offering at those destinations. In addition, as George (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0974928413489466">2008</xref>) notes, there is physical product that the guest will accrue after the consumption of the tourism product offering because of the service nature of the tourism consumption process.</p>
<p>The travel and tourism industry can play a leading role in poverty reduction in developing countries according to World Economic Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0974928413489466">2009</xref>). The benefits of tourism will, however, not flow automatically to poor and vulnerable groups of people at a destination; concerted steps must be taken to ensure that tourism is pro-poor. Economic growth can happen in the presence of widespread poverty, and hence pro-poor tourism is very imperative. According to Ashley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0974928413489466">2006</xref>), pro-poor tourism seeks to maximise the local economic impacts along the tourism value chain to see where linkages with the local economy can be boosted. Therefore, the focus shifts from local benefits being exclusively associated with employment creation by the tourism industry, to entrepreneurship by locals to ensure that the tourism benefit remains local. One of the reasons that the tourism industry is sought after is to ensure that the standard of living of the locals is raised. This is achieved by ensuring that the locals benefit from the tourism industry by owning companies, especially small, medium and micro enterprises. In the case of South Africa, the tourism industry is especially relevant considering that South Africa has a high rate of unemployment and inequality. The tourism industry is a proven job creator owing to its labour-intensive nature because the tourism product offering is a service and an intangible experience that must be simultaneously produced and consumed.</p>
<p>According to Blaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489466">2013</xref>), unemployment hovers around 25 per cent, which means that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0974928413489466">Equal Education 2011</xref>) 47 per cent of South Africans are living below the poverty line, and 2.4 million young people in South Africa between the ages of 18 and 25 are unemployed. South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world and this is further compounded since a country like Brazil has managed to reduce inequality when compared to South Africa. According to Bhorat and Van Der Westhuizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), South Africa was once one of the world’s most unequal societies and now is the most equal. Gini-coeficient is an indicator of the skewed distribution of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0974928413489466">May et al. 1997</xref>), measuring the degree of inequality. Tourism, more than any other sector, has the ability to address inequalities, create jobs simultaneously whilst the industry grows. The multiplicity of skills required by the tourism industry ensures that jobs are created for the highly skilled, middle skilled and the un-skilled. The tourism industry provides many entry-level positions that would have not existed in other industries in the economy, in as much as these entry-level positions may be low paying. As noted by Dinh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0974928413489466">2011</xref>), one in every 20 jobs in sub-Saharan Africa is in travel and tourism. The industry also creates opportunities for the employment of more women and marginalised groups of people than other industries. The labour-intensive nature of the tourism industry is a key factor in creating jobs with tourism growth. Rogerson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0974928413489466">2006</xref>) noted that the pro-poor attributes of tourism are related to tourism offering opportunities for the informal sector participation, consumption is on-site; therefore, the customer must come to the site for consumption. Pro-poor tourism cannot be a reality unless market access is granted to the poor in addition to business linkages with established operators and the imparting of skills to ensure sustainability and viability.</p>
<p>In addition, the tourism industry relies on the natural resources that already exist, which can be regarded as ‘free’ resources, such as wildlife, scenery and culture. ‘Tourism contributes to environmental protection, conservation and restoration of genuine heritages, biological diversity and sustainable use of natural resources…Tourism protects and creates economic value for resources which otherwise have no perceived value to residents, or are regarded as a cost rather than a benefit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0974928413489466">Satani 2004</xref>, 35). By creating the ‘free’ resources as sites of consumption, tourism creates the financial incentive to conserve those sites. The barriers to entry in the tourism industry are low when compared to other industries, because (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0974928413489466">Gerosa 2003</xref>) tourism is not impacted by tariffs and non-tariff barriers, such as, on agriculture and manufacturing. The low barriers of entry result in the domination of small, medium and micro enterprises in the informal economy that will be locally owned and operated. One of the major reasons why tourism is so significant for less developed countries is that the original market countries cannot put protectionist barriers against the destination countries. Besides the aspects of having a passport and visa (to certain countries), the industry is largely unregulated and can grow unimpeded as opposed to other sectors such as agriculture. This can be attributed to the fact that tourism is service which is an export product consumed at the destination area.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Tourist consumption is important to many destinations as local residents increase their local expenditure on day visit whilst out of town tourist inject needed capital in the local economy. Tourists usually consume a bundle of goods and services while travelling and the key elements of such a consumption bundle may be identified within five broad commodity groups: accommodation, food, transportation, shopping and entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0974928413489466">Divisekera 2010</xref>, 631).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The tourism industry combines primary (land, labour, etc.) and intermediate (hotels, shops, mode of transport, etc.) inputs to produce intermediate outputs, such as accommodation, meals or performances, according to Sharpley (2004a). The intermediate outputs are used to produce intangible experiences that are the final products that are valued. The fact that the tourists experience at the tourism destination creates opportunities for other domestic enterprises to benefit from the tourism and creates backward linkages in industries such as agriculture. Tourism can catalyse other industries, such as manufacturing, through tourism demand. Therefore, tourism has a direct, indirect and induced impact at the destination economy. Therefore, the effects of tourism can be experienced through the economy of a country. Local production should be supported to ensure that the economic expenditure of tourists stays in the local economy and creates further multiplier effect.</p>
<p>‘Tourism is associated with the movement of people to consume a tourism product offered at a destination area.’ This means that tourists must undertake a trip or element of journey from the tourist producing area pass through a transit area to get to the tourism destination area. ‘Aviation is indispensable for tourism, which is a major engine for economic growth, particularly in developing economies. Globally, 51% of international tourists travel by air’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0974928413489466">ATAG 2003</xref>). According to the Commission on Sustainable Development (2001), demand for air freight service is also primarily a function of economic growth and international trade. Therefore, this means that the liberalisation of air services can help in growth of the economy of a country, by allowing the free movement of goods and people. According to a document titled ‘The Economic Impact of Air Service Liberalisation’ by InterVISTAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0974928413489466">2007</xref>), traffic growth subsequent to liberalisation of air services agreements between countries typically averaged between 12 per cent and 35 per cent, significantly greater during years preceding liberalisation. Landlocked countries and small island countries can have aviation as an alternative to the high transport costs over land.</p>
<p>With specific reference to BRICS, according to Pan African Investment &amp; Research Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), emerging markets are expected to be the drivers of growth in tourism, boosting international tourism. The majority of BRICS countries, with reference to South Africa, possess two characteristics: namely, that they are long haul destination and secondly they represent a small market for South Africa with huge potential for future growth. The rapid economic growth experienced by the BRICS countries is associated with rising incomes, a growing middle class and improved standards of living. It is, therefore, not surprising that in the case of the Asia-Pacific region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0974928413489466">UNWTO 2006</xref>) China and India are fueling intra-regional, outbound tourism and will continue to be leading tourist-generating regions for the future. The rising incomes in the BRICS countries increase local spending and this leads to the demand for tourism consumption. The growth in the BRICS countries brings with it new customers, which, therefore, presents a growth pole for the entire world. The ongoing economic crisis in the USA and Europe has dampened the demand for outbound tourism, whilst Asia has been largely insulated. The growing influence of the BRICS countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0974928413489466">Ministry of Tourism 2012</xref>) can be accounted when you consider that China overtook France as one of the top five source markets for overseas tourists with growth in South Africa driven by increase in arrivals from emerging regions, namely, South America (54.4 per cent) and Asia (40.7 per cent), for the first six months of 2012. Merrill Lynch and Gemini Consulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0974928413489466">2010</xref>) noted that even during the recession of 2010 in the global economy, the Asia-Pacific region grew with GDP growth of 8.7 per cent in China and 6.85 in India.</p>

<title>History of BRICS</title>
<p>According to Bliss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), the term BRICs was coined by Jim O’Neill in 2001 referring to the world of emerging economies, namely, Brazil, Russia, India and China. These countries were significant in that they represented growing population, new markets and had increased their share of global trade and were important for global trade. ‘This represents a global shift in economic power from the West, eastwards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489466">Asuelini and Jethro 2011</xref>, 3). The global shift in economic power occurred before the European Sovereign debt crisis and the sub-prime crisis in the United States whilst both these crises may have ascended the economic and political prominence of these countries and their associated grouping BRICS. Politically these countries were increasingly organising themselves as a group at global stages, such as the G-8 and the United Nations. China and Russia are the only BRICS members that are Security Council members whist Brazil, India and South Africa are members of the Security Council through reforms to the Security Council to include non-permanent members. The shifting of power from the West to the East through the involvement of the emerging economics of BRICS countries can be associated with the influence the BRICS countries have in the United Nations and in the Security Council. According to Patel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0974928413489466">2011</xref>), during a vote on imposition of sanctions on Syria, Russia and China vetoed that resolution, whilst the other BRICS countries including Lebanon abstained from voting. This earned Russia, China and the other BRICS members the wrath of the Western powers, indicating that the Security Council is a battleground between the world’s established powers and the emerging powers represented by BRICS countries. The BRICS countries are more vocal in G-20 meetings and even within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) according to Chan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0974928413489466">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>With the original BRICs and the new BRICS grouping, the two countries that have received a lot of attention are India and China. According to Bussolo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0974928413489466">2007</xref>), in 1980 China and India accounted for 2 per cent of global output and by 2005 it was 7 per cent of global output, nearly a quadrupled increase in output. South Africa was later invited to join BRICs and represented the last S, making the group BRICS. According to Alden and Sidiropoulos (2011, 1), ‘the BRIC decision to invite South Africa to join in late December 2010 gave Africa a direct voice within the grouping, although it is only South Africa that feels that at forums such as these, it must represent the region as well as itself’. Membership of BRICS for South Africa represents many economic opportunities for South Africa; however, it must be borne in mind that many of the BRICS member countries are competing with South Africa to access markets in Africa. According to Khan (2011, 493), ‘the original BRIC nations include the factory of the world (China), the garden of the world (Brazil), the gas station of the world (Russia) and the back office of the world (India). South Africa comes to the club as jeweler of the world and gatekeeper.’ According to Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0974928413489466">2007</xref>), China and India would become dominant suppliers of manufactured goods and services while Brazil and Russia would become suppliers of raw materials. Economic growth in the BRICS countries has improved the standard and quality of life. In as much as economic growth is not a sufficient condition for development, the economic growth has lifted many families out of poverty. The power of China as a BRICS member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0974928413489466">Chan 2012</xref>) is associated with the allegation that China caused the global financial crisis by undervaluing the Chinese currency to support the export of its manufactured produce.</p>
<p>South Africa’s inclusion in the BRIC community that later changed to BRICS is not only about mere economics but also geopolitical considerations. According to Kruger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), South Korea, Mexico and Turkey have much bigger economies than South Africa. South Africa has been able to ‘punch above its weight’ in most global issues, has earned a non-permanent seat on the Security Council of the United Nations and is regarded not just as the voice of the African continent but a gateway to access the African continent. This is confirmed by Draper and Scholvin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0974928413489466">2012</xref>) that a closer look at economic interaction in sub-Saharan Africa confirms that South Africa interlinks many of its neigbouring countries globally. Many African countries depend on the financial services sector and transport infrastructure of South Africa to conduct transactions. OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg is the most important hub in Africa, whilst the rail network is provided by Spoornet (state-owned enterprise). Durban is the busiest port in Africa, complemented by Richard Bay and the new Ngqura Port in Port Elizabeth. Kruger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0974928413489466">2012</xref>) acknowledges that the strategic location at the tip of Africa would allow BRICS countries to better compete with the G-7 as the Cape is one of the key naval routes from East to West. South Africa has well-developed port infrastructure that can be resourceful to the BRICS countries. Access via the Suez Canal is affected by the volatile political situation in many countries, and the operation of pirates around the Horn of Africa has made travel past the region too risky and would be increasingly avoided as ransom has been demanded when people and cargo have been impounded by pirates. As ships have increasingly become bigger, they cannot access the Suez Canal and the route around the Cape is increasingly becoming the most important maritime route. The geography of the individual BRICS countries is spatially dispersed with one representative from South America in Brazil, one representative from Africa, South Africa, and three representatives from Asia, namely, Russia, India and China. The BRICS countries are geographically dispersed and represent newly industrialised countries (NICs) in continents that are economically marginalised. For the purposes of this article, only India will be profiled. According to Hubacek et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0974928413489466">2007</xref>), these two countries are home to 37 per cent of the world’s population today.</p>
<sec id="section4-0974928413489466">
<title>India</title>
<p>‘India is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous country with over 1.18 billion people. India is a federal constitutional republic with a parliamentary democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0974928413489466">Simon 2011</xref>, 43). India is one of the world largest and fastest growing economies and according to Dahlman and Utz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0974928413489466">2005</xref>), India’s economy surged to a growth rate of 8.2 per cent between 2003 and 2004. India has developed around the services economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0974928413489466">Simon 2011</xref>); total IT business process outsourcing (BPO) reached aggregate revenues of US$73.1 billion in 2010. According to Simon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0974928413489466">2011</xref>), 64 per cent of the population in the working age group (15–60 years) are employed. India’s middle class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0974928413489466">Deutshe Bank Research 2010</xref>) consumption is roughly equivalent to Ireland’s total private consumption. This confirms the huge potential that the Indian middle class represents from a business perspective. From a military perspective, according to Van Rooyen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), India’s army is the fourth largest in the world, and has used its military power in various peacekeeping missions in Africa. Trade between India and South Africa increased more than fivefold between 2003 and 2009, according to Sidiropoulos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0974928413489466">2010</xref>). Trade between the two countries has resulted in conglomerates, such as First National Bank having a presence in India, whist Mahindra and TATA have reciprocal presence in South Africa. MTN, a South African cell phone operator, was involved in a failed merger in 2009 that would have formed one of the largest cell phone companies in the world.

<title>Influence of BRICS</title>
<p>The phenomenal growth that the BRICS countries have experienced in the world economy can be associated with the success of the globalisation, as part of the capitalistic system of production. The force of globalisation ensured that companies were searching for new areas, and site for capitalist accumulation, new markets, new places to source raw material and new sites for production. The movement of capital from one country to another has been encouraged as part of foreign direct investment (FDI) which is highly sought after as bringing in financial injection into an economy. The reduction of barriers to entry of capital has been associated with the Washington Consensus.</p>
<p>Countries that had distinct advantages, such as abundant labour, low costs of production, technology and high skills and expertise, attracted FDIs. The fundamental influence of the BRICS countries is that they have increased the global marketplace for skills through increased knowledge acquisition, and opened up new markets for consumer goods that also include tourism. Many of these BRICS countries are already engines of growth, through increased trade and increasing their share of global income, and associated standard of living for their inhabitants. The phenomenal growth that these countries have experienced have led to increased wealth and increased disposable income. For the consumption of tourism to happen, there must be an existence of disposable income and discretionary time, with the former being the most important. In the case of an unemployed person, they may have unlimited amount of time to consume tourism products or services, but because of the price that must be paid for the consumption to occur, the unemployed may be disadvantaged because of economic challenges such as lack of income.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that price discriminated in that it grants access to those that have the money and are willing to spend it for the activity, whilst those that do not have the money to pay the price are discriminated from consumption. The increasing wealth, development of a middle class and the education of these consumers in middle class consumption may lead to eventual consumption of tourism products domestically and outside their countries. The population of the Asia-Pacific region has a strong desire and ability to travel as disposable income increases. The above average growth rate of these emerging economies beyond growth rates achieved by many developed economies has ensured that the BRICS countries are taken seriously. According to IPK International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), the rising income in emerging economies is one of the drivers of world GDP. Asia is definitely the main geographical area that will drive the future growth of the world economy. The fast growth experienced by the BRICS countries mitigates the mature travel markets in the developed world. The global economic crisis experienced by Europe and North American countries has reduced growth forecast for economies, limiting the expenditure on tourism and outbound tourism. The Asia-Pacific outbound tourism has, according to IPK International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), experienced double digit growth in excess of 14 per cent. The consumer nature of the populations in these newly industrialised nations can be ascertained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0974928413489466">Simon 2011</xref>) from the fact that in 2010, BRIC countries accounted for 13 per cent of global demand, whilst China is the world’s largest producer of ICT products (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0974928413489466">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>As noted by Honkanen and Mustonen (2007, 43), ‘tourism holds an important part in the lives of Western citizens’. Tourists from these countries consume tourism more readily as they are experienced traveller, and the consumption is part of their lifestyle that enhances life experiences and can be a status symbol, and consumption is over a lifetime. If the tourists generating countries are experiencing reduced demand for tourism consumption due to the not compulsory nature of tourism consumption, looking for new growth markets is a realistic response. Many countries have joined the BRICS bandwagon to try and attract particularly the Indian and Chinese tourism markets. The Western countries are the dominant tourism-generating countries and any negative economic conditions have an adverse impact on the developmental potential of tourism. According to Sharpley (2004b, 17),
<disp-quote>
<p>international tourism is still largely dominated by the industrialised world, with the major tourism flows being primarily between the developed nations and to a lesser extent, from developed to less developed countries. Indeed, despite the emergence of new, increasingly popular destinations such as China, Poland, and Thailand, the economic benefits of tourism remain highly polarized.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This means that tourism occurs between countries that need tourism the least. However, the developmental potential of tourism is great despite the low levels of tourism as the developing countries share a small percentage of the total tourism market. According to Kharas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), Asia’s emerging middle class will be large enough to become one of the main drivers of the global economy. The BRICS countries present markets that must be targeted by means of stimuli to benefit from their great spending potential. George (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0974928413489466">2008</xref>) noted that tourism is a great example of a fashion item. In addition, Sharpley (2004b) noted that tourism-generating countries have a dominant consumer culture that influences all forms of consumption including tourism. The consumer culture has also impacted on the BRICS countries which represent not just an ‘untapped tourism market’ but market with high growth potential.</p>

<sec id="section6-0974928413489466">
<title>Market Selection: Why India not China</title>
<p>The reason that India is put forward as a better travel destination can be related to several reasons that include language, history, common interest, trade relations, sports relation and a common history.</p>
<sec id="section7-0974928413489466">
<title>India’s Outbound Tourism to South Africa</title>
<p>According to <italic>The Hindu Business Line</italic> (2012, 1), ‘in, 2005, nearly 85,000 Indians visited South Africa’. This was nearly 10 per cent more than the previous year’s number of 72,000. From a numbers perspective, the nearly double digit growth of tourists from India compared to other BRICS countries is testimony to the Indian tourism miracle. According to South African Tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), the number of tourists travelling from India to South Africa increased by more than 122 per cent between 2005 and 2010. India, therefore, displays faster outbound tourism growth to South Africa, far ahead of any other Asian-Pacific tourism-producing countries. Travel agencies remain an important intermediary in tourism and they play an important role in influencing customer choice. The fact that Durban had hosted the Travel Agency Federation of India (TAFI) in November 2012 is an important step in winning over Indian travel agencies that are an important intermediary in the tourism value chain. South African Tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0974928413489466">2008</xref>) has placed India as one of the core markets that delivers the ‘bread-and-butter’ income and where SAT must deploy 60 per cent of the budgeting expenditure on this category of markets. India with six major airports is well connected and the liberalisation of aviation has benefited the customers in terms of lower fares and increased air capacity. Of the eight core markets of outbound tourism to South Africa, according to Statistics South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0974928413489466">2011</xref>), India represents 4.2 per cent of the outbound market to South Africa at number 6, while China represents 3.1 per cent at number 8.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0974928413489466">Table 2</xref>, it is clear that in numbers game, India has been able to attain greater outbound tourism market to South African than China.</p>

<title>Services and Knowledge-based Economy in India</title>
<p>‘Services have become the major engine of economic growth, accounting for half of India’s output and employing less than one quarter of the workforce’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0974928413489466">Cheng et al. 2007</xref>, 147). The economy of India is more service orientated than the economy of China. Services have shown enormous growth potential, and the service economy is represented by middle class labour which means that the service economy grows, there would be a corresponding growth of the middle class. Call centres, health tourism and outsourced industries have driven the service economy contribution to GDP whilst creating employment for the middle class. The service economy demands higher levels of skills, requiring corresponding level of skills amongst the current and potential employees. The demand for higher skills in the economy means it will have an incentive impact on upskilling of the population and higher interest in higher education. The middle class is the focus not exclusively for outbound tourism to South Africa from India; the middle class in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0974928413489466">Deutshe Bank Research 2010</xref>) is the fastest growing section of the population although the middle class represents less than 30 per cent of the population of India. This therefore means that the scope for the growth and development of the middle class in India is enormous. The middle class, as their salaries increase, will experience increased discretionary income that can be used for leisure, recreation and tourism service offering. The services economy will increasingly require a higher skills set especially considering the knowledge-based economy (KBE) we are experiencing in the world. The challenges faced by many countries are related to acquiring the required skills to respond to the KBE. Therefore, all countries that seek to attain sustained economic growth can either produce their own skills or attract them from elsewhere. According to Finegold et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0974928413489466">2011</xref>), India already has the largest number of college and universities in the world and the government plans to more than double higher education capacity in the next decade. These graduates would increase the size of the middle class in India and increase the expenditure of the middle class, hopefully also on leisure and tourism. The movement towards a knowledge economy in India is underpinned by strong emphasis on education that will produce a pool of skilled workers and entrepreneurs that will enter the middle class.</p>

<title>Democratic India</title>
<p>The fact is that India is a democratic republic with institutions such as an independent judiciary that are important prerequisites for success. Democracy is not an end in itself but increasingly destinations that have democratic institutions offer transparency and greater business opportunities. The challenge facing China is the lack of robustness of its judiciary as arbitrator of disputes and a lack of an independent and robust judiciary makes China an investment risk. China is described by Shaw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0974928413489466">2007</xref>) as a Marxist authoritarian state.</p>

<sec id="section10-0974928413489466">
<title>Language: English</title>
<p>According to Dahlman and Utz (2005, 3), India has ‘a critical mass of skilled, English-speaking knowledge workers, especially in the sciences’. Since English is the world’s primary language of business, it means that from an outbound tourism perspective to South Africa, Indian tourists can be engaged using English as a primary language of communication. This is, however, not the case with regard to China. According to the Tamil Federation of KwaZulu-Natal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), many Indians in South Africa speak English to overcome language barriers.</p>

<sec id="section11-0974928413489466">
<title>Population Growth</title>
<p>Many developed nations are facing negative natural population growth, while countries in the developing world are experiencing high population growth, meaning that new consumers are entering these markets all the time. As noted by Bussolo et al. (2007, 9),
<disp-quote>
<p>the two significant changes occurring are that: a) all the increases in the global population will be in developing countries, and b) today’s high-income counties and China will become significantly older. The largest contribution to the nearly 1.5 billion increase in developing regions can be attributed to India.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fertility challenges in China are still being faced with the one-child policy. According to Aiyar and Mody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0974928413489466">2011</xref>), India will be the single largest contributor to the global workforce as the working-age ratio increases from 64 per cent to 69 per cent by 2040. The attraction about Indian outbound tourists is that they travel with family and spend a significant amount on shopping, according to Tripathi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0974928413489466">2004</xref>). In order to cater for the needs of the Indian inbound tourists, significant research must be undertaken as to find out how this market can be exploited in South Africa.</p>

<sec id="section12-0974928413489466">
<title>High Inequalities in China</title>
<p>The middle class of China is regarded as larger when compared to the Indian middle class. According to Bussolo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0974928413489466">2007</xref>), in China 56 million people belong to the global middle class, earning more than 90 per cent of all Chinese citizens. This presents a worrying picture on the sustainability of the demand for discretionary income dependent expenditures such as tourism. The high inequality in China, therefore, means that it is not a better choice than India, rather China requires special measures to tap into that market. The high inequalities limit the spending. In a paper titled ‘Tourism Outlook: South Africa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0974928413489466">Visa 2012</xref>), it emerged that Indian tourists had spent US$17.3 million in 2011, up 13.1 per cent year on year. According to Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0974928413489466">2007</xref>), India has the potential to grow the fastest among the four BRIC countries over the 30 to 50 years because the decline in the working age will happen later for India compared to the other BRIC countries.</p>

<sec id="section13-0974928413489466">
<title>Indian Diaspora in South Africa</title>
<p>According to Cloete (1982, 46),
<disp-quote>
<p>the first Indians were brought into Natal around about 1860 as labourers for the sugar cane estates, but were soon followed by others who did other work and mostly served as traders. Some also moved to the Transvaal and the Cape Colony, but not to the Orange Free State where a law was passed in 1890 to keep them out. At first it appeared that the Indians would be accepted as part of the population of Natal and some males were even registered as voters.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The arrival of the Indians was a result of the comfortability of the Natal Zulus with their tribal land ownership and they did not provide reliable and regular labour to the white sugar entrepreneurs, who turned to India as a source of alternative labour sources. The first Indian arrivals were followed by Indians that paid the costs of their own travel to South Africa. Indian contract (indentured) labour by providing cheap and secure supply of labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0974928413489466">Vavi 2010</xref>) entered the working class struggle in South Africa. ‘India has deep historical and cultural ties with the countries of Africa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0974928413489466">Beri 2011</xref>, 5). Furthermore according to Beri (2011, 12),
<disp-quote>
<p>the Indian diaspora in Africa is another factor for the region’s increased importance. In the past, despite around two million people of India origin living in Africa, the Indian government did not consider that the Indian community abroad had any political, diplomatic or economic relevance to India…The Indian government has revised its policy and is actively engaging in building bridges. The recently held Mini Pravisi Bhartiya Divas in Durban, South Africa, signaled India’s growing interest in interacting with its diaspora in Africa and building relationships based on mutual dependencies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The majority of Indians in South Africa reside in the province of KwaZulu-Natal and their influence is quiet evident in the province. The apartheid policy of separate development led to the development of race-based dwelling areas resulting in Indians being allocated Indian only locations, such as, Chatsworth, Azaadville and Lenasia. After the enactment of the Land Tenure Act of 1946, Indians were also subjected to forced removals. According to Vavi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), forced Indian removals resulted in their relocation to townships, such as Laudium, Lenasia, Phoenix, Cato Manor and Chatsworth. Indians also participated in the struggle for the liberation of South Africa from the racist segregation policies of apartheid. The South African Indian Congress (SAIC) when led by Dr Yusuf Dadoo and Dr Naicker understood that it could only advance the Indian question when it cooperated with other national liberation organisations in South Africa. According to South African History Organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0974928413489466">2012</xref>), what was to be called a ‘Three Doctors Pact’ was signed by SAIC’s Dr Yusuf Dadoo and Dr Naicker and the African National Congress (ANC) President, Dr A. Xuma, to cooperate against the apartheid and segregation policies in place for people of colour in South Africa. In 2010 South African Indians commemorated 150 years in South Africa. Indians, even though they are a small section of the total population in South Africa, are known for their entrepreneurship, hard work and creativity, and enrolments in well paying fields, such as medicine, actuarial studies and the engineering sciences field. Vavi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0974928413489466">2010</xref>) concurs with the fact that Indian traders were removed from city centres during apartheid because of the competition they posed to white capital interests. Luiz and Mariotti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0974928413489466">2008</xref>) confirm the entrepreneurship nature of Asians in a study about entrepreneurship amongst MBA students in South Africa. Asian students had a conservative view towards risk and were more willing to become entrepreneurs because of the family businesses that they are exposed to.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0974928413489466">Table 3</xref>, it is clear that Indians spend on average more nights than other groups of outbound tourists to South Africa. This extended stay can be attributed to visiting friends and relatives (VFR) that may be related to the fact that there is a dominant Indian diaspora in South Africa. The familiarity with the country also means they are worthwhile as repeat visitors to South Africa.</p>

<title>A Shared History</title>
<p>Indians represent one of the minority race groups in South Africa that were suppressed under apartheid laws, such as Black Africans and Coloureds. Apartheid created a dual society with whites enjoying exclusive rights in the country whilst other race groups enjoying citizen rights at a descending level with Indians regarded as second class citizens, Coloureds being regarded as third class citizens and lastly, Black African as fourth class citizens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0974928413489466">Table 4</xref>). Indians played a prominent role in the struggle against oppression in South Africa and apartheid. Indians represented by the SAIC formed an alliance with the ANC that later formed the first democratic government in 1994. One of the alliance partners of the ANC, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), was established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0974928413489466">Vavi 2010</xref>) in 1985 with the leadership comprising two Indian leaders, Jay Naidoo as General Secretary and Elijah Barayi as President. Both these alliance partners, including the South African Community Party (SACP), have had Indian leaders.</p>

<title>Mahatma Gandhi</title>
<p>The history that India shares with South Africa is related to the late democratic leader Mahatma Gandhi who was born in present-day India and spent more than a decade in South Africa. According to Cloete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0974928413489466">1982</xref>), the Natal Indian Congress (NIC) formed by Mahatma Gandhi in 1894 was apparently the first political organisation for South African Indians. <italic>Satyagraha</italic>, the active non-violent defiance campaign, initiated by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa was exported to India after being conceived in South Africa. India which was under British rule was liberated through the <italic>Satyagraha</italic> defiance campaign. The link of Mahatma Gandhi is a fine link between the countries. The NIC was formed as a body to represent the interest of Indians in South Africa and Gandhi was instrumental in its establishment. The NIC and the SAIC formed a pact with the ANC for the liberation of South Africa from apartheid policies. According to Zuma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), the United Nations has declared Gandhi’s birthdate, 2 October, as the International Peace Day owing to the great sacrifices he made for world peace. Therefore, the engagement with the Indian population could include selling justice tourism tours associated with the struggle for liberation in South Africa and Mahatma Gandhi. The house in which Mahatma Gandhi lived in Johannesburg from 1908 to 1909 has been converted into a museum and has been named Satyagraha House.</p>

<title>Political: India’s Foreign Policy towards Africa</title>
<p>‘The main tenet of India’s Africa policy has been support for the struggle against decolonization and racial discrimination in South Africa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0974928413489466">Beri 2011</xref>, 5). This resulted in India becoming a member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) during the Cold War era with other non-major power countries. India already view Africa very positively as a partner in the reform of global institutions including the United Nations Security Council, where both South Africa and India have served as rotating non-permanent members. The military of India has been involved in many peacekeeping missions on the African continent. Therefore, from a political perspective, India can be regarded to be closer to African governments than China. China, however, has provided various military supports to African liberation movements. According to Van Rooyen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0974928413489466">2010</xref>), India’s participation in peacekeeping missions on the African continent include Congo (1960–1964), Namibia (1989–1991), Angola (1989–1991), Ethiopia-Eritrea (2000 onwards), the Congo (1999 onwards), Mozambique (1992–1994), Somalia (1993–1994) and Rwanda (1993–1996). Political instability has a detrimental impact on the economies of African countries, stifling economic growth and human development. Therefore, the attainment of peace and stability in African countries has a developmental dividend for the continent, and the commitment of India to this objective is commendable. India’s participation on the African continent gave the continent a status as an emerging superpower.</p>

<title>Sports: Cricket</title>
<p>Cricket is one sport that links South Africa and India as both countries are superpowers in global cricket. The Indian Premier League (IPL) has attracted many South African players that ply their trade in India, including AB de Villiers, Jacques Kallis, Faf du Plessis and Morne Steyn. Sports provide an avenue for promoting South Africa as tourist destination, and former Proteas player and fielding coach for IPL team Mumbai Indians, Jonty Rhodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0974928413489466"><italic>The Hindu Business Line</italic> 2012</xref>), volunteered to promote South African tourism in India. The power of cricket in India is unrivalled by any other sport, with Jonty Rhodes being one of the greatest cricketers, benchmarking fielding on the cricket pitch. According to Tripathi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0974928413489466">2004</xref>), Australia used Steve Waugh, former cricket player, to promote Australia as a destination for Indians, tapping into the familiarity of Steve as a cricket personality.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Outbound tourism to South Africa can only grow at a faster pace with the liberalisation of air travel in South Africa allowing free competition. The attraction of outbound tourism markets whilst South Africa remains a long-haul destination can only be attained through a progressive aviation strategy. There is a need to ensure that the support services for attaining visas to visit South Africa are increased. BRICS countries, from the tourism business perspective, present great opportunities for outbound tourism to South Africa. Restrictive aviation policies hell bent on protecting the monopoly of the national carrier, South African Airways, will not be in the best interest of the country and the future tourism for the country. As South Africa attains tourism growth in double digits above the global average, there is a need to achieve customer satisfaction by responding to the growth surge by increasing the capacity of the tourism industry. Each of the individual BRICS countries must be catered to and portfolio be managed as they show phenomenal growth, as Europe is still in the doldrums. The concentration of outbound tourism to South Africa from Europe especially the United Kingdom is a risk as it presents a challenge of sustainability. As the nature of the tourism industry is very averse to risks and change of situation, being highly dependent of one source market is a concern. Therefore, the BRICS countries’ growth have been encouraging in increasing tourism to South Africa and providing a means of market diversification. With India as the primary focus of outbound tourism growth from Asia, tourism numbers will increase with double digit growth owing to the success of the middle class project in India.</p>
