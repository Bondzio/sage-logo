<p>In its second edition, <italic>Language and Gender</italic> offers a clear and comprehensive overview of research and trends in the study of language and gender. The new edition includes an updated overview of recent research in areas such as language and sexuality, and gender and workplace talk. This introductory text is divided into three parts and 12 chapters.</p>
<p>Part I, ‘Preliminaries: Airing Stereotypes and Early Models’, sets the scene by examining some of the early work on sex differences in language use and stereotypes about women. It also considers the distinction between sex and gender, the importance of language study for feminists, and the early feminist claims about ‘women’s language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Lakoff, 1975</xref>). Talbot problematizes the dichotomous conceptualization of gender, given that such a view is seen to obscure the dynamic nature of gendered linguistic practices. Instead, she argues that gender should be viewed as a continuum, with varying degrees of masculinity and femininity, and suggests that there is a need to avoid reproducing existing stereotypes about the sexes in studying language and gender. She also points out that there is no simple way of itemizing ‘men’s language’ and ‘women’s language’ on the basis of linguistic forms, since there is no one-to-one correlation between form and function.</p>
<p>Part II, ‘Interaction among Women and Men’, reviews a selection of empirical research studies of gender and spoken interaction situated within the theoretical framework of what Talbot calls ‘difference-and-dominance’. She looks at research in two specific genres, storytelling and conversation, and examines the research findings on gender differences in politeness strategies and conversational styles, as well as miscommunication between men and women as ‘cross-cultural’. For example, the research reviewed shows that women tend to focus on rapport and the affective aspect of conversation, while men tend to focus on report and the information function of conversation. In view of these problematic dichotomies, as also argued in Part I of the book, Talbot concludes Part II by considering the theoretical underpinnings underlying these research studies within the ‘difference’ framework, and presenting a critique of Deborah Tannen’s popularizing work on men’s and women’s ‘interactional styles’. She argues that the ‘difference’ approach results in a static conception of distinct male and female identities, reinforces existing stereotypes and contributes to essentialism in the perception of gender. While the critique is for the most part well-argued, Talbot appears to overlook the possibility that the ‘difference’ framework does not necessarily reject the ‘dominance’ view concerning the existence of a patriarchal social order. It would also be useful to point out at some point in the critique that certain interactional styles and discursive practices are stereotypically associated with notions of masculinity and femininity and that these discursive strategies can be employed by both men and women to construct gendered identities.</p>
<p>Moving on smoothly from the emphasis on gender differences in most of the early work reported in Part II, Talbot argues for the need to examine the discursive construction and performance of gender. Part III, ‘Discourse and Gender: Construction and Performance’, presents a critical perspective on language and gender research, and introduces the approach of critical discourse analysis (CDA), which examines how language contributes to social reproduction and social change. CDA places emphasis on gender as performance and conceptualizes the notion of gender as dynamic. According to Talbot, individuals are positioned in a range of positions as social subjects and these ‘subject positions’ are gendered in specific ways. In other words, men and women are discursively constituted as masculine and feminine subjects in and through their actions. As an example of taking a critical perspective, Talbot investigates the discursive construction of maternity. In addition, she examines a number of issues such as the interplay between femininity and consumerism and the constructions of masculinities in the everyday life of young men and in magazines and newspapers. She also presents recent work on gender and language in professional public contexts, media representations of women at work, and language and sexualities. With a selection of illuminating examples from the empirical studies, Talbot shows that the critical approach helps to achieve the objective of exposing power relations and avoiding polarization into ‘men do this, women do that’. Part III ends with an insightful discussion of struggles and resistance in discourse, regarding attempts to eradicate sexism from English, and the notion of ‘political correctness’.</p>
<p>While the book presents the research findings on language and gender in an accessible and engaging manner, one weakness is that most of the empirical studies reviewed in the text are based in Western countries and it would have been better if studies from Asia and Africa could also be discussed. In addition, I would like Talbot to include a short introduction to the use of different approaches to language and gender research, such as conversation analysis and interactional sociolinguistics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Sunderland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Sunderland et al., 2008</xref>), since an understanding of these different approaches would help readers understand the examples provided in the text better.</p>
<p>Aside from the shortcomings just mentioned, <italic>Language and Gender</italic> offers a very good starting point for further exploration of research findings in the field of language and gender. One of the main strengths is that the selection of examples from research studies serves the purpose of illustrating the trends and issues in language and gender research very well. Another strength is that the list of further reading provided at the end of each chapter is very useful for readers who would like to dig deeper in specific areas of research. Taken as a whole, the book is a very solid, cogently argued and highly structured text. It is written in a clear, systematic and accessible manner throughout. Without doubt the book will serve as an excellent textbook for upper undergraduate and postgraduate students. Also, given the wide-ranging and rich content of the book, it would be of interest to researchers who seek to get acquainted with the latest developments in this exciting and vibrant field.</p>
