<sec id="section4-0194599812440666">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Sixty pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of OSAHS presenting between January 2009 and December 2010 were enrolled and randomized to undergo either standard T&amp;A (n = 30) or T&amp;A with pharyngoplasty (n = 30). Surgical cure was defined as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;5 plus OSA-18 health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) score &lt;60. Other outcomes included postsurgical AHI and minimum oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) improvement, changes in OSA-18 scores at 1 month, and postsurgical days to resume normal diet and activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812440666">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three patients from each group did not undergo surgery. Of the 54 patients treated, 8 from the pharyngoplasty group and 2 from the standard group were lost to follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no difference in cure rate between groups (standard 60%, pharyngoplasty 56.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .793). Limiting analysis to those patients with complete data, a higher, but not significantly increased, cure rate with pharyngoplasty was noted (72% vs 89.5%, <italic>P</italic> = .155). Greater OSA-18 improvement (<italic>P</italic> = .036) and greater (although nonsignificant) AHI improvement and earlier return to normal function were noted with pharyngoplasty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812440666">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The addition of pharyngoplasty to traditional adenotonsillectomy did not significantly improve OSAHS cure rates as measured by sleep testing and HRQL, although a nonsignificant increase in cure rate was observed in those who completed the study protocol. An unexpectedly high rate of patient dropout rendered the study statistically underpowered and therefore inconclusive.</p>

<body>
<p>The standard treatment for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A). Elimination or improvement in clinical symptoms is achieved in most patients. However, definitive cure is not always achieved. This is evident as a large percentage of adult patients presenting with OSAHS have undergone T&amp;A as a child. In addition, in studies focusing on pediatric T&amp;A, polysomnography (PSG) results rather than clinical symptoms alone show a cure rate of 54% to 66%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812440666">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The discrepancy in these findings is due to the absence of a standard definition of cure, which varies from an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 0 to an AHI &lt;5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440666">2</xref></sup> In a meta-analysis including data from 1079 subjects, when cure was defined per each individual study, the overall treatment success of T&amp;A was found to be 66.3%. When cure was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;1, the success rate was 59.8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812440666">1</xref></sup> This inconsistency exists as many of the criteria for defining OSAHS are either based on consensus or taken from studies with small numbers or outdated technology. As such, the sensitivity and specificity of many of the sleep study indices as they apply to the pediatric population have never been calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812440666">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>While various studies have examined the effect of variations in T&amp;A technique on postoperative pain, few studies analyzing their effect on OSAHS cure rate have been published. In a 2004 study by Guilleminault et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440666">4</xref></sup> that compared treatment modalities for OSAHS in pediatric patients, closure of the tonsillar pillars (pharyngoplasty) following T&amp;A was reported to result in complete resolution of symptoms and polysomnographic findings in 100% of patients.</p>
<p>The goal of this study is to compare simple T&amp;A to T&amp;A with pillar closure in a pediatric population. The outcome measures studied will be surgical cure, change in AHI, change in OSA-18 questionnaire score, and postoperative pain control as it relates to return to normal diet and activity. We hypothesize that pillar closure will result in a higher cure rate, greater AHI improvement, decreased pain, and quicker return to normal function than nonclosure.</p>

<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<sec id="section8-0194599812440666">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A prospective randomized, single-blind, controlled study of pediatric patients scheduled for T&amp;A for the treatment of OSAHS was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that closure of the tonsillar pillars improves the OSAHS cure rate and functional recovery compared with standard T&amp;A. The study was conducted at 1 site (Advanced Center for Specialty Care, Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois) from December 2009 to December 2010 and was approved by the Advocate Health Care Institutional Review Board (Park Ridge, Illinois). Informed consent was provided by the legal guardians of all study participants, and assent to treatment was provided by patients when appropriate.</p>
<p>The decision to offer T&amp;A was made on the basis of a clinical history of snoring, irregular breathing, and restless sleep and a physical examination showing obstructive hyperplasia of the palatine tonsils and adenoid tissue. Baseline demographic data for all patients (age, sex, body mass index [BMI] percentile-for-age), tonsillar size (1-4), and adenoid size (percentage obstruction of choana on nasal endoscopy) were recorded at the initial visit, and all patients and/or guardians filled out a quality of life questionnaire (OSA-18).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440666">5</xref></sup> Patients planned for surgery were given the option of participating in the study. All participants in the study were scheduled for preoperative polysomnographic testing, either at a Pediatric Sleep Laboratory (scoring of sleep indices per American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2007 pediatric guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440666">2</xref></sup>) or using an Itamar Watch-PAT200 home sleep test system (sleep indices calculated using peripheral arterial tonometry have been validated against polysomnographic findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812440666">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812440666"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812440666"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812440666">16</xref></sup>). The decision to proceed with surgical treatment was not affected by study participation. Patients and caregivers were blinded to PSG results. There were no instances of negative PSG findings necessitating the abandonment of proposed surgery.</p>
<p>At the time of enrollment in the study (but prior to scheduling a date for surgery), eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo either standard T&amp;A (group 1) or T&amp;A with closure of the tonsillar pillars (group 2). A total sample size of 60 patients was predetermined, and numbers 1 to 60 were assigned to group 1 or 2 by a statistician using a computerized random-number generator. Sequential sealed envelopes containing group assignment were opened by the treating physician in the order that patients were enrolled. For the purposes of informed consent, both procedures were explained in detail to all patients/guardians, who were then blinded as to which technique was to be used.</p>
<p>Patients/guardians were asked to document the number of days following surgery that return to normal diet and return to normal activity were achieved. Posttreatment PSG (using the same mode of testing as prior to surgery for each patient to ensure validity of results) was repeated between 1 and 6 months. This time window for completion of a postoperative study was instituted to maintain uniformity of testing while allowing adequate recovery time following surgery. Repeat OSA-18 and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires were collected at 1 month following surgery (either at the follow-up clinic visit or over the phone). The short follow-up time in this study was intended to maintain contact with as many patients as possible. Patient blinding was strictly maintained until completion of the study protocol.</p>

<title>Quality-of-Life Questionnaires</title>
<p>Quality of life was assessed with the pediatric OSA-18 questionnaire, an 18-item survey with proven test-retest reliability, construct validity, and internal consistency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440666">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812440666">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812440666">18</xref></sup> This survey features questions spread across 5 categories (sleep disturbance, physical symptoms, emotional distress, daytime function, caregiver concerns). Questions are scored 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 7 (<italic>persistently</italic>) based on the frequency of symptoms. The maximum score is 126. Scores of less than 60 suggest a small impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL), scores between 60 and 80 suggest a moderate impact, and scores greater than 80 suggest a large impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440666">5</xref></sup> The version of this survey used in our practice also features a VAS rating the patient’s overall quality of life (0 = <italic>poorest</italic>, 10 = <italic>best</italic>), to be completed by the patient’s parents/guardian.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812440666">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Cold steel technique was used for T&amp;A. Hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery. At this point, the pharyngoplasty group underwent closure of their tonsillar pillars. Approximation of the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars was accomplished in 2 layers: primary submucosal closure followed by second-layer mucosal closure with 3.0 chromic suture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812440666">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>The primary outcome for this study was the rate of cure following T&amp;A with or without pillar closure. This was defined as achievement of postoperative AHI &lt;5 plus an OSA-18 score &lt;60. This definition has not been validated. Symptomatic HRQL parameters were included in the definition of cure in addition to PSG findings, as the decision to proceed with surgery was not based on PSG findings.</p>
<p>Secondary outcomes included absolute and percentage AHI reduction, improvement in minimum oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), absolute and percentage OSA-18 score reduction, absolute and percentage VAS improvement, days to return to normal diet, and days to return to normal activity compared between the treatment groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812440666">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome of cure, using results from the only previous study assessing cure rates between these variations in T&amp;A technique (Guilleminault et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440666">4</xref></sup>). Cure rates in this study were reported as 100% with pharyngoplasty versus 60% with standard T&amp;A, although the definition of “cure” was unclear (described as the resolution of all symptoms and PSG findings). Using setting α = .05 and 80% power, while considering a 10% dropout rate, a projected enrollment of 60 patients (30 standard T&amp;A, 30 T&amp;A with closure) was considered an adequate sample size to detect a significant difference in the cure rate if such a difference exists.</p>
<p>An intention-to-treat analysis was used, and patients were analyzed according to their randomized groups. Two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests (2-tailed) were used as a conservative method of comparing preoperative to postoperative changes in secondary outcomes between groups and to reject the null hypothesis. Student’s <italic>t</italic> test (2-tailed) was used to compare preoperative and postoperative mean values within each group and to reject the null hypothesis. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to test the association between categorical variables, including primary outcome cure between treatment groups. All continuous data are displayed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance is accepted when <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-0194599812440666" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>One-hundred fifty patients were evaluated. Of these, 60 meeting inclusion criteria agreed to participate in the study, completed baseline PSG and OSA-18, and were randomized to treatment groups. Three patients from each group withdrew from the study prior to surgery. The remaining 27 patients from each group underwent surgery. A further 2 patients from the standard T&amp;A group and 8 patients from the pillar closure group either could not be contacted or refused to complete postoperative PSG testing within 6 months of surgery, leaving 25 patients in the standard group and 19 patients in the closure group with complete postoperative data for analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812440666"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> displays a flow diagram of patient progress through this trial.</p>

<p>An intention-to-treat analysis looking at surgical success was performed for all 60 patients who were randomized to treatment. Patients who withdrew prior to surgery and those who had surgery but failed to complete the study follow-up protocol were considered treatment failures and analyzed accordingly. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812440666"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> displays the results of this analysis. No difference in cure is seen between the treatment groups (<italic>P</italic> = .793). No significant differences were found in the demographics of the 10 patients (8 closure, 2 standard T&amp;A) without postoperative PSG data compared with those of the remaining study participants. When a worst-case scenario sensitivity analysis was conducted that treated those with missing PSG data in the closure group as failures (n = 8) and those in the standard group as successes (n = 2), there remains no statistically significant difference in the cure rate (<italic>P</italic> = .425). If we choose to limit our analysis to only those patients with complete follow-up data, cure rates of 18/25 (72.0%) for standard T&amp;A and 17/19 (89.5%) for pillar closure are found; however, this difference also fails to reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .155).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to compare standard T&amp;A to T&amp;A with pharyngoplasty for the treatment of OSAHS in the pediatric population. The basis for this study is a report published by Guilleminault et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440666">4</xref></sup> which indicated that pharyngoplasty resulted in complete resolution of OSA symptoms and absence of PSG findings in all patients treated. However, the results of this study are somewhat ambiguous, with the number of patients receiving pharyngoplasty reported separately as either 4 or 155. To date, this represents one of the only studies to describe the effect of pharyngoplasty on OSAHS outcomes. The reported value of 100% cure rate with this procedure is significantly higher than that seen for standard T&amp;A in a previous meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812440666">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, in a subsequent prospective study by Guilleminault et al in which 207 children underwent T&amp;A, 47% of patients had residual PSG abnormalities and 49% remained symptomatic following surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812440666">19</xref></sup> Given this discrepancy, we felt this interesting clinical question could be best addressed through a prospective study.</p>
<p>When examining cure rates following surgery, our results are limited on a number of fronts. The first is the high rate of dropout in both arms of our study and the need to adhere to an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis that considers all dropouts to be treatment failures. While the statistical power of our analysis remains unchanged in this instance, the validity of our results may be undermined. When adhering to ITT analysis, cure rates for both interventions approximate those reported in the recent meta-analysis. The performance of a worst-case scenario ITT analysis showed that the high rate of patient dropout was not biasing our results in favor of pharyngoplasty. Moreover, in a condition such as OSAHS, failure or refusal to adhere to the follow-up testing protocol is unlikely to be the result of a negative treatment outcome in all cases. If we consider only those patients for whom we have complete data, a higher rate of cure is seen in the pharyngoplasty group, although this finding again lacks statistical significance. Further studies looking at larger patient groups, preferably from multiple centers, are warranted to better answer this question. Such studies might also consider further refinement of inclusion criteria to include only patients with documented OSAHS and confirmation of obstruction at the oropharynx with Cine magnetic resonance imaging or fiber-optic endoscopy and the exclusion of patients with very high BMI.</p>
<p>A further limitation is the lack of a validated definition of cure. Given that the diagnosis of OSAHS and decision to proceed with surgical treatment were not made on the basis of PSG findings, we felt that defining cure on the basis of PSG outcomes alone would be inappropriate. As such, our definition of cure included a postoperative OSA-18 (HRQL) score of &lt;60 as an additional requirement, as scores below this level have been previously defined as representing minimal impact on HRQL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440666">5</xref></sup> Definitions of cure based on PSG and OSA-18 criteria alone were also assessed but did not alter the study outcome.</p>
<p>The window in which postoperative PSG testing was conducted is very wide in our study. This has the potential to introduce noise into our data given that both objective and subjective outcomes may have changed over time. Although 2 different modes of sleep testing were employed (primarily because of restriction of resources), internal validity was maintained as much as possible by ensuring patients were tested in the same way preoperatively and postoperatively.</p>
<p>While few previous studies have examined the effect of tonsillar pillar closure on OSAHS outcomes, multiple studies have compared this procedure to standard T&amp;A with regard to postoperative pain and morbidity. Ramjettan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812440666">20</xref></sup> compared 20 patients with standard T&amp;A (including 15 children) to 20 patients with pillar closure (including 17 children) and found no difference in immediate postoperative pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812440666">20</xref></sup> In a study by Sendi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812440666">21</xref></sup> in which 1 pillar was sutured and 1 was not (single-subject design), at 6 hours, 18 of 30 patients aged 7 to 16 years had reduced pain, 6 had increased pain, and 6 had equivalent pain on the side of the suture. These observed differences were not found to be statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812440666">21</xref></sup> Conversely, in a study by Genç et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812440666">22</xref></sup> tonsillar coverage with palatopharyngeus mucosa led to reduced levels of pain and increased healing at the sutured site between the 3rd and 10th postoperative days. However, localized edema was also increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812440666">22</xref></sup> While we did not look directly at postoperative pain or medication usage in the current study, we found no statistically significant difference in the number of days to return to normal diet or activity between treatment groups.</p>
<p>Sample size determination in the current study was performed in such a way that an overall dropout rate of 10% could be tolerated. However, dropout rates of 36.7% in the pillar closure group and 16.7% in the standard T&amp;A group were seen. While greater improvements in AHI and fewer days to resume normal function were seen in our pharyngoplasty group, these results were not statistically significant. It is interesting that OSA-18 improvement alone was significantly better with pharyngoplasty compared with standard T&amp;A. It is possible that this greater improvement is related to that group’s higher mean baseline OSA-18 score, although this hypothesis would be difficult to prove without further study. AHI improvement with pharyngoplasty is a more easily quantifiable and possibly more meaningful outcome than OSAHS “cure” rate and as such should be the primary outcome of interest in future studies of this technique. As it stands, the results of the current study are inconclusive; however, they have value as an exploratory data set on which further hypothesis-driven clinical trials could be built.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We did not demonstrate a statistically significant change in cure rate by modifying the T&amp;A procedure to include pharyngeal closure through approximation of the tonsillar pillars. However, data from the subgroup of patients who completed the study showed an improved cure rate with closure, although this finding lacked statistical significance. Further studies are warranted to explore this question.</p>
