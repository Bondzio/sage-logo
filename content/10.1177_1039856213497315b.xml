<p>The death of Bruce Henry Peterson on 24 April 2013 robbed the College of the last surviving member of the committee which set up The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.</p>
<p>Bruce was born to Stanley Robert Peterson, an accountant with the Federal Land Tax Department and Ruth Evelyn Peterson (nee Whiteman) on 21 September 2018. The family initially moved from Sydney to Melbourne and returned to Sydney in 1926, living in Burwood and later in Strathfield. Bruce attended Burwood Public School then Fort Street Boys High School before being sent to board at Wolaroi College in Orange. He was School Captain and played in the first XV rugby union team. While at Wolaroi he was friendly with Howard and George Speirs, and through them met their sister, Dorothy, who was later to become his wife.</p>
<p>He then studied Medicine at the University of Sydney, graduating with Honours in 1941. After his residency at Sydney Hospital he was commissioned as Army Captain, married Dorothy in July 1942, before serving in the AIF in New Guinea from 1942–1945 where he was mentioned in dispatches and won the Military Cross (MC). During his service there he was thrilled to hear of the birth of his daughter, Ruth, but later contracted malaria and was briefly hospitalised. During this time he became concerned about the “fear states” in the men, calling them NYDN’s, “not yet diagnosed neuroses”, now known as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This is where his interest in psychiatry began.</p>
<p>When he returned to Sydney he worked at the 113<sup>th</sup> General Hospital (now Concord Repatriation General Hospital), treating wounded servicemen and prisoners of war. After discharge from the Army in 1946, Bruce worked as a GP at Emmaville in Northern NSW for 3 years.</p>
<p>He decided to follow a career in psychiatry, and in 1949 joined the NSW Division of Mental Hygiene and trained in Orange, Parramatta and Gladesville Psychiatric hospitals, qualifying with a Sydney University DPM in 1952. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Medical Superintendent at Morisset Hospital for 1953–1954. Bruce then left to start his private practice in Burwood and Macquarie Street until his retirement in 1988.</p>
<p>The Peterson family flourished with the birth of another two daughters, Joy and Katie, and the family acquired a dog, Scottie, which Bruce enjoyed washing with his children. Music was an important part of family life, and they also enjoyed wonderful caravan holidays down the south coast, walks in the Blue Mountains and cruising around the harbour and Hawkesbury, often with the grandchildren. Being a man of a committed Christian faith, Bruce was heavily involved in his Church and became a lay preacher and psychiatric adviser to the Wesley Central Mission. He believed in the prayer of ‘Generous God, may I be generous in all my relationships with people’ and practised it.</p>
<p>Dr Peterson held many appointments, being Honorary Psychiatrist at Sydney Hospital, Consultant at Waddell House Private Hospital, Clinical Lecturer at the University of Sydney, Convenor of the Clergy–Doctor Committee of NSW and editor of the <italic>Australian Journal of Sex, Marriage and Family</italic> and started a small Christianity and Psychiatry group which met bimonthly.</p>
<p>He was passionate about his involvement in the Father and Son Movement, holding the position of State President through to the change of name to the Family Life Movement, and was the first National Chairman. He was presented with the Harvey Sutton Family Life Award in 1984. This movement is now called Interrelate.</p>
<p>Dr Peterson was a respected member of the Australasian Association of Psychiatrists and was chosen in 1962 to be in the committee which included Dr John (Jack) Donald Russell (1903–1994), Dr Ian Gordon Simpson (1919–1976) and Professor David Clarkson Maddison (1927–1981) to set up and incorporate the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, thus becoming a Foundation Member and Treasurer (1963–1970) and later President (1971–1972). The Royal warrant to the College was given in 1978. He was on the College Ethics Committee for many years. In 1990 Dr Peterson was given the College’s Medal of Honour, the citation for which said “Dr Peterson has served this College with distinction, wisdom and quiet, gentle, selfless dedication which has earned him the highest esteem and respect of his colleagues …” In the same year he was awarded the Membership of the Order of Australia (AM) for “service to medicine, especially in the field of psychiatry and the community”.</p>
<p>After some precious years of retirement he devoted himself to caring for Dorothy (blind, deaf, Alzheimer’s disease) and running the household, enabling them to continue living at home until 2011. This all changed when he fell and broke his hip. The hip replacement was successful but Bruce was unable to regain his mobility, so both he and Dorothy moved to Windsong Aged Care Facility where Dorothy died soon after.</p>
<p>Bruce was a good husband and father and one who served his God, his country, his College and his patients well.</p>
