<p>What a whirlwind year this has been! My term as your 2012 president is drawing to a close, and I want to take the opportunity to thank you for this incredible experience. It has been phenomenal and something I will treasure and remember as the highlight of my career. I have to say that this year would not have been possible without the understanding and support of my husband, my kids, my dean, and the incredible team of faculty and staff at the Urbana regional program of the UIC College of Nursing. They stood behind me all year long, holding me up and cheering me on. My deepest thanks go to all of them.</p>
<p>As I reflect on the past year, I know we have made incredible strides, but the beauty of who we are as a discipline leaves us with much to be accomplished. I have been busier this year than I ever imagined. Funny, but no matter how well prepared you think you are for this role, life can always throw unexpected curves at you. My major challenge came at the start of the year with the resignation of our CEO. AADE is at an incredible point in its history, and our board knew how important it was to keep our momentum going. With this sense of urgency in mind, I went into overdrive and appointed the search committee. This incredible group of diabetes educators (Donna Tomky, Tami Ross, Joan Bardsley, Jan Pearson, Charlotte Hayes, and Deb Fillman) worked tirelessly with me to identify and hire a search firm, interview and hire an interim CEO, conduct a national search, interview several well-qualified candidates, and finally present the final candidate to the board. The process took about 180 days, exactly what search firms predict for a search at this level. What an experience! As you know, Chuck Macfarlane began his tenure as our CEO on September 4. Without doubt, all of us on the Board of Directors are convinced that he is the best person to lead us into the next phase of our development.</p>
<p>While the search consumed a great deal of my time, the work of the association never stopped. For this, I have to offer my deepest appreciation to a world-class staff. We gathered on Capitol Hill in April to lobby our federal legislators for direct reimbursement for qualified diabetes educators. While our House and Senate bills were not passed this time, we garnered more support and will absolutely reintroduce them in the next legislative session. We witnessed history when licensure for diabetes educators was signed into law in Kentucky, and we are actively pursuing licensure in several other states. We held 5 regional meetings across the country and are planning locations for 2013. In follow-up of our 2011 Workforce Analysis, we hosted a summit meeting with key thought leaders to actively discuss next steps. And our committees and work groups are creating position statements, determining research trajectories, and reviewing, revising, and possibly consolidating our key practice documents.</p>
<p>At the board and staff level, we completed a strategic plan to carry us through the next 3 years. As I write this, we are setting tactics and developing the 2013 budget to present to the board at our November meeting in Chicago. We are setting some broad, audacious goals, but I think we have the wherewithal to accomplish what we set out to do. Our staff are never idle. They are actively supporting My AADE Network, working with coordinating body leadership and our communities of interest. They are planning for and hosting webinars, Core Concepts courses, and, of course, the annual meeting, which we all use to stay current in our field. They are also seeking grant funding, writing proposals, and occasionally enjoying incredible success. Along with her team, our chief science and practice officer was awarded a $1.2 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this fall. This, along with so many other factors, demonstrates how well respected our association and, by extension, all diabetes educators have become.</p>
<p>Certainly, we diabetes educators have a renewed sense of purpose. With the continued explosion of diabetes and prediabetes in the United States and throughout the world, diabetes educators must be included as key members of the health care team. It is difficult to push for this when our discipline is not even listed as a profession by the Bureau of Labor. Our ongoing challenge will be to continue to demonstrate to others who we are and what we can accomplish, both for our patients and for the health care system. It won’t be easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is.</p>
<p>Many of you heard my call to arms at our 2012 annual meeting. It is important to advocate for diabetes education. Far too many people do not understand who we are or what we do. Use your voice. Talk with your local legislators and encourage your patients to do the same. Don’t wait for someone else to take the lead. Spread the word about the impact of diabetes education and support. Encourage other health care professionals to specialize in diabetes education. We need more educators in the field! And finally, do your best to support AADE. With your help, we can continue to grow and strengthen the specialty of diabetes education.</p>
<p>With a bit of reluctance and great good wishes, I will hand over the reins to Tami Ross and your new Board of Directors on January 1. I am absolutely sure that under their direction, our association will continue to thrive. Thanks for the memories!</p>
