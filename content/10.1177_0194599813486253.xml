<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>This was a retrospective cohort study of 800 cases of adenotonsillectomy. Two cohorts of patients were identified based on whether or not FloSeal was used intraoperatively during the completion of the monopolar dissection adenotonsillectomy. Outcomes that were measured included: (1) age, (2) sex, (3) diagnosis, (4) primary hemorrhage, (5) secondary hemorrhage, (6) return to operating room, and (7) dehydration.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Age and gender were similar between the 2 groups. Chronic tonsillitis was the primary indication more often in the control group; this was statistically significant. Primary hemorrhage occurred in 1 subject from each group (0.28%); secondary hemorrhage occurred in 11 subjects from the FloSeal group (3.22%) and 7 from the control group (1.87%). Both outcomes were not statistically different between the 2 groups. Return to operating room showed no statistically significant difference between groups. The need for postoperative admission for dehydration failed to show statistical significance between groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our experience, the application of FloSeal hemostatic matrix after monopolar adenotonsillectomy demonstrates no additional reduction in postoperative adverse events encountered in the pediatric population.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy is a very common pediatric surgical procedure to relieve upper airway obstruction and recurrent tonsillitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813486253">1</xref></sup> The most feared postoperative complication is early or delayed bleeding, which may require additional surgical intervention and is the leading cause of litigation with adenotonsillectomy second only to burn injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813486253">2</xref></sup> Postoperative hemorrhage can be divided into primary and secondary. The incidence of these complications has recently been reported to range between 0.3% and 2.1% as primary bleed rates and 2% to 10.3% for secondary events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813486253">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813486253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486253">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the vast array of surgical dissection and hemostasis methods available, postoperative hemorrhage continues to be a potentially catastrophic complication after tonsillectomy. Cold-steel dissection followed by suture ligature has been shown to result in lower complication rates compared to hot dissection techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486253">6</xref></sup> However, variable degrees of electrocautery may still be required in cases of cold steel dissection when bleeding is refractory to conservative measures, including pressure and ties. The use of hemostatic agents in reducing postoperative hemorrhage has also been studied, including the benefit of FloSeal hemostatic matrix application with cold dissection techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813486253">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813486253">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813486253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813486253">11</xref></sup> Whereas results have shown a general reduction in postoperative pain and morbidity with this agent, empirical data are lacking regarding whether FloSeal actually improves wound healing and decreases other complications. Moreover, the potential additive value of FloSeal in conjunction with monopolar cautery dissection has not been investigated to our knowledge. Therefore the purpose of this study was to compare postoperative complications associated with adenotonsillectomy with and without the application of FloSeal at the completion of the procedure, specifically, primary hemorrhage, secondary hemorrhage, dehydration, and return to operating room.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0194599813486253">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This retrospective cohort study was performed at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan between 2007 and 2008. Two specific cohorts of patients who underwent tonsillectomy, with adenoidectomy, were compared relative to postoperative bleed rates and other complications. Prior to data collection, Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the Detroit Medical Center and Wayne State University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599813486253">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Current procedural terminology (CPT) code analysis was conducted to identify study participants who underwent tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy during this defined time period. In order to prevent confounding variables, only patients who underwent dissection with monopolar needlepoint cautery (Valleylab Electrosurgery Products) at a setting of 15 watts, followed by hemostasis with suction cautery at a setting of 25 watts, were included. The remaining inclusion criteria were an age of 1 to 18 years old and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea symptoms or recurrent tonsillitis. Patients were excluded from the study if (1) dissection by means other than needle point monopolar cautery was used, (2) any additional means of hemostasis was used, or (3) they suffered a history of bleeding diathesis. Two cohorts of patients were established from the chart reviews: In 1 subgroup (experimental) FloSeal was utilized at the completion of surgery with the goal of reducing postoperative bleeding; in the other subgroup (control) FloSeal was not used. Two senior pediatric otolaryngologists were the supervising surgeons for all study participants.</p>
<p>The following were extracted from the chart reviews: procedure performed, whether or not FloSeal was applied, primary bleed, secondary bleed, dehydration, return to operating theatre, diagnosis, age, and gender. Procedure was defined as either tonsillectomy alone or tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy. FloSeal use was defined as yes or no based on the operative report. Primary bleed rate was defined as bleeding that occurred within the first 24 hours following surgery. Secondary bleeding was defined as bleeding that occurred after 24 hours following surgery. Dehydration was determined by the return to the emergency department for poor oral intake within 2 weeks of surgery. Return to operating room was defined as the need to control hemorrhage under general anesthesia. The primary outcome measured is primary hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes include: secondary hemorrhage, dehydration, and return to operating room.</p>
<p>Recurrent tonsillitis was defined as per the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery guidelines. Obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed based on polysomnography as well as when parents gave a history of apnea and obstructive breathing patterns during sleep.</p>
<p>All procedures were performed under general anesthesia in the hospital setting. Anesthesia services were conducted in a similar manner in all cases. Adenoidectomy was performed with an adenoid curette and packed. Tonsillectomy was then performed with needle point monopolar cautery at a setting of 15 watts. Next, hemostasis was obtained with suction monopolar cautery at a setting of 25 watts. Surgical sites were copiously irrigated with normal saline and followed by 5 minutes of jaw relaxation where the MacIvor mouth gag was removed and the patient’s neck was put into neutral position. All cases were conducted in identical manner up to this point. The control group was turned over to anesthesia for transport to the post-anesthesia care unit. The experimental group had FloSeal hemostatic matrix applied to the tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy sites and held in place with moist tonsil sponges for 60 seconds prior to transfer to the post-anesthesia care unit.</p>
<p>To ensure data reliability, all chart reviews were performed independently by 4 data collectors who did not perform any of the operations. To demonstrate intrarater reliability, 10% of the charts were reanalyzed 1 month later by the same data collector. Interrater reliability was accounted for by reanalyzing 10% of the charts by a different data collector, thus allowing us to measure the degree to which they agreed with themselves and the 3 other reviewers on all chart ratings. There were no incongruent findings among data collectors. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813486253"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All binomial outcomes measured were subjected to chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests to determine the significance of the difference between the 2-study surgical groups (with or without FloSeal) on each of the dichotomous measures described previously. <italic>P</italic> value of .05 was employed as the threshold significance level for each comparative measurement.</p>
<p>Power is based on the analysis of a contingency table goodness-of-fit test (χ<sup>2</sup>). Using a small effect size (.20) and a sample size of 358 per group, adequate power is available (.81) to identify significant differences in cell proportion between the 2 study groups (individuals who received intraoperative FloSeal, as adjuvant therapy, vs individuals who did not). For these comparisons we are assuming a sample size of n = 358 per group, which is based on 2 equal subsets from the 716 tonsillectomy procedures during the defined time period. SPSS version 20.0 was used to determine power analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 800 patients initially identified as prospective study participants, only 27 (3.4%) underwent tonsillectomy alone. Two (0.3%) patients were discovered to have been coded incorrectly and had undergone adenoidectomy alone. These 29 patients were excluded from participation, rendering the sample pool to 771 subjects. One of the surgeon investigators performed adenotonsillectomy in 382 (49.5%) subjects, using FloSeal in all but 41 (10.7%) cases. The second surgeon investigator performed adenotonsillectomy in 389 (50.5%) subjects and used FloSeal in only 15 (3.9%) cases. In order to prevent surgeon selection bias, these exceptions were not included in final data analyses. Resulting in a final cohort number of 716 subjects, 342 underwent adenotonsillectomy and received FloSeal by a single surgeon (FS), and 374 underwent adenotonsillectomy and did not receive FloSeal by a single surgeon (NFS), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813486253"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>.</p>

<p>The ages of all subjects ranged from 1 to 18 years, with no significant difference between the 2 cohort groups. Gender was evaluated for both groups with a slight male predominance (χ<sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>P</italic> = .93). Demographic characteristics are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813486253"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>
<p>As previously noted, the preoperative diagnostic inclusion criteria were obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent tonsillitis. The former condition was determined in 572 (79.9%) subjects and the latter diagnosis was revealed in 144 (20.1%) subjects. In the former cohort pool 248 subjects were treated with FloSeal and 274 were not. This was not a significant difference. However, there was a significant difference within the recurrent tonsillitis group, wherein 44 subjects had FloSeal application and 100 did not (χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.40, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Primary bleed rate was analyzed on the entire cohort and found to occur in 2 (0.3%) subjects, 1 from the FloSeal subgroup and 1 from the alternative subgroup. This was not of significance statistically (χ<sup>2</sup> = .004, <italic>P</italic> = .95).</p>
<p>Secondary bleeding occurred in 18 (2.5%) patients from the entire study population, 11 (3.2%) from the FloSeal subgroup and 7 (1.9%) from the alternative subgroup. This difference proved insignificant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.32, <italic>P</italic> = .25). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the overall bleed rate between the 2 study groups.</p>
<p>Hospital admission was required for dehydration and/or pain control in 51 (7.1%) subjects, 24 (7.0%) from the FloSeal subgroup and 27 (7.2%) from the other cohort. This difference was statistically insignificant (χ<sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>P</italic> = .92). At our institution, subjects with an age of less than 3 are electively admitted for observation. When we analyzed postoperative admission in our study of subjects who were over the age of 3 for reasons of pain and poor hydration, we found that 19 (7.6%) from the FloSeal subgroup and 9 (2.9%) from the non-FloSeal subgroup were admitted. This was found to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>The need for return to the operating theatre was required for 7 (1.0%) subjects, 5 (1.5%) from the FloSeal group and 2 (0.5%) from the other group. These results were not significantly different (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.59, <italic>P</italic> = .21). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813486253"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> illustrates all of these contrasting group differences.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tonsillectomy was first described by Celsius in 10 AD and has understandably seen many advances since that time. In the 1950s and 1960s, over 1 million tonsillectomies were performed each year, and currently approximately 250,000 such procedures are performed yearly in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813486253">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813486253">7</xref></sup> Surgeons have utilized a variety of techniques in an attempt to develop the most optimal methods and outcomes. Techniques such as cold dissection, laser, coblation, plasma knife, monopolar cautery, bipolar cautery, and harmonic scalpel have all been employed for such purposes. Additionally, a plethora of different methods for hemostasis have been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813486253">1</xref></sup> These include monopolar cautery, bipolar cautery, suture ligature, cross clamping, and absorbable hemostatic agents, such as FloSeal and other topical agents. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate and compare adverse postoperative outcomes, the most significant of which is postoperative hemorrhage. Recently published data have revealed primary bleed rates ranging from 0.3% to 2.1% and secondary bleed rates ranging from 2% to 10.3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813486253">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813486253">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A large study examined outcomes of data from 33,921 tonsillectomies performed between 2003 and 2004. This analysis included factors such as the surgical techniques employed and the associated postoperative bleed rates. Cold steel dissection followed by ties/packs for hemostasis had the lowest postoperative bleed rate at 1.7%, while all diathermy techniques had increased incidence of postoperative bleed rates varying from 2.7% to 6.6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486253">6</xref></sup> Note that these data involve results for tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy in all age groups. In the under 5 age group, the bleeding rate was relatively low at 1.9% and return to operating theatre rate of 0.8%. For the 5 to 15 age group the bleeding rate was 3% with a return to operating theatre rate of 0.8%. In adults, the rate approximated 5%, with a return to operating theatre rate of 1.2 %.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486253">6</xref></sup> This is consistent with our data, which showed a total of 20 (2.79%) subjects who experienced postoperative hemorrhage. Another large retrospective study of more than 6000 tonsillectomy procedures performed by cold dissection showed a 2.94% postoperative bleed rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813486253">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813486253">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813486253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813486253">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of FloSeal hemostatic matrix in adenotonsillectomy has been studied previously and has shown promising results in achieving hemostasis when compared to electrocautery. These studies suggest FloSeal to reduce operative time, decrease intraoperative blood loss, facilitate return to regular diet quicker, and decrease postoperative pain scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813486253">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813486253">15</xref></sup> The use of FloSeal for accomplishing hemostasis in adenotonsillectomy was previously studied at our institution. The unpublished data from Bae and Haupert failed to show a statistically significant difference between FloSeal versus electrocautery when examining postoperative bleed rates in children.</p>
<p>FloSeal is a hemostatic agent composed of semihydrated gelatin particles that are reconstituted with 5000 units of human-derived thrombin solution immediately prior to use. As blood passes through the particles, the thrombin converts the patient’s native fibrinogen to fibrin polymer, and the resulting clot is a FloSeal-fibrin matrix composite clot that seals the bleeding site. Thus, according to the manufacturer instructions, it is indicated in the treatment of diffuse oozing as well as active bleeding problems. FloSeal is absorbed by the body in 6 to 8 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813486253">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>At our institution patients are admitted for observation if they are under 3 years of age. We analyzed immediate postoperative admission in our study subjects who were over the age of 3 for reasons of pain and poor hydration and found that 19 (7.6%) from the FloSeal subgroup and 9 (2.9%) from the non-FloSeal subgroup were admitted. This outcome was significant, as those subjects older than 3 years of age who underwent FloSeal treatment were more likely to require postoperative admission for pain. A logistic regression for admission was performed to determine if age and gender influenced postoperative admission. Whereas the use of FloSeal had such predictive value, age and gender did not. It remains unclear to us as to why children treated with FloSeal experienced significantly more pain postoperatively than those who were not treated with this coagulant. This question could be answered in future investigations. When all age groups were analyzed, no statistically significant difference was seen. The 51 (7.1%) subjects who required hospital admission (including those &lt;3 years of age) within 2 weeks postoperatively due to poor oral intake and dehydration were closely studied. This outcome was not consistent with the level of adenotonsillectomy sequelae reported by other clinical researchers, especially with respect to postoperative dehydration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813486253">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813486253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813486253">15</xref></sup> In the previous reports, patients were admitted for pain control and hydration less than 1% of the time. These differences between our findings and the results of other investigations may relate to the young age of our subjects and the fact that we used monopolar cautery. In our subjects, postoperative dehydration occurred equally in both cohort subgroups when all ages were included.</p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea was the more common indication for surgery among both subgroups when compared to recurrent tonsillitis. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea between the 2 subgroups. However, there was a statistically significant finding when comparing recurrent tonsillitis. That is, more subjects within the control group, who did not receive FloSeal, had a preoperative diagnosis of recurrent tonsillitis. Although this factor might be predictive of a potentially higher incidence of postoperative adverse events in the control group, the results demonstrated no such complications. These limitations could be addressed with future investigations.</p>
<p>The incidence of primary and secondary postoperative hemorrhage failed to show a statistically significant difference between 2 study subgroups that underwent adenotonsillectomy. There were a total of 20 cases of postoperative bleeds, 2 primary and 18 secondary. These results are consistent with recent reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813486253">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813486253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813486253">12</xref></sup> In the current data pool, we were unable to demonstrate a significant reduction in secondary postoperative bleed rates. This negative outcome may potentially be due to the fact that the FloSeal matrix is no longer present after the initial 24 hours following its application. However, this would have to be substantiated with data from further investigations. Our findings also failed to produce a significant decrease in primary postoperative hemorrhage in subjects who underwent FloSeal treatment. This outcome was perplexing, as we theorized, a priori, that use of this material would facilitate clot formation and improve hemostasis. It could be argued that standard use of electrocautery in all subjects prior to the application of FloSeal may have prevented the interaction of thrombin and fibrinogen, which normally is required for the topical agent to induce biologic coagulation.</p>
<p>The need to return to the operating room for control of bleeding was experienced in 7 of the 716 subjects (1.0%), which is consistent with previously published data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813486253">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486253">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813486253">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813486253">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813486253">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813486253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813486253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813486253">19</xref></sup> Of these, 5 were from the group with FloSeal treatment and 2 were from the control group. These differences were not statistically significant, though there was a trend toward fewer adverse events in the control group.</p>
<p>The retrospective nature of this research endeavor may lead to some inherent limitations. Subjects were divided into the 2 cohorts based on surgeon preference preoperatively; no intraoperative findings or events determined FloSeal use. All subjects who received FloSeal were treated by the FloSeal surgeon only. All subjects who did not receive FloSeal were treated by the no FloSeal surgeon only, and no overlap was studied. This limitation could be addressed with a future prospective randomized study eliminating preoperative surgeon bias. However, we eliminated the 4% of subjects who received FloSeal from the NFS surgeon to prevent intraoperative selection bias of the surgeon. Similarly, the 10% of subjects who did not receive FloSeal from the FS surgeon were eliminated in order to prevent intraoperative selection bias. We recognize that some adverse postoperative events could have been missed if the subjects were treated at an outside facility or did not seek medical attention. During the 2-year period reviewed, resident- and fellow-level surgeons assisted in operations, which may lead to a slightly higher complication rate. However, the same residents or fellows were assisting in operations for both control and experimental subgroups during the specified time period, which prevents confounding variables between cohorts. This study design compared adverse postoperative outcomes in cohorts who received FloSeal versus no FloSeal after hemostasis was already achieved with monopolar cautery. This method increased our potential for a negative study outcome. Previous studies have compared FloSeal versus monopolar cautery in achieving hemostasis, which was not the objective of the current study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our experience, the application of FloSeal hemostatic matrix after monopolar adenotonsillectomy demonstrates no additional reduction in postoperative adverse events encountered in the pediatric population. Specifically, our data failed to demonstrate statistically significant reduction of: (1) primary hemorrhage, (2) secondary hemorrhage, (3) return to operating theatre, or (4) dehydration. Finally, there was an increase in postoperative admission for pain and dehydration in those subjects who underwent FloSeal application.</p>
