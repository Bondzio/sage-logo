        <p>The contribution of geography education to citizenship education is recognized by
          geography educators. Still, globalization created new territories and new “borders” not
          always easy to cross—but they all exist and coexist giving new meanings to the idea of
          space appropriation. Geographical space has gained all these dimensions and can no longer
          be viewed in terms of its materiality. This article addresses the concept of citizenship
          education for Portuguese geography teachers within the multicultural nature of Portuguese
          society and schools. A final reference is given to the importance of cities as places of
          citizenship education.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The concept of <italic>border</italic> is a key concept in geography. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2158244012471956">Ciattoni (2003)</xref> puts it, “border” is
        an insatiable geographical object. Associated with the concept of territory, the “border” is
        a universal structure, an organizational scheme fundamental to social and human life on
        Earth. The “border” is also a changing geographic reality that can be addressed in so many
        ways and can take many forms: linear, zoned, or simply mental and imaginary.</p>
      <p>In geography, the territory is space appropriated for a certain social group and the
        “border” is the physical or psychological limit of that territory. Globalization created new
        territories and new “borders” not always easy to cross—but they all exist and coexist giving
        new meanings to the idea of space appropriation. Geographical space has gained all these
        dimensions and can no longer be viewed in terms of its materiality.</p>
      <p>Geography education is inevitably connected to these new approaches of territory and its
        limits, as the multicultural dimension of societies has made it impossible to ignore that
        many global issues are now reflected in our countries, regions, cities, and of course in our
        schools. And for a subject specially designed to understanding the relations between nature
        and society and its impacts in our daily lives, the notion of inclusion and exclusion is
        particularly relevant. It is a geographical concern to understand how students can acquire
        knowledge that prepares them to analyze and understand the complex and relevant problems in
        this world of multiple relations.</p>
      <p>This is also a teachers’ concern expressed in many studies done in Portuguese schools. The
        complex world is no longer a distant reality but it is here in our lives and in our
        classrooms. The “borders” geography education addresses are not just national borders or
        European ones but they are increasingly social and physiological. And these are many times
        the most difficult ones to address. Through citizenship education, teachers in general and
        geography teachers in particular try to address many issues related with the need to develop
        critical thinking about complex global issues that are now a reality in their lives.</p>
      <p>Portuguese schools are multicultural territories where sometimes the borders in terms of
        social divisions and the invisible and visible lines between groups are very real and it is
        important to challenge those borders which deny freedoms, rights, and capabilities. This
        article shows that school geography has been trying to “tear down walls” in what concerns
        the understanding of the world. First, we refer to the meaning of “citizenship education.”
        Then, the article focuses on presenting the nature of school diversity and how school
        geography, through teachers’ voices, provides a territorial dimension of analyses important
        in an effective citizenship education and practices.</p>
      <p>This multiscale analysis is important when thinking about citizenship at different levels
        and its impact in human and social development. It allows to analyze problems at local,
        regional, national, and global level and critically analyze its impacts also at different
        levels. The methodology of research consists of documental analyses about recent changes in
        the composition of Portuguese schools, recent changes in school geography, and teachers’
        perceptions regarding citizenship education, using a qualitative paradigm of research.</p>
      <p>It also includes an analysis of which geography contents better adapt to dealing with
        problems of diversity, inclusion, and exclusion, as well as the experiences teachers
        consider more appropriate to debate these issues. The data presented are selected from a
        broader research that intends to prove that many of these approaches can be made at local
        level, or in other words, that cities can be spaces where the benefits and problems of
        globalization can be found and studied and where the notion of territory and border can give
        an important framework to geographical education in Portuguese schools.</p>

      <title>The Meaning of Citizenship Education</title>
      <p>A wide range of terms is used worldwide to denote a form of teaching and learning that in
        some way encourages good citizenship. These include citizenship education, civics, social
        studies, life skills, and moral education. In addition, there are relations with a variety
        of subjects (e.g., history, geography, economics, politics, languages, environmental
        studies, and religious education). Discussion of citizenship education therefore encompasses
        a diverse and complex curriculum area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2158244012471956">Jackson, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Following an analysis of the more than 300 known definitions of democracy associated with
        citizenship education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2158244012471956">David Kerr
          (2003)</xref> identifies a number of linked themes and concepts that are common to
        citizenship education: <disp-quote>
          <p>They include the <italic>themes</italic> of: the <italic>preservation</italic> of
            something, such as democratic society and its associated rights; the notion of
              <italic>participation</italic> in society; the <italic>preparation</italic> or
              <italic>capacity building</italic> of young people for active and informed
            participation; a focus on <italic>inclusion</italic> or <italic>integration</italic>
            into society; a concentration on <italic>contemporary society</italic>, the
            encouragement of <italic>partnerships;</italic> and the <italic>promotion</italic> of an
            international perspective . . . The definition also highlights a number of key
              <italic>concepts</italic> that underpin citizenship education, including
              <italic>democracy, rights, responsibilities, tolerance, respect, equality,
              diversity</italic> and <italic>community</italic> . . . Citizenship education also
            involves the <italic>dimensions</italic> of <italic>knowledge and understanding, skills,
              attitudes and values</italic>. These <italic>dimensions</italic> are brought together
            through teaching and learning approaches, which have the primary goal of shaping and
            changing the attitudes and behaviour of young people through into their adult lives. The
            lifeblood of citizenship education is modern society and discussion of the topical and
            sensitive issues it throws up. Citizenship education enables consideration of these
            issues, often set within an appropriate historical framework, from a range of
            perspectives.” (pp. 7-8, italics added)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Portugal followed the recommendations of the Council of Europe on education for democratic
        citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2158244012471956">Council of Europe,
          2002</xref>). The Council of Europe clearly referred to the fact that it was a
        responsibility of present and future generations to maintain and safeguard democratic
        societies, and that education had an important role in promoting the active participation of
        all individuals in political, civic, social, and cultural life. Thus, education for
        democratic citizenship was very important and should be implemented in all member states. It
        was declared that</p>
      <list id="list1-2158244012471956" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>education for democratic citizenship should be seen as embracing any formal, nonformal
            or informal educational activity, including that of the family, enabling an individual
            to act throughout his or her life as an active and responsible citizen respectful of the
            rights of others;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>education for democratic citizenship should be considered a factor for social cohesion,
            mutual understanding, intercultural and interreligious dialogue, and solidarity, that it
            contributed to promoting the principle of equality between men and women, and that it
            encouraged the establishment of harmonious and peaceful relations within and among
            peoples, as well as the defense and development of democratic society and culture;
            and</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>education for democratic citizenship, in its broadest possible sense, should be at the
            heart of the reform and implementation of educational policies.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Following this and other important recommendations, the Portuguese Ministry of Education
        published in 2006 the “Strategic goals and recommendations for an action plan of Citizenship
        Education” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sitio.dgidc.minedu.pt/cidadania/Documents/FECidadaniaSP.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://sitio.dgidc.minedu.pt/cidadania/Documents/FECidadaniaSP.pdf</ext-link>). It refers
        the need to offer all students a common base of knowledge, attitudes, and values through an
        accurate education for rights and responsibilities in an educational perspective for global
        citizenship that allows the following:</p>
      <list id="list2-2158244012471956" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>contribution to students’ personal and social development based on diversified
            experiences of democratic life;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>students’ development as active members of society able to eliminate the social
            mechanisms that build and reproduce inequality and discrimination, as well as able to
            value diversity as a way of human enrichment; and</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>students’ awareness of their responsibility as members of society, encouraging
            participation, coresponsibility, and compromise in the building as world, where freedom,
            justice, and solidarity really exist.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>This is particularly important when considering the changes Portuguese society has been
        going through in what concerns its multicultural dimension. And of course, schools are an
        expression of these changes, as it will be addressed in the next chapter.</p>

      <title>Multicultural Dimension of Portuguese Schools—Recent Changes</title>
      <p>Portugal was for many centuries a country of emigrants, but recently this situation has
        changed. In the last decades, Portuguese society has been changing as a result of the
        changing times—each year, more and more people from different countries, cultures, and
        religions have been arriving to Portugal in the pursuit of work and a better life. Although
        this situation is not new to Portugal that for many years has received immigrants from PALP
        (Portuguese Speaking African Countries) and Brazil, what makes this phenomena challenging
        has been the arrival of many immigrants from Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>The National Institute of Statistic recorded the following values for immigrants in
        Portugal, in the last decade (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2158244012471956">Table

      <p>Immigration from Eastern European countries is now almost 70% of European immigration. It
        is important not to forget the percentage of immigrants arriving from Central and South
        America, the relative value of which has increased since 2000 (about 12% of the immigration
        total and in 2008 reaching more than 25% of the immigrants arriving in Portugal). These
        immigrants are mainly from Brazil (95% of immigrants originating from South America in 2000
        and 81% in 2008).</p>
      <p>This changing pattern of immigration presents many challenges to both state and society.
        This flow of immigrants to Southern Europe has made the Mediterranean region more complex
        and created many new problems. The nature of immigration since the 1990s is a remarkable mix
        of nationalities and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2158244012471956">Baldwin-Edwards, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>But it is not only society that has had to face these recent changes: The educational
        system has also felt the need to adapt to this new Portuguese reality. School is becoming a
        mix of nationalities and cultures. If society is increasingly multicultural, Portuguese
        schools include, nowadays, a young population of different cultural origins. The school has
        more than ever before an importance in recognizing the multiculturalism of school
        attendants. It is necessary to take in consideration this dimension in such a way that all
        the differences are respected and still school prepares its students to life in society
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2158244012471956">Bernardo, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The integration of migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and minorities in the Portuguese
        education system follows the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and,
        particularly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child36 (Article 2, n.1),
        which is applied independent of the child’s legal status. The national legislation and the
        Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (Articles 13, 15, 73, and 74) bestow rights of equal
        treatment in access to education and teaching, independent of race, language, territory of
        origin, or religion. In these terms, any child (exiled, refugee, or parented by irregular
        immigrants) has a right to education and social service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2158244012471956">Dias, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Portuguese legislation also accommodates the recognition of qualifications held by foreign
        students who may wish to enter the national education system, rendering them equivalent to
        current Portuguese qualification certificates or other diplomas. Applications are analyzed
        by the Ministry of Education according to a table that contemplates 25 countries. A Support
        Office for the Recognition of Qualifications and Competencies is maintained by the ACIME
        (High Commission for Immigration and Ethnic Minorities) for this specific purpose.</p>
      <p>Immigrant, refugee, or asylum-seeker students who enter the Portuguese education system
        benefit from pedagogic support which is both adequate to their situation and compatible with
        the resources available to their new school. The support measure ought to be focused on the
        removal of all that hinders the students’ progress and the creation of specific activities
        for the learning of Portuguese as a second language, whenever they prove necessary. Schools
        should also perform a diagnostic assessment of the pupil, followed of an individual
        educational support plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2158244012471956">Dias,
          2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>According to a Ministry of Education report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2158244012471956">Direcção Geral da Educação [DGIDC], 2005</xref>), Portuguese
        schools were attended by students of 120 nationalities, which have a total of 80 languages
        as their mother tongue. This report intended to characterize the situation of the students
        whose mother tongue is not Portuguese and reached some interesting conclusions:</p>
      <list id="list3-2158244012471956" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>Although students from Angola and Cape Verde are in the top of the countries of origin
            of the students who were not born in Portugal or whose parent’s mother tongue was not
            Portuguese, Brazil and Ukraine are now in third and fourth position, between 2001/2002
            and 2004/2005. The percentage of Brazilian students represented 8.2%, while the
            percentage of Ukrainian students had increased to 8%.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>According to the data of the study, which involved more than 15,000 students, countries
            such as Brazil, Ukraine, France, Moldavia, Germany, and Switzerland had a growing number
            of students in Portuguese schools, while others were in low numbers such as Cape Verde,
            Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé e Príncipe, and India, in what concerns students whose mother
            tongue was not Portuguese.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Among the 80 languages spoken by students at home, the “crioulo” languages spoken in
            PALP countries are the most common, followed by Ukrainian. The majority of the students
            speak Portuguese in school with teachers and peers, but 5% communicates with their peers
            in “crioulo.”</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>There is also a relation between school achievement and nationality. Among the best
            succeeded students, there are nationalities such as Moldavia, Switzerland, Germany,
            Romania, and Ukraine.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>In what concerns the understanding of school subjects, in a scale of four (ranging from
            “good,” “satisfactory,” “not satisfactory,” to “don’t understand anything”) 40.6% of the
            students got a “satisfactory” and 30% reached “good.” Yet, one in each four students
            shows great difficulties in the mastering of Portuguese language and almost 5%
            considered “don’t understand anything” in what the use of Portuguese language is
            concerned.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>In what concerns school achievement, 60% of students whose mother language is not
            Portuguese manages to get a satisfactory level, and the remaining 40% refer in equal
            parts to very good levels of achievement and negative achievement.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The fact that students enter the system without testing for Portuguese language skills has
        given rise to some criticism. In fact, immigrant students are integrated in schools without
        having actually developed the learning skills necessary to cope with the curricula. It was
        exactly this situation that led to the implementation of a program of integration of
        students whose mother tongue was not Portuguese, in 2005, by the Ministry of Education.</p>
      <p>Having presented the situation in terms of nationality and cultural diversity of Portuguese
        schools, it is important to refer how the school system has been trying to overcome all the
        challenges of multicultural schools. If much has been done in terms of educational policy, a
        lot remains in the hands of those who contact directly with students—the teachers. And if in
        some school subjects it is difficult to approach the item of living in a multicultural
        society and school, in school geography this item is an important curricular part of the
        school subject.</p>
      <p>Thus, geography gives an important contribution in terms of discussing these new situations
        which are a reality of Portuguese classrooms. In the following chapter, a study involving
        geography teachers will be presented—It was important to know their views and practices in
        citizenship education; considering Portuguese multicultural school, school geography is even
        more relevant in what concerns dealing with differences in terms of language, culture,
        religion, and other aspects.</p>

      <title>School Geography and Citizenship Education—Recent Approaches in Compulsory
        School</title>
      <p>Due to the growing ethnic, cultural, racial, language, and religious diversity in Europe
        and throughout the world, citizenship education needs to be reviewed to prepare students to
        function effectively in the 21st century. Citizens in this century need the knowledge,
        attitudes, and skills necessary to operate in their cultural communities and beyond their
        cultural borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2158244012471956">Banks,
        2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The role of school has never been so important in helping students to develop, not only
        thoughtful and clarified identifications with their cultural communities and their
        nation-states but also clarified global identifications and deep understanding of their
        roles in the world community. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2158244012471956">DeJaeghere (2009)</xref>, schools should be talking about
        critical citizenship pedagogical approaches that bring coherency to other approaches found
        in different forms of education and apply them to the purposes of citizenship education in
        multicultural societies.</p>
      <p>These approaches are summarized by the author in four main areas:</p>
      <list id="list4-2158244012471956" list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>including marginalized knowledge and voices in the curriculum to allow for the
            construction of alternative forms of citizenship, and seeing this knowledge in relation
            to, and as a critique of, mainstream constructions of citizenship and democracy;</p>

      </list>
      <p>So, how can school geography do its part?</p>
      <p>The International Declaration on Geographical Education for Cultural Diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2158244012471956">International Geographical Union [IGU],
          2000</xref>) considers in its preamble that school geography is committed in the world
        effort to enhance the ability of all citizens to contribute to creating a just, sustainable,
        and pleasant world for all. In fact, the nature of geography education has specificities
        that make this school subject a major contributor in overcoming some of the bias that arise
        in a multicultural society and of course in multicultural school systems.</p>
      <p>In fact, geography education offers foundations for people of the world to develop</p>

      <p>Portuguese National Curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2158244012471956">Department of Basic Education [DEB], 2001</xref>) doesn’t have a specific discipline to
        address citizenship education and so, this task has been attributed to the several
        curriculum subjects. Some guiding lines are presented in terms of what dimensions school
        subjects should address in the formation of a conscientious citizenship:</p>
      <list id="list6-2158244012471956" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>creation and development of a personal and social identity;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>participation in civic life showing responsibility, solidarity, and a critical
            attitude;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>respect and valorization of individual and group diversity in what concerns their

        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>development of an ecological awareness leading to the valorization and preservation of
            the natural and cultural heritage; and</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>valorization of the relational dimension of learning and the ethical principles that
            regulate the relation with knowledge and the others.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>In view of these recent concerns, school geography in Portugal was reorganized in terms of
        contents and competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2158244012471956">DEB,
          2002</xref>). It assumes its vocation in terms of giving a fundamental contribution to
        citizenship education. The concept of the “geographical competent citizen” is introduced and
        defined as “the one that has spatial skills, having the ability to view spatially phenomena,
        interconnecting them, and understand their territorial patterns, use different scales of
        approach, and understand territorial, cultural and individual identity.”</p>
      <p>Considering that the teaching of the subject should be centered in the interpretative
        dimension of several educational experiences and not in the theoretical contents of
        geography, school geography is organized in six broad themes that should be developed in
        compulsory school:</p>
      <list id="list7-2158244012471956" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>The Earth: How to study it and represent it;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Natural environments;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Population and its patterns;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Economical activities;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Development contrasts; and</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Environment and society.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>In each theme, teachers should create learning experiences that allow the development of
        general competences and also specific geography competences: location, knowledge about
        places, and dynamisms of the interrelations among places. So, what does learning geography
        mean?</p>
      <p>According to the International Declaration on Geo-graphical Education for Cultural
        Diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2158244012471956">IGU, 2000</xref>), geography
        plays a major role in identifying cultural diversity of people around the world and their
        potential communality of Earth through the study of place, space, territory, natural
        resources, and people’s livelihoods. In so doing, geography acts as an important “bridge”
        between the physical and social sciences. Geographers have a long history of significant
        contributions to decision making at local, regional, and global scales for a variety of
        issues, including resources management, health, environmental assessment, transportation,
        climate changes, and hazard management. Because humanity’s common concern at the start of
        the 21st century is about its natural and human-created environment, geography’s main
        contribution to the future of the planet now lies in its pedagogical and scientific efforts
        to explicate further our understanding of spatial aspects of the human–nature interface.</p>
      <p>This contribution to the understanding of the world also implies civic education—Through
        geography, students are encouraged to explore and develop knowledge and understanding,
        skills, and attitudes and values. In terms of knowledge and understanding, one of the most
        relevant issues is the diversity of peoples and societies on Earth to appreciate the
        cultural richness of humanity. In terms of skills, students develop the ability to use
        communication, thinking, practical and social competencies to explore geographical topics at
        a range of scales from local to international. And in terms of values, students develop the
        capacity to understand their surroundings and the variety of natural and human
        characteristics on the surface of the Earth as well as learn to respect the rights of
        different social groups.</p>
      <p>School geography in Portugal pursues all these goals, and its educational relevance
        increases when considering diversity issues not only in a regional or national scale but
        also in a local scale, in the classroom, in the school. Geography deals with issues closely
        related to citizenship, multiculturalism, among others. These issues are very important
        nowadays, and geography allows a multidisciplinary and global vision of the world events.
        Even in what concerns globalization, school geography bases its analyses in the
        understanding of other cultures, in intercultural and economic changes, and in changes in
        general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2158244012471956">Cachinho, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the next section, geography teachers share their considerations about these issues and
        explain how geography themes adapt to dealing with aspects of multiculturalism, citizenship
        education, and other important questions. More important, how do geography teachers view
        their roles as citizenship educators through geography in their multicultural classes.</p>

      <title>Geography Teachers Perceptions on Citizenship Education—The Importance of the
        Territorial Dimension</title>
      <p>These data are part of a broader research concerning school geography in Portugal, teachers
        training and concerns, reorganization of the school subject, and the role of geography in
        the national curriculum. About 200 geography teachers participated in this research
        explaining how they have adapted in the last decades to changes in the national curriculum
        in general and in the particular subject they teach—geography.</p>
      <p>The first thing teachers were asked was, considering the main themes of school geography,
        which ones adapt better to allowing approaches related to citizenship education in their
        classrooms. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2158244012471956">Figure 4</xref> shows that
        this is a cross-curricular theme in geography, but there are two themes that presented
        themselves as particularly relevant to this kind of approach. The themes are presented in
        the order they are taught during the last 3 years of compulsory school (at least till 2009,
        because now compulsory school has 3 more years, but that’s another issue).</p>

      <p>It is important to refer that teachers were also asked about the themes that are most
        interesting in developing issues about sustainable development and environmental education,
        but for the purpose of this presentation, we will focus on the themes that most adapt to
        citizenship education issues. The graph shows two main themes for this purpose—“population

      <p>In geography research, some of the findings have already proved the need to approach these
        items within a territorial context. Issues like cultural diversity need a territorial basis
        of analyses which provides different types of learning. One thing is talking about cultural
        diversity in the world, in Europe, in the city, or even in the neighborhood; another is
        approaching these issues in a des-territorialized context (as it is done many times in
        citizenship education).</p>
      <p>Close approaches are more connected to students’ experiences, feelings, and emotions, and
        at this local level of analyses, certain issues can have the effect of challenging students’
        reflections and critical thinking about their own beliefs. The analysis of some phenomena at
        a regional level may also be interesting to develop a wider awareness of cultural issues.
        And making the same study at the global level will certainly give another understanding of
        the cultural diversity issue.</p>
      <p>So, how can teachers manage all these approaches in the geography class? Giving students
        the possibility to range from these different levels of analyses enables them to grow from
        “their own experience”–based perceptions to a wider comprehension of the phenomena. This
        means involving students in problem-based activities, many times arising from their own
        experience. The development of a geographical literacy can be based in memorization of
        isolated geographical facts. Students live in a multidimensional world and become aware of
        it in many contexts. It is the daily relationship with the environment that helps shaping
        knowledge and understanding of space.</p>
      <p>The multicultural dimension of the classrooms can be an important asset for teachers when
        approaching population and diversity issues. And through geography, it is possible to do
        these multiscale analyses to show that oftentimes local issues are a consequence of global
        ones. Or, on the contrary, students may perceive that those global issues have local impacts
        that reflect in their existence and perceptions.</p>
      <p>The most important contribution of geography is, by setting a territory of analyses, with
        its physical or imaginary borders, it is clearer to approach certain issues. When asked
        about the importance of citizenship education, which is a concern for geography teachers,
        many referred to values and attitudes, but the majority considered that these should be
        worked within a context that helped to clarify the questions in discussion. And it was clear
        that some teachers give more importance to a local level of analyses of problems whereas
        others consider that the regional and global dimension can never be forgotten to understand
        the dynamics and interrelations of natural and social issues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2158244012471956">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

        share this common idea of contribution to the integration of students in their communities

      <title>Final Reflections About Urban Geography Contribution to Citizenship Education</title>
      <p>In the previous sections we tried to demonstrate how Portuguese society is more than ever a
        multicultural one, and how it reflects in the complexity of our schools and how it was
        necessary to develop different approaches to help students understand this diversity and
        adapt to it. The particular case of school geography was referred, an example of a school
        subject that has taken the lead in many projects and studies related to citizenship
        education.</p>
      <p>The themes explored by the school subject are particularly relevant in studies about social
        and economical problems of our societies and their impact in the territorial. It was also
        mentioned that it is exactly this possibility of conducting studies at different scales that
        gives geography its importance in terms of approaching issues of human and social
        development. We would like to refer to the importance that urban studies have been gaining
        in specific areas of study of many global issues.</p>
      <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2158244012471956">Cabigon (2008)</xref>,
        understanding the nature of cities in globalization is essential <italic>knowledge</italic>.
        In fact, cities all share common traits (e.g., a market-oriented nature). They also hold a
        potential for dualism (<italic>promise</italic>: wealth, innovation, and social change; and
          <italic>trouble</italic>: prostitution, poverty, crime, and pollution, among many others).
        Cities are very important both globally and <italic>locally</italic>. They are the center of
        trade, commercial establishments, business firms, advanced culture, and technology. They are
        the destinations of immigrants hoping and searching for employment. Cities represent the
        most often used and influential places in the world.</p>
      <p>This means that our success and survival in the world today and tomorrow depends on the
        knowledge we have about cities. Cities are particularly challenging entities to understand.
        Equally important is that they are constantly evolving, impacting on our lives and the lives
        of others. Geographers have always been interested in cities as they sometimes reflect many
        events that happen at a different scale, and reproduce many of the issues that also appear
        at different scales. Being a close reality for Portuguese students, what happens in the city
        may be a good place of study to understand most complex phenomena.</p>
      <p>The importance of the city as the living place of a great part of humanity in the 21st
        century was celebrated in 2010 in the Expo in Shanghai, titled, “Better World Better Life.”
        Urban inequality in the cities always has a social and territorial expression. And these
        inequalities can have serious political repercussions. The UN Report State of the Cities
        2008/2009 clearly refers to the danger of social inequality in the cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2158244012471956">UN-HABITAT, 2008</xref>):</p>
      <list id="list18-2158244012471956" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>Social and economic inequalities can awaken a host of negative sentiments among the
            poor and dispossessed and lead to mass action, or worse, civil strife, either because
            disparities are not acknowledged and thus not remedied, or because corrective measures
            such as laws and redistribution policies attempt to entrench the status quo or seek to
            placate those mired in a highly unequal system and</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Inequalities can also reduce the base of social and political support for fundamental
            structural reforms necessary to embark on a path of high growth with more equity.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The discourse about the city could easily be the discourse about the world’s inequalities
        and this is why geographers give a special attention to the city when creating citizenship
        education activities. In her research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2158244012471956">Soenen (2002)</xref> presents a study on community development in urban environments
        undertaken in multiethnic schools in Flanders. The main purpose was to research changes in
        schools and use the complexity and diversity of the city to build social integration and a
        sense of community. Some of the conclusions of the study reinforce the importance of the
        city approach in dealing with multicultural integration issues.</p>
      <p>The movement of educational cities has been drawing educators’ attention since 1990 to the
        fact that the city provides the best material conditions from which to forge a general offer
        of diffusion of the learning and the knowledge needed for life in society and, at the same
        time, can create the greatest range of inequalities in its distribution. The city is a
        shopwindow filled with an array of offers and possibilities waiting to be chosen, but very
        often, they are not taken advantage of, or else there is an unequal distribution of the
        freedom to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2158244012471956">International
          Association of Educating Cities, 1990</xref>).</p>
      <p>In its Charter of Educating Cities, it is stated that diversity is inherent in the modern
        city and the notion is that it will increase even more in the future. Accordingly, one of
        the challenges facing the educating city is to foster a balance and harmony between identity
        and diversity, taking into account the contributions of the communities of which the city is
        comprised and the rights of all those living in the city to feel that their own cultural
        identity is being recognized.</p>
      <p>And these are important reasons why to approach human diversity in school geography at the
        local scale is very important to help students grasp the real impact of their imaginary
        borders in the place they live in. Because “borders” are real and their impact is visible in
        the living space of cities. And it is by fighting the closest ones that maybe distant ones
        will fade away.</p>
