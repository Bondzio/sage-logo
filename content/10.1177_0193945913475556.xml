<title>Have you heard about the Emerging Scholars Network (ESN)?</title>
<p>If you have not heard about the ESN or are just curious to learn more about this energetic group, read on!</p>
<p>In the fall of 2010, the Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS) Board of Directors appointed a task force to explore a mechanism to increase student involvement in MNRS. Student members of MNRS were asked to become involved with the task force. In the task force’s report to the MNRS Board of Directors, the main recommendation called for the development and implementation of a formal student network that, in collaboration with the Board of Directors, would work to enhance student participation and leadership within the Society. The name, <bold>Emerging Scholars Network</bold>, emerged as the recommended name for this group as identified by the members of the task force. The name, Emerging Scholars Network, reflects the diversity of the group, which includes undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. The ESN supports MNRS’s mission by engaging promising nursing scholars in the organization at early points in their career to support their development as nurse scientists and leaders. Dr. Liz Madigan, Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University, is the MNRS Board Liaison to this important committee.</p>
<p>An interview was conducted by the MNRS Secretary with the ESN’s student coleaders: Heather Hardin (HH) and Andrea Gilmore-Bykovskyi (AGB).</p>

<list id="list1-0193945913475556" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>1. First, provide us with a little bit of information about your personal background, including your nursing background.</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>HH response:</italic> I live and work in a small town in southern Indiana with my husband and pet fish. I have been a nurse since 2005, working in a medical/surgical setting and community health. Currently, I am working for women, infants, and children as a nurse, nutritionist and lactation counselor, and as a graduate research assistant at the University of Louisville.</p>
<p><italic>AGB response:</italic> I am originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I have lived in Madison, Wisconsin, for most of my life where I now live with my parents, husband, and 1-year old daughter. My first experience in the nursing field was during my undergraduate program when I worked as a nursing assistant in a skilled nursing facility. This experience inspired me to pursue and achieve the advanced training necessary to influence change in these work systems and in particular for the persons with dementia living there. Now, I practice as a long-term care nurse primarily in geriatric rehabilitation.</p>
<list id="list2-0193945913475556" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>2. Tell us about your progress in graduate school. What school/university are you attending? Who is your adviser(s)? What is the focus of your dissertation topic?</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>HH response:</italic> I am a PhD candidate at the University of Louisville School of Nursing and plan to graduate in August 2013. My advisor is Barbara Speck, PhD, RN. My dissertation topic is trust of health care among adolescents.</p>
<p><italic>AGB response:</italic> I am a PhD candidate and John A. Hartford Building Academic Geriatric Nursing Capacity (BAGNC) predoctoral scholar at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Nursing. My mentor is Barbara Bowers, PhD, RN, FAAN. My program of research focuses on pain and symptom management for nursing home residents with dementia. My dissertation study is a behavioral observation study with the primary aim of developing a computerized analytic framework for examining the relationships among social interaction, engagement, and dementia-related behavioral symptoms in nursing home residents with Alzheimer’s type dementia.</p>
<list id="list3-0193945913475556" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>3. Provide us with some background information on the Emerging Scholars Network. How and why did you become involved?</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>HH and AGB responses:</italic> In the fall of 2010, the MNRS Board of Directors appointed a task force to explore a mechanism to increase student involvement in MNRS. We both became involved with the task force that fall. The primary recommendation of the task force’s report to the Board called for the development and implementation of a formal student network that, in collaboration with the Board of Directors, would work to enhance student participation and leadership within the Society. The name, Emerging Scholars Network, is intended to reflect the diversity of our group, which includes undergraduate students, graduate students across all programs, and postdoctoral fellows. The Emerging Scholars Network supports MNRS’s mission by engaging promising nursing scholars in the Society at early points in their career to support their development as nurse scientists <italic>and</italic> developing leaders. To contribute to the mission of MNRS, the goals of the Emerging Scholars Network are to</p>
<list id="list4-0193945913475556" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>enhance opportunities for engagement and leadership training throughout the Society,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>develop and maintain peer-to-peer mentorship,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>support MNRS student members,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>increase professional philanthropy among the student membership body,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>create opportunities for networking among the student membership, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>increase awareness of and accessibility to MNRS for nursing students throughout the region.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>HH response:</italic> I became involved with the Emerging Scholars Network because I was looking for peer support and an opportunity to network with other PhD students like myself. While attending the student breakfast at MNRS in 2011, I learned that MNRS was developing a student committee, so I volunteered to help with the task force.</p>
<p><italic>AGB response:</italic> I saw the Student Task Force and subsequently, the Emerging Scholars Network, as an opportunity to contribute to the mission of MNRS while also supporting my own professional development. Serving as Co-Chair of the Emerging Scholars Network Committee has been an invaluable learning experience and has helped me to develop skills in strategic planning, group management, and leadership. The opportunity to develop these skills is not traditionally emphasized in doctoral programs. I also see the Emerging Scholars Network as a very practical way to contribute to something that I think is critical for the nursing field here and now: supporting and encouraging more nurses to take leadership roles in research, teaching, and practice.</p>
<list id="list5-0193945913475556" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>4. What are some of the Emerging Scholars Network initiatives and plans for the upcoming year and beyond?</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The ESN has several long-term and short-term goals, which were derived from student member responses to a survey distributed last year (2011).</p>
<p>Short-term goals for the upcoming year are to</p>
<list id="list6-0193945913475556" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>develop a peer-mentorship program that will serve the needs and interests of MNRS student members;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>work to increase professional philanthropy among student members, thus supporting increased student scholarships and grants for MNRS student members; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>build an infrastructure for bolstering MNRS student membership and raising awareness about the Society among nursing students in the region.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Long-term goals of the ESN include plans to</p>
<list id="list7-0193945913475556" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>reduce the cost of student membership,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>create new opportunities for student awards and recognition, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>establish a networking site to support long-term professional communication and networking among scholars.</p></list-item></list>
<list id="list8-0193945913475556" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>5. Why should other students get involved in MNRS and the ESN?</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The ESN serves as a voice for all student and postdoctoral members, representing their perspectives within MNRS. The ESN works in close collaboration with the Board of Directors and other MNRS committees to address the group’s goals, needs, and concerns. Because the ESN is still relatively new, now is a very exciting time to get involved and contribute your vision to the development of the ESN. The ESN welcomes all student and postdoctoral fellow MNRS members at no additional cost. In addition to advocating for students and postdoctoral fellows, the ESN is developing a wide variety of services for its members, including opportunities to receive training in professional service and leadership, improving communication skills, skills formation to build a strong network for peer support in accomplishing professional goals, and networking with other MNRS members with similar clinical and research interests. Much of what the ESN has to offer is not available in many traditional educational or training programs, but is a unique asset to becoming a leading nurse scientist, educator, and/or clinician.</p>
<list id="list9-0193945913475556" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>6. How can students or their faculty mentors obtain more information about becoming involved in the Emerging Scholars Network?</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Heather and Andrea provide two immediate ways for interested students to learn more about the ESN.</p>

<list-item><p>Student members of MNRS are welcome to meet us at the MNRS conference in Chicago (March 2013). Last year, we met with MNRS student members on multiple occasions: at the student breakfast, during an informal dinner at a local restaurant, and at an Emerging Scholars Network meeting. This year, we plan to continue these activities and increase our presence by setting up an information table and wearing a button or sticker, so members of Emerging Scholars Network are easily identifiable.</p></list-item>

<title>MNRS Foundation News</title>
<p>GREAT NEWS! The endowment fund, established to undergird the MNRS Dissertation and Seed Grant program, through monies contributed by members of the Founders’ Circle and the 35th Anniversary Circle, has reached US$200,000! We are extremely grateful to all who made that happen. Because of reaching that milestone, interest from that fund will be used to fund a Dissertation Grant.</p>
<p>Also at the conference, this milestone was celebrated during the Business Meeting/Award ceremony. Achieving this goal is particularly significant because all of the monies contributed came from our members. Please see the list of members of these two circles featured on our website and express your appreciation to them.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s Board of Trustees is well aware that to achieve our next goals (US$300,000 by the end of 2014, and an ultimate goal of US$500,000) for the Endowment Fund, we need to obtain monies from outside the Society. Contacts have been made with several corporations and foundations, but we believe that the best possibilities are through you, our nurse scientists. We need your help to identify vendors whose products you purchase for your projects, and if possible, contact names. Also, if there are organizations who are concerned about the problem you study, we need information about them. The trustees are happy to make the contacts, and refer to your research, when seeking support for the MNRS grants program from the sources you identify. Please send all referrals for the trustees to seek funds to the President of the Foundation, Dr. Kathleen (Kitty) Buckwalter, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kathleen-buckwalter@uiowa.edu">kathleen-buckwalter@uiowa.edu</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Donations received throughout the year, as well as the monies raised from events at the annual conference (Silent Auction and the FUNdraiser), are used to fund the grants awarded each year. Each year, the Foundation must raise approximately US$22,500 to support its share of the funds for the grants. The remainder comes from the MNRS budget based on income from dues and the conference (US$12,500 in 2013).</p>
<p>If you are not already a member, and are able to do so, please join us in the Founders’ Circle to help achieve the next goal. For those who do not feel able to meet the financial commitment for the Founders’ Circle, we have established a new program: The Ambassador Circle. To join this circle, which requires a US$500 donation for 3 years, just send a check to the MNRS address on the website, or use the donation mechanism and indicate it is for the Ambassador Circle.</p>
<p>In 2012, MNRS received a record number of applications for both the Dissertation and Seed grants, documenting the need for continuing to offer the grants and the goal of increasing the number of grants awarded. Let’s work together to support nursing science in the Midwest by establishing a significant endowment fund for the MNRS Foundation, as well as sufficient funds to award grants each year!</p>
