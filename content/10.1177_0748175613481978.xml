<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traditionally, the social and emotional needs of students were not regarded as the responsibility of the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748175613481978">Hiebert, Kemeny, &amp; Kurchak, 1998</xref>). The focus of education in the past has often been limited to the instructional program and the intellectual, cognitive development of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede, Imonikhe, &amp; Afen-Akpaida, 2007</xref>). In the past decades this has changed however, with guidance moving from the margin to the mainstream of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175613481978">Lapan, Gysbers, Multon, &amp; Pike, 1997</xref>). As research indicates, the affective development influences and, stated negatively, compromises cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175613481978">McGee &amp; Fauble-Erickson, 1995</xref>), and therefore schools must also take some responsibility for students’ social and emotional development. After all, social and emotional guidance and support lead to a more efficient and effective learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175613481978">Aluede &amp; Egbochuku, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best, Lang, Lodge, &amp; Watkins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613481978">Galassi &amp; Akos, 2004</xref>). An important aim of an educational institution therefore should be to facilitate the development of each of their students, which means enriching their intellectual as well as their personal, social, and emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175613481978">McGee &amp; Fauble-Erickson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>This fundamental goal of facilitating the total development of every student, presents a number of challenges not only for the school and the teachers but also for the counselors or support teachers who are seen as being at the forefront of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175613481978">Emanuelsson, 2001</xref>). When guidance becomes a comprehensive program integrated into the educational curriculum, roles change. Teachers become the first-line helpers and counselors are set with a coordinating and supporting role, which involves professional guidance and training of the regular class teachers and other school personnel, curriculum development and program implementation, maintenance of records, doing research as a reflective practitioner, and assessment and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175613481978">Agaliotis &amp; Kalyva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613481978">Galassi &amp; Akos, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These challenges and the new roles that arise from socioemotional guidance establishing its importance, ask for psychometrically sound and useful methods, which enable scientific research on guidance to be carried out so that counselors can evaluate guidance practices and program implementation. To our knowledge, no instrument exists that measures <italic>integrated</italic> socioemotional guidance, which includes guidance activities of the teachers at the class level as well as supportive characteristics at the level of the school. For this reason, this study focuses on the validation of the Socioemotional Guidance Questionnaire (SEG-Q), a measure of integrated socioemotional guidance.</p>
<sec id="section2-0748175613481978">
<title>Integrated Social–Emotional Guidance</title>
<p>Guidance has evolved from an isolated position taken on by one person (the counselor) to a comprehensive program that is part of the educational system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613481978">Galassi &amp; Akos, 2004</xref>). Guidance is the whole of activities integrated into the curriculum that aim to stimulate the personal and social development of every pupil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>). This sort of guidance, as an integral part of the curriculum, is referred to as <italic>integrated guidance</italic> in the Dutch literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613481978">Detrez, Bosman, &amp; Gombeir, 2000</xref>), <italic>comprehensive guidance</italic> in the American literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175613481978">Gysbers &amp; Henderson, 2000</xref>), and a <italic>whole school approach</italic> to guidance in the British and Hong Kong’s literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613481978">Hui, 2000</xref>). All emphasize the central role of the teacher in guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613481978">Hui, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175613481978">Watts &amp; Kidd, 2000</xref>). Teachers are first line helpers, who possess valuable information concerning their students, and are best suited to make referrals when specialized help is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175613481978">Aluede &amp; Egbochuku, 2007</xref>). This is not surprising considering that teachers are by far the key figure in the daily school life of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175613481978">Maples, 1992</xref>). Personal involvement of teachers in pupils’ lives is inevitable through this intense contact, and this means that teachers have the potential to be of significant impact for students who have the need or desire for such a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175613481978">Tatar, 1998</xref>). Integrated guidance demands that every teacher is involved in offering and organizing guidance as part of the curriculum. It is expected that teachers integrate guidance into their educational pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, teachers’ task perception and self-efficacy with regard to guidance are crucial elements in integrated social and emotional guidance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al. (1995)</xref> however, emphasize that there should be a whole-school approach to guidance. Since guidance results into additional responsibilities for teachers, and possibly more stress and a higher workload, a supportive network at the school level becomes a necessity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613481978">Chan &amp; Hui, 1998</xref>). The effectiveness of a guidance program depends, at least in part, on a paradigm shift to a comprehensive and collaborative whole-school approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748175613481978">Drefs, 2003</xref>). This whole-school approach means that the guidance activities performed by the teacher in the classroom are embedded into a school with certain crucial characteristics. The characteristics presented by several authors include a caring school climate, a clear vision and school ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175613481978">Luk-Fong &amp; Lung, 2003</xref>), the support of the principal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175613481978">Gysbers &amp; Henderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613481978">Hui, 2000</xref>), supporting systems and caring structures at the school, cooperation, communication, and coordination of the school team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613481978">Galassi &amp; Akos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175613481978">Gysbers &amp; Henderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613481978">Hui, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175613481978">Maples, 1992</xref>), cooperation with external partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>), and professionalization of the school team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175613481978">Luk-Fong &amp; Lung, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613481978">Triliva &amp; Poulou, 2006</xref>). Since these characteristics have a facilitating and supporting role for guidance activities in the classroom, it is important that these variables are also measured when evaluating or mapping the social and emotional guidance of students. Since no questionnaire exists that both measures guidance at the class level as well as guidance at the school level, the aim of this study is to develop a psychometrically sound instrument by assessing the factor structure and reliability of the SEG-Q.</p>

<title>The Socioemotional Guidance Questionnaire</title>
<p>In this study, the psychometric qualities of the SEG-Q, as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748175613481978">Keppens and Struyf (2008)</xref>, will be examined. The SEG-Q was developed based on a literature review, and focus group research with several key-participants (e.g., teachers, guidance teachers, principals, trainers; <italic>n</italic> = 26) in order to check for content validity, and a pilot study was conducted (<italic>n</italic> = 115), to check for difficulty, clarity, and feasibility of the items. SEG-Q is a self-report instrument for teachers. The SEG-Q consists of three different parts, which contain 71 items answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>I totally disagree</italic> to <italic>I totally agree</italic>. Part 1—<italic>coordination and organization at school</italic>—contains 30 items, which measure the coordination and organization at the level of the school. School characteristics such as a caring school climate, a clear vision, the support of the school’s principal, and supporting structures and procedures, mentioned earlier, are central to this part of the questionnaire. Part 2—<italic>support of the teachers at school</italic>—consists of 25 items that measure to what extent teachers are supported at school when it comes to the socioemotional guidance of pupils. This part of the questionnaire measures dynamic aspects concerning the teachers such as communication between teachers and with parents, professionalization opportunities, and cooperation. This as opposed to Part 1, which measures the more static characteristics present at school. Finally, Part 3 of the questionnaire—<italic>guidance by the teachers</italic>—contains items regarding the socioemotional guidance of students by individual teachers in the classroom. It consists of 16 items that measure the earlier mentioned task perception and self-efficacy of individual teachers. The questionnaire was administered in Dutch. The items as presented in the tableslater in the text are the English translation of these original items, as translated by an expert both in the English language and educational vocabulary.</p>

<title>Respondents</title>
<p>The population of the validation study includes all Flemish secondary schools that organize the first 2 years of secondary education (pupils aged 12–14 years), except for the special education schools. A list of all these schools from the year 2006–2007 that was obtained from the Flemish Department of Education showed that there are 684 different schools in Flanders that organize the first 2 years of secondary education. Out of this population, a smaller sample was drawn. A least 84 schools should be selected when striving for a 95% confidence level and 10% confidence interval. Taking into account possible nonresponse and nonaffirmations to the request to participate, we asked 200 schools to participate. The schools were selected based on a random stratified sample drawing to reach a representative sample. The population was stratified according to province, type of secondary school (subsidized official education, subsidized private education, or community education), and school size. In total, 95 schools agreed to participate. In each of these schools, 20 teachers were asked to participate in the online survey within the month of October 2008. In an accompanying letter, the teachers were told that they participated in a large-scale Flemish survey study that investigated the perceptions of teachers on socioemotional guidance. In addition, teachers were given the aforementioned definition and some examples of socioemotional guidance, to avoid misinterpretations when answering the questions. No information on the theoretical framework of this study (i.e., teachers as key figures and the need for a whole-school approach) was given to the teachers. In order to minimize nonresponse, a reminder was sent to the teachers 2 weeks after the start of the study. Schools where only a few teachers responded electronically were sent paper copies by the end of November 2008.</p>
<p>The final sample includes 1,418 teachers from 86 different schools (response rate of teachers = 74%, response rate of schools = 91%, average number of teachers per school = 16.5). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748175613481978">Table 1</xref>, the used stratification variables, province and type of secondary education of these 86 participating schools, reflect the distribution in the population. There is a slight underrepresentation of schools of one province (“Limburg”: 7 instead of the desired 11 schools) and a slight overrepresentation of schools of another province (“Flemish-Brabant”: 16 instead of 11 schools), but in general the distribution of the sample is in line with the distribution in the population, and thus representative. For the stratification variable, school size, we found no significant difference for the average pupils per school between the population and the used sample (<italic>M</italic><sub>population</sub> = 477; <italic>M</italic><sub>sample</sub> = 433; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Of the total sample, 1,017 or 71.7% of the teachers were female and 382 or 26.9% were male. The average age of the teachers was 38.21 ± 10.68 years, ranging from 20 to 74 years. With respect to years of working experience as a teacher, 19.6% had less than 5 years of experience, 21.1% had between 5 and 10 years, 15.9% had between 11 and 15 years, 10.4% had between 16 and 20 years, and 30.0% of the teachers had more than 21 years of teaching experience.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>To evaluate the factor structure of the SEG-Q, the data were subjected to several factor analyses. Not only exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) but also confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) and multilevel factor analyses were performed. In order to execute these different analyses, the data were randomly split in half. Since it is important to have enough teachers within each school when performing a CFA, selecting random schools instead of teachers was used to split the data.</p>
<sec id="section7-0748175613481978">
<title>Factor Analyses at Teacher Level</title>
<p>The first phase in examining the underlying structure at the teacher level was to perform EFAs on the three different parts of the questionnaire. These analyses were conducted with the software SPSS 16. The aim of the study is to describe the underlying structure and latent constructs and not merely to describe the data with a reduced number of variables, therefore we opted to use EFA instead of principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175613481978">Leech, Barrett, &amp; Morgan, 2005</xref>). For the EFA, we used the first half of the random split data. We based the selection of the number of factors on the eigenvalues-greater-than-one method (Kaiser–Guttman rule; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175613481978">Bandalos &amp; Boehm-Kaufman, 2009</xref>), parallel analysis, and the scree plot as well as on the interpretability and the fit of the scales into the theoretical framework. Since we expect the different factors to be correlated we opted to use oblique rotation instead of varimax rotation. Only factors with more than two items and items with a sufficient high loading of more than |.30| were retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175613481978">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To cross-validate the factor structure identified through the EFA, the second phase at the teacher level was a CFA on each part of the questionnaire. These three CFAs were conducted on the second half of the split data with the software M-plus 5. In each of these CFAs, a model consisting of the number of factors and the number of items as retained from the EFA was tested. If necessary the model was optimized based on the modification indices. To obtain models with a good fit, we used the following goodness-of-fit indices: for the comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) we strived for values of about .95, for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) values less than .06 and for the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) values less than .08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175613481978">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in the third and last phase, the reliability of the scores for the established scales was checked by means of their Cronbach’s alpha values and accompanying item analyses. An alpha value of .7 is considered sufficiently reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175613481978">Pallant, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0748175613481978">
<title>Factor Analyses at School Level</title>
<p>Because we have a hierarchical data set with teachers being organized within schools, multilevel factor analyses can be carried out. In that way, the dependency in the data would be respected and the factor structure at the school level would be investigated. After all, we must not assume that the same factors as at the teacher level will be present at the school level and thus suitable to describe the school level or to make comparisons about it. Therefore, items of scales with an intraclass coefficient greater than .05, which means that the school level has a significant and sufficiently high influence, were further analyzed by the means of a multilevel factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175613481978">Van de Vijver &amp; Poortinga, 2002</xref>). As the CFAs, the multilevel factor analyses were carried out using the software M-Plus 5.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the factor structure as found at the teacher level was checked at the school level by the means of multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA). In line with the CFA, the second half of the split data set was used. The fit indices and modification indices indicate to what extent the factor structure can be found at the school level. If the factor structure could not be confirmed, the second phase of the factor analyses at school level was a multilevel exploratory factor analysis (MEFA) to determine the school level’s factor structure. The first part of the random split data was used to perform these analyses. We made use of all items from the initial data set; items that were removed after the EFA or CFA because of low or double loadings were only removed when it appeared necessary in accordance with the MEFA. The number of factors was determined based on the eigenvalues and parallel analysis. As with the EFA, only factors with more than two items were retained, items with loadings greater than |.30| were withheld and items with a large loading on different factors were removed.</p>

<p>In the first stage, the 30 items from Part 1 of the SEG-Q are subjected to an EFA with oblique rotation. Prior to this EFA the suitability of the data for the EFA is checked. The Kaiser–Meyer–Oklin value is .918, exceeding the recommended .6, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity reached statistical significance (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4012.101, <italic>df</italic> = 435, <italic>p</italic> = .000), indicating that there is sufficient communality present in the manifest variables to perform a factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175613481978">Pallant, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The initial eigenvalues of the EFA indicate the presence of six factors, which explain, respectively, 61.42% of the variance. The parallel analysis, however shows that only five factors have an eigenvalue that exceeds the corresponding criterion value for a randomly generated data matrix of the same size (30 variables × 710 respondents). The fifth factor of this five-factor solution, however, does not contain sufficient items and, therefore, we opt to use a four-factor solution. This is in line with the scree plot, which shows a clear break after the fourth factor, and with the number of factors that this part of the questionnaire is theoretically supposed to measure. These four factors explain, respectively, 35.48%, 8.41%, 6.33%, and 3.97% of the total variance of 54.19%. To interpret these four different factors, we made use of an oblique rotation. The factor correlation matrix indeed shows that there is a moderate correlation between the various factors (absolute <italic>r</italic> values between .33 and .55). The rotated solution, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748175613481978">Table 2</xref>, shows that there are sufficient items with a loading greater than .30 for each factor and the fact that most items load on only one factor. Only for Items 6, 11, and 18 was this not the case; they had a double and low loading on two different factors and therefore will be deleted. Since the loading of Item 16 on Factor 3 is only slightly greater than .30 and the loading of this item on Factor 1 is nearly as high, Item 16 will also be deleted.</p>

<p>In the second phase, the four factors and corresponding 26 items that resulted from the EFA are subjected to a CFA. The results of this CFA point to moderate but still insufficiently high fit indices (CFI = .882, TLI = .867, RMSEA = .069, SRMR = .055). Subsequently, changes are made to the four-factor model in order to achieve a better fit. Items 13, 19, and 22 are removed since the modification indices show that error covariances should be included between these items and items of other scales. These moderate to strong correlations with items from other scales can point to the fact that these items measure several concepts or that these items were not unambiguously interpreted by the different respondents. The removal of these three items leads to a better, but still insufficient fit (CFI = .882, TLI = .867, RMSEA = .067, SRMR = .055). In the next step, error covariances between items of a same scale were added. This shows that there is a negative correlation between Items 20 and 23 on one hand (<italic>r</italic> = −.60) and Items 20 and 24 on the other hand (<italic>r</italic> = −.49). These moderate negative correlations are not very plausible based on the content of the items. These correlations might even indicate a misinterpretation of Item 20 whereby this item—<italic>In the school’s work plan, it is explicitly mentioned that the school provides socioemotional guidance</italic>—was interpreted as static as opposed to the more dynamically formulated Item 23—<italic>Our school regularly adjusts its view on the socioemotional guidance of pupils</italic>—and Item 24—<italic>At school, we reflect in group about the strengths and weaknesses of the socioemotional guidance provided</italic>. Considering this possible erroneous or ambiguous interpretation of Item 20, we decided to delete this item. Finally, taking the changes based on the modification indices into account, we came up with a four-factor structure with 22 items and seven error covariances with a good fit (CFI = .946, TLI = .936, RMSEA = .048, SRMR = .046). The final four-structure model with corresponding items and error covariances can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175613481978">Figure 1</xref>. The first factor of this model measures the school’s climate (<italic>n</italic> = 7), the second factor measures vision with regard to socioemotional guidance (<italic>n</italic> = 3), the third factor measures the support of the school’s principal (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and the fourth and last factor measures caring structures and procedures with respect to socioemotional guidance at school (<italic>n</italic> = 6).</p>

<title>Part 2: Support of the Teachers at School</title>
<p>In the first phase, the 25 items of Part 2 of the SEG-Q were subjected to EFA. Both the results of the Kaiser–Meyer–Oklin test (.904) as well as the Bartlett test (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3417.298, <italic>df</italic> = 300, <italic>p</italic> = .000) indicate that there is sufficient communality present in the manifest variables carry out a factor analysis. The initial eigenvalues of the EFA indicate the presence of five factors, which explain, respectively, 61.98% of the variance. The scree plot shows both a breaking point after the fourth and after the fifth factor. The parallel analysis (25 variables × 710 respondents) suggests a four-factor solution, but when using four factors it appears that one of the factors cannot be interpreted. In line with the eigenvalues and the scree plot, we opted therefore to use five factors. These five factors explain 35.53%, 9.20%, 7.46%, 5.11%, and 4.68% of the total variance. To interpret these five factors we used an oblique rotation. After all, the factor correlation matrix shows that there is a moderate correlation between the various factors with absolute <italic>r</italic> values ranging from .25 and .51. The rotated solution, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748175613481978">Table 3</xref> points out that the different factors have sufficient items with loadings higher than .30 as well and that most of the items only load on one factor. For Items 34, 36, 47, and 48 however, there is an almost equally high loading on two out of five factors and, therefore, we decided not to retain these items.</p>

<p>In the second phase, the five factors and 21 corresponding items were subjected to CFAs. The results of the first CFA, which tested the model with the five factors that resulted from the EFA, showed a moderate but insufficient fit (CFI = .902, TLI = .886, RMSEA = .068, SRMR = .06). Based on the modification indices, error covariances between items belonging to the same scale were added. These modification indices showed a negative correlation between Item 46 and Item 44 (<italic>R</italic> = −.376), which cannot be explained based on the content of these items. This negative correlation, therefore, raises questions about the formulation and interpretation of Item 44<italic>—At school, teachers have someone to turn to when they have questions about the socioemotional guidance of pupils</italic>. The word “someone” in the wording of the item can refer both to a person at the school or someone outside the school, and thus depending on the interpretation the item belongs to a different factor. Because of this vague and ambiguous wording, Item 44 was deleted. The final model consists of five factors, 20 items, and three error covariancens (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175613481978">Figure 1</xref>) and proves to be a good fit to the data (CFI = .946, TLI = .935, RMSEA = .052, SRMR = .046). The first factor measures the school’s internal cooperation with regard to socioemotional guidance (<italic>n</italic> = 4), the second factor measures the professionalization of teachers with regard to socioemotional guidance (<italic>n</italic> = 5), the third factor measures the communication between teachers regarding the socioemotional guidance of pupils (<italic>n</italic> = 3), the fourth factor measures the school external cooperation (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and the fifth factor measures the communication with parents with respect to the socioemotional guidance of their child (children; <italic>n</italic> = 5). For these five factors of the second part of the SEG-Q, we also checked internal consistency. The results as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0748175613481978">Table 5</xref> show that all scales are sufficiently reliable.</p>

<sec id="section13-0748175613481978">
<title>Part 3: Guidance by the Teacher</title>
<p>Also for Part 3, which consists of 16 items, it appears from the Kaiser–Meyer–Oklin test (.802) and the Bartlett test (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2595.561, <italic>df</italic> = 120, <italic>p</italic> = .000) that there is sufficient communality in the manifest variables to perform an EFA.</p>
<p>The initial eigenvalues of the EFA as well as the parallel analysis (16 variables × 710 respondents) indicate the presence of four factors, which explain 57.98% of the variance. The screeplot does not show any clear breaking points; there are minor breaks after the second, fifth, and seventh factor. For the initial solution with four factors it appears that the fourth factor contains insufficient items, and brings us to a three-factor solution. These three factors explain, respectively, 26.54%, 13.54%, and 10.17% of the variance, which in total amounts to 50.25% variance explained. Also for this part of the questionnaire an oblique rotation was subsequently used to further interpret these factors. This is because the factor correlation matrix shows that there is a moderate correlation between the various factors (absolute <italic>r</italic> values between .21 and .33). The rotated solution as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0748175613481978">Table 4</xref> shows that the various factors contain sufficient items with a loading higher than .30 on only one of the factors. Only Item 60 did not load on any of the factors and was therefore not retained.</p>

<p>The results of the CFA for the three factors and 15 corresponding items that emerged from the EFA, show that there is a moderate but insufficient fit (CFI = .857, TLI = .827, RMSEA = .083, SRMR = .062). When four error covariances based on the modification indices were added, a model with a good fit to the data was obtained (CFI = .955, TLI = .943, RMSEA = .047, SRMR = .041). Thus, the final model includes three factors, 15 items, and four error covariances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175613481978">Figure 1</xref>). The first factor measures the guidance competences of the teacher (<italic>n</italic> = 6), the second factor measures the narrow task perception of teachers with regard to socioemotional guidance (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and the third factor measures the broad task perception of teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Finally, we also checked the reliability of the scores for these three scales. The Cronbach alpha values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0748175613481978">Table 5</xref>) show that these scales for the third part of the questionnaire are sufficiently reliable with alphas of .7 and .8.</p>

<title>Factor Structure at the School Level</title>
<p>Because of the hierarchical structure of the data it seems useful to check whether the school level has a significant influence. As stated before however performing a multilevel factor analysis is only needed when the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is greater than .05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175613481978">Van de Vijver &amp; Poortinga, 2002</xref>). For the scales climate, vision, principal’s support, and structures and procedures of Part 1 of the SEG-Q we found a significant effect from the level of the school with ICCs of .17, .18, .18, and .11, respectively. For the first part of the questionnaire, it is therefore necessary to perform a multilevel factor analysis. For Part 2 of the questionnaire, ICCs of .12, .10, and .08, respectively, for the scales internal cooperation, external cooperation, and communication with parents also show a significant influence of the school level. For the other scales of Part 2—professionalization and communication between teachers—there appears to be no significant influence of the school level. For Part 3, guidance by the teachers, the ICCs also indicate that there is no significant impact of the school. The multilevel factor analyses will therefore only be carried out on Part 1 of the questionnaire and on the scales internal cooperation, external cooperation, and communication with parents from Part 2.</p>
<sec id="section15-0748175613481978">
<title>Part 1: Coordination and Organization at School</title>
<p>When performing the MCFA on the obtained model for Part 1 of the SEG-Q, the seven error covariances that were added in the CFA were only included at the teacher level, not at the school level. We will add potential error covariances at the school level based on the modification indices of the MCFA. The fit indices of the MCFA show that across both levels there is a good but slightly insufficient fit (CFI = .926, TLI = .914, RMSEA = .040), and at the teacher level the model is reconfirmed (SRMR within = .048 &lt; .06). However, the fit indices also show that the factor structure is less suitable at the school level (SRMR between = .147). After adding three error covariances the model fit at the school level still remains insufficient (CFI = .932, TLI = .921, RMSEA = .039, SRMR within = .039, SRMR between = .128).</p>
<p>The next step therefore was to determine the factor structure at the school level by means of an MEFA. As at the teacher level, the eigenvalues of the MEFA point to a four-factor structure. To interpret this four-factor structure we used an oblique rotation. The rotated solution shows that because of several double loadings no meaningful four-factor solution can be reached. Too many items had to be deleted whereby only Factor 1 would still contain a sufficient number of items. When opting for a three-factor structure, deleting double items resulted again in one of the factors containing an insufficient number of items. As such, the MEFA brings us to a two-factor structure at the school level. The first factor contains seven items (i.e., Items 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 17) that measure the climate at school, as was also the case at the level of the teachers. The second factor contains nine items (i.e., Items 4, 7, 19, 20, 22, 24, 27, 28, and 29) that measure school policy with regard to socioemotional guidance. Thus, at the level of the school, there is one factor comprising the scales vision, principal support, and structures and procedures that exist as separate constructs at the teacher level. Based on the results of the MEFA we can conclude that, as opposed to the four-factor structure at the teacher level, there are only two factors at the school level: climate and school policy.</p>

<title>Part 2: Support of the Teachers at School</title>
<p>Also on the second part of the questionnaire an MCFA was carried out to verify whether the structure as found at the teacher level is also present at the school level. As stated above, only the scales internal cooperation, external cooperation, and communication with parents are involved in the multilevel analysis. Assuming that the model at the level of the school is the same as that at the teacher level, we tested a model with three factors and 12 corresponding items. The two error covariances included in the MEFA were only included in the model at the teacher level; error covariances at the school level will be included based on the modification indices of the MCFA. The fit indices confirm the fit of the full model across levels (CFI = .941, TLI = .922, RMSEA = .048), and reconfirm the fit of the model at the teacher level (SRMR within = .042 &lt; .06). The fit indices also show however that the model does not fit at the school level (SRMR between = .216), and according to the modification indices no error covariances can be added to improve the model fit.</p>
<p>The next step therefore was to determine the factor structure at the school level by means of an MEFA. The eigenvalue of the MEFA suggested a three-factor structure. To interpret this three-factor structure, we used an oblique rotation. The results of this rotation indicate that the majority of the items have a sufficiently high loading on only one of the factors. After removing Item 43, 44, and 54 because of double loadings, the number of items loading on Factor 2 remains insufficient. As a result, the final structure at the school level consists of only two factors. The first factors contain six items (Items 39, 46, 47, 50, 55, and 56), which measure two distinct variables at the teacher level. Thus, the two distinct scales, internal and external cooperation at the teacher level are incorporated into one scale at the school level. The second factor consists of three items (Items 51, 52, and 53) that measure the same construct as at the teacher level, namely communication with parents. Thus, based on the results of the MEFA we can conclude that a two-factor structure can be established that measures (internal and external) cooperation and communication with parents.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The goal of every educational institution should be to stimulate the total development of every individual and also enriching their personal, social, and emotional development besides their intellectual or cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>). As a consequence, socioemotional guidance has moved to the forefront of education, and research on and evaluation of socioemotional guidance practices and programs has become a necessity. Since research and evaluation is contingent on a psychometrically sound instrument to measure integrated socioemotional guidance, the aim of this study was to investigate the factor structure and validity of the SEG-Q.</p>
<p>Based on the results of this study we can conclude that the SEG-Q is a valid and reliable self-report instrument for teachers. It measures both guidance by the teacher in the classroom (Part 3) as well as the supportive guidance network at the level of the school (Parts 1 and 2).</p>
<p>In this study, we carried out EFAs and CFAs to investigate the factor structure of the SEG-Q at the level of the teacher, as well as multilevel factor analyses to check whether these constructs also apply to the level of the school. The results indicate that at the teacher level the SEG-Q measures 12 different constructs with a total of 57 items. Part 1—organization and coordination at school— includes four scales and 22 items, which measure climate, vision, principal’s support, and structures and procedures with respect to socioemotional guidance. Part 2—support of the teachers at school—consists of five scales and 20 items, which measure internal cooperation, professionalization, teacher communication, school external cooperation, and communication with parents, all in relation to socioemotional guidance. Parts 1 and 2 of the SEG-Q thus measure the various school characteristics, which are mentioned in the literature to be determinative or facilitating for pupil guidance at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613481978">Aluede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613481978">Best et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613481978">Galassi &amp; Akos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175613481978">Gysbers &amp; Henderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613481978">Hui, 2000</xref>). Besides these characteristics at the school level, literature on pupil guidance also discusses the central role of the teacher. This central role is measured by Part 3—guidance by the teacher—which consists of three scales and 15 items that measure the guiding competences of the teacher and his or her narrow and broad task perception regarding socioemotional guidance. We conclude that at the teacher level, the SEG-Q measures both the school characteristics and the central role of the teacher as mentioned in the literature.</p>
<p>The results of the multilevel factor analyses show that the factor structure of the SEG-Q at the level of the school differs from that of the level of the teacher. To begin with, it appeared from the intraclass correlations that five constructs (professionalization, communication teachers, narrow task perception, broad task perception, and guiding competences) are only situated at the teacher level. Thus, these scales are measures of teacher perceptions of the mentioned school characteristics and not a measure of the actual school characteristic as such. This should be taken into account when using the SEG-Q to make statements about the professionalization, communication between teachers, teachers’ task perception, and guiding competence at school.</p>
<p>As to the remaining constructs it appeared that these constructs are present at the level of the school but in a less differentiated way. The results point toward two overarching scales, both for Part 1 and Part 2 of the SEG-Q. For Part 1, only the scales climate and school policy can be distinguished with the first containing the same seven items as the climate scale at the teacher level, and the latter containing nine items, which initially belonged to the scales vision, principals’ support, and structures and procedures. For Part 2 of the SEG-Q, only school cooperation and communication with teachers can be distinguished at the level of the school. School cooperation contains six items that measure internal or external cooperation at the teacher level and communication with teachers contains the same three items as at the teacher level. We can conclude therefore that the 12 different scales of the SEG-Q as found in the factor analysis are measurements at the teacher level, which cannot be aggregated to represent a characteristic at the school level. To make statements or comparisons at the school level, only the constructs climate, school policy, school cooperation, and communication with teachers can be used. Further research on this matter and the use of the SEG-Q at the school level, however, remains desirable.</p>
<p>The validity of the SEG-Q in this study was examined by means of exploratory, confirmatory, and multilevel factor analyses using teachers’ perceptions. Given the central role of teachers regarding integrated socioemotional guidance, investigating these perceptions is an important aspect of research on and the evaluation of socioemotional guidance practices. Few people can make or break the schools’ guidance program like teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175613481978">Aluede &amp; Egbochuku, 2007</xref>) and that is why teachers’ perceptions on integrated socioemotional guidance were central to this study. It should be said however that the validity examined in this study is limited to construct validity. Further research on the external validity of the questionnaire is desirable. Furthermore, the questionnaire is not only limited to teachers’ perspectives, it also collects only quantitative data. To obtain a more realistic and accurate perspective on the matter, it would be useful to complement data gathered by the SEG-Q with data related to the perceptions of the students as well as qualitative data. The latter can be obtained through interviews with teachers, students, principals, and support teachers involved with socioemotional guidance at school or through document analysis or observations. After all, triangulation or the use of multiple research methods or techniques on the same phenomenon, in this case socioemotional guidance of students, can transcend individual shortcomings, such as socially desirable answers in survey research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613481978">Denzin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175613481978">Levering &amp; Smeyers, 2003</xref>). Finally, we also encourage future research to examine the psychometric properties of the SEG-Q in contexts other than the Flemish in order to check equivalence of the SEG-Q for other countries and languages.</p>
<p>Although further research is desirable and needed, the results of this study are promising, showing that that the SEG-Q can be a valid and reliable self-report instrument for teachers. It measures the school characteristics and central role of the teacher regarding the socioemotional guidance of students, which are considered important in the literature. Considering the need in education to enhance pupils’ social and emotional development, the existence of such a valid and reliable instrument is important. The SEG-Q can be used to evaluate integrated socioemotional guidance at school, to measure the current state of affair with regard to socioemotional guidance, or to enhance dialogue on this matter between different parties at school. Given the changing roles in an integrated model of socioemotional guidance, the evaluation or measurement of the current state of affairs in schools can be very useful. In an integrated model of guidance, the teacher becomes the first line helper or key figure, and counselors are set with a coordinating and supporting role which involves professional guidance and training of the regular class teachers and other school personnel, curriculum development and program implementation, maintenance of records and doing research as a reflective practitioner. The SEG-Q can enable the school counselor or support teacher to fulfill this new role and tasks of supporting, coordinating, and evaluating the guidance program and activities at school.</p>
