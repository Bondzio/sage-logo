<p>In the present study, we provide important insights into the knowledge and experience individuals gain when engaging in nonprofit and voluntary work. The article explores how applicable the acquired human capital is when put to work in environments that share some common elements. Using data from the second panel study of entrepreneurial dynamics (PSED 2), we find robust evidence that previous nonprofit experience significantly increases the chances to successfully found a new venture. Given the similarities in work environments that are plagued by uncertainty and ambiguity, the task-relatedness of human capital acquired through nonprofit work might provide a comparative advantage when creating a new venture. Practical implications and future research are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In part, the literature on both nonprofit workers and entrepreneurs shares a common element in describing the individuals involved as striving for autonomy and discretion and being driven by intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764012449517">Borzaga &amp; Tortia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012449517">Carsrud &amp; Brännback, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012449517">Light, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012449517">Ridder &amp; McCandless, 2010</xref>). Both types of workers are said to enjoy the value of their working conditions more than the pecuniary benefits, while the latter in essence provide more upside potential but come at the expense of increased risk. In essence, given the similarity in nonprofit and entrepreneurial environments and the high emphasis on motivational aspects for each engagement, previous nonprofit experiences might be helpful in the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities. Accordingly, this paper combines these two areas and provides evidence that nonprofit workers can put their experiences to good use when founding an entrepreneurial venture.</p>
<p>Our work provides important insights into the knowledge and experience individuals gain when engaging in voluntary work and how applicable the acquired skills are when put to work in environments that share some common elements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012449517">Markman and Baron (2003)</xref> argue that the fit between personal characteristics and the environment in which people work is important to understand why some individuals are successful, while others fail to stand the test of time; the compatibility between what awaits individuals striving to be successful and their personal characteristics and skill endowments matters in explaining their future success.</p>
<p>We test for performance impacts of previous nonprofit experience (controlling for self-selection based on personal characteristics and motivation) and find robust evidence that nonprofit experience positively influences the chances for new venture emergence/foundation. We extend the literature on entrepreneurship and nonprofit work alike by pointing out similarities in work environments that should make individuals with nonprofit experience a good fit for an entrepreneurial career, given the circumstances they faced previously. Bearing in mind that individuals have substantial discretion in choosing their career paths, paying attention to person-entrepreneurship fit can enlighten our understanding of why some individuals are more successful when embarking on an entrepreneurial endeavor.</p>
<p>While we chose an entrepreneurial environment to test for the effect of nonprofit experience on success, our results might be equally applicable to other business engagements. In particular, our results document that working in resource-constrained nonprofit environments that might be plagued by high levels of uncertainty and ambiguity can yield substantial benefits for future career paths. Hence, the increasing importance placed by colleges on nonprofit experience in the selection and education of students attests to the role that these experiences might play in the wider business context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764012449517">Bushouse &amp; Sowa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764012449517">Mirabella, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is structured as follows: section two outlines the theoretical background and derives the hypotheses. Section three describes the data and presents the methodology. Section four reports the results. Section five discusses the findings and the study’s potential limitations, and provides concluding remarks.</p>

<sec id="section2-0899764012449517">
<title>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764012449517">Shane and Venkataraman (2000)</xref> define entrepreneurs as individuals that create, discover, evaluate, and exploit opportunities. Entrepreneurial activities are plagued by uncertainty and ambiguity, and substantial tenacity and endurance is required to breathe life into a new venture. Different entrepreneurs may face similar (or even the same) opportunities, but due to heterogeneity in skills, resources, capabilities, and most importantly, personal characteristics, organizing patterns differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012449517">Baker &amp; Nelson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764012449517">Bowman &amp; Hurry, 1993</xref>). Subsequent organizing activities can be traced back to the individuals’ pursuit of these actions, their resources, and their personal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764012449517">Davis, Marino, Aaron, &amp; Tolbert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764012449517">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial firms are characterized by unexpected changes and instability, making them distinct from more established organizations. The risks that entrepreneurs take upon themselves are high. But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012449517">Markman and Baron (2003)</xref> maintain that individuals have control in managing their aspired career paths, and hence seek opportunities based on aspirations, endowments, and, most importantly, fit and congruency. Individuals choose to become entrepreneurs when they sense that they possess the required skills and traits to be successful in this environment. In the following we focus on three different personal characteristics that might influence the person-entrepreneurship fit: self-efficacy, perseverance, and previous nonprofit experience.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0899764012449517">Figure 1</xref> presents a stylized depiction of our theoretical model linking personal characteristics of entrepreneurs to new venture emergence. Whether an individual will be successful as a nascent entrepreneur is predicated on person-entrepreneurship fit. Accordingly, we would expect self-efficacy and perseverance to affect new venture emergence positively. Moreover, we argue that based on the relatedness of previous work experience, and given the surrounding ambiguity, uncertainty, and resource constraints, nonprofit experience can provide a good fit with the entrepreneurial environment. In the following, we present the underlying theoretical arguments for our hypotheses in more detail.</p>

<sec id="section3-0899764012449517">
<title>Self-Efficacy</title>
<p>Goal setting theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764012449517">Locke &amp; Latham, 1991</xref>) argues that motivational factors influence individual performance. Personal goals and aspirations drive individuals to exert more effort, which in turn is necessary to achieve distinct milestones. Only when people believe they can achieve a goal (self-efficacy) will they be willing to exert the necessary effort. Accordingly, creating a new venture involves a substantial belief in one’s abilities to face the entrepreneurial challenges ahead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012449517">Markman &amp; Baron, 2003</xref>). Self-efficacy therefore drives entrepreneurial motivations and subsequently links intention and action in the process of establishing a new venture. Accordingly, goals coupled with motivations predict entrepreneurial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012449517">Carsrud &amp; Brännback, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-efficacy reflects the conviction of individuals that they have the abilities needed to achieve a certain outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764012449517">Chen, Greene, &amp; Crick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764012449517">Markman, Balkin, &amp; Baron, 2002</xref>). Entrepreneurs with higher levels of self-efficacy are more likely than others to engage in entrepreneurial activities. Given their stronger belief in their skills, they should exert more of the effort required to build new ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012449517">Markman &amp; Baron, 2003</xref>). Given the high levels of uncertainty and ambiguity involved, believing in one’s own abilities and subsequently exerting effort will create a good fit with the entrepreneurial environment. Thus, entrepreneurs with higher levels of self-efficacy should generally have higher chances to successfully create new organizations. We therefore formulate the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0899764012449517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 1:</bold> Nascent entrepreneurs with higher levels of self-efficacy will outperform nascent entrepreneurs with lower levels of self-efficacy.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0899764012449517">
<title>Perseverance</title>
<p>Nascent entrepreneurial ventures are plagued by a lack of legitimization, social perils, and the risk of stigmatization. Not surprisingly, a great number of aspiring entrepreneurs disband their venture due to the hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012449517">Delmar &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>). A high level of tenacity is required to go for long periods without positive feedback from customers or potential financiers. Challenges can cause personal stress and psychological barriers to continuing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012449517">Bandura, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Being able to continue despite the troublesome circumstances is among the most crucial criteria for making it through the nascent entrepreneurial phase. Not everyone does make it. Empirical research shows that successful entrepreneurs are more likely than unsuccessful ones to exhibit high levels of tenacity and to do anything in their power to avoid failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012449517">Baum &amp; Locke, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012449517">Markman and Baron (2003)</xref> suggest that perseverance and the ability to overcome adversity might determine why some individuals are more successful than others. Personal characteristics that are associated with persistent effort and resilience to adversity therefore make some aspiring entrepreneurs more likely to continue exerting effort despite the adverse circumstances. Thus, we argue that nascent entrepreneurs with higher levels of perseverance are more likely to overcome unforeseen contingencies and obstacles, and hence, a new venture is more likely to emerge due to their continued effort exertion. We formulate the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0899764012449517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 2:</bold> Nascent entrepreneurs with higher levels of perseverance will outperform nascent entrepreneurs with lower levels of perseverance.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section5-0899764012449517">
<title>Nonprofit Experience</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012449517">Benz (2009)</xref> finds that both entrepreneurs and nonprofit workers are motivated mainly by non-pecuniary benefits and derive satisfaction from them. In biotechnology, for example, the desire to amass wealth might be outweighed by personal aspirations to find a cure. Moreover, others might engage in entrepreneurship “as an end in itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012449517">Carsrud &amp; Brännback, 2011</xref>, p. 16). This is evidenced by the activities of habitual or serial entrepreneurs who frequently start new ventures, regardless of the positive or negative outcome of previous endeavors. Becoming an entrepreneur is associated with a need for autonomy and discretion rather than the pure expectation of financial rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012449517">Benz, 2009</xref>). For both entrepreneurs and nonprofit workers, opportunities to utilize skills and pursue ideas, coupled with greater autonomy, provide superior benefits than would the higher salaries both could earn in more standard employment.</p>
<p>Employees of nonprofit organizations voluntarily push towards well-defined goals and are driven by intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation. Empirical work documents the observation that nonprofit workers are characterized by high levels of intrinsic motivation and are generally “willing to exchange extrinsic rewards for commitment to the cause” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012449517">Ridder &amp; McCandless, 2010</xref>, p. 130; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012449517">Light, 2002</xref>). Contributing to an organization’s and mission by working on a socially desirable product or service increases the motivation of nonprofit workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764012449517">Benz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764012449517">Borzaga &amp; Tortia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764012449517">Stukas, Worth, Clary, &amp; Snyder, 2008</xref>). Nonprofit workers exhibit a less-pronounced focus on monetary compensation; autonomy and responsibility are among the widely cited factors leading to entry into nonprofit organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764012449517">Borzaga &amp; Tortia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764012449517">Nickson, Warhurst, Dutton, &amp; Hurrell, 2008</xref>). The underlying intrinsic motivation is fostered by needs for competence and self-direction.</p>
<p>Accordingly, given the similarities in environments and personal characteristics between entrepreneurship and nonprofit work, the performance of entrepreneurs with nonprofit experience could be higher than that of those without it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012449517">Markman &amp; Baron, 2003</xref>). The more one’s work shares common characteristics with previous situations encountered or knowledge acquired, the more likely one should be able to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764012449517">Unger, Rauch, Frese, &amp; Rosenbusch, 2011</xref>). Knowing what to expect and what the process requirements are significantly reduces ambiguity in task selection and fine-tunes the allocation of time and effort. One can anticipate future contingencies and react at the proper time with the appropriate effort.</p>
<p>While some might see the ambiguity and uncertainty that entrepreneurship provides as a hindrance, the concomitant autonomy and discretion in decision making might motivate workers with a nonprofit background. Given the knowledge and experience they acquired in their prior engagement in nonprofit work and a higher tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity, they might be better equipped to deal with the entrepreneurial environment. Accordingly, nonprofit workers that pursue the entrepreneurial route could be more successful then workers from other occupations. Hence, we formulate the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list3-0899764012449517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 3:</bold> Nascent entrepreneurs with nonprofit experience will outperform nascent entrepreneurs without nonprofit experience</p></list-item></list>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0899764012449517">
<title>Data set and Sample</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses empirically, we draw on the Second Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED II) data set. The PSED II is a representative survey of entrepreneurial activities in the United States that portrays individuals during their business creation processes. The data set describes the characteristics of nascent entrepreneurs, documents the sequences of the organizing activities, summarizes the types and volumes of resources committed, and characterizes the new ventures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0899764012449517">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>For PSED II individuals were identified in late 2005 and early 2006, with four follow-up interviews, each taking place 12 months after the previous one, with the last wave completed in January 2010. The sample of active nascent entrepreneurs was taken from an overall group of 31,845 individuals. Out of this probability sample, 1,214 active nascent entrepreneurs were identified in an initial interview. Interviewees were identified through their answers on screening questions as to whether they (a) were intending to start a new firm, (b) had already carried out at least one start-up activity in previous years, (c) expected to own part of the firm, and (d) did not have a business that was currently running. Hence, entrepreneurs eligible for the sample were involved with an ongoing but not yet operational start-up. The early stage screening was used to ensure representativeness of the data, and, more importantly, to reduce distortions caused by potential survivorship biases. Throughout the data collection process, respondents gave affirmative answers concerning a package of start-up activities that reveal the progress they made in terms of becoming operational. Given the re-interviewing over the course of five years, the resulting longitudinal structure, with monthly indications of activities started and finished, allows for inferences on the process of organizing activities and facilitates causal inferences among dependent and independent variables.</p>
<p>Concerning the number of respondents, Wave A identifies 1,214 nascent entrepreneurs who returned the questionnaire, whilst the number drops subsequently due to non-respondents and disbandment to 972 for Wave B, and 746, 526, and 435 for the Waves C to E. Among entrepreneurs engaged in start-ups, 512 disbanded their ventures and 243 perceived their ventures as operational. For the remainder of the other ventures, 180 reported ongoing activities as per Wave 5, but did not perceive their venture as operational. Lastly, 279 start-ups out of the initial sample omitted at least one wave or stopped reporting their progress entirely. Hence, for these entrepreneurs, we do not know the status of their organizing activities, and consequently, these observations are pruned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0899764012449517">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<sec id="section9-0899764012449517">
<title>Completion of Entrepreneurial Organizing Activities</title>
<p>Given the debate on the applicability of researcher-defined and self-reported outcome measures, we employ a more prudent outcome measure by using information on whether the entrepreneurs achieved a first positive cash flow (covering managerial salaries) and also perceived their venture as operational. We compare those who answered in the affirmative with entrepreneurs who indicated that they terminated their work on their ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764012449517">Gartner &amp; Carter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764012449517">Davidsson &amp; Gordon, 2011</xref>). Becoming operational is therefore a combination of questions A35 and A41, which ask whether monthly revenues ever exceeded monthly expenses (including salaries for the managers) and whether, based on this achievement, the respondents would characterize their venture as being operational. If both conditions are fulfilled, the variable takes on the value of one. We label this outcome as “perceived emergence”. Moreover, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012449517">Delmar and Shane (2003)</xref>, we also investigate whether all involved entrepreneurs report disengagement, to allow comparisons across these two reported statuses. If others are still working on the venture, we do not treat these as disbanded, as only the key respondent disengaged from the venture, which is distinct from disbandment. If all reported start-up members disengaged from the venture, the variable takes on the value of zero for the comparison category, and if others are still working, we omit the data, due to the “still trying” nature of the observation. Hence, we fit a logistic regression using the outcome “perceived emergence” against “venture disbandment” as the dependent variable.</p>

<title>Explanatory Variables</title>
<sec id="section11-0899764012449517">
<title>Self-efficacy</title>
<p>We measure perception of self-efficacy using the five questions identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764012449517">Dimov (2010)</xref>. The questions employ a five point Likert-type scale. A confirmatory factor analysis reveals that three of the five items load on one factor and result in a satisfactory Cronbach’s alpha of 0.68 (corresponds to questions AY4 to AY8 from PSED 2). One could improve the fit by using only the questions AY6 to AY8 to 0.72. Nevertheless, we followed the recent approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764012449517">Dimov (2010)</xref> to make our results comparable to previously published studies and employ a measure comprising all five items. The original PSED 2 scale is inverted so that higher values indicate higher levels of self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Lacking detailed measures for perseverance that directly assess how entrepreneurs are likely to deal with adversity faced, we use two proxies that indicate the motivations underlying the entrepreneurial intentions. Both measures should proxy for how serious nascent entrepreneurs are in their effort provision during the nascent phase. We focus on two variants of “need for achievement” to proxy for perseverance. Entrepreneurs are characterized by a strong desire to accomplish tasks and their “need for achievement” incorporates expectations of doing things better than others and accomplishing tasks faster. Empirical analyses show that need for achievement has predictive validity when analyzing entrepreneurial success and failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012449517">Hansemark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764012449517">Winter, 2010</xref>). The factor analysis reveals two different factors on which the items load. We label them according to intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of why individuals engage in entrepreneurial activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0899764012449517">
<title>Need for achievement (intrinsic)</title>
<p>We identified four questions that measure the intrinsic need for achievement of nascent entrepreneurs on a five point Likert-type scale. Higher values correspond to a higher intrinsic need for achievement. A confirmatory factor analysis reveals that the four items load on one factor and result in a satisfactory Cronbach’s alpha of 0.76 (questions AW1, AW4, AW10, and AW14 from PSED 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0899764012449517">
<title>Need for achievement (extrinsic)</title>
<p>We identified three questions that measure the extrinsic need for achievement of nascent entrepreneurs on a five point Likert-type scale. Higher values correspond to a higher extrinsic need for achievement. A confirmatory factor analysis reveals that the three items load on one factor and result in a satisfactory Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79 (questions AW6, AW9, and AW12 from PSED 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0899764012449517">
<title>Nonprofit experience</title>
<p>PSED 2 asks respondents whether the previous employer was a public sector or government organization, a not-for-profit organization, a stable private sector business, a growing private sector business, or a declining private sector business. We administer the nonprofit experience in dichotomous form and create a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if the previous employer was a not-for-profit organization and zero otherwise.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0899764012449517">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>We operationalize experience of nascent entrepreneurs by referring to the most widely cited factors such as formal education (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764012449517">Dickson, Solomon, &amp; Weaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012449517">Evans &amp; Leighton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764012449517">Unger, Rauch, Frese, &amp; Rosenbusch, 2011</xref>), labor market experience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764012449517">Bosma et al, 2004</xref>), and entrepreneurial experience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764012449517">Bosma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764012449517">Robinson &amp; Sexton, 1994</xref>). The variables are calculated for solo entrepreneurs and teams. In the latter cases, we include the average levels of these factors.</p>
<sec id="section16-0899764012449517">
<title>Formal education</title>
<p>To collect PSED II data, respondents were asked to indicate the highest level of education each member of the entrepreneurial team had completed. We recoded this variable, ranging from elementary school to PhD, into number of years of education (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012449517">Davidsson &amp; Honig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012449517">Iacus, King, &amp; Porro, in press</xref>).</p>

<title>Empirical Methodology</title>
<p>In the following, we will present the results of the logistic regression using a dichotomous nonprofit variable and the measures of self-efficacy and perseverance, and also provide estimations that remove a covariate imbalance of nonprofit experience caused by self-efficacy and perseverance. Likely, perseverance and self-efficacy are correlated with the dummy variable indicating nonprofit work experience. Accordingly, to measure the impact of nonprofit experience, net of personal characteristics, we need to make sure that the correlation among the explanatory variables is removed in our empirical analysis. The table reports two set of results, three logistic regressions that follow a step-wise addition of personal characteristics, human capital and other control variables, and a second set of regressions that removes correlation among the personal characteristics and subsequently adds control variables. For the latter set, we employ coarsened exact matching (CEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012449517">Iacus et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764012449517">Singh &amp; Agrawal, 2011</xref>), which ensures a better balance between the treatment and control group. Consequently, the covariates in both groups are more similar and thus allow inferences despite potential correlation among treatment (nonprofit workers) and core characteristics (self-efficacy and perseverance) caused by the self-selection into nonprofit work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764012449517">De Cooman, De Gieter, Pepermans, &amp; Jegers, 2011</xref>). We rely on the implementation in Stata to choose the bins based on Scott’s rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764012449517">1992</xref>) rather than providing chosen cutoff points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012449517">Iacus et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764012449517">Marx, Singh, &amp; Fleming, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764012449517">Table 1</xref> summarizes the details for the underlying sample of this study including 674 nascent entrepreneurial ventures that either are operational/emerged (30%) or fully disbanded (70%). These performances within PSED II are similar to other studies analyzing new firm creation in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764012449517">Reynolds, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764012449517">Spletzer et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764012449517">Table 1</xref> presents the summary statistics and correlation matrix. Nascent entrepreneurs with nonprofit experience represent around 10% of the sample. On average, nascent entrepreneurs in the sample have an education equivalent to 15 years of schooling (with a standard deviation of around 2 years) and 13 years of work experience. Almost half of the entrepreneurs have been involved with a previous start-up, as co-creators and/or owners. Interestingly, nonprofit entrepreneurs are more likely to start a new venture within the health care segment. T-tests reveal that the percentage is some 10% higher and the differences in means are significant at the 10% level.</p>

Given the matching of nascent entrepreneurs based on self-efficacy and nonprofit experience, the number of observations drops in Columns 4 and 5. Hence, the implications relate to those entrepreneurs with nonprofit experience and their matched counterparts. Observations with no close match on core characteristics are pruned.</p>
<p>From the results, we can infer that when controlling for endogeneity through coarsened exact matching, the coefficient associated with nonprofit experience is positive and highly significant (ß = .236, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and ß = .270, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively). Moreover, the chances of the venture’s being perceived as emerged nearly double. This lends strong support to Hypothesis 3.

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Our work investigates the applicability of nonprofit experience to similar business environments. We test for performance impacts of previous nonprofit experience (controlling for endogeneity) and find robust evidence that nonprofit experience significantly increases the chances for new venture emergence. Despite the emphasis the literature places on several types of labor market experience, nonprofit experience can provide valuable insights into why certain entrepreneurs are successful and others fail. Given the similarities in work environments that are plagued by uncertainty and ambiguity, the task-relatedness and/or similarity might provide a comparative advantage when creating a new venture.</p>
<p>The findings also provide insights into the human capital that people who have worked in nonprofits gain and about the likely task applicability. Nonprofit work equips individuals with skills to succeed in resource-constrained environments. These benefits go beyond what is widely believed to be captured by personal characteristics (self-efficacy and perseverance) and general human capital. In fact, experience gained (controlling for the selection into these activities given personal characteristics) might prove useful in other managerial contexts. Given the emphasis some business schools put on volunteer work in both the selection of students and subsequent education of their students, there might be valuable insights gained for future managers through these work experiences that can complement the general knowledge that is acquired in colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764012449517">Mirabella, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence on increases in voluntary work participation among college students and the corresponding focus of colleges on these activities, documents a strong awareness of benefits that these programs might bring about. Accordingly, it might be interesting to further the results of this study by documenting when and under which circumstances nonprofit and voluntary experiences can be beneficial for individuals striving in various sectors and environments, starting one’s own business simply being one of these activities. While we see an emergence of education curricula dealing with nonprofit management, other disciplines might well learn from the theoretical, empirical, and practical insights from nonprofit scholars and practitioners alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764012449517">Bushouse &amp; Sowa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764012449517">Mirabella, 2007</xref>). In addition, understanding various facets of human capital composition might reveal more insights into the applicability of various components in practical settings.</p>
<p>Moreover, an awareness of knowledge and skills that is fostered through volunteer and nonprofit work might increase the number of individuals who are willing to engage in these activities in the first place and also increase the longevity of their commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764012449517">Griffith, 2011</xref>). Our work provides evidence that might inform the recent debate on the design of HR systems for nonprofit organizations and the structure of incentives. Our results document that nonprofit workers might be willing to face environments plagued by higher levels of uncertainty and ambiguity, if these provide autonomy and discretion in return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012449517">Ridder &amp; McCandless, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the number of pruned observations in our study warrants some caution about the generalizability of our results. In particular, the number of nascent entrepreneurs that do not have a close match should be investigated further. Recent work points towards other core characteristics that likely matter for entrepreneurs and nonprofit workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764012449517">Davis, Marino, Aaron, &amp; Tolbert, 2011</xref>). Finding further similarities across and within the different groups could inform our understanding of drivers of nonprofit work and the subsequent applicability of experiences gained.</p>
<p>Lastly, it might be worthwhile to extend the approach taken in this paper by investigating the business models of entrepreneurs with nonprofit work experience and their corresponding growth aspirations. Given the differences in underlying reasons for creating new ventures, measures of success (such as perception of an emerged venture) might differ when social motives are at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764012449517">Bagnoli &amp; Megali, 2011</xref>). Concerning the sector choices among nascent entrepreneurs, those with nonprofit experience are more likely to start a new venture within the health care segment. As a matter of fact, this might provide some evidence that entrepreneurial ventures can be a continuation of previous activities, and that founding one’s own firm might present a viable strategy for nonprofit workers to achieve their aspirations. Our intention is not to regard nonprofit work as a strategy to engage in subsequent entrepreneurial endeavors. Rather, we want to bring about the notion that nonprofit work might indeed help to start a business due to the characteristics that these environments share. Hence, the argument is rather that individuals in nonprofit environments can and should think about starting their own ventures to further pursue their individual careers and aspirations.</p>

<title>PSED 2 Questions for Measures Used in the Empirical Analysis</title>
<p>Perception of Emergence</p>
<p>A35: What was the first month and year in which monthly revenue was greater than all monthly expenses, including salaries for the owners active in managing the business?</p>
<p>A41: It would appear that you are (IF ONE OWNER: managing /IF TWO OR MORE OWNERS: helping to manage) an operating business—one with sales and revenue greater than the ongoing expenses including salaries. Would you agree with this description of the current status?</p>
<p>Nonprofit Experience</p>
<p>AX18: (Is/Was) this employer a public sector or government organization, a not-for-profit organization, a stable private sector business, a growing private sector business, or a declining private sector business?</p>
<p>Self-Efficacy</p>
<p>AY4: Starting this new business is much more desirable than other career opportunities I have. (Would you say that you strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree?)</p>
<p>AY5: If I start this new business, it will help me achieve other important goals in my life. (Would you say that you strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree?)</p>
<p>AY6: Overall, my skills and abilities will help me start this new business. (Would you say that you strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree?)</p>
<p>AY7: My past experience will be very valuable in starting this new business. (Would you say that you strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree?)</p>
<p>AY8: I am confident I can put in the effort needed to start this new business. (Would you say that you strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree?)</p>

<p>We also tested for the impact of gender in subsequent analyses. Firstly, we include a variable indicating whether a woman is involved with the team (or as the solo entrepreneur) and whether the respondent is female. Noticeably, the results indicate that females have lower chances to successfully found new ventures. However, once we control for self-selection and the personal characteristics that make individuals more likely to engage in nonprofit work prior to starting a new venture, the effect vanishes and gender is not among the decisive factors. Gender <italic>per se</italic> (although other studies might find otherwise) is likely not the main driving force of the reported results. Hence, we think that including personal characteristics into our decision analysis better captures the causal mechanisms underlying nonprofit work and subsequent entrepreneurial success. Results including gender variables are available upon request.</p>
