<p>It is a great pleasure to introduce this special issue, marking the 40th anniversary of the Masters degree course in Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene &amp;Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>Forty years is a significant period in any life, and – borne on the wave of a massive increase in computational power – there have been immense changes in the practice and teaching of statistics since Professor Peter Armitage welcomed the first cohort of students in 1969. It was therefore a great delight to be able to welcome Peter, together with over 250 alumni, students and staff (past and present) to the 40th anniversary symposium on 16th and 17th April 2009.</p>
<p>The symposium was titled ‘Statistical methods and medical research – new challenges for an old marriage’, and a wide-ranging programme encompassed issues with frequentist inference, adaptive trial design, drug safety, meta-analysis, genetic epidemiology, survival analysis, causal inference and missing data. This issue conveys a flavour of some of the rich variety of methodology and applications presented.</p>
<p>Tom Palmer and colleagues review the key role of Mendelian randomisation and the use of genetic variables as instrumental variables for estimating causal effects of modifiable risk factors on disease, with a particular focus on appropriate ways to use information from multiple genetic variants. In the second paper, Rhian Daniel and colleagues show how causal diagrams can be applied to clarify when, in the presence of missing data, an analysis restricted to complete records will be unbiased. Giorgos Bakoyannis and Giota Touloumi provide an accessible overview of the rapidly developing field of competing risks in survival analysis. Finally, Elizabeth Williamson and colleagues provide an insightful review of the various methods of adjusting for confounders using propensity scores.</p>
<p>Central to the ongoing success of the MSc has been both the enthusiasm and commitment of generations of students and staff, together with the continuing scholarships from the Medical Research Council, National Institute of Health Research and GlaxoSmithKline. During the meeting, the alumni recognised the continuing difficulties faced by students from low income countries, and inaugurated a new scholarship fund (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/eph/msd/scholarship/">http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/eph/msd/scholarship/</ext-link></underline>) which is intended to provide much needed financial support for such students.</p>
<p>The future is likely to see continued rapid development of the MSc, not least with increased use of e-learning. The success of such developments rest on the energy and commitment of alumni, students and staff: thus I am confident there will be much to celebrate in 10 years time!</p>
<p>Finally, I am grateful to the editor-in-chief, Brian Everitt, for supporting this special issue and for all the referees for their expertise and time reviewing the manuscripts.</p>
