<abstract>
<p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are receiving growing attention, which brings a unique opportunity to utilise solutions available to address them. These diseases are largely preventable; proven, cost-effective interventions are available; and when NCDs emerge, means exist to treat them, prevent complications, and to improve quality of life. Yet, there is a lack in progress in responding effectively to NCDs, and the current discussion and research focus predominantly on challenges rather than the opportunities, which this paper outlines.</p>

<sec id="section1-1403494812455112">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Today more people die of non-communicable diseases (NCDs (cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes)) than of any other cause and it is estimated that low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) bear 80% of this burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812455112">1</xref>]. Reflecting this, there is now unprecedented political attention towards NCDs at the global level, particularly with the High Level Meeting of the 2011 United Nations General Assembly focusing on these diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812455112">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Such attention provides a great opportunity for public health and development professionals, policy makers and civil society to move what has been a slow discussion forward and push for greater investment into NCD research, prevention and treatment. This is a chance which may not recur at such a high international level, but it is also linked to a serious risk. By failing to agree on binding targets and appropriate investment, we risk gaining nothing but rhetoric and the societal assumption of futility.</p>
<p>In addition, with time passing the NCD crisis grows, particularly in low-and middle income settings. We cannot afford to wait, and the time is now ripe for sustainable and swift action in order to curtail the rising pandemic of NCDs. This will not be achieved, though, if NCDs are falsely portrayed solely as a health issue and the focus of discussion continues to be limited to the challenges in addressing them. This article highlights the feasible, cost-effective opportunities associated with addressing NCDs – such global gains make addressing NCDs politically imperative and offers an opportunity for encouraging societal support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812455112">
<title>Health opportunities of the NCD pandemic</title>
<p>NCDs share risk factors (an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and environmental carcinogens) and therefore common opportunities for prevention. These risk factors along with environmental, economic, social and behavioural determinants in the population can be addressed through prevention and promotion of healthier lifestyles and living conditions. Population-wide strategies are both cheap and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812455112">3</xref>]. For example, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has shown to be a successful instrument to reduce tobacco-related deaths and disease globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455112">4</xref>] and this could be a model for intervention in other areas. Even modest changes in risk factors have a substantial public health benefit, with positive effects on other aspects of health and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455112">5</xref>].</p>
<p>There are documented ways of treating and managing NCDs to enable the majority of people affected by them to lead productive, full lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812455112">6</xref>]. Disease-management is also cost-effective and feasible in low resource settings and includes systematic referral, regular follow up and essential medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812455112">7</xref>]. NCD interventions should be integrated with already existing primary care systems through joint screening programmes, common guidelines and the combining of services – for example by integrating treatment for people with HIV with care for people with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812455112">8</xref>]. This would be both cost-effective and increase the resultant health impact. Furthermore, most NCDs develop slowly over many years and exposure to risks accumulates throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812455112">9</xref>], which means that there are opportunities for interventions throughout the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812455112">10</xref>]. So while early intervention offers a significant opportunity to prevent disease, it is never too late to improve the situation for people affected by NCDs.</p>

<sec id="section3-1403494812455112">
<title>NCDs as a unifier of stakeholders</title>
<p>NCDs affect populations regardless of nationality, religion or ethnicity and bring opportunity for countries to unite for a common purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812455112">11</xref>]. NCDs can thus help build political ties between countries and regions through the exchange of information and resources. This is exemplified by the Caribbean Group of States (CARICOM), who lobbied for and successfully proposed the UN High Level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812455112">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Further, addressing NCDs must be a government, cross-disciplinary task [10] where partnerships between national governments, the private sector, civil society, patient organizations and academia will optimize results by bringing awareness and support to NCD interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812455112">13</xref>]. Such a partnership is difficult to develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812455112">14</xref>], but as was successfully done in the up-scaling of the response to HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812455112">15</xref>], NCDs could become the next unifier of stakeholders working towards a tangible goal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812455112">
<title>Addressing NCDs brings development and economic savings</title>
<p>NCDs have a vast economic impact and the World Economic Forum describes the diseases as one of the greatest threats to global economic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455112">16</xref>]. Low-income groups are most at risk, due to increased exposure to risk factors and decreased access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812455112">13</xref>]. This has a negative effect on labour supply, productivity, and investment, which hamper social and economic growth – an estimated US$84 billion will be lost in LMICs between 2005 and 2015 owing to NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812455112">17</xref>]. Addressing NCDs consequently provides an opportunity for greater economic prosperity and development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494812455112">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Feasible solutions to address NCDs do exist. These diseases are largely preventable; proven, cost-effective interventions are available; and when NCDs emerge, means exist to treat them and prevent complications. Furthermore, addressing NCDs improves economic and social development. For this progress to occur on a population-level, though, the current global momentum must be used to reorient attention towards the gains associated with solving the NCD pandemic – gains which will reach far beyond health.</p>
