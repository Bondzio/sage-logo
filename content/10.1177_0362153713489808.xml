<p>It is an honor to have been invited by the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>(<italic>TAJ</italic>) coeditors to serve as the guest editor on this special issue dedicated to the counseling field. I feel honored on three counts.</p>
<p>First, as a counselor myself and a Provisional Teaching and Supervising Transactional Analyst, I have invested a good deal of energy in finding and defining my own professional identity in this field, one that is still so little known and recognized within the larger transactional analysis community. It is a struggle that most transactional analysis counseling trainees and professionals face and keep questioning. What are the specifics of the counseling field? What are its limits? In French, which is my native language, being a <italic>conseiller</italic> is not an officially recognized profession. You can be a real estate counselor, a marital counselor, a financial counselor, and so on. The term conseiller needs to be further specified, and this is a struggle French-speaking counselors have as we try to figure out what to call ourselves. However, this struggle is not specific to us but is shared by many counselors all over the world who struggle with this identity problem.</p>
<p>Second and foremost, this issue of the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>is the first to be produced by SAGE Publishing, one of the top international publishing houses for scholarly and academic journals. The <italic>TAJ</italic> Editorial Board and the ITAA Board of Trustees have invested tremendous energy, enthusiasm, time, and patience in negotiating this important step, for which I personally want to warmly congratulate and thank them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713489808">Cornell (2012</xref>) quoted SAGE as follows: “SAGE will focus on expanding the <italic>TAJ</italic>’s influence and reputation globally within our psychology, psychoanalysis, and counseling portfolio as well as in related domains throughout the social sciences and humanities” (pp. 2-3). Cornell went on to write, “The benefits of moving to SAGE for the ITAA and its members are many. The most important is that as of January 2013, the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>will be available to ITAA members in both hard copy and digitally” (p. 2). I am excited and proud that counselors describe their work, experiences, and expertise in this special issue, the first one we are publishing with SAGE.</p>
<p>Third, it has been a privilege to work with the talented counselors who have written for this <italic>Journal, </italic>and I have been deeply enriched by the warm, stimulating, challenging, respectful, and constructive cooperation I have had with each of them. I want to praise them all here and will introduce them below.</p>
<p>I was deeply engaged in the editorial process when last July I went to a magnificent baroque concert in a church in old town Geneva. As I was being swept up by the magic of the music, and as a violin player myself, I dreamed of the following metaphor.</p>
<p>Just as the violin has four strings, transactional analysis today recognizes four fields of application. While I was listening to the sound of the musicians tuning their instruments, I reflected on how each string is important, and how if one string were missing or totally out of tune, the violinist would have a hard time playing and attuning to the other instruments. Each string is specific, in density and quality and in how it feels under one’s fingers. Each has a different tone, covers a specific range of notes, and provides a special flavor to a note. The same note can be played on different strings, but then each one of them, though the same, will be unique.</p>
<p>They do share one thing in common. All four strings rest on a bridge. Under the bridge, between the two faces of the violin, lies what is called the <italic>soul</italic>, a cylindric piece of wood through which the sound vibrates, resonates, and thrives.</p>
<p>As I let myself feel the special sound of each string, I reflected again on the four fields of transactional analysis, how all four are important while being different, each with specific core competencies. I thought about how as a whole they are reminiscent of the four strings of the violin, vibrating through the soul, which in transactional analysis would include the philosophy of OKness, widening awareness, encouraging clear thinking and the capacity for spontaneity and intimacy, leading toward autonomy, allowing physis to thrive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713489808">Clarkson, 1992</xref>): like the sound of music through the soul of the violin.</p>
<p>To continue the musical metaphor, in this issue of the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>we have a septet, with seven musician-authors, each voice with its own special tune, each important and specific, and each contributing to further define counseling and its many facets.</p>
<p>First, William Cornell from the United States invites us on a trip back in history. Over the years, Cornell has been deeply involved in developing the counseling field and boosting the self-respect of many of us counselors. His thoughtful research and analysis helps us to become more aware and understanding of how “Eric Berne’s professional anxieties and biases were the ground in which counseling in transactional analysis came to be assigned a second-class professional status” and how his ideas came to be incorporated in the transactional analysis canon” (p. 7). Cornell further stimulates us to an interesting self-questioning on “the impact of Berne’s investment in creating a transactional analysis psychotherapy at the expense of other modes of facilitating learning and growth” (p. 7). This trip into the past is important and much needed to appreciate the place of the counseling field in transactional analysis today.</p>
<p>We then have the personal voice of N. Michel Landaiche, III, from the United States. In his article, “Working Within Limits,” he reflects on working as a mental health counselor for nearly 25 years and writes about his love for and commitment to his profession and clients. In an intimate way he writes about his own struggle and identity quest within the hierarchy of mental health professions wherein “psychiatrists are lords, psychologists the landed gentry, social workers the merchants with varied status and success, and counselors the street sweepers” and how this “denigrating construct has made it difficult to develop a professional identity and pride” (p. 15). Landaiche demonstrates the dilemma and struggles of working within time constraints, rules, and contracts while tending to the needs of specific clients from multicultural backgrounds. In his own sensitive way, he invites counselors to reflect on their practice and professional identity.</p>
<p>A third powerful voice is that of Liselotte Fassbind-Kech from Switzerland. In her article, “Counseling as a Treasure Hunt,” she focuses on one of the core competencies of counseling, working with resources, which is her favorite and which she experiences as life-enhancing for both her clients and herself. She expands on past, present, and future resources and presents them in a creative, comprehensive way on an axis of time. Through varied and lively case material, Fassbind-Kech demonstrates how she regards the major task of counselors as “helping their clients develop their awareness and abilities and to use and enhance their own resources and capacities to this end” and how this means “engaging in an exciting treasure hunt” (p. 25). She explains in an engaging way how she views counseling “as a journey of discovery that may lead to undiscovered or unexpected richness” (pp. 35–36).</p>
<p>In yet another voice, Margaret Bowater from Australia introduces an additional resource, taking us into the world of nightmares in her article “Fighting Back: Addressing a Nightmare in Counseling.” She explains how “dreaming itself, including nightmares, is a natural process during which conscious events trigger emotional responses that reach back into previous experiences” (p. 39). She writes about how in her work with nightmares she “concentrate[s] on the client’s need for immediate alleviation of distress allied to a conscious restructuring of script beliefs based in early childhood” (p. 39). Bowater emphasizes the importance of dreamwork for counselors, offers new and challenging ideas about how to speak with clients about dreams and nightmares, and provides engaging case material to illustrate her points.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by these authors, the work of counselors can be seen as “giving birth,” that is, accompanying clients to find their true self and the treasure of their own resources on their way toward autonomy. This leads us to the poetic voice of Maryse Dewarrat from Switzerland in her article “Preparing for a New Life: Midwifery and Transactional Analysis.” She takes us into her world as a midwife, explaining how as a counselor she introduces transactional analysis concepts into her work. She describes how “for men and women, the experience of pregnancy is like a pause in life, a special time I am privileged to share with them. The profession of midwifery is unusual in that it allows me to be present during the time that marks life without a child and then life with a child for both the woman individually and the couple as a unit” (p. 49). She goes on to explain how “both as a midwife and a transactional analyst, I can observe the upheavals in ego states that occur during this time of tremendous, expectant change” (p. 51). This observation, among others, led Dewarrat to develop a training program for future parents that she also now plans to offer to midwives and transactional analysis trainees.</p>
<p>For counselors, the “delivery room” can take many forms. In “Short-Term Counseling and Transactional Analysis,” Jan Grant from Australia illustrates how she works in brief therapy. Through her own practice and engaging case material, she defines five key elements that can be used to make short-term counseling effective. She emphasizes the real skills necessary to work effectively in a time-limited manner and takes us through an engaging discussion about holding the possibility of a one-session cure.</p>
<p>This septet would not be complete without the voice of Patrizia Vinella from Italy and her interesting and challenging discussion about counseling groups. In “Transactional Analysis Counseling Groups: Theory, Practice, and How They Differ from Other TA Groups” she reminds us of how Eric Berne began doing group treatment in a U.S. military hospital during World War II and how transactional analysis was born in a group setting. She focuses on the group setting and the group leader’s role in her efforts to define one type of counseling group, taking us through a thorough reflection and self-questioning in relation to one of her group experiences with teenagers.</p>
<p>I hope that you will have as much pleasure and curiosity as I did in discovering these various authors and their specific and rich voices, letting yourself be swept along by the music they compose in describing these many facets of the work of counseling.</p>
<p>Fassbind-Kech began her keynote speech during the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713489808">2011</xref> Transactional Analysis World Conference counseling symposium in Bilbao, Spain, with this challenging question: “If we are not merely second-rate psychotherapists, what else are we?” I recently read a book in which I found this wonderful sentence that I am translating here from the French: “At the heart of ourselves there is light. To wish to be like the other tarnishes it. Freedom calls for our own responsibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713489808">Hollander-Lafon, 2012</xref>, p. 107). My hope is that this issue of the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>will contribute to further defining the professional identity of counselors and their own light and to strengthening their sense of self-worth, pride, and freedom in the work they accomplish in this exciting field. I also hope that this will encourage counselors to come out of the shadows, to write further about their specific practice and expertise, and to thus gain recognition and respect for all counselors.</p>
