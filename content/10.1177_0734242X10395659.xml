<abstract>
<p>The recycling for recovery and reuse of material and energy resources undoubtedly provides a substantial alternative supply of raw materials and reduces the dependence on virgin feedstock. The main objective of this study was to assess the potential of dry municipal solid waste recycling in Mashhad city, Iran. Several questionnaires were prepared and distributed among various branches of the municipality, related organizations and people. The total amount of solid waste generated in Mashhad in 2008 was 594 800 tons with per capita solid waste generation rate of 0.609 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. Environmental educational programmes via mass media and direct education of civilians were implemented to publicize the advantages and necessity of recycling. The amount of recycled dry solid waste was increased from 2.42% of total dry solid waste (2588.36 ton year<sup>−1</sup>) in 1999 to 7.22% (10 165 ton year<sup>−1</sup>) in 2008. The most important fractions of recycled dry solid waste in Mashhad included paper and board (51.33%), stale bread (14.59%), glass (9.73%), ferrous metals (9.73%), plastic (9.73%), polyethylene terephthalate (2.62%) and non-ferrous metals (0.97%). It can be concluded that unfortunately the potential of dry solid waste recycling in Mashhad has not been considered properly and there is a great effort to be made in order to achieve the desired conditions of recycling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the most complex solid waste stream, in contrast to more homogeneous waste streams resulting from other sources of production such as industries or agricultural activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X10395659">Robert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X10395659">Troschinetz and Mihelcic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X10395659">Wang and Nie, 2001</xref>). Considering the rapid increase in waste generation and limited amount of land for landfill and also problems in obtaining new disposal sites, the improvement of solid waste recycling programmes must be recognized as one of the most feasible and practical solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X10395659">Alwaeli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X10395659">Narayana, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X10395659">Suttibak and Nitivattananon, 2008</xref>). Inappropriate MSW management poses serious environmental and public health risks. In general, waste management suffers from poor implementation of current regulations, lack of pilot studies before organization and planning and poor cooperation between specialists and authorities. Other problems include insufficient regulations and/or enforcement thereof, and financial restrictions in many developing countries such as Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X10395659">Agdag, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X10395659">Refsgaard and Magnussen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X10395659">Williams et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Development of science and technology-based industries has also contributed significantly to the increased volume and toxicity of waste materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X10395659">Nnorom et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X10395659">Sangodoyin and Ipadeola, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X10395659">Turan et al., 2008</xref>). Improper management of solid waste has been reported by several researchers in different cities of developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X10395659">Berkun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X10395659">Chung and Carlos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X10395659">Imam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X10395659">Sharholy et al., 2008</xref>). Those waste management strategies that focus on source reduction, resource recovery and reuse have proved to be more cost effective over time and they are less damaging to the environment, simply because they prevent or minimize waste generation at the source of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X10395659">Tchobanoglous et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of an adequate and integrated management of MSW includes the combination of waste production minimization, recycling, recovery of energy and various disposal options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10395659">Magrinho and Semiao, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Waste recycling, energy generation and employment opportunities from waste management also have immense potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X10395659">Kassim and Ali, 2006</xref>). The application of recycling, reuse, composting, waste-to-energy or other processes in order to recover materials and energy provides a substantial alternative supply of raw materials and reduces the dependence on virgin feedstock. The recovered products must meet the fundamentals of market resource security, meaning they should meet the requirements of reliable quality, quantity and price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X10395659">Cheremisinoff, 2003</xref>). Over the past few decades, particular attention has been paid to the reduction of solid waste generation via implementation of appropriate recycling programmes as a response to the increase in the cost of both waste collection and disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X10395659">Alavi Moghadam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10395659">Damghani et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The objective of the present study was to assess the potential of dry MSW recycling in Mashhad city, Iran, and also present an overview of the current situation with respect to dry solid waste recycling there.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>To investigate the current situation with regard to MSW management in Mashhad city, several questionnaires were prepared and distributed among various branches of the municipality, other related organizations such as the Mashhad composting plant and various sectors of the population (2220 among the population, 100 among municipality staff, 20 among composting plant workers, 76 among hospital workers and 450 among industrial units). The data collected for different MSW functional elements were based on response to the questionnaires, visual observations and sampling by the authors, available reports and several interviews and meetings with authorities, including engineers working in the municipality and the Mashhad composting plant. This study also involved estimation of waste composition by sampling the waste stream in each region of the city, providing 12 samplings collected for the entire city in each month (from waste collection trucks) between April 2007 and February 2008 (yielding 144 total samples). The geographical location of each city area, the season of the year and socio-economic conditions in the neighborhoods were recorded in the sampling program. Of 144 samplings, 10 came from higher class neighbourhoods, 97 samples from middle class neighbourhoods and 37 from poor class neighbourhoods (according to official data, civilians of upper class correspond to about 7% of total population, the middle class represent 67% and the lower class represent 26%). Closed garbage bags were randomly chosen from the contents of the trucks. For sampling, the total volume of waste in collecting vehicles was divided into four parts, and then each part was divided again to four parts to yield a 90.8 kg sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X10395659">Tchobanoglous et al., 1993</xref>). A total volume of 0.5 m<sup>3</sup> of waste was separated into food waste, garden waste, paper, board, plastic, polyethylene terephthalate, non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, glass, textiles, rubber, construction waste and miscellaneous components. After the separation, each type of waste was weighted and placed in a container of known volume, thus identifying the composition in terms of mass and volume. In order to compare the current situation with the desired situation of improved recycling and considering feasible and practical issues and also information in the literature about recycling rates in developed and developing countries, a recycling rate of 50% was defined as desired and 80% as ideal.</p>
<p>Samples of food waste and garden waste were taken to the laboratory to measure their moisture content. Samples of about 380 g were obtained after breaking up the last three samplings and were placed in a furnace at a temperature of 130°C. The mass selection and temperature of analysis were based on the ASTM standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X10395659">ASTM International, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Solid waste generation and its characteristics</title>
<p>At the present time the MSW of Mashhad city is collected daily by a semi-mechanical method. The waste materials are picked up from the point of generation and transported to the different types of collection vehicles including 6 to 12 ton traditional and mechanical collection trucks from 0700 to 1800 h. About 560 trips are made each day for collection of MSW. Medical wastes are also collected daily from unspecified points near the hospitals and clinics. The collected wastes are transported to a landfill site with area of 1 500 000 m<sup>2</sup>, located 5 km from Mashhad city. The texture of the soil is limey and the site is surrounded by rocks. In the case of medical wastes, they are first coated with lime and then landfilled. Also note that a composting facility with capacity of 500 ton day<sup>−1</sup> is producing 60 tons of compost daily. The solid waste generation rate in Mashhad over a 7-year period is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X10395659">Figure 1</xref>. The total waste generated has gradually increased over the studied period of time as a direct result of population growth and industrial development. The total amounts of solid waste generated in Mashhad during 2007 and 2008 were 565 750 and 594 800 tons, respectively. The results show that per capita solid waste generation rate in Mashhad in 2008 was 0.609 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. In comparison, the per capita solid waste generation rate wa 0.88 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in Tehran)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10395659">Damghani et al., 2007</xref>), 1.21 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X10395659">Suocheng et al., 2001</xref>) and 0.95 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X10395659">Metin et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, in a study carried out by Troschinetz et al. (2009) of 23 case studies in developing countries, the average MSW generation rate was 0.77 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X10395659">Troschinetz and Mihelcic, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>More than 74% of solid wastes in Mashhad (2008) were made up of household and commercial waste materials and the other types of solid waste including hospital, Industrial and construction wastes comprised less than 24% of the total waste stream in 2008. Household and commercial solid waste composition depended on several factors such as dietary habits, cultural traditions, life-style, climate and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X10395659">Mor et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The quantity of each type of waste can be helpful in planning the management of solid waste. For example, in terms of the design and operation of composting plants or temporary storage of dry solid waste materials that could be sold for reuse or reprocessing (such as plastics, paper, metals, glass, etc.). The results of physical analysis showed a predominance of organic waste (76.3%), which itself comprised food waste (57.1%) and garden waste (19.2%). This shows a high potential for composting of MSW in Mashhad.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10395659">Figure 2</xref>, the major element in dry SW of Mashhad is plastic (28.6%), which is comprised of 110 ton day<sup>−1</sup> of different types of plastic including high- and low-density polyethylene films which is enough to supply a large recycling plant. Different types of plastic can be used in various household and commercial applications, mostly as packing plastics for storage of waste materials and the manufacture of different plastic tools and toys. Used plastics are typically collected by the informal recycling sector and the material is usually sent to traditional and semi-industrialized private workshops for reuse and reprocessing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10395659">Figure 3</xref>). This recycling practice is unduly awkward and the supply flow is unreliable. Therefore, there are opportunities for recyclers in the informal sector to obtain low cost material. These private workshops typically are small operations with elementary assemblies for grinding, milling or melting of scavenged plastics. Usually four or five workers handle all stages of these kinds of recycling processes in each workshop. The average price of different types of plastic recovered from the waste stream (including low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene films and rigid polystyrene) is about 220 US$ per tonne.</p>

</fig>
<p>Increasing the public awareness of the advantages of source separation in preventing transmission of contamination by recycled plastics and converting informal recycling to formal under the supervision of governmental authorities can enhance the quality of secondary products and reduce the impacts on public health. Installing special receptacles for collecting discarded plastics on an occasional basis either in the home or on the streets, seems to be an appropriate mechanism for collecting more discarded plastics for use as secondary materials. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and dishes (1.2%) comprise the lowest constituent of dry SW in Mashhad. These waste PETs subdivide to cooking oil packaging (21%) and drinking packaging (79%).</p>
<p>Another major fraction of dry solid wastes in Mashhad is comprised of paper (10.7%). Waste papers are mostly comprised of newspaper (4.3%) and white papers (6.4%) with a total mass of 41.2 ton day<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>The averages cited in the characterization data indicate that about 8% of solid waste (disposable nappies, hazardous waste from households such as batteries, sprays, some contaminated rubbish from toilets or bathrooms, and others) of Mashhad city should be landfilled, while the remaining (subdivided to organic garbage and different fractions of dry solid waste including plastics, paper, metals, etc.) could potentially be reused and recycled. Also in terms of the organic waste fraction, composting is a suitable option. According to data available in the literature on 19 case studies solid waste streams in developing countries consist of 70% recyclable materials and about 17–80% organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X10395659">Troschinetz and Mihelcic, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Solid waste recycling</title>
<p>In order to enhance the recycling programmes in Mashhad, over the last decade environmental educational programmes via mass media and direct education of civilians along with preparation of physical devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X10395659">Figure 4</xref>) were implemented to publicize the advantages and necessity of recycling, source separation and minimization of solid waste generation at the point of production or generation. It must be mentioned that special educational programmes were carried out by employees in the private sector which is responsible for collection of MSW under the supervision of the municipality. Educators carried out house-to-house teaching activities in six regions of Mashhad city for 2 years, covering approximately 50% of the population of Mashhad. A comparison of the current situation of dry SW recycling with the past is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X10395659">Table 3</xref>. The amount of recycled dry SW was increased from 2.4% of total dry SW (2588 ton year<sup>−1</sup>) in 1999 to 7.2% (10 165 ton year<sup>−1</sup>) in 2008.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X10395659">Figure 5</xref>, the most important fractions of recycled dry SW in Mashhad (2008) included paper and board (51.3%), stale bread (14.5%), glass (9.7%), ferrous metals (9.7%), plastic (9.7%), PET (2.6%) and non-ferrous metals (0.97%).</p>

<p>It should be noted that good markets exist in Mashhad and other cities in Iran, especially in terms of waste plastics, metals and paper and board. At the present time the private sector is handling this kind of recycling to a limited extent, which can be developed under organized programmes and supervision of responsible authorities. These recycled waste materials are sold to various industries on the industrial estates of the cities as secondary raw materials for production of different goods. In a study of recycling in Bangkok, Thailand, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X10395659">Suttibak and Nitivattananon (2008)</xref>, it was found that the largest component of recyclable waste consisted of black and white paper (38.90%), followed by mixed plastic bottles, glass, cardboard, and newspaper (13.01, 11.68, 10.18 and 9.94%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X10395659">Narayana, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X10395659">Table 4</xref> provides a comparison of the overall recycling of dry SW in Mashhad and some other cities in the world.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X10395659">Figure 6</xref> indicates that current rates of recycling of different components of dry solid wastes have to significantly increase to achieve an acceptable recycling rate. For example only 1.9% of total waste plastics or 17.6% waste paper and corrugated cardboard is recycled, despite all the recycling programmes that have been implemented.</p>

<p>The collection and final disposal of solid wastes in Mashhad follows a pattern that is very similar to that of most Iranian cities and the findings of this research show that improvement of the current situation and incorporating mechanical systems is necessary to enhance the safety, health and efficiency of collection in the terms of time and labour.</p>
<p>The most important objective of any solid waste management programme is to handle waste at a reasonable cost while minimizing the adverse environmental effects. A well-planned recycling programme can help to both create job opportunities and conserve material resources.</p>
<p>We believe it is important for municipal officials to include a media-based public information programme in their efforts to launch and expand recycling activities. These programmes typically cover the environmental and socio-economic benefits of recycling as well as describe procedures for efficient waste separation and collection. Also, it is often effective to include penalties for the large solid waste generators (industries, institutions and organizations), financial encouragements for people and institutions to achieve higher recycling rates, facilitating recycling activities for the public by providing collection points and improvement of recycling technology. The most important of these mechanisms would be the separation of solid waste at the source of production.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Highlights of this study’s findings are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X10395659" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The rate of MSW recycling in Mashhad is not as great as desired.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The main challenges are design, planning, and implementation of a suitable recycling programme.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Waste characterization revealed the potential to recycle as much as 110.2 tons of plastics, 81.1 tons of paper and board and 37.9 tons of textiles each day.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>About 710.2 tons of food wastes and 239.2 tons of garden wastes can be composted each day.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>About 8% of solid wastes (disposable nappies, hazardous waste from households such as batteries, sprays, etc., some contaminated rubbish from toilets or bathrooms and others) of Mashhad City should be sent to landfill.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>About 92% (subdivided into organic waste and dry waste) of solid waste materials could potentially be reused and recycled.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>By improving the rate of recycling from 7.2 to 80%, the overall costs of waste management can be reduced by an average of approximately 21%, considering the costs of collection and transportation and landfilling equal to US$4300 per ton of solid waste.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>According to the data obtained during this study, it can be concluded that unfortunately the potential of dry SW recycling in Mashhad has not been considered properly by the people and authorities. It must also be mentioned that there is a long way to go in order to obtain the desired conditions for conservation of materials, environment and natural resources via recycling programmes in Mashhad city.</p>
