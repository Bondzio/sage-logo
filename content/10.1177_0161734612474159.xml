<p>In ultrasound-based elastography methods, the estimation of shear wave velocity typically involves the tracking of speckle motion due to an applied force. The errors in the estimates of tissue displacement, and thus shear wave velocity, are generally attributed to electronic noise and decorrelation due to physical processes. We present our preliminary findings on another source of error, namely, speckle-induced bias in phase estimation. We find that methods that involve tracking in a single location, as opposed to multiple locations, are less sensitive to this source of error since the measurement is differential in nature and cancels out speckle-induced phase errors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The measurement of shear wave velocity, particularly in soft tissue, is of interest to several groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0161734612474159">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0161734612474159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0161734612474159"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0161734612474159">10</xref></sup> Assuming a linear elastic material of constant density, the shear wave velocity is proportional to the square root of the tissue stiffness, which in turn has been shown to be a useful parameter in the detection of disease. In ultrasound-based elastography methods, the process of estimating the shear wave velocity usually involves the tracking of scatterer displacements due to an applied force. Errors in this displacement estimation are propagated through the process and ultimately affect the estimates of the shear wave velocity and thus the estimates of shear stiffness. These errors are often attributed to electronic noise and decorrelation due to physical processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0161734612474159">11</xref></sup> Some of the results in our earlier work indicate that there exists another source of error, namely, a speckle-induced bias. This bias was discovered on closer inspection of the estimates of shear modulus within a linear elastic phantom, using two different elastographic methods (spatially modulated ultrasound radiation force [SMURF] imaging and sonoelastography). In the following sections, we first present the relevant portions of our findings from that earlier study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0161734612474159">12</xref></sup> and then our methods and results from our investigation on this speckle-induced bias.</p>
<p>SMURF imaging was validated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0161734612474159">13</xref></sup> using standard mechanical testing (MTS) and sonoelastography in uniform gelatin and Zerdine™ (CIRS Inc., Norfolk, Virginia) phantoms. The results showed good agreement between all three methods. In the SMURF method, a spatially varying acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) was generated by a linear array transducer. The resulting shear wave of known wavelength was generated within a homogeneous phantom. By tracking the speckle at a single location and using cross-correlation techniques, the temporal frequency of the shear wave was estimated and used to calculate the shear modulus.</p>
<p>In the sonoelastography measurements, an electromagnetic shaker was used to vibrate a phantom at a known frequency. This motion generated a forward traveling shear wave. At two locations, a known distance apart, the same linear array transducer was used to measure the shear-wave-induced displacements, which differ by only a phase shift if attenuation is neglected. The shear wavelength was estimated using the phase shift between the two signals, and this was in turn used to calculate the shear modulus.</p>
<p>In both methods, several echoes were acquired at the tracking locations within a homogeneous phantom. To create estimates of shear modulus as a function of depth, the phase shift (sonoelastography) or temporal frequency (SMURF) was calculated for each sample of the RF echo signal and then converted to a shear modulus.</p>
<p>In the sonoelastography case, it was found that the trial-to-trial variation was insignificant compared with the variation within the depth of field in the estimates. This indicated that the variation was not due to random noise, as it would have been minimized when the data from the various echo lines were averaged, but rather it was due to a correlated noise source. In contrast, the trial-to-trial variation in the SMURF estimates was comparable with the variation within the depth of field and thus indicated that the estimates were limited by random noise.</p>
<p>One explanation for the correlated noise in the sonoelastography experiment is the effect of shearing. Shearing can cause variations in the shear modulus estimates because it creates a range of displacements within the tracking beam, and the resulting displacement estimate is an average of these displacements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0161734612474159">14</xref></sup> As portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0161734612474159">Figure 1</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0161734612474159">15</xref></sup> higher excitation frequencies result in a greater amount of shearing since all the scatterers are not displaced uniformly as the shear wave propagates through.</p>

<p>However, in a sonoelastography experiment performed in a gelatin phantom, phase shifts were measured and plotted for three different distances between the lateral tracking locations (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0161734612474159">Figure 2</xref>). Beam spacing values of 0 mm, 0.885 mm, and 1.77 mm were used. The intertrial standard deviations associated with the beam spacing values were 0.0026, 0.0040, and 0.0043 radians, respectively. The intratrial standard deviations, which represent the standard deviation of the phase shift estimates over a total depth of 1.9 cm, were 0.0021, 0.3328, and 0.281 radians, respectively. The Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0 mm case is not exactly the same as the autocorrelation. Here, the correlation can be thought of as being between the even samples and the odd samples, each with some random noise component. This is consistent with the other cases as the echoes from the two tracking locations were not collected simultaneously, and the time between echoes collected at one location was twice the pulse repetition period. When Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0 mm, that is, the same speckle was used in the calculation, the phase estimates had a standard deviation in the region of interest that was comparable with the random error. The other two lateral tracking distances were greater than the tracking beam width and yielded repeatable measurements with much higher variation over the region of interest. These results suggested that random noise and shearing were not the main reasons why the trial-to-trial variation was insignificant compared with the variation in the phase difference estimates.</p>

The intertrial standard deviations were 0.0026, 0.0040, and 0.0043 radians, respectively. The intratrial standard deviation—the standard deviation of the phase shift estimates over depth (total of 1.9 cm)—was much smaller for the Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0 case (0.0021) than for Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0.886 mm (0.3328) and Δ<italic>x</italic> = 1.77 mm (0.2810). The small trial-to-trial variation in phase estimate compared with the overall variation in the estimates suggests the variation is not due to inadequate signal-to-noise ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0161734612474159">13</xref></sup> The mean phase shift is not zero for the case when Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0 mm because the tracking echo signals were not acquired simultaneously.

<p>An important difference between the SMURF method and other elastography methods such as sonoelastography, lateral time-to-peak (TTP), and supersonic shear wave imaging is that they determine the shear wave arrival time difference or phase shift by tracking speckle in two different locations, while SMURF determines the arrival time information by tracking speckle in a single location. We hypothesize that the displacement tracking along an A-line is biased by strong speckle because scatterers whose echoes interfere constructively at a point slightly off the beam axis will be tracked in preference to a weaker on-axis speckle. Consequently, at different depths, there is a speckle-induced variation in the path length, and there is thus a location-dependent underestimation or overestimation of the phase shift. SMURF, however, is a differential measurement because the same speckle is being used in calculating the arrival time difference. This suggests that using the same set of scatterers during tracking to determine the shear wave velocity could potentially reduce the variation in the estimates because the speckle-induced bias is circumvented.</p>
<p>The amount of variation due to this bias has not been examined until now. In this preliminary work, we examine the effect of speckle-induced bias on the estimates of shear wave velocity and thus shear modulus. We examine the effect of echo signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the choice of beam spacing on the variation in shear modulus estimates using both single tracking location (STL) and multiple tracking location (MTL) algorithms. Shear modulus estimation methods that track the displacement of speckle in different lateral locations will be termed <italic>multiple tracking location</italic> methods, while those that track the shear-wave-induced displacements from a fixed point will be referred to as <italic>single tracking location</italic> methods.</p>

<title>Simulation</title>
<p>The STL and MTL algorithms were compared using one-dimensional (1-D) and 2-D simulations. The 1-D simulations (FIELD II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0161734612474159">15</xref></sup>) were performed to show the effect of the position of a single scatterer within a tracking beam, on the estimates of shear modulus. The 2-D simulations were performed using a finite-element model (FEM; COMSOL Multiphysics), and included potential effects associated with the pushing beam shape and choice of material properties. The 2-D simulation was used to explore the effect of the distance between the pushing beams (STL) or tracking beams (MTL), as well as the effect of SNR, on the shear modulus estimates.</p>

<p>The shear wave is modeled as a 1-D-struck string problem, wherein the resulting velocity wave is a replica of the impulsive forcing function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0161734612474159">12</xref></sup> The forcing function is proportional to the pushing beam intensity, which is modeled as having a Gaussian profile.

<p>The general assumption with the MTL methods is that the path length between the scatterers in the two tracking beams is the distance from the middle of one tracking beam to the middle of the next. Essentially, it is as if the scatterers being tracked are located in the middle of their respective beams. If the scatterers within both tracking beams are exactly offset to the left or right of their respective beam centers, the assumed path length is still accurate. However, this is not the case in reality.</p>
<p>The effect of this speckle-induced change in path length was investigated in a 1-D simulation by placing a single scatterer within each tracking beam (no shearing present) and then offsetting the scatterers in the beams by varying amounts. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the tracking beam in both methods was 0.7 mm. In the MTL method, the scatterer in one beam was placed in the middle of its corresponding beam while translating the scatterer within the other beam in steps of 0.1 mm to the left or right of its beam axis. The distance between the tracking beam centers was 3 mm.</p>
<p>In the STL method, only one tracking beam was employed, and the scatterer within this beam was also translated in steps of 0.1 mm to the left or right of its beam axis. The distance between the pushing beams was 3 mm.</p>
<p>In both methods, each scatterer was displaced by 10 µm using a single-frequency sine wave at 500 Hz. The tracking of the induced displacements was simulated using FIELD II. The finite-time difference of the displacement data was used to derive the velocity-time waveforms. The arrival time difference was estimated using cross-correlation techniques. The shear modulus estimate was then derived from (2), where the beam spacing is assumed to be 3 mm. The shear modulus was set at 2 kPa by choosing a shear wave speed of √2 m/s (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0161734612474159">Equation 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Finite-Element Simulation</title>
<p>Using COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, Massachusetts), a 2-D plane strain, FEM of a linear elastic material was created. The material had an elastic modulus of 6 kPa, density of 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.499. The acoustic radiation force, <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x,z</italic>), was proportional to the pushing beam intensity. The push beam was generated in FIELD II by simulating a 4.2 MHz VF7-3 linear array transducer with F/2.7 and a 200-cycle-long pushing pulse. The push beam was then imported into COMSOL as a forcing function. The force amplitude was scaled and applied to the mesh for 50 µs. The push beam was focused at 3 cm, and the radiation force was scaled to result in a 20 µs peak displacement at the point of application in the FEM. The resulting displacements in a 2-mm-wide-by-1-cm-tall region centered around the focus, at distances 3 mm and 5 mm away from the push (i.e., Δ<italic>P</italic> = 2 mm), were applied to a corresponding 2 mm by 1 cm set of random scatterers. To mimic the STL ARFI method, the displacements generated at the two locations are applied to the same set of random scatterers. For the MTL ARFI method, the displacements were simply applied to different random scatterer sets to mimic the differing speckle between the two tracking locations. The shear modulus was then estimated as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0161734612474159">Figure 3</xref>. This FEM included Rayleigh damping with a stiffness damping parameter, β = 10<sup>−6</sup> s, and a mass damping parameter α = 1 s<sup>-1</sup>. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 7.5 kHz. The FEM, unlike the 1-D simulations, included potential effects associated with the pushing beam shape and choice of material properties.</p>
<p>To explore the effect of the distance between the pushing beams (STL) or tracking beams (MTL), the separation between the locations at which the displacements were extracted from the mesh was varied from 1 mm to 4 mm. The same process outlined above was used to estimate the shear modulus. White Gaussian noise was band-passed to match the bandwidth of the VF7-3 transducer, and then added to the simulated tracked RF data. The noise was added to generate simulated RF echo data with SNR levels of 10 dB (low) and 30 dB (average).</p>

The beam-formed RF echo data was sampled at 40 MHz and digitized with 16-bit resolution. The probe has 192 elements of 0.2-mm pitch and 7.5-mm height. The elevation focus is fixed at 3.75 cm. The center frequency of both the push and track pulses was 4.21 MHz. The push pulses were 200 cycles long, while the track pulses were 2 cycles long. A Hanning apodization geometrically focused at 2 cm was used on transmit. Dynamic focusing and apodization were used on receive. The pushing beam width is chosen to be twice that of the tracking beam width to mimic a more uniform displacement of the scatterers and thus minimize shearing effects within the beam.</p>
<p>In the STL ARFI algorithm, the acoustic radiation force was applied at two locations, <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, 2.1 mm apart, and the induced shear waves were tracked at a location, <italic>T</italic>, 1.8 mm from <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0161734612474159">Figure 4a</xref>. The shear modulus estimate is associated with the region between the two pushing pulses. This sequence of pushing and tracking is known as an ensemble. To map out the shear modulus of a region of interest, the entire ensemble is simply translated laterally. The shear modulus of the region between the pushing pulses is estimated by cross-correlating the velocity data to attain the arrival time difference.</p>

<p>For the MTL ARFI algorithm, the acoustic radiation force is applied to the material at a location <italic>P</italic>, and the induced shear waves are tracked at the force application point and then at increasing lateral distances from that pushing location as portrayed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0161734612474159">Figure 4b</xref>. The distance from the pushing location to first tracking location is 1.8 mm, and the distance from the first tracking location (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the last tracking location (<italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic>) is 2.1 mm. The shear wave is thus tracked over a lateral region that is 2.1 mm wide, with each track location placed approximately 0.35 mm from the previous one.</p>

<title>Data Processing</title>
<p>The post-push tracking echoes were received at a PRF of 7.5 kHz. The received echoes were up-sampled to 320 MHz using a low-pass interpolation filter. The displacements were estimated using a windowed normalized cross-correlation on the reference and post-push echoes. A window length of 1.5 mm was used along with a 39 µm search region. Subsample precision in finding the location of the peak of the cross-correlation function was achieved by applying a parabolic fit to the peak sample and its neighbors. The data used in estimating the shear wave speed was confined to the depth of field and was calculated to be approximately 7 mm.</p>
<p>In the STL ARFI algorithm, the finite-time difference of the slow-time displacement was calculated to get the velocity data. The velocity data associated with the two pushes were first up-sampled by a factor of 10 using linear low-pass interpolation, and then cross-correlated to extract the arrival time difference between both waves. This was repeated for every axial sample and lateral ensemble. In calculating the average shear modulus over depth or within a region, the cross-correlated velocity waveforms with a correlation coefficient less than 0.5 were ignored.</p>
<p>Two methods were used to process the MTL data. In the first method, the same data-processing algorithm described for the STL case was used in acquiring the shear wave arrival time difference at each axial sample and lateral ensemble, but in this case, the displacement data was from the first and last tracking locations (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic>). This method was used in the FEMs. In the second method, the displacement over time as tracked by the beams at <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> <italic>through T<sub>N</sub></italic>, are used to calculate the shear wave speed as outlined by Palmeri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0161734612474159">16</xref></sup> For each lateral location, the time it took to reach the peak displacement is recorded and plotted against the distance of that lateral location from the pushing location. A linear regression is performed on the Time-to-Peak (TTP) data. The inverse slope of the regression line represents the shear wave speed in the tracked region. This was repeated for every axial sample and lateral ensemble. In calculating the average shear modulus over depth or within a region, a goodness-of-fit threshold (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8) was applied. This lateral TTP method was used for the phantom and excised porcine liver experiments.</p>

<p>Two tissue-mimicking phantoms were made from deionized (DI) water, gelatin and cornstarch. The softer phantom was made from 100-bloom gelatin, while the stiffer phantom was made from 200-bloom gelatin. Cornstarch powder was added to provide ultrasound scattering and attenuation. Glutaraldehyde was added to the mixture to accelerate the gelatin cross-linking process. The mixture was poured into a mold, which was then sealed and rotated for at least 12 hours. On solidification, the phantom was removed from the mold and stored in mineral oil. The phantoms are cylindrical in shape. Each phantom has a radius of 4 cm and is 7 cm in height.

<p>The effect of the speckle-induced change in path length was investigated in a 1-D simulation by placing a single scatterer within each tracking beam (no shearing present) and then offsetting the scatterers in the beams by varying amounts. The FWHM of the tracking beam in both methods was 0.7 mm.

<title>Effect of Beam Spacing and Echo SNR</title>
<p>The amount of variation in the modulus estimates is affected by the relationship between the size of the error in the estimates of the arrival time difference and the true arrival time difference. Specifically, the error in the estimates of the arrival time difference relative to the true arrival time difference decreases as the push beam distance (STL) or track beam distance (MTL) increases. The error in the shear modulus estimates is expected to be inversely proportional to the push beam spacing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0161734612474159">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0161734612474159">Table 1</xref> show the data for both algorithms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0161734612474159">Table 1</xref> contains the average shear modulus estimate for both methods with different beam spacings, as well as the standard deviation of the measurements.

<title>Speckle-Induced Bias versus Jitter</title>
<p>Errors in shear wave velocity estimation using transient elastography methods are a function of jitter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0161734612474159">11</xref></sup> shearing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0161734612474159">14</xref></sup> variation in the intensity field/out-of-plane propagations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0161734612474159">17</xref></sup> motion artifacts, and dispersion. The results presented thus far are consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to these other sources of variation, there is a correlated noise source that is associated with transient elastography methods that track displacements at multiple locations to estimate shear wave velocity. This noise source is due to the fact that stronger speckle are tracked preferentially, and they may be located off the axis of the tracking beam. The consequence is that the propagation path length, which is often approximated as the distance from one tracking axis to the next, is a variable.</p>
<p>The results from the 1-D simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0161734612474159">Figure 5</xref>) show the effect of the speckle-induced path length changes by tracking a single scatterer. Specifically, when the scatterer is offset in such a way that the true path length is shorter than the assumed path length, the arrival time difference is smaller and the shear modulus is estimated as being larger than it actually is since <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-0161734612474159">

</inline-formula> and the beam spacing was assumed to be fixed. Inversely, when the scatterer is offset in such way that the true path length is longer than the assumed path length, the arrival time difference is larger and the shear modulus is estimated as being smaller than it actually is. The use of a single scatterer, in addition to making it easier to visualize the changes in path length, also eliminates the shearing component.</p>
<p>One way to circumvent this problem is to use the same set of speckle when performing the shear wave velocity estimation as is the case with STL methods. Using the same set of speckle makes the calculation a differential one, so that an identical bias is present in both sets of the estimated displacement data and is subtracted out. Averaging the results from multiple iterations of the experiment can reduce the random error component. The speckle-induced bias, however, cannot be removed this way. It can, however, be reduced by spatial averaging, but doing this detracts from the resolution. The implication of a significant reduction in the variation of the shear modulus estimates is that the precision of the estimates will be improved, which would then enhance the elastographic image quality and the diagnostic value of the estimates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0161734612474159">Figure 6</xref> shows the intertrial variation in a 10-iteration finite-element simulation using both algorithms in the same model. Interestingly, while it is true that the STL algorithm has consistently better correlation coefficients, both algorithms have good correlation coefficients (greater than 0.94), which suggests that the estimates are likely of good quality and that there is actually a variation in the arrival time difference. In other words, even in a simulation where the correlation coefficients are relatively high in both methods, the variation of the estimates is still seen to be greater in the MTL method than in the STL method. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0161734612474159">Figure 6c</xref>, the arrival time differences of the different depth samples over the 10 trials is almost symmetrically distributed, but since the calculation of the shear modulus involves the inversion of the arrival time difference, <inline-formula id="inline-formula3-0161734612474159">

</inline-formula> the resulting shear moduli do not have a symmetric distribution. In addition, the MTL method has larger variations in the arrival time estimates than in the STL method, and these variations are further magnified with the inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0161734612474159">Figure 6b</xref>). For these reasons, there is often a bias in the MTL measurements in addition to the variation within the estimates, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0161734612474159">Figure 6a</xref>.</p>
<p>The variation in the shear wave velocity estimates due to this speckle-induced bias can be quite significant as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0161734612474159">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0161734612474159">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0161734612474159">9</xref> demonstrate. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0161734612474159">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0161734612474159">9</xref>, the estimates are found at a single location within a gelatin phantom (~0.9-kPa shear modulus) and an excised porcine liver tissue sample, respectively, over the depth of field of the ultrasound pushing beam. Repeated measurements in the same location using both methods result in different amounts of variation in the estimates. In both a relatively nondispersive material (the gelatin phantom) as well as in a viscoelastic medium (the excised liver tissue), the variation in the shear modulus values is larger when multiple tracking lines are used than when a STL is employed. We expect that the more viscous a material is, the greater the distortion (amplitude loss and spreading) of the tracked shear wave displacement waveform. The greater the distortion, the harder it becomes to accurately extract the arrival time difference between the induced shear waves. This will affect both STL and MTL methods, and presumably, the variation in the estimates of shear modulus as a result of this distortion will eventually become comparable with the speckle-induced bias. So far, however, in the experiments in excised porcine liver—which is known to have a viscous component—the improvement in the estimates from the STL method is still clear.</p>
<p>In cases where motion, whether physiologic or otherwise, is present, it is expected that the degradation of the STL method performance will be determined by the degree to which the motion results in a decorrelation of echoes collected along a single track line.</p>
<p>In the phantom and liver experiments, the lateral TTP MTL algorithm was used in the estimation of the shear moduli. The use of additional tracking lines within the region of interest improved the variation within the estimates, but this variation was still greater than that found in the STL measurements.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0161734612474159">Figure 8</xref>, the estimates from all the trials over the depth of field are used to calculate the mean and standard deviation at different lateral locations within two gelatin phantoms of shear modulus values of ~0.9 kPa and ~4.5 kPa. The phantoms are fabricated in-house, and great care was taken to make the phantoms as homogeneous as possible. The choice of shear modulus values for the gelatin phantoms represents the lower and higher end of shear modulus values reported in normal to cirrhotic human liver tissue. The standard deviation of shear modulus estimates within different regions of two phantoms is significantly larger in the MTL case than in the STL case.</p>

<title>Echo SNR and Beam Spacing</title>
<p>The benefit of tracking in a single location is decreased at low echo SNR. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0161734612474159">Figure 10</xref> and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0161734612474159">Table 1</xref>, the SNR was infinite, representing the ideal scenario. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0161734612474159">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0161734612474159">Table 2</xref>, show the effect of reduced SNR on both methods. A smaller improvement in the STL estimates over the MTL estimates is seen when significant noise is present in the simulation data. This is intuitive, as one would expect a significant amount of variation in the estimates as the noise level increases. Comparing the data from the 30-dB noise level and the infinite SNR case suggests that beyond a certain point, increases in SNR will not result in a significant reduction of the variation in the estimates.</p>
<p>Another parameter that can be altered to control the amount of variation in the estimates is the beam spacing. Larger distances imply longer arrival times. Since the error in the estimates of the arrival time difference falls within a relatively small range, the size of that error relative to the true arrival time difference will decrease as the push beam distance (STL) or track beam distance (MTL) increases.</p>
<p>This effect can also be visualized using simple error propagation methods:</p>
<p>In general, if <italic>G</italic> = <italic>G</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is some function of <italic>x</italic>, then the error in <italic>G</italic>, <italic>∂G</italic>, as a function of the error in <italic>x</italic>, <italic>∂x</italic>, is given by,</p>

<p>The error in the shear modulus estimates is thus seen to be inversely proportional to the push (track) beam spacing. This beam spacing dependence can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0161734612474159">Figure 8</xref>. It is harder to see the dependence in the case of the STL method because both methods were plotted on the same scale. Selecting an arbitrarily large spacing, however, is not practical. Furthermore, dispersion can distort the shear wave before it arrives at the tracking location, and the distortion of the shear waves can ultimately result in inaccurate estimates of the shear modulus.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have shown that phase-shift/arrival time errors due to speckle can be a significant source of jitter in transient elastography methods that involve displacement estimation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that slightly off-center speckle with a strong signal will be tracked in favor of weaker on-axis speckle, and that this results in a variation in the propagation path length that is dependent on the location of the speckle within the tracking beam. Tracking at a single location subtracts out this speckle noise in shear wave velocity estimates because the same scatterers are being used.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit in using a STL is derived when the echo SNR is good (&gt;20 dB), and when there is minimal distortion of the shear wave shape and minimal transducer motion.</p>
