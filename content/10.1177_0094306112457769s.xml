<p>One of the most interesting parts of China’s current social and political scene is the remarkable frequency of local protests, upwards of 100,000 per year and rising, according to official estimates. Protests occur in China today in a variety of settings and in response to a variety of causes: labor conditions and missing wages, land seizures, environmental disasters, building collapses, official corruption, and treatment of people with illnesses and disabilities, for example. The protests in the village of Wukan in the fall of 2011 brought the world’s attention to land seizure protests in China. As observers have pointed out, these protests often have a striking resemblance to patterns of protest at earlier times in China’s history, with appeals to higher officials to remedy the bad behavior of local officials or other local power holders.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is now possible to assess these similarities, thanks to Ho-fung Hung’s <italic>Protest with Chinese Characteristics: Demonstrations, Riots, and Petitions in the Mid-Qing Dynasty</italic>. Hung addresses exactly this issue in an historical context. He looks at the period of 1740–1839 and finds that the character of protest and resistance varied throughout the period. This is the early modernization period of Chinese history. One of the distinctive features of Hung’s position is his view that Chinese “modernity” did not begin with the nineteenth-century crisis of encounter with the West, but rather began a full century earlier, stimulated by more endogenous causes (p. 4). The grasp of the central power of the state increased during this period, and it also represented a major advance in the commercialization of Chinese society. Hung believes that the subject of popular unrest has been overlooked in this period.</p>
<p>Hung highlights two large questions: did patterns of popular protests in mid-Qing China parallel the cycles of rise and fall of centralized state power and market prosperity; and how did Confucianist ideology contribute to distinctive patterns of protest during this early modern period (p. 16)? He breaks the period into three distinctive combinations of state power, market strength, and the moral legitimacy of the emperor: 1740–1759 (centralized state power, market prosperity, emperor’s moral legitimacy all high); 1760–1799 (centralized state power unravels, commercial prosperity high, emperor’s moral legitimacy low); and 1800–1830 (centralized state power and market economy in crisis, emperor’s moral legitimacy high). His research goal, fundamentally, is to see whether there are patterns that emerge in the protests that occurred during these three periods that will perhaps shed light on the factors that influenced them.</p>
<p>Methodologically, we can summarize Hung’s approach as providing a structured temporal account of the period in question and three potential causal-structural factors that differed across the three sub-periods; and then a quantitative and qualitative study of the protest episodes that are partitioned by this framework. Hung makes the point that large-scale rebellions were rare during this period in China, but that protests concerning local issues and officials were frequent.</p>
<p>The main source of data on protests during this period that Hung analyzes is the <italic>Veritable Records of the Qing</italic>, a compendium of shortened versions of edicts and memorials from the emperor and other officials. Out of the 2,096 volumes of this archive, Hung identifies 514 events of popular protest and 450 events of petitions to higher officials (p. 55). His empirical work involves coding hundreds of contentious events during the period, classifying them, and looking for patterns of change over time. But how to categorize these disparate events? Here is Hung’s overview description of his approach: “I classify the documented protest events into different types according to their claims and repertoires. A protest’s claim is a set of articulated demands advanced by the participants. The repertoire of a protest is the set of learned or invented acts that the protesters performed to attract the attention of potential participants and the authorities, as well as to persuade or force the authorities to meet their demands” (p. 58).</p>
<p>Each event is assigned information on three questions: the demands, the actions involved in the protest, and the locale and year of the protest (p. 59). In addition, Fung classifies events as “state resisting”/“state engaging” and “non-violent”/“violent.” He then examines the frequency trends that the inventory of events demonstrates. For the period as a whole, state-engaging protests represented 35 percent of the total, while state-resisting protests represented 65 percent (Table 2.3). However, this pattern changes significantly over time. State-engaging protests increase from 21 percent to 36 percent to 61 percent over the three sub-periods, while state-resisting protests show symmetrical decline (Table 3.1). Further, he provides more detailed descriptions of a number of incidents from each period to focus on some of the background social, economic, and political factors that appear relevant.</p>
<p>Here are a few generalizations that he derives from studying the 1740–1959 period: (1) protesters commonly respected the legitimacy of state regulation, (2) there were recurring repertoires of protest, (3) literati elites were involved as participants or organizers, and (4) participants came from widely different social backgrounds (pp. 96–98).</p>
<p>One distinction between protest events that he draws from the existing literature on contention and rebellion is between backward-looking and modernizing protests. Essentially the former represent demands to secure existing rights (or re-establish recently extinguished rights). The latter take the form of proactive protests aimed at creating new opportunities and rights within an emerging set of economic or social institutions. Hung rightly rejects the idea that the European experience can provide a full theory of contentious politics. So he insists on using the evidence of non-Western movements as an alternative basis of analysis and theory. China’s experience in the mid-Qing era provides an ample basis for arriving at such a scheme.</p>
<p>Hung doubts the utility of the concept of “backward-looking” protest in the mid-Qing period. Instead, he argues that protests throughout the period were proactive and aimed at securing better outcomes in the future for the protesters, in light of changing political and economic conditions. The large distinction that Hung favors as a way of categorizing contention has to do with the purpose and style of the mobilization. “Filial protest,” or “state-engaging” protest, involves collective action intended to implore the state to honor its obligations. “State-resisting” protest involves action deliberately designed to challenge the authority and power of the state, often with the threat or reality of violence (p. 58). And Hung believes this scheme is valuable for China, in part, because some surprising patterns emerge through these lenses. In particular, he finds the frequency of state-resisting protest varies significantly along this timeframe, from a high point in 1600–1644 of 94 percent to a low in 1740–1759 of 40 percent, rising again between 1776 and 1839 (Figure 6.1).</p>
<p>Hung’s account highlights several important things about Chinese protest. First is the point that protests exist within a set of material social arrangements that provide the interests that lead to mobilization. So an important dimension of analysis for uncovering the causes of a wave of protests is to analyze the changing economic and political circumstances that created new pressures and opportunities for ordinary people. Second is the point that culture and repertoires of resistance give form to the protests that emerge. Here he gives explanatory importance to Confucian ideas about the state, but also to heterodox ideas stemming from non-Confucian traditions, for example, White Lotus Buddhism.</p>
<p>A very old feature of Chinese protest involves the delivery of petitions to the central government (emperor) to protest abuses by local officials, tax farmers, or other scourges of peasant life. Hung refers to these as “filial-loyal” demonstrations. The 2011 protests in Wukan village demonstrated many instances of this kind of protest. “In Qing times (1644–1911), a common remedy for powerless subjects abused by local officials was to travel all the way to Beijing to appeal to the emperor as their grand patriarch, hoping that he would sympathize with their plight and penalize corrupt local officials” (p. 1). And, as Hung points out, this tradition has continued through 1989 and beyond.</p>
<p>This is historical sociology done at a particularly high level of both historical and sociological rigor. Hung has a good grasp of the historical research that has been done on rebellion and unrest in China over the period of four hundred years. He also has developed a credible way of using the data sources that are available to form a clear picture of the frequency and causes of protests during the century on which he focuses. The book is an important contribution to the task of understanding contentious politics in China’s modern history.</p>
