<p><italic>Taking the MYP Forward</italic> has been written to help current and prospective International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP) schools and practitioners gain a fuller understanding of the landscape of middle years education in general, and of the MYP in particular. The book represents a lively and varied collection of views and opinions from educators around the world as to how the MYP might be taken forward. One of the book’s strengths is the manner in which it highlights the need for a course of study that is aligned with what we know about the changes in adolescent behaviour during these crucial middle years. There is a concern expressed, however, that the British university system may be too rigid in its thinking when it comes to evaluating the merits of the MYP.</p>
<p>The book is particularly useful for those new to the MYP, while at the same time offering very meaningful guidance and insights to those who are more familiar with the programme. It is divided into four distinct parts, which serve to take the reader on a logical journey from how the MYP is structured, to looking at the programme in practice, to the challenges of implementation, finishing with two experienced school heads speculating on the future of middle-years schooling. One of the overarching questions that continues to resurface is whether or not the MYP is an adequate preparation for the IB Diploma Programme. Ultimately the book answers in the affirmative, although there is no denying the fact that the nature and delivery of the MYP can and do vary according to the school and the cultural context in which it is offered.</p>
<p>In the first part of the book we are introduced to how the MYP seeks to focus the students upon content knowledge in tandem with the development of an array of skills and attitudes. There are also timely reminders of the challenges posed by what is to a large extent a school-designed curriculum that needs to articulate with both the IB Primary Years and Diploma Programmes. There is no attempt to hide from or disguise this quite unlikely juxtaposition. In the book’s second chapter, Wilf Stout makes a strong case for the need truly to understand the nature of adolescent development before embarking upon any form of curriculum design. This highly spirited chapter stresses the value of matching active and inquiring learners to a curriculum that has been designed to promote moral and intellectual curiosity. Unsurprisingly the contention is that the MYP is extremely well-equipped to provide such a framework.</p>
<p>In the second part of the book the MYP receives great credit for the manner in which it encourages students to make interdisciplinary links and to be interculturally aware. What most impresses Eif Phillips is the fact that students who are able to make these links between subjects are more likely to be able to recognize real world applications of their knowledge. This part of the book argues with great conviction about the value of students playing an active role in their learning in a manner consistent with best MYP practice. Janet Field launches a persuasive defence against the charge that interdisciplinary teaching undermines academic rigour, pointing out that collaborative planning can mount a worthy argument against subject specific insularity. That said, a strong sense of realism runs through the book in general, which highlights the fact that MYP programmes function most effectively when timetabling and curriculum documentation are designed to serve the delivery of the programme. Éanna O’Boyle suggests that the greatest virtue of the programme is its ability to foster creativity in students, with its open-ended and cross-disciplinary tasks. This creativity enables students to tackle complex problems in unfamiliar situations. He goes on to argue that creativity builds self-esteem. O’Boyle does acknowledge, though, that unbridled moral creativity may ultimately be unpalatable. To his credit, he questions the extent to which some of the MYP documentation is truly advocating creativity.</p>
<p>The argument that the MYP is a curriculum that develops socially responsible students resonates throughout this part of the book, with the IB Learner Profile and the Areas of Interaction coming in for particular praise and focus. Lest our enthusiasm runs away with us, though, we are given a dose of harsh reality by Adam Brown, Maggie Dickson and Sally Smitheram, who highlight the extreme importance of language acquisition in the maintenance of cultural identity. Reality sets in for many of us who recognize the challenges inherent in developing language policies and programmes that do justice to this need.</p>
<p>In the third part of the book we are presented with some of the issues that make MYP implementation a unique challenge within schools. Eric Robertson speaks with great conviction when he suggests that further work needs to be undertaken to fully understand the specific demands placed upon MYP coordinators. The fact that the programme often straddles middle school and high school, with teachers who are more comfortable in the high school terrain, makes for many tensions. The emphasis on external examination grades can often lead teachers to be dismissive of the MYP, which they see as too dissimilar to the IB Diploma Programme in terms of rigour and examination preparedness. Dominic Currer echoes the general sentiment throughout the book when he emphasizes the need to put the students’ needs first. He argues that for the MYP programme really to flourish, consideration must be given to the structure of the school day so that the timetable is designed to promote student learning in a manner consistent with current research into the adolescent brain. Matthew Albrighton concludes his chapter with an extremely useful list of strategies designed to facilitate successful implementation of the MYP, perhaps the most useful of which is the call for bravery, so that the programme can be implemented without recourse to compromise.</p>
<p>The last part of the book examines the future of middle years schooling, with numerous references to the importance of personalized learning. Throughout this book the writers have been somewhat conscious of the accusation that school-designed curriculum can be seen as lightweight. In this part, however, we are being convinced that what students really benefit from is a curriculum that includes rigour and creativity, and that is international and inspirational in nature. The MYP at its best has the capacity to meet the needs of the 21st century learner, but the book demands that schools re-evaluate how they structure their schools in order to do true justice to an outstanding programme.</p>
<p><italic>Taking the MYP Forward</italic> is interesting on many levels as it seeks not only to provide an honest and balanced account of the merits and pitfalls of the implementation and delivery of the MYP, but also offers a highly accessible overview of current thinking into how students learn best. Clearly the over-riding message of the book is meant to endorse the quality of the MYP, but there are genuine attempts to offer words of caution where they are due. To the MYP newcomer, the book offers an excellent route into the MYP, offering constant reassurance that the MYP’s underlying principles and motives are utterly consistent with what we know to be best practice in teaching and learning.</p>
