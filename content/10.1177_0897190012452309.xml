<abstract>
<p>Stroke is a major cause of death and disability and, as such, is associated with a heavy socioeconomic burden. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, and AF-related stroke tends to be more severe and poses a higher risk of recurrence than non-AF-related stroke. Anticoagulant prophylaxis with warfarin is effective in preventing stroke in eligible patients with AF, but in real-world practice this agent, though inexpensive, is underutilized. Moreover, warfarin has notable drawbacks that result in suboptimal anticoagulation and, as a result, greater disease burden and higher costs. Newer oral antithrombotic drugs with a wide therapeutic window and no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring may be as efficacious as warfarin and, given the costs associated with managing warfarin therapy, they may also prove to be more cost effective.</p>

<title>Burden of Stroke</title>
<p>In the United States, approximately 795 000 individuals experience a stroke on an annual basis, with stroke accounting for 1 in 18 of all deaths.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452309">1</xref>
</sup> Worldwide, 15 million people each year suffer a stroke, of which approximately one third are fatal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012452309">2</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012452309">3</xref>
</sup> As more people live into old age, the absolute number of strokes continues to increase. Patients who have had an initial stroke remain at risk for recurrent strokes, with 20% of men and 25% of women 65 years of age or older being at risk for recurrence in 5 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452309">1</xref>
</sup> A stroke can be particularly devastating to patients’ functional status; 15% to 30% of stroke survivors remain permanently disabled, and 20% of these individuals require care in a long-term care facility for 3 months following the event.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012452309">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Stroke and associated disability impose a considerable economic burden on both individuals and healthcare systems. The mean lifetime cost per patient with an ischemic stroke in the United States is $140 048.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452309">4</xref>
</sup> The main initial cost driver for these patients is inpatient care, which accounts for 70% of costs in the first year following a stroke.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452309">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452309">4</xref>
</sup> However, when considering the overall economic burden of stroke, long-term nursing home care for disabled patients is the primary expense, averaging more than $50 000 per year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012452309">5</xref>
</sup> Health care costs also escalate with increasing stroke severity. A study in a French cohort of 435 patients with brain infarctions showed that the mean per-patient cost over the first 18 months after a stroke increased from 10 530 € (Euros; $9161 2002 US dollars [USD]) for patients with a modified Rankin score of 0 to 1 (no or minor symptoms) to 34 809 € ($30 284 2002 USD) for patients with a modified Rankin score of 4 to 5 (moderate-to-severe disability).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012452309">6</xref>
</sup> In addition to lost productivity, patients returning home after an acute stroke frequently incur costs associated with structural modifications to their homes and mobility aids to facilitate activities of daily living.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452309">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to its economic impact, stroke also has a profound detrimental effect on the quality of life of patients, as well as on their caregivers. Overall, stroke survivors have been shown to have significantly lower mean scores for mental health, physical health, health utility, and self-rated health when compared with patients who have not experienced this condition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012452309">8</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, studies have shown that the caregivers of stroke patients may experience significant psychiatric comorbidities (eg, depression and anxiety), as well as impaired quality of life and physical burden. In one study, the physical and mental health of caregivers was consistently poorer than age-adjusted population norms, with poorer mental health and cognitive functioning in the patient being associated with poorer mental health in the caregiver.<sup>

<title>Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Stroke</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, affecting more than 2.2 million Americans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452309">1</xref>
</sup> This arrhythmia is an independent risk factor for stroke, conferring a nearly 5-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012452309">10</xref>
</sup> At least 15% of all ischemic strokes are associated with AF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>
</sup> The risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF increases with age, with the annual risk increasing from 1.5% in patients aged 50 to 59 years to 23.5% in those aged 80 to 89 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012452309">5</xref>
</sup> The annual risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF who do not receive antithrombotic therapy is approximately 5%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Several studies have reported that strokes associated with AF are likely to be more severe compared to strokes in patients without the arrhythmia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012452309">12</xref>

</sup> Patients with AF who suffer a stroke are also more likely to be bedridden or severely dependent in activities of daily living compared with those in sinus rhythm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012452309">12</xref>,

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012452309">16</xref>
</sup> In addition, the presence of AF in patients who experience stroke has been shown to confer a higher mortality rate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012452309">13</xref>,

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012452309">16</xref>
</sup> In a 40-year follow-up of the Framingham Heart Study, AF was associated with a nearly doubled 30-day mortality and greater 1-year mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012452309">9</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, in an analysis of 105 074 patients who had a documented stroke (30% of whom had AF), the risk of death was 50% higher in patients with AF compared to those without the arrhythmia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012452309">13</xref>
</sup> Similarly, in a large Italian population-based study, the presence of AF in patients who had experienced a first ischemic stroke was associated with higher 30-day and 1-year mortality rates compared to patients without AF.<sup>

<title>Current Approach to Stroke Risk Stratification in AF</title>
<p>Stroke risk in patients with AF varies, depending largely on the presence or absence of additional risk factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>
</sup> Numerous risk stratification schemes have been developed that show wide differences in risk categorization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012452309">17</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012452309">18</xref>
</sup> The CHADS<sub>2</sub> index is a commonly used and well-validated scheme for stratifying stroke risk in patients with AF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012452309">19</xref>
</sup> With the CHADS<sub>2</sub> index, a cumulative score (range 0-6) is calculated, with 1 point each assigned for <bold>c</bold>ongestive heart failure, <bold>h</bold>ypertension, <bold>a</bold>ge of at least 75 years, and <bold>d</bold>iabetes mellitus, and 2 points each assigned for a previous <bold>s</bold>troke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)—CHADS<sub>2</sub> is an acronym for all of these risk factors. This risk stratification system has been previously validated and shown to be associated with a 1.5-fold increase in the stroke rate for each 1-point increase in the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.</p>
<p>Given the predictive value of the CHADS<sub>2</sub> index, this scoring system has been recommended by the most recent American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for antithrombotic therapy for stratifying patients with AF into various risk categories for stroke.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>
</sup> The purpose of this risk stratification process is to determine the most appropriate antithrombotic therapy for these patients. Patients are considered to be at low, intermediate, or high risk for stroke if they have a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0, 1, or at least 2, respectively.</p>
<p>While the CHADS<sub>2</sub> index is the most validated risk stratification scheme for patients with AF, it is important to note that other scoring schemes have also been evaluated in this population. One risk stratification scheme in particular, CHADS<sub>2</sub>-VASc, was recently recommended in the updated AF guidelines developed by the European Society of Cardiology as a more comprehensive risk factor assessment method in patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 to 1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012452309">20</xref>
</sup> This system differs from CHADS<sub>2</sub> in that it recognizes vascular disease, female gender, and age 65 to 74 years as risk factors for stroke. However, because the CHADS<sub>2</sub> scoring system has been well validated and is fairly easy to use in clinical practice, the recently updated ACCP guidelines have continued to recommend this scheme as the primary approach for stroke risk stratification in patients with AF.<sup>

<title>Current Pharmacologic Approaches to Stroke Prevention in AF</title>
<p>According to the recently updated ACCP guidelines, the most appropriate antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF should be determined based on their CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>
</sup> For patients who are considered to be at high risk and have a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of at least 2, oral anticoagulant therapy is preferred over aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. In patients who are not candidates for oral anticoagulant therapy for reasons other than bleeding, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended over aspirin monotherapy. Oral anticoagulant therapy is also recommended, rather than aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, for patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 1, who are considered to be at intermediate risk for stroke. For those patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0, who are considered to be at low risk for stroke, either no antithrombotic therapy or aspirin is recommended. However, the updated guidelines have suggested that no antithrombotic therapy be used in this low-risk population since the risk of bleeding with aspirin may exceed its benefit in this particular group.</p>
<p>Warfarin has historically been the standard of care for stroke prevention in AF for patients considered to be at intermediate or high risk for stroke. Warfarin has been shown to be significantly more effective than aspirin<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012452309">21</xref>
</sup> or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing strokes in patients with AF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012452309">22</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the net clinical benefit associated with warfarin increases with higher CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012452309">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At the same time, however, warfarin has a number of well-recognized limitations that make its use challenging in patients with AF. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, with the desired international normalized ratio (INR) range in patients with AF being 2.0 to 3.0. The importance of maintaining an INR within the therapeutic range was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 21 studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012452309">24</xref>
</sup> In this analysis, the risk of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in patients with AF who were anticoagulated suboptimally (INR &lt; 2.0) compared with patients maintained at an INR ≥ 2.0. In addition, patients who were over-anticoagulated (INR &gt; 3.0) had a significantly higher risk of bleeding compared with patients maintained at an INR ≤ 3.0. Therefore, regular INR monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments are required for all patients with AF who are receiving warfarin. Additionally, there is significant interpatient and intrapatient variability in dose response with warfarin, which can be attributed to a number of factors including food and drug interactions, pharmacogenetic influences, and comorbid conditions.<sup>

<title>Poor Adherence to Guidelines</title>
<p>Despite the availability of guidelines to assist practitioners with selecting the most appropriate antithrombotic therapy in their patients with AF, several studies have demonstrated that these recommendations are often not followed in clinical practice. A systematic review found that less than 60% of patients with a history of stroke or TIA and less than 70% of patients at high risk of stroke (CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 2 or higher) received prophylaxis with an oral anticoagulant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012452309">26</xref>
</sup> In a retrospective study involving 3646 patients with AF or atrial flutter at a major teaching hospital in France, only 53% of patients received guideline-adherent antithrombotic therapy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012452309">27</xref>
</sup> The remaining patients were either undertreated (31%) or overtreated (16%). Overall, guideline adherence was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and stroke compared with undertreatment. In a multivariate analysis, antithrombotic undertreatment was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality and stroke in these patients.</p>
<p>The recent Euro Heart Survey on AF also showed that, in the real-world setting, antithrombotic guideline recommendations are frequently not implemented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190012452309">28</xref>
</sup> Among the 4086 patients with AF, only 58% were treated according to guidelines, whereas 16% were overtreated and 26% were undertreated (ie, oral anticoagulants were withheld from patients with no bleeding risk factors). Among the 3634 patients who were at high risk for stroke, 61% were treated in accordance with the guidelines, 11% were overtreated (i.e. oral anticoagulants were used in patients with bleeding risk factors), and 28% were undertreated. At 1 year, the incidence of any thromboembolism or the combined end point of cardiovascular death, thromboembolism, and major bleeding was significantly higher in the undertreated group compared with the group that was adherent to the guidelines. Although the risk of stroke was higher in the undertreated group compared with the guideline-adherent group, this difference was not statistically significant. The risk of major bleeding was higher in the overtreated group than in the guideline-adherent group; however, this difference was also not statistically significant.</p>
<p>The US-based National Anticoagulation Benchmark Outcomes Report retrospectively analyzed stroke prevention practices in 945 hospitalized patients with AF at 38 teaching, community, and US Veterans Administration hospitals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0897190012452309">29</xref>
</sup> Among patients at high and moderate risk of stroke (86.1% and 6.5% of the total population, respectively) who were candidates for warfarin, only 54.7% and 54.1%, respectively, actually received this antithrombotic therapy. Neither warfarin nor aspirin was used in 20.6% of the high-risk patients or 29.5% of the moderate-risk patients. Aspirin monotherapy was used for stroke prevention in 24.7% and 16.4% of patients in the high-risk and moderate-risk groups, respectively.</p>
<p>An analysis of patients from the Atrial Fibrillation: Focus on Effective Clinical Treatment Strategies (AFFECTS) registry demonstrated that warfarin is not only underprescribed in high-risk patients but also overprescribed in low-risk patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190012452309">30</xref>
</sup> In this study, only 73% of patients in the rate-control cohort and 66% of patients in the rhythm-control cohort, both with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of at least 2 (ie, high risk), received warfarin. However, in patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of less than 2, warfarin was prescribed in 60% and 49% of patients in the rate- and rhythm-control cohorts, respectively. In addition, there was evidence of overprescribing for patients at low risk of stroke (ie, CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0). Approximately 40% of patients in the rate-control and rhythm-control groups with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 were receiving warfarin at the end of the registry.</p>
<p>Reasons for underuse of warfarin in routine clinical practice cited by general practitioners and cardiologists often include inappropriate concern over potential contraindications, such as fear of use in the elderly individuals, fear of bleeding, and concerns about patients not being compliant with treatment or monitoring recommendations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0897190012452309">31</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190012452309">32</xref>
</sup> Patient-related factors contributing to underuse of and noncompliance with warfarin include the inconvenience of obtaining regular INR monitoring, need for dietary restrictions because of potential food interactions with warfarin, and poor understanding of their stroke versus bleeding risk (ie, underestimation of stroke risk and overestimation of bleeding risk).<sup>

<sec id="section7-0897190012452309">
<title>Poor INR Control</title>
<p>The INR is considered to be the best measure of efficacy for warfarin therapy in patients with AF. In recent clinical trials, patients receiving warfarin for stroke prevention spent only 62% to 68% of the time in therapeutic range (TTR).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012452309">34</xref>

 </sup>Outside of the clinical trial setting, the amount of time spent in the target INR range is even less. In a retrospective cohort study of patients with AF treated in US outpatient practices, the mean TTR for patients receiving warfarin was only 48%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012452309">34</xref>
</sup> In a retrospective study involving 1511 patients with AF being followed in routine clinical practice in the United States, Canada, France, Italy, and Spain, only 32% to 50% of patients with INRs measured during at least 60 days of treatment with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) were maintained in the target INR range for at least 70% of the time; 11% to 36% of patients were in the target INR range for less than 50% of the time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190012452309">35</xref>
</sup> In a French study of 278 patients with nonvalvular AF seen in routine clinical practice, those with poor INR control were shown to experience an increased risk of stroke or bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012452309">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Underadherence to anticoagulant therapy has been significantly associated with suboptimal anticoagulation and low INR measurements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0897190012452309">37</xref>
</sup> Missing 20% to 30% of doses has been associated with up to a 2-fold increased risk of subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Because suboptimal anticoagulation can increase the risk of ischemic stroke, adherence to anticoagulant medication is critical in the management of AF.</p>

<title>New and Emerging Antithrombotic Therapies for Stroke Prevention in AF</title>
<p>Several oral antithrombotic agents have been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or are in development for stroke prevention in patients with AF. These oral anticoagulant drugs include the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. In October 2010, dabigatran was approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Rivaroxaban was approved for use by the FDA in July 2011 for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, and in November 2011 for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Two large phase 3 clinical trials with apixaban have recently been published,<sup>

</sup> and phase 3 clinical trials with edoxaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF are ongoing. Overall, these new and emerging oral anticoagulant drugs may offer a number of advantages over warfarin therapy, including more predictable dose–response relationships, lack of requirement for routine coagulation monitoring, and substantially fewer food and drug interactions.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012452309">40</xref>
</sup> In this study, 18 113 patients were randomized to receive dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, or adjusted-dose warfarin (titrated to a target INR of 2.5 [range 2.0-3.0]). Patients received dabigatran in a blinded fashion; however, warfarin use was open label. The primary efficacy outcome of this study was stroke or systemic embolism, while the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The median follow-up period was 2 years. The primary end point occurred at a rate of 1.69% per year in the warfarin group, 1.53% per year in the dabigatran 110-mg group, and 1.11% per year in the dabigatran 150-mg group. Based on these results, both dabigatran groups were shown to be noninferior to warfarin. However, superiority was also assessed, and the dabigatran 150-mg group was shown to be superior to warfarin in reducing the primary end point. The rate of major bleeding was 3.36% per year in the warfarin group, 3.11% per year in the dabigatran 150-mg group (<italic>P</italic> = .31 vs warfarin), and 2.71% per year in the dabigatran 110-mg group (<italic>P</italic> = .003 vs warfarin). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was significantly lower in both dabigatran groups (0.12% per year for 110 mg and 0.10% per year for 150 mg) than in the warfarin group (0.38% per year; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Overall, the mean TTR in this study was 64%; however, the mean TTR for the 951 sites participating in RE-LY ranged from less than 57.1% to greater than 72.6%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012452309">40</xref>
</sup> When assessing the outcomes in the RE-LY trial relative to each center’s mean TTR, the primary efficacy results remained consistent within the dabigatran 150-mg and 110-mg groups compared to the warfarin group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0897190012452309">41</xref>
</sup> In the same way, similar significant reductions in intracranial hemorrhage were observed within both dabigatran groups compared to the warfarin group. However, with regard to major bleeding, for each center participating in the study, fewer events were observed in the dabigatran 150-mg group compared to the warfarin group at a lower TTR, while the rates were similar between the groups at a higher TTR. The rates of major bleeding were lower in the dabigatran 110-mg group than in the warfarin group, regardless of the center’s TTR.</p>
<p>Even though the 110-mg and 150-mg dabigatran dosing regimens were evaluated in the RE-LY trial, only the 150-mg dose was approved by the FDA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190012452309">42</xref>
</sup> A lower, 75-mg dose was also approved for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 15 to 30 mL/min; however, it is important to note that dabigatran has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment, because patients with a CrCl less than 30 mL/min were excluded from RE-LY. Moreover, the 75-mg dose has not yet been evaluated in a randomized, prospective clinical trial in patients with AF.</p>
<p>Two sets of AF guidelines have recently provided guidance regarding the role of dabigatran for stroke prevention in patients with this arrhythmia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190012452309">43</xref>
</sup> The updated AF guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society have recommended that dabigatran be considered as an alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and risk factors for stroke or systemic embolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190012452309">43</xref>
</sup> Based on these guidelines, patients with prosthetic heart valves, hemodynamically significant valvular disease, a CrCl less than 15 mL/min, or advanced liver disease would not be considered appropriate candidates for dabigatran therapy. The most recent ACCP guidelines have also included recommendations regarding the role of dabigatran for stroke prevention in patients with AF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452309">11</xref>
</sup> These guidelines suggest that dabigatran should be used, rather than warfarin, in patients with AF for whom oral anticoagulation is recommended (ie, patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of at least 1).</p>

<title>Rivaroxaban</title>
<p>ROCKET AF was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study investigating the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 20 mg daily compared with adjusted-dose warfarin (titrated to a target INR of 2.5 [range 2.0-3.0]) in 14 269 patients with nonvalvular AF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0897190012452309">44</xref>
</sup> For patients with a CrCl of 30 to 49 mL/min, the dose of rivaroxaban was reduced to 15 mg daily. The primary efficacy outcome of this study was the composite of stroke and systemic embolism, while the principal safety outcome was the composite of major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding. The median duration of follow-up was 1.6 years.</p>
<p>The primary end point occurred at a rate of 2.2% per year in the warfarin group and 1.7% per year in the rivaroxaban group.  Based on these results, rivaroxaban was shown to be noninferior to warfarin. However, in a prespecified on-treatment analysis that included only those patients who completed the trial on drug therapy, rivaroxaban was shown to be superior to warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (1.7% per year vs 2.2% per year, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .02). Major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding occurred at a rate of 14.5% per year in the warfarin group and 14.9% per year in the rivaroxaban group (<italic>P</italic> = .44). The rate of intracranial hemorrhage was significantly lower in the rivaroxaban group (0.5%) than in the warfarin group (0.7%; <italic>P</italic> = .02).</p>
<p>For patients randomized to warfarin in ROCKET AF, the mean TTR was 55%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0897190012452309">45</xref>
</sup> The TTR in this study varied according to region, with the highest TTR observed in North America (64.1%) and the lowest observed in Eastern Europe (49.7%). The effect of rivaroxaban did not differ across quartiles of TTR according to study center (<italic>P</italic> = .74 for interaction).</p>
<p>Based on the results of ROCKET AF, the FDA approved rivaroxaban to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. For patients with a CrCl greater than 50 mL/min, the approved dose is 20 mg once daily.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0897190012452309">46</xref>
</sup> The dose should be reduced to 15 mg once daily for those patients with a CrCl of 15 to 50 mL/min. Based on the labeling, rivaroxaban is not recommended for use in patients with a CrCl less than 15 mL/min, even though patients in the ROCKET AF trial were excluded if they had a CrCl less than 30 mL/min. The updated ACCP guidelines do not provide any recommendations regarding the role of rivaroxaban in patients with AF because this antithrombotic therapy had not been approved by the FDA for use in this population at the time that these guidelines were developed.</p>

<title>Apixaban</title>
<p>The efficacy and safety of apixaban have been compared to both aspirin and warfarin in 2 separate clinical trials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0897190012452309">38</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190012452309">39</xref>
</sup> AVERROES was a double-blind, double-dummy trial that randomized 5599 patients with AF who failed or were considered unsuitable for VKA therapy to either apixaban 5 mg twice daily or aspirin 81–324 mg daily.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0897190012452309">38</xref>
</sup> The primary efficacy outcome of this study was stroke or systemic embolism, while the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. This study was stopped early in June 2010 (with a mean duration of follow-up of 1.1 years), when a significant benefit with regard to the primary efficacy outcome was observed in the apixaban group. The rates of stroke or systemic embolism were 3.7% per year and 1.6% per year in the aspirin and apixaban groups, respectively (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .001). Rates of major bleeding were 1.2% per year in the aspirin group and 1.4% per year in the apixaban group (<italic>P </italic>= .57). The rate of intracranial bleeding was 0.4% per year in both treatment groups.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of apixaban in patients with AF were compared to warfarin in the ARISTOTLE trial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190012452309">39</xref>
</sup> In this double-blind, double-dummy study, 18 201 patients with AF were randomized to receive either apixaban 5 mg twice daily or adjusted-dose warfarin (titrated to a target INR of 2.5 [range 2.0-3.0]). A reduced dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily was used for patients who met 2 or more of the following criteria: age of at least 80 years, weight of 60 kg or less, and a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL or higher. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of stroke and systemic embolism; the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The primary efficacy end point occurred at a rate of 1.6% per year in the warfarin group and 1.27% per year in the apixaban group. Based on these results, apixaban met the criteria for both noninferiority and superiority to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred at a rate of 3.09% per year in the warfarin group and 2.13% per year in the apixaban group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was significantly lower in the apixaban group (0.24%) than in the warfarin group (0.47%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>In November 2011, apixaban was granted priority review status by the FDA for stroke prevention in AF. In June, 2012, the FDA delayed their decision regarding the approval of apixaban for this indication and requested additional information regarding data management and verification from the ARISTOTLE trial.</p>

<title>Edoxaban</title>
<p>Edoxaban is another factor Xa inhibitor currently in phase 3 clinical development for stroke prevention in AF. This drug is being evaluated in the ongoing ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, which is expected to be the largest among all the new oral antithrombotic trials, with enrollment targeted at 20 500 patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0897190012452309">47</xref>
</sup> In this double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial, patients are being randomized to receive edoxaban 30 mg daily, edoxaban 60 mg daily, or adjusted-dose warfarin (titrated to a target INR range of 2.0-3.0). The primary efficacy outcome of this study is the composite of stroke and systemic embolism, while the primary safety outcome is major bleeding. Recruitment for this trial is complete, and it is anticipated that analysis of the results will be completed sometime in 2012.</p>

<title>Benefits and Limitations of the New Oral Antithrombotic Drugs</title>
<p>The new oral antithrombotic drugs offer a number of potential benefits compared to warfarin therapy. Unlike warfarin, these new agents possess predictable pharmacokinetic profiles, obviating the necessity for routine coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustments. These drugs have a more rapid onset and offset of action compared to warfarin. Additionally, they have significantly fewer food–drug and drug–drug interactions than warfarin. Also, unlike with warfarin, the efficacy and safety of these new oral antithrombotic drugs is not influenced by genetics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190012452309">42</xref>,

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0897190012452309">48</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, despite these advantages, these new oral antithrombotic drugs also possess several potential limitations. Unlike warfarin, these drugs have no specific antidote that will completely reverse their anticoagulant effects. The data regarding the potential reversibility of dabigatran and rivaroxaban are sparse and are primarily derived from studies that have been conducted in animals or healthy volunteers. Studies have not yet been conducted with these reversal agents in patients with AF or in those who have experienced bleeding events or need to undergo surgical interventions. However, based on the data that are currently available, for patients receiving either dabigatran or rivaroxaban who experience mild bleeding, because of the relatively short half-lives of these drugs, discontinuation of therapy and watchful waiting will likely resolve the bleeding issue. However, when patients experience moderate-to-severe bleeding, supportive measures, including the use of fluid replacement, hemodynamic support, blood products (including fresh frozen plasma), charcoal, or hemodialysis (for dabigatran only) may be considered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0897190012452309">49</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0897190012452309">50</xref>
</sup> In the event of life-threatening bleeding, the use of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VIIa (rVIIa) may also be considered. PCC has been evaluated in healthy volunteers receiving dabigatran or rivaroxaban.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0897190012452309">50</xref>
</sup> In this study, rivaroxaban significantly prolonged the prothrombin time and significantly decreased the endogenous thrombin potential; however, the administration of PCC in these patients resulted in a normalization of both of these parameters within 15 minutes. These effects were sustained for 24 hours. While the use of dabigatran significantly increased the activated partial thromboplastin time, ecarin clotting time, and thrombin time, administration of PCC had no effect on any of these measures of coagulation. The reversal effects of rVIIa have been evaluated only in animals receiving dabigatran.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0897190012452309">51, 52</xref>
</sup> The results of these studies were mixed, with administration of rVIIa significantly reducing bleeding times in rats receiving high doses of dabigatran in one study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0897190012452309">52</xref>
</sup> but failing to significantly reduce hematoma size in mice where intracranial hemorrhage was induced with dabigatran.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0897190012452309">51</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Additionally, in the RE-LY trial, patients receiving dabigatran had higher rates of myocardial infarction than those who received warfarin (<italic>P </italic>= .07 for the 110-mg dose and <italic>P </italic>= .048 for the 150-mg dose).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012452309">40</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0897190012452309">53</xref>
</sup> This increased risk occurred in a broad spectrum of patients, making it difficult to determine which patients should be excluded from this therapy. Dabigatran-treated patients also had higher rates of dyspepsia (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .001) in the RE-LY trial,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012452309">40</xref>
</sup> which may discourage adherence to this agent. Finally, the FDA is currently looking into reports of excessive bleeding with dabigatran.</p>
<p>The doses of both dabigatran and rivaroxaban must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190012452309">42</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0897190012452309">46</xref>

<sec id="section14-0897190012452309">
<title>Costs and Cost-Effectiveness of Anticoagulation in AF Management</title>
<p>Although the acquisition cost of warfarin is relatively low, costs associated with INR monitoring and adverse events increase the total cost of warfarin therapy. The mean cost of monitoring warfarin therapy in patients with AF was estimated to be between $216 and $339 (2003 USD) per patient per year in 3 anticoagulation clinics associated with different US health plans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0897190012452309">54</xref>
</sup> Staff labor accounted for approximately 40% of the monitoring costs, and laboratory costs accounted for approximately 55% of the costs. Based on these data, if 50% of the 2.2 million individuals with AF in the United States received warfarin, the annual costs of INR monitoring alone would exceed $300 million.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452309">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Results of cost-effectiveness analyses are often expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is the ratio of the change in costs associated with a new or different therapeutic intervention to the change in that intervention’s clinical effects relative to the comparator, usually standard of care. Often, the change in effects is measured as the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by the intervention relative to the prevailing standard of care. Existing data indicate that VKA treatment is relatively cost effective compared with no anticoagulation for patients in a general AF population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0897190012452309">55</xref>,

</sup> In patients with AF who are at low risk for stroke, warfarin has not been found to be cost effective, with patients receiving this therapy incurring higher costs and a poorer quality of life compared with those who received no anticoagulation.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0897190012452309">56</xref>
</sup> Similarly, warfarin therapy has been found to be cost effective compared with aspirin,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0897190012452309">56</xref>
</sup> with an ICER of $4484 per QALY in one study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0897190012452309">56</xref>
</sup> However, in patients at low risk for stroke, warfarin was associated with small increases in QALYs at substantially increased costs compared with aspirin. In those who were at moderate-to-high risk for stroke, warfarin was found to be cost effective compared with aspirin (ICER $8000 per QALY).</p>
<p>An analysis by Sorensen and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0897190012452309">61</xref>
</sup> indicates that the real-world cost-effectiveness of warfarin is likely to be substantially less than that reported in clinical trials. This analysis modeled costs and outcomes of anticoagulant therapy in 1000 patients with AF at moderate-to-high risk of stroke using clinical trial and retrospective outpatient data on INR control, clinical outcomes, and warfarin discontinuations. For warfarin-eligible patients, warfarin therapy was assessed in 4 scenarios: (1) perfect INR control (100% of patients maintained within target INR), (2) clinical trial–like control (INRs within target range for 68% of the time), (3) real-world control (INRs within target range for 48% of the time), or (4) real-world prescription of warfarin, aspirin, or no therapy (simulated real-world practice where 12% of warfarin-eligible patients were prescribed warfarin and 23% were prescribed neither warfarin nor aspirin).</p>
<p>The estimated lifetime numbers of primary and recurrent ischemic strokes in an assumed 1000-patient cohort (all patients aged 70 years) were 626, 832, 984, and 1171 in scenarios 1 to 4, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0897190012452309">61</xref>
</sup> Most events occurred when patients were not prescribed warfarin or had discontinued warfarin therapy. When no discontinuation of warfarin was assumed other than for bleeding events, the numbers of ischemic strokes decreased substantially in each scenario. Mean QALYs per patient were 7.21, 6.92, 6.75, and 6.67 for scenarios 1 to 4, respectively, and costs per patient were $68 039, $77 764, $84 518, and $87 248, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012452309">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

</sup> The authors concluded that clinical and cost outcomes were strongly dependent on the quality of anticoagulation and rates of warfarin discontinuation and that policy makers should use real-world INR control and discontinuation rates when assessing the cost-effectiveness of this antithrombotic therapy for prevention of stroke in patients with AF.<sup>

<sup>c</sup> Scenario 1 maintained 100% of patients in the target INR range and reflected ideal treatment goal according to guidelines. Scenario 2 approximated clinical trial conditions and time in the recommended INR range as reported in the SPORTIF V trial.<sup>

</sup> which estimated that INRs were in target range 48% of the time. Scenario 4 approximated routine practice, in which a proportion of warfarin-eligible patients were prescribed either aspirin (12%) or neither warfarin nor aspirin (23%). Discontinuation of warfarin due to nonclinical events, including burden of INR testing or frustration over poor INR control, was considered for all scenarios. Discontinuation estimates were based on data on 973 patients receiving warfarin or aspirin in the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged Study.<sup>

<p>In the United States, the acquisition costs of both dabigatran and rivaroxaban are much higher than the cost of warfarin, and one may assume that apixaban and edoxaban will also be more expensive than warfarin. Nevertheless, when direct costs relating to coagulation clinics and personnel involved in the routine coagulation monitoring required with warfarin are eliminated, it is likely that the new oral anticoagulants are more cost effective than warfarin.</p>
<p>To date, available cost-effectiveness analyses of the new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in AF have focused on dabigatran, because it was the first of the new oral anticoagulants to be approved for this indication. In a study that used results from the RE-LY trial, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was found to be cost effective in patients with AF and a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 3 or higher (i.e. high-risk patients) unless the TTR with warfarin therapy was greater than 72.6%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0897190012452309">64</xref>
</sup> Warfarin was the more cost-effective agent in moderate-risk patients (ie, CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 1-2) and those with better INR control. The cost-effectiveness of dabigatran has also been evaluated in patients with AF and a history of stroke or TIA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0897190012452309">65</xref>
</sup> Using data from the RE-LY trial, the investigators found that, in the base-case analysis, dabigatran provided 0.36 additional QALYs (compared with warfarin) at a cost of $9000, yielding an ICER of $25 000. As in the earlier study, the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran appeared to depend on the adequacy of warfarin management, with its cost-effectiveness being inversely related to the average TTR.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>AF is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. Strokes are generally more severe in patients with AF than in those without this arrhythmia and are associated with greater disability and costs to individuals and health care systems. The majority of patients with AF have coexisting conditions that further increase their risk of stroke. In real-world practice, however, anticoagulation remains suboptimal. Warfarin therapy is inconvenient and difficult to manage, in part because of the requirement for INR monitoring. It is also likely that as a consequence of poor INR control and high rates of drug discontinuation, the real-world cost-effectiveness of warfarin therapy is lower than clinical trial estimates. New oral antithrombotic agents that do not require routine coagulation monitoring may improve the uptake of anticoagulant therapy in patients with AF, resulting in reduced rates of AF-related stroke and reduced costs to the health care system.</p>
