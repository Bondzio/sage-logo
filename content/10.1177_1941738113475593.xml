<title>New Open Access Journal to Launch in 2013</title>
<p>The <italic>Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine: An Open Access Journal for Orthopaedic Sports Medicine, Arthroscopy, and Knee Arthroplasty</italic> will launch in 2013. Dr Bruce Reider, current executive editor of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine Medical Publishing Group, will serve as editor-in-chief. Associate editors for the publication will be Drs Allen Anderson and Mark Steiner. This trio of well-recognized professionals will lead the helm as the AOSSM ventures into its first open access publication. This platform will allow the journal to provide compelling research in the fields of orthopaedic sports medicine, arthroscopic surgery, relevant translational research, sports traumatology/epidemiology, and knee arthroplasty while maintaining AOSSM’s high peer-review standards.</p>
<p>Open access journals provide a venue for researchers and clinicians to publish their data in a timely manner and reach individuals throughout the world while still receiving all the benefits of publishing in a print journal (including listing in the PubMed Central database, which we hope to accomplish in 2014). There is no subscription charge to readers, so anyone can access the full text of every article. This publication model is financed by modest article processing fees paid by the authors or their funding source at the time of acceptance.</p>
<p>AOSSM will be collaborating with other professional organizations, worldwide, in the publication of the <italic>Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> so that the broader profession can participate in expanding the base of orthopaedic sports medicine literature.
