<abstract>
<p>This article maps the multiple methods used to bring scholar-activists, music producers and music consumers together in a conversation that culminated in the creation of three winning ‘empowering songs’ from the ‘Changing representations of women in popular music’ project. This project explores the gendered stereotypes of women in popular music, and seeks to contribute to reflection on, and creation of, alternative (empowering) narratives about women through song. The article discusses this marriage of research and advocacy and reflects on some of the outcomes from ‘corporate’ reflections – all of which generated a lot of passion about the tensions and possibilities around women’s representations and roles. The authors conclude that for research findings to have practical and policy value and legitimacy, what, how, when and where we communicate our messages is extremely important.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Dans cette communication, nous retraçons les multiples méthodes utilisées pour réunir chercheurs-activistes, producteurs de musique et consommateurs en une conversation qui a donné naissance à trois ‘chansons émancipatrices’ gagnantes dans le cadre du projet ‘Changing representations of women in popular music’. Le projet en question explore les stéréotypes sexuels féminins dans la musique populaire, et a pour but de contribuer à la conception et à la création de discours (émancipateurs) parallèles sur les femmes à travers la chanson. Nous nous proposons de discuter ce mariage entre recherche et militantisme, et de nous pencher sur certains des résultats des réflexions ‘de groupe’ – qui ont attisé les passions sur les tensions et les possibilités affectant les représentations et les rôles des femmes. En tant que chercheurs, nous avons dû prendre en compte le fait que si nous voulons que les résultats obtenus soient valables et légitimes sur un plan pratique et politique, il nous faut nous souvenir que l’important est non seulement notre message mais comment, où et quand nous le communiquons.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>En este artículo se traza un mapa de los múltiples métodos utilizados para reunir a activistas académicos, productores musicales y consumidores de música en una conversación que culminó con la creación de las tres ‘canciones potenciadoras’ ganadoras del proyecto ‘Cambios en la representación de las mujeres en la música popular’. Este proyecto explora los estereotipos de género de las mujeres en la música popular y trata de contribuir a la reflexión y a la creación de narrativas (potenciadoras) alternativas sobre las mujeres a través de las canciones. El artículo debate esta unión entre la investigación y las políticas de apoyo y refleja algunos de los resultados de las reflexiones ‘corporativas’, todo lo cual genera gran pasión acerca de las tensiones y posibilidades alrededor de la representación de la mujer y su papel. Como investigadores, se nos recuerda que para que las conclusiones tengan un valor práctico y político, además de legitimidad, es muy importante saber qué, cómo, cuándo y dónde comunicamos nuestros mensajes.</p>

<p>The academy is a place for knowledge production and dissemination – teaching and research is what we do. An additional mandate at the University of Ghana, which we are required to report on in our annual reports to the Vice-Chancellor, is extension work. Extension work includes our contributions to the academy of scholars by way of editorial work, reviews and so forth, as well as contributions to our communities through lectures in schools, pro-bono work for civil society organizations and the like. In the early years of the university’s life, there was a strong sense of social activism, and university faculty were involved in advocating for issues as diverse as the dismantling of neocolonialism to the provision of safe maternal health care. At the formal opening of the Institute of African Studies in 1963, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first president, advocated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our aim must be to create a society that is not static but dynamic, a society in which equal opportunities are assured for all. Let us remember that as the aims and needs of our society change, so our educational institutions must be adjusted and adapted to reflect this change. . . . The educated man should be so sensitive to the conditions around him that he makes it his chief endeavour to improve those conditions for the good of all. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392111429229">Nkrumah, 1963</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An extensive body of work exists examining the role of African universities in knowledge production and the impact on our societies (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392111429229">Court, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429229">Mkandawire, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429229">Sawyerr, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392111429229">Tettey and Pupulampu, 2000</xref>). Recent consensus appears to be that the (economic and structural) adjustment years of the 1980s contributed to a privileging of instrumental and self-interested approaches to knowledge production, and that concerns about social justice and transformation became marginal. By the early 1990s intellectual output and critical comment on national and international issues was a pale shadow of the immediate post-independence years. During one of the lectures to commemorate the 100th birthday of William Ofori-Attah, the speaker, Stephen Adei, lamented the failure of university faculty to make their perspectives on national issues heard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392111429229">1</xref></sup> Others have complained that African scholars have become mere empiricists, producing data for the consumption of foreign experts, and hopping from one consultancy to another. The verdict can be summed up in Zeleza’s indictment of ‘Academic Tourists’ for their tendency to move freely through the revolving doors linking scholars, consultants, non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392111429229">Zeleza, 2002</xref>) in ways that have debased serious scholarship.</p>
<p>Such indictments notwithstanding, not all African or Ghanaian academics can be accused of being ‘Academic Tourists’. Many continue to be at the forefront of advocacy on a number of issues such as the environment, civil and political rights, domestic violence and access to health care. Feminist scholars have been particularly active in their advocacy around gender issues through, for example, close associations with activist organizations. In the edited collection titled <italic>African Feminist Politics of Knowledge: Tensions, Challenges, Possibilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429229">Adomako Ampofo and Arnfred, 2009</xref>) the authors show how advocacy finds expression through diverse routes such as classroom activism seeking gender transformation in student perspectives; efforts at engendering institutional cultures; position papers sent to governmental and non-governmental organizations; policy dialogues; community outreaches; media appearances; and even public marches. Several issues of the continental journal <italic>Feminist Africa</italic> provide testimony to the ways in which feminist intellectual work, research and activism break down some of the ‘traditional binaries between formal academic knowledge and power vis-à-vis informal activist knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429229">Oldfield et al., 2009</xref>: 5). A poignant example of a fruitful marriage between scholarly work, activism and advocacy can be found in the trajectory of the passage of domestic violence legislation in Ghana (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392111429229">Adomako Ampofo, 2008</xref>). In this article we report on a project under the Pathways of Women’s Empowerment Research Project Consortium (WE-RPC), ‘Changing representations of women in popular music’, in which the marriage of research and advocacy was an integral component of the research from the onset. Elsewhere we carry out gender analyses of the song texts, and interrogate various research participants’ perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392111429229">2</xref></sup> In the current article we are more interested in providing a methodological window on how sociology can be of contemporary relevance by discussing how research findings were employed in innovative ways for gender transformation.</p>
<p>‘Women’s empowerment’ has emerged as an important focus in mainstream development agenda, from the WID discourse of the 1970s, through WAD, to GAD in the late 1980s, climaxing in the Beijing Platform for Action (1995) definition as ‘women’s active participation in all spheres of pubic and private life through full and equal share in economic, social, cultural and political decision-making’. Although theatre has long been exploited as a space for development work, leading to the concept of Theatre for Development, music does not typically come to mind as a site for development work or advocacy. However, music is an important conduit for the transmission of society’s cultural values, beliefs and norms, including notions of womanhood and women’s place in society, and is an important site for the formulation and contestation of black identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429229">Collins, 2004</xref>). In seeking to marry research and advocacy, and explore the associations between sexualities and empowerment, we decided to focus on popular music because of its ubiquity and intimacy with everyday life. Across Africa, music is constantly heard booming from shops, restaurants, taxis, buses, lorries and other public sites, and it plays a significant part in the everyday lives of people across age, class, religion, ethnicity and social occasion. Events such as marriage and naming ceremonies, funerals, as well as public and state functions such as lectures and the commissioning of projects, are deemed incomplete without music. Thus, the whole society is exposed to the songs and hence the messages musicians convey. People draw inspirational, educational and emotional messages from music and the lyrics are repeated in daily conversations. Musicians frequently become powerful public figures capable of conveying ideas that serve to comprise popular culture through their lyrical and verbal pronouncements. Indeed, a 2008 editorial of the <italic>Legon Observer</italic> assigns popular music a role equal to, if not above, that of historians and other social scientists noted for documenting the lives of the people: ‘But for our complete treasury of our collective human story in all its full complexity, we must also turn to the singers of our countless songs: our songs of joy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392111429229"><italic>The New Legon Observer</italic>, 2008</xref>: 1–2).</p>
<p>While there are several studies on the role of music in political activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429229">Asante-Darko and Van der Geest, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429229">Kong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429229">Vambe, 2000</xref>), less work has been done to examine gendered images in popular music and their potential to (dis)empower women. Music, like other art forms, often relies on stereotypes to create and convey its messages. Stereotypes may serve as sites where models of behaviour (representation) become models for behaviour (warnings, advice), making narratives available for practical application to listeners’ experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429229">Barber, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429229">Newell, 2000</xref>). Women in a variety of cultures have been represented either as decorative, fetishistic, manipulative, fragile, or in need of rescuing (or submission) in contemporary popular music lyrics, music videos, music concerts and movie soundtracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392111429229">Hobson and Bartlow, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429229">Collins (2000)</xref> claims that the lyrics of contemporary Ghanaian <italic>highlife</italic> focus almost solely on romantic love and sexual innuendo; in the case of <italic>hip-life</italic> there is a definite macho flavour to the lyrics and a tendency to objectify women in the songs and videos of the genre. We may echo the question posed by Simone: ‘if urban culture is a mirroring process through which residents understand something about their collective life, as well as a vehicle through which implicit forms of social collaboration are put to work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392111429229">2008</xref>: 76), how do images in popular music reproduce or subvert particular constructions of women and gender relations? Given the notion of gendered interpretation, the prevailing sexual stereotypes of women within Ghanaian popular music, the role that popular music has played, and could play in shaping and reflecting society, as well as the need to take a comprehensive approach to women’s empowerment, it could be argued that while popular music may be a significant contemporary site for women’s disempowerment through gender stereotyping, popular music can also be used as a vehicle for the empowerment of women through innovative and transformative approaches. In the next section we introduce the WE-RPC and the ‘Changing representations of women in popular music’ project. We then go on to examine women in popular music paying attention to links between development, sexuality and representations. The discussion that follows provides a sociological analysis of our findings. In the concluding section we comment on the larger question of linking research to activism.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011392111429229">
<title>The study setting and methodology</title>
<p>The Centre for Gender Studies and Advocacy (CEGENSA)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392111429229">3</xref></sup> at the University of Ghana had, from 2007 to 2011, been part of an international research consortium titled Pathways of Women’s Empowerment (WE-RPC). The project was funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and partners in the consortium included the Nucleus for Interdisciplinary Women’s Studies (NEIM) at the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil; BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh; the Social Research Centre (SRC) at the American University in Cairo, Egypt; and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in Brighton, United Kingdom, which coordinated the project. The partners were located in hubs, where we worked with colleagues in the region – thus CEGENSA worked with partners in Nigeria and Sierra Leone and formed the ‘West Africa hub’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392111429229">4</xref></sup> The WE-RPC worked in three thematic areas:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Conceptions of empowerment and change</italic>, encompassing substantive empirical as well as conceptual work on measuring empowerment and change in women’s lives and contextualising meanings and practices of empowerment in our different regions.</p>
<p><italic>Building constituencies for justice and equality</italic>, taking the ‘voice’ entry point into exploring the politics of changing policies, and development and political institutions, to lend greater support to women’s empowerment that can promote greater justice, equality and wellbeing for all.</p>
<p><italic>Empowering work</italic>, taking the ‘work’ entry point into investigating the relationships between paid work and empowerment and exploring the implications of changing markets in the wake of globalization for women’s rights, security and wellbeing as workers as a pathway of empowerment.</p>
<p><italic>Changing narratives of sexuality</italic>, taking the ‘body’ as an entry point into understanding the factors that can enhance women’s ability to exercise control over their own bodies in relation to their sexuality, focusing in particular on religion, media and the intersection of global forces with the institutions that mediate women’s options and choices. (WE-RPC, 2006; see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0011392111429229">Appendix 1</xref> for details)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The WE-RPC’s starting point was that while women have achieved gains in some aspects of their social location and wellbeing, there has been a lot more rhetoric on ‘women’s empowerment’ than real changes in power relations, particularly for women living in poverty. We also believe that the pathways to women’s empowerment are more complex than can be easily fixed by a simple magic bullet such as, for example, access to micro-credit, as laudable as such efforts might be. The core research objective has been to understand these diverse pathways to ‘empowerment’, and what enables women to ‘empower’ themselves and sustain changes in gendered power relations. The consortium also sought to make these pathways more visible through advocacy and, hopefully, thereby, influence shifts in policy and practice that can build on past achievements.</p>
<p>In our project on changing representation of women in popular music we took the body – in accordance with the WE-RPC’s ‘Changing narratives of sexuality’ theme – as a point of departure from which to explore the ways in which women’s bodies have been, and can be (re)presented in popular music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392111429229">5</xref></sup> In our work, the term changing has two meanings: (1) Changing, the adjective, whereby we examine the <italic>changes</italic> over time in the representations of African women in popular music – this is the research component of our work; and (2) Changing, the verb, continuous sense, that is, to contribute to positively <italic>changing</italic> the ways in which women are represented in Ghanaian popular music – this is the advocacy component of our work. Our work has relied on multiple and diverse methods including the collection of 250 songs specifically about women and/or gender relations; a thematic and genre-based sorting and periodization of the song texts; two sharing and reflection workshops with WE-RPC researchers, musicians and media personnel; discussions with selected consumers of music; a song competition; and many lectures, and guest appearances on radio and TV by members of the research team.</p>
<p>Among the major musical genres that enjoy tremendous popularity in Ghana today are <italic>highlife, hip-life, hip-hop</italic> and <italic>gospel</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392111429229">6</xref></sup> It is, however, to the first two genres that we turn much of our attention, as gospel music has hardly any themes that directly speak to issues of gender. As a musical genre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429229">Collins (1994)</xref> describes <italic>highlife</italic> as a fusion of both indigenous and western rhythms and melodies, including regimental music, sea shanties and church hymns. Originating as ‘palm wine’ music, the roots of <italic>highlife</italic> date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries and today it still dominates the Ghanaian music scene as the most popular musical form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429229">Collins, 1994</xref>). <italic>Highlife</italic>, together with its more recent offshoot, <italic>hip-life</italic>, lends its voice to the issues of the day, as well as values and belief systems in Ghanaian society, be they gender conventions or more general notions about human nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429229">Collins, 1994</xref>). Entering the Ghanaian music scene in the early 1990s, <italic>hip-life –</italic> a hybrid musical genre with its roots in <italic>highlife</italic> and heavily influenced by <italic>hip-hop</italic> and <italic>reggae</italic> rhythms – has since become the dominant musical form in youth pop culture. Rapped in local Ghanaian dialects, pigeon and English, <italic>hip-life</italic> has been dubbed ‘the voice of a generation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392111429229">Asante, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0011392111429229">
<title>Selection of songs</title>
<p>The project began in 2008 with a discussion among the entire Ghana RPC team about what we thought were the typical themes represented in songs about women; these included:</p>
<list id="list1-0011392111429229" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Women’s bodies and dress;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Romance, love and marriage;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Witchcraft;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Motherhood and fertility;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Violence;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inherent negative traits of women such as fickleness, unfaithfulness, greed;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inherent positive traits of women such as being sweet, kind, sacrificial;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Critiques through the eyes of women, i.e. songs which present women’s critical views about their circumstances.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The research team carried out a purposive collection of songs spanning the period from the 1930s to 2009. The main criteria for a song’s inclusion was that (1) the lyrics had to be specifically about women, including, but not limited to the themes listed above; (2) the songs had to be in English or Akan;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011392111429229">7</xref></sup> and (3) the songs had to broadly reflect the following periods and genres: the 1930s to 1950s, reflecting the guitar and dance band music era; the 1960s and 1970s to capture the years of pop, Afro beat, Afro rock and reggae; the 1980s, which saw the burgeoning <italic>burger highlife</italic>; and the 1990s to the present where we have the neo-traditional groups, contemporary high and hip-life and the birth of the music video industry. We relied on a colleague and renowned musicologist, John Collins, to assist in selecting songs for the period from the 1930s to the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392111429229">8</xref></sup> For songs from the 1980s to the present we relied on our research assistant, Nana Dansowaa Kena-Amoah, who holds an MPhil in music, to assemble the collection with input from a variety of radio disc jockeys.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392111429229">9</xref></sup> To facilitate analyses a content analysis workshop facilitated by colleague and linguist Akosua Anyidoho was held for the researchers in June 2008.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011392111429229">
<title>First reflection workshop</title>
<p>The next stage of our work involved the planning and execution of a workshop with popular artistes and media persons. We sought to bring together popular musicians, including members of the Musicians Union of Ghana (MUSIGA); members of the media, especially journalists for newspaper entertainment pages; hosts of TV and radio music programmes; and WE-RPC researchers. The workshop was planned for July 2008 and print, phone, email or in-person invitations were extended to 27 individuals from the music industry, of which 10 attended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392111429229">10</xref></sup> They included three musicians, of whom one is a popular icon from the 1970s who has made a recent comeback; one is a ‘conscious rapper’ from the current generation of artistes; and the third, a woman gospel music artist and until 2011, the president of MUSIGA. The workshop format, facilitated by Akosua Anyidoho, included a general discussion on representations of women in music, reflections on the place of popular music and popular musicians in transformation projects and reflections on specific song texts from our repertoire of songs and conversations around possible alternative, more affirming representations of women in songs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011392111429229">
<title>Focus group discussion with consumers of music</title>
<p>In early 2009 we held two focus group discussions with taxi drivers and students respectively to capture their impressions on representations of women in popular music. These groups were selected because both are avid consumers of music. Taxi drivers spend many hours a day in their cars, with their dials constantly trained on one FM station or another where they are exposed to diverse music. Some also consciously tune into stations that they believe are popular among their passengers. Thus they influence the kind of music that passengers listen to, and are also influenced by passengers’ choices. Students of the University of Ghana, like young people all over the world, listen to music constantly – on radio, TV, the Internet and their music players. The taxi drivers’ group was composed of 10 men ranging in age, as far as we could guess, from early thirties to late forties. The students’ group included six young women and five young men from first to final year. We, the authors, moderated the discussions with input from our research assistant, Nana Dansowaa. Both discussions were audio and video recorded and transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011392111429229">
<title>Song competition</title>
<p>In 2009, as part of a major effort in advocacy we launched a song competition. The competition sought empowering songs about women. In April 2009 we placed adverts in the national dailies and the entertainment press seeking songs with socially conscious and empowering representations of women (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0011392111429229">Appendix 2</xref> for the Competition call). Of the entries that were received, only two were from women, reflecting the reality that music composition and production is a field dominated by men. A panel of nine judges, made up of musicians, music producers, gender researchers, music scholars and young music consumers, independently reviewed the entries based on a mutually agreed set of criteria: relevance of the lyrics to women’s empowerment, quality of the music and innovation.</p>
<p>The winning song and two runners-up were professionally recorded on CD, and a music video of the Number One song was produced as well. The songs were launched at a powerful, colourful event on 21 November 2009, at a major hotel in Accra, Ghana’s capital. The MC for the night was Ms Jessica Opare-Saforo, an eloquent radio broadcaster from Citi FM and the programme for the evening included enough entertainment and education to highlight the goals of the project. Before and after the launch of the winning songs researchers were on several prime time morning shows on three national TV stations, and two national and three local radio stations to discuss the project and the song launch, and engage the public in discussions about representation of women in popular music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011392111429229">11</xref></sup> Some radio stations also partnered with CEGENSA to play the songs on air and provide brief commentary on the purpose of the project. The three national TV stations and at least two of the national daily newspapers carried news and brief commentaries of the launch, and an interview with a BBC reporter, David Amanor, was telecast on <italic>Network Africa</italic> thus ensuring continental (and possibly global) coverage.</p>

<title>Second reflection workshop</title>
<p>We held a second workshop in June 2010. The aim of this workshop was to share preliminary analyses of the song texts with selected musicians, producers and literary scholars, and generate interest among colleague researchers to use the song texts in their work. Participants were each given a bound volume of the songs which had to broadly reflect the following periods and genres, as mentioned earlier: the 1930s to 1950s, reflecting the guitar and dance band music era; the 1960s and 1970s to capture the years of pop, Afro beat, Afro rock and reggae; the 1980s which saw the burgeoning burger highlife; and the 1990s to the present where we have the neo-traditional groups, contemporary high and hip-life and the birth of the music video industry.</p>

<title>Popular music and sexuality: Women as objects or subjects?</title>
<p>Human sexuality is undoubtedly an important part of life and so it is not surprising that it should form such an important pivot for popular cultural products. The question of <italic>how</italic> this is represented is, however, paramount. Clearly sexuality can be presented as both creative and destructive. When does the representation of sexuality in popular music cease to be creative and become destructive and demeaning of women? Are women presented merely as objects of sex with a focus on their bodies, or are both men and women presented as respectful mutual partners? Cole challenges African gender scholarship to interrogate ‘the rift between theories of how gender is constructed and the actual on-the-ground practices of how gender is performed and enacted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429229">2007</xref>: 272). Popular culture provides vivid on-the-ground enactments of gender that must be confronted. A cursory examination of the representations of women in contemporary popular media suggests a conflicting, ambivalent at best, relationship to women’s bodies and sexuality. Music videos herald a dress culture where less and tighter is better. At the same time, public rhetoric is consumed with the notion of women’s ‘indecent dress’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0011392111429229">12</xref></sup> The danger that a male-dominated production of popular culture will continue to replicate gender stereotypes and misrepresentations is very real; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429229">Collins (2000)</xref> argues that the majority of Ghanaian rap singers tend to objectify women in their songs and videos.</p>
<p>Representations of women’s bodies and sexualities in the media have a bearing on women’s actual and potential pathways of empowerment for, in addition to configuring representations of sexuality, popular media such as music also organize and express <italic>norms</italic> around women’s sexualities. In view of this we theorize our work in the larger body of work on sexual politics – representations, identities and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429229">Collins, 2004</xref>). Pereira notes that sexuality is ‘articulated with the ways in which gendered human beings become defined within particular, singular <italic>identities</italic> and the <italic>cultural</italic> frameworks that give meaning to such constructions at given historical moments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429229">Pereira, 2003</xref>). The literature on women’s empowerment has thrown up several areas where this ‘empowerment’ should occur, and is or is not occurring – domestic decision-making; access to resources; control over resources; equal rights and freedom from discrimination; the sexual division of labour; and participation in public office to name some. Sexuality usually enters the discourse via the concept of ‘bodily integrity’. Here one is talking about women’s ‘control’ over their fertility and reproductive behaviour; access to reproductive health care information and services; care and nurture of the body; restrictions on physical mobility; policing of appearance; and exposure to violence. Thus, the process of empowerment is expected to increase women’s capacities to make choices that will enhance ‘bodily integrity’ – increase the ability to take care of one’s body and enhance the level of personal (bodily) security.</p>
<p>Although the literature examines the misrepresentation of African female sexuality and the complex intersecting dimensions of gender, race, religion and culture, as well as same-sex relationships, some African feminist scholars and activists have suggested that a strong silence remains regarding the question of female sexuality within African women’s and gender studies, particularly in relation to pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429229">Adomako Ampofo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429229">McFadden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392111429229">Mama, 1996</xref>). An interesting debate ensues between McFadden and Pereira in a 2003 issue of <italic>Feminist Africa</italic>. McFadden argues that sexual pleasure is intrinsic to feminist empowerment and that the silences around them reflect a lack of feminist agency and determination: ‘For the majority of black women, the connection between power and pleasure is often not recognised, and remains a largely unembraced and undefined heritage. . . . In often obscure or hidden ways, it lies at the heart of female freedom and power; and when it is harnessed and “deployed”, it has the capacity to infuse every woman’s personal experience of living and being with a liberating political force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429229">McFadden, 2003</xref>: 50). Pereira’s response is not simply to consign women’s bodily integrity to constructions of practical (versus strategic) needs, such as protection from HIV infection, but to legitimize these so-called silences from a historical perspective, ‘given the historical conditions of imperial expansion and racist fascination with the hypersexuality projected onto Africans by Europeans’. She advocates that it would be more productive to map sexualities ‘with a view to their future exploration and understanding?’ (2003: 62). Collins articulates the ways in which the representation of (black) bodies reinforces gender and racial stereotypes, ‘Because of its authority to shape perceptions of the world, global mass media circulates images of Black femininity and Black masculinity and, in doing so, ideologies of race, gender, sexuality, and class’ (2004: 122). As with its American precursor, Ghanaian hip-life music provides no immediately easy distinction between representations of sexually liberated women and those who are sexual objects, ‘their bodies on sale for male enjoyment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429229">Collins, 2004</xref>: 126). However, as Anyidoho argued in our textual analysis workshop, more important than what and how musicians self-identify is how these messages are read by the music’s consumers. Thus, the creators and consumers of music may share (and not always unequally) in the power to provide meaning to the lyrics.</p>
<p>Identity and power are associated with the language and practice of development. When it comes to the question of development practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429229">Armas (2007)</xref> claims that sexuality has actually been sidelined by development. Associated more with disease, risk and danger than with pleasure or love, sex has been treated by development agencies as something to be controlled and contained, thus African people are often presented by others as over-sexed, and policies are geared to controlling their sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429229">Arnfred and Adomako Ampofo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429229">Ezumah, 2009</xref>). In contrast to the ‘development discourse’ of the 1970s and 1980s, issues affecting women today are frequently discussed within the framework of ‘rights’. Since the 1990s the rights-based approach has become a critical element in development discourse, policy and practice. The AIDS epidemic has broken old taboos and silences, and begun to open up space for the recognition of how central sexual rights are to wellbeing. However, efforts need to be made beyond the confines of narrow, problem-focused thinking. Feminist scholars argue that sexuality is a vital aspect of development, and that sexual rights are a precondition for reproductive rights and for gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429229">Armas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429229">McFadden, 2003</xref>). Armas further advocates the use of rights as an entry point to talk about sexuality in relation to development. We agree that there is value in promoting sexuality beyond the narrow confines of disease, and recognizing the importance of pleasure; however, as we have articulated, we feel that it is extremely important to examine how ‘pleasure’ is represented. This is particularly important given the connections between sexual representations and society’s differing moral prescriptions for women and men. Rights-based approaches that take on questions of sexual rights could be a part of the process of creating positive representations of women as gendered bodies and this could be articulated through song.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, therefore, popular music can be politicized. Emphasizing the accessibility of the popular music medium, with particular reference to (Ghanaian) highlife, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429229">Asante-Darko and Van der Geest (1983)</xref> promote the potential for political – overt or subtle – messages to be expressed within Ghana. Beyond Ghana, studies have explored the use of popular songs for a variety of ends: to reinforce an ideology and legitimize a ruling elite; to act as a rallying call to others so as to establish and reinforce group identity; and to voice dissatisfaction with society, including social norms and political conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429229">Kong, 1995</xref>). Kong further notes how political dissatisfaction is captured, for example, in American ‘protest songs’, while opposition to social norms has been expressed in rock ’n’ roll. She notes that slave songs, for example, provided African-Americans with a way of expressing and communicating under conditions of great oppression, and freedom songs associated with the civil rights movement provide an illustration of how songs help mobilize protest and create group solidarity in specific situations. In Zimbabwe the tradition of song as social commentary has been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429229">Vambe, 2000</xref>). In the US, educators have harnessed the power of popular music through the rewriting of rap lyrics to help in the fostering of children’s self-esteem and the countering of negative images of women in the media. According to Carla E Stokes, the founder of HOTGIRLS (Helping Our Teen Girls In Real Life Situations) rewriting song lyrics helps girls ‘critically analyze the messages they encounter in the media and in their daily lives’, moreover ‘girls are <italic>using</italic> hip hop as a vehicle to reach their peers and raise awareness about issues that affect their lives’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429229">Kieya, 2007</xref>). Teens have taken to the recording studio to create their versions of popular songs, such as ‘Let Me Tell You How You Talk to Me’, a reworked version of Justin Timberlake’s song ‘Sexy Back’. Thus popular music can become a powerful vehicle for cultural and political expression and prompt the politicization of personal spaces (the home, street, music shop, or club for instance) as it provides ‘portable politics’ over which individuals may exert some control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429229">Allen, 2004</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>The combination of entertainment and education is seen in contemporary practice as an innovative approach to achieving social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429229">Singhal and Rogers, 1999</xref>). The process of deliberately designing media messages to both entertain and educate in order to increase knowledge about an issue, create favourable attitudes and change overt behaviour has been coined ‘enter-education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429229">Singhal and Rogers, 1999</xref>). Our study sought to harness this potential of popular music. In the next section we report on what we learned about the potency of popular music, and our efforts to challenge popular musicians to be more reflexive and critical in their representations of women.</p>

<title>Changing the representations of women in popular music</title>
<p>The reflection workshops and conversations with music consumers threw up several popular themes about women in songs; on the positive side they are seen as the keepers of tradition, they are dependable, a source of joy, virtuous angels (usually as wives and mothers); they are (appropriately) submissive, never angry, caring, welcoming of a man’s relatives and kind. Songs evoked praise for women’s intelligence and spirituality as well as their reproductive/mothering roles, and for being faithful lovers (even when their men went astray). Participants in the first workshop also noted that the theme of beauty was common in songs and not always in an objectifying sense. However, in both reflection workshops and the conversations with students and taxi drivers, participants felt that on balance the images were more negative, or at least not empowering. On the negative side participants agreed that women are objectified sexually, with a focus on the (big) breasts/butt and other motifs that go beyond appreciating the body and desire, to mere lust. Other portrayals included women as exploitative, unfaithful, unreliable, enchantresses, witches, jealous, competitive (typically with other women over men), unstable, weak minded, fickle, greedy/materialistic, exploitative, ungrateful and lazy. Some notions could be described as neutral or merely factual descriptions, such as women being described as subordinate to men or ready to defer to men; women being ‘weaker’ than men (i.e. her role does not include the use of the gun; and men defend women/children). Not surprisingly, in both workshops the older musicians felt that it was principally the younger ones who provided women’s bodies as fodder for the male imagination. In the 2010 workshop, Nana Ampadu, a veteran from the 1970s and 1980s, insisted that love songs of his generation were not imbued with ‘pornography’.</p>
<p>Participants in the two reflection workshops suggested several reasons for the negative representations of women, including tradition, religion, capitalism and generational tensions. Argued one:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I see people refer to religion as a reason for women to submit . . . religion makes it taboo to say certain things . . . it is wrong for a woman to say [same things as men] because of religion even though she feels so inside . . . and on the capitalism side . . . sex sells, it’s commercially viable, musicians doing good work are not respected . . . they want to see women shaking their buttocks . . . (Kubolor the WunLuv; musician)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, while tradition controls women, the capitalist market provides opportunities to sell them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429229">Collins (1994)</xref> argues that when traditional expectations of women’s roles come into conflict with some aspects of urban lifestyles and westernization, they combine to threaten ‘traditional’ male authority, which helps to explain why popular texts so often dwell on the subject of sexual tension, marriage treachery, prostitution, witchcraft accusations and the duplicity of city women. Participants in both workshops and both group discussions stressed that music is influential. In the second reflection workshop, Carlos Sakyi, music producer, noted simply that ‘music can influence the way people think and act’. A taxi driver who had ceased listening to a particular musician because of his negative portrayal of sex, which he felt would influence him, now listens only to gospel music and says, <italic>‘</italic>the words in the songs [gospel] touch my heart that is why I listen to them’. Another driver noted, ‘I strongly believe that songs have a great influence on people.’ In the conversation snippets below, a taxi driver identifies not only the power of songs, but calls for advocacy around music:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><italic>Taxi driver</italic>:</td>
<td>When we were young, during the olden days our grandparents used to tell us stories through songs and the words would make you have change of mind about a lot of things. The words made you respectful . . . and they made you responsible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><italic>Discussion leader</italic>:</td>
<td>Do you really believe that songs can change a man’s way of thinking or have great impact on people?</td>

<tr>
<td><italic>Taxi driver</italic>:</td>
<td>I strongly believe that songs have a great influence on people. There are certain songs when being played; you feel the words cannot help you positively. There are others too when played, everybody joins in singing because the words are encouraging. For this reason, there is the need to have leaders who would frankly come out to say the words in a particular song are bad and would influence the youth negatively.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>Something like ‘adepa hye adepa mu’;<sup>13</sup> if you are a mature person you realize the song can harm children. If I hear such songs I switch my radio off. If there is a passenger in the car and the song is being played, you the driver feel guilty. (Taxi driver)</p>
<p>When you listen to Fiifi Banson’s<sup>14</sup> programme . . . when you have passengers in the car you would be forced to switch off the radio. Because I wouldn’t like the passenger to listen to such a songs . . . either I switch it off or tune it to a different station. And most passengers do not complain. (Taxi driver)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The students were even more convinced of the power of the lyrics. One female student said, ‘I weigh the contents of the music before I listen to it.’ And another explained further, ‘Some make you depressed, some make you emotional. Some of these songs create some perceptions like, I don’t want to be in a relationship .’ A male student noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I look at the lyrics of this particular song, I think it is full of sexual elements and it will really trigger relationships. As young people if you should be alone with your girlfriend and you play such songs no matter who you are something will happen.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Particularly influential is the fact that today the music is heard over and over again; as one female student explained, ‘When something is said over and over again it affects your thinking. It’s the lyrics that affect you when listened to over and over again.’</p>
<p>The conversations with the students and taxi drivers also provided support that songs negatively stereotype and/or sexualize women. Not surprisingly, women students were more critical of the representations of women in song than the men were, and they complained strongly about the sexual objectification of women in songs and how this made them feel. They also hinted at what this might mean for their own relations with men, as images of sexually available women were projected onto them. One woman student said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t like the way they portray women in their clips. I think it’s so shameful and degrading. You see them wearing all sorts of clothes. They are exposing their body parts. It’s bad, very bad and I feel so shameful [<italic>sic</italic>] because I feel like it makes me so transparent around guys and I don’t like it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is this song recently and it talks about girls. It goes like, ‘you be yawa girl’. I don’t know what the girl did and it’s like the guys are really on the girl telling the girl she is ‘yawa’.<sup>15</sup> Maybe they asked for something from her and she didn’t give it out, I don’t know what it is, maybe sex or anything. It’s like most guys if they should ask you and you don’t give it to them, they tell you, you are ‘yawa’. I think that song is very bad. (Female student)</p>
<p>What I feel is some of these songs portray women as sex objects. It’s like they see us as something they can play with. (Female student)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the men, especially the taxi drivers, also acknowledged that popular urban music, especially the videos, objectify women sexually:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well we can say that most of our songs do not say anything good about women. They most often talk about ladies’ style of dressing and their body parts. It’s not nice. I have not heard them using men in their songs. (Taxi driver)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of the acknowledged power of music, messages about women can then become part of people’s realities in subtle ways. As suggested by the comments below, some participants insisted that song lyrics could influence one’s behaviour for good or ill, and men acknowledged that they would themselves use songs to manipulate or control women:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have also personally used the words in [a] song to insult a woman who proved stubborn when I wanted to propose to her. I used those words until she agreed. . . . If this song had not come out, I don’t think it would even have occurred to me to use those words. (Taxi driver)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whether the situation described in the last quote above actually happened or not, the driver was certainly convinced that he had successfully employed the lyrics of a popular song to overcome the ‘stubbornness’ of a woman he was interested in who had been playing hard-to-get.</p>
<p>The songs also reinscribe gendered power relations and underscore the importance of women being ‘good’ girls in order to ‘win’ (their) husbands. While men can play with sexualized women in the songs, and can have multiple partners, in order to become someone’s wife, or to sustain this position, a woman must be humble, submissive and not sexually available. This mixed bag of messages must surely continue to be confusing for young people seeking to make sense of gender politics. Some women students felt that music helped them figure men out and how to please them. These mixed messages, and their impact on constraining women, are described below:</p>
<list id="list2-0011392111429229" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Female student 1</italic>: And there is this song . . . He was describing two ladies, his wife and his girlfriend. I like the way he described his wife. She was humble, soft, she was the mother type and his girlfriend was the happy-go-lucky type, she loved clubbing and [was] always worrying him with money issues. . . . It created some difference. It made us aware of what men want.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Discussion Leader</italic>: So what do men want?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Female student 1</italic>: They like good girls, humble, those who don’t ask for money.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Female student 2</italic>: The song was like he was confused as to who to choose but in the end he chose his wife.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Female student 3</italic>: Because his wife is not money conscious.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Female student 4</italic>: The thing is that our society doesn’t blame the men when they go wrong. The blame is put on the women even when the men go wrong. They will tell you that you didn’t take care of him that is why he went behind you [cheated on you].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Male student</italic>: They [men in songs] like good girls, humble, those who don’t ask for money.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A female student complained further about this stereotyping, ‘Nobody sings that for a man to get a good wife he has to be this, he has to be that. It’s always the women – we have to be this, we have to humble. I think it’s not good. It makes us like we are their subordinates, which is not good. We are supposed to be equal.’</p>
<p>The litany of negative images notwithstanding, the first reflection workshop gave us reason to believe that taking our research to town, so to speak, was a project with potential for the transformation of representations of women we sought to engender. The musicians referred to themselves as activists, and claimed the power to reflect, condone or challenge contemporary practices. One said, ‘When [the musician is] given the gift of music you have to reflect society .’ Another described himself as an ‘activist’ and Diana Hopeson, the president of MUSIGA, conferred on musicians the role of ‘lyrical prophets’. Although the media representatives were less sanguine about the prospects of musicians as social prophets (given the commercial nature of the industry), they agreed that musicians are powerful and have a social responsibility to not only entertain, but also educate. Musicians, media persons and researchers agreed that musicians can, and should be, part of a larger cultural project of social transformation that would include changing the representations of women in song texts.</p>
<p>The three winners of the song competition were: first place, Kwabena Quaicoo, for ‘As Long As You Are a Woman’; second place, Osei Korankye, for ‘Mmma Moo’ [women kudos] and third place, Born African for ‘Equal Rights’. The judges subsequently worked with the winners to enhance the ‘empowerment’ appeal and diversity of representations of women. Ultimately the popular appeal and lyrics of the winning song identified many prominent historic and contemporary female figures that the song celebrates; for example Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the current President of Liberia; Miriam Makeba, an influential anti-apartheid musician; and Efua Sutherland, a playwright. The chorus goes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As long as you are a women/If I were a woman</p>
<p>you/I would control the universe</p>
<p>If I were a girl/ As long as you are a girl</p>
<p>I/you would rule the world</p>
<p>For the strength of the world lies in a woman</p>
<p>Women have the power to change the world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Suggesting to both women and men that they take a second look at preconceived notions. The lyrics and the imagery in the song’s video address women’s sexualization and gender-based violence, as well as highlighting women’s decision-making power – many of the questions addressed in development issues. Since the launch the winning song and video have been played on radio and TV on occasions such as Valentine’s and Mothers’ Day, at activist events, and in 2011 the song was nominated for a national music award. The launch and ensuing media advocacy provide some direction for the larger question of linking research and advocacy. During each radio or TV appearance, sometimes with other guests, on occasion with our first and second place winners, we would make reference to actual song lyrics, and suggest the negative effects of stereotyping and sexualizing women (and men, for that matter). Because we incorporated the views and voices of consumers of music, and used the media to reach a wide audience, the musical impact and the collective conversations have had an impact beyond the analysis of song texts, which was where we began. While we recognize that the music industry is a formidable one to enter or impact, we found radio DJs, TV presenters and even some musicians really interested in working further with us. In ‘taking our research to town’, a discussion of popular forms of expression (even beyond music to include other forms of popular culture such as proverbs) has been generated. Soon after the winning song’s launch a TV presenter remarked, ‘I have never thought of music in such terms. This launch will make me more aware when I listen to music.’</p>
<p>To cite one example of our engagement with the public: <italic>The Front Page</italic>, on one of the most popular radio stations in Ghana, provided a two-hour opportunity for Akosua Adomako Ampofo, Diana Hopeson (president, MUSIGA) and Gyedu Blay Amboley, a renowned musician, to engage with the conscious and versatile host, Kwaku Sakyi-Addo, on women’s representations in song. We the researchers continue to receive requests to speak on the subject of women’s representations in popular arts and the media.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Much development literature defines African women as the most vulnerable and disenfranchised segment of contemporary African society. In many ways today’s Ghanaian woman enjoys greater opportunities and freedoms than her sister of the 1930s, the era where the songs in our musical collection start. At the same time feminist scholars and activists struggle to contend with and address the many new ways in which women have become tradable goods in the new markets created in the most private of spaces thanks to music videos and porn (both soft and hard) that is merely a mouse click away. Some argue that while the language of gender has become almost mainstream, the political project of gender and development has been reduced to a technical fix:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . by powerful institutions that understand the importance of controlling discourse well. . . . There has been a separation of political and economic empowerment and a return of instrumentalism that privileges a meaning of empowerment associated with formal institutions and individual autonomy. Emphasis is more on the economic actor contributing to growth and less on issues of body autonomy and the power within. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429229">Armas, 2007</xref>: 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Armas goes on to argue that in DFID women’s empowerment is not understood as changing patriarchal structures but rather as meeting women’s practical gender needs. If this is indeed so, then ‘empowerment’ can easily be interpreted as something that takes place at the individual level without any real changes to the existing oppressive structures. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392111429229">Dogbe (2002)</xref>, women’s empowerment is an oft-stated mission in Ghana’s development and cultural policy documents; however, she questions what it means to harness culture for development – which culture and whose culture? How, she asks, can cultural development become ‘empowering’ for women when aspects of these same cultures – including representations of women in music – are used to oppress them? Ghana’s cultural policy over the past decade has focused on culture’s restorative, therapeutic, protective and creative potential to transform the national development processes. However, Dogbe suggests that even if these intended roles for culture are interpreted progressively, current development policy-making and implementation processes have been formed on the basis of implicit assumptions that empowering women and other marginal groups can be achieved without fundamental changes to the status quo.</p>
<p>In light of the outcomes of our work, and the continuing objectification and infantilization and the pervasiveness of highly sexualized representations of women within widely available popular music songs and videos, questions of women’s ‘sexual empowerment’ become all the more pressing. Can things be done differently? Can music serve as a pathway for women’s empowerment? Can lyrics that challenge negative stereotypes of women through their empowering subject matter be written, sung and, perhaps more pertinently, popularized? Our project has shown that there is a place for popular music beyond its role as a mere accessory to contemporary urban life, to its place for the empowerment of women through linking research to action that resonates with people’s daily lives. Our work has also shown that not only feminist scholars, but also popular musicians, members of the media, as well as consumers of music, propose a variety of potential pathways to alternative, more diverse and empowering representations of women – and that working together is a powerful tool for transformation.</p>

<title>Appendix 1: WE-RPC themes and areas of enquiry</title>
<p><italic>Source</italic>: Pathways of Women’s Empowerment end of inception phase report 1 March 2006– 30 November 2006; Reference No: R8506.</p>
<p>The WE-RPC agenda was constructed to encourage the design of comparative and collaborative projects organized according to four themes:</p>
<list id="list3-0011392111429229" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Conceptions of empowerment and change</italic>, encompassing substantive empirical as well as conceptual work on measuring empowerment and change in women’s lives and contextualizing meanings and practices of empowerment in our different regions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Building constituencies for justice and equality</italic>, taking the ‘voice’ entry point into exploring the politics of changing policies, and development and political institutions, to lend greater support to women’s empowerment that can promote greater justice, equality and wellbeing for all.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Empowering work</italic>, taking the ‘work’ entry point into investigating the relationships between paid work and empowerment and exploring the implications of changing markets in the wake of globalization for women’s rights, security and wellbeing as workers as a pathway of empowerment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Changing narratives of sexuality</italic>, taking the ‘body’ entry point into understanding the factors that can enhance women’s ability to exercise control over their own bodies in relation to their sexuality, focusing in particular on religion, media and the intersection of global forces with the institutions that mediate women’s options and choices.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Within each thematic cluster, projects addressed the three areas for enquiry outlined in the original proposal – everyday lives, policy processes and strategies for change – to:</p>
<list id="list4-0011392111429229" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Locate empowerment in women’s everyday lives</italic>, from the perspective of women themselves by applying a range of methodological and analytical strategies to gain a better conceptual and empirical understanding of how positive change happens in women’s lives, how such changes can be better measured and assessed and what can be learnt from these processes that can contribute towards policies, programmes and practices that seek to promote women’s empowerment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Trace <italic>policy processes</italic> that seek to promote women’s empowerment, in order to understand the enabling conditions, strategies and tactics for achieving policy changes, and to both study and contribute to what it takes for such policies to be effective in addressing persistent gender inequities and bringing about greater justice, equality and wellbeing for all.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Explore <italic>strategies for change</italic> that reveal the factors for success and contextual conditions under which efforts to enhance women’s empowerment are effective in bringing about change, asking what works and what is specific to particular contexts, and what more generic lessons can be drawn.</p></list-item>

<title>Appendix 2: Song competition</title>
<p>The Competition: Music is a significant part of the everyday lives of people across age, class, religion, and ethnicity. Musicians are powerful conveyors of ideas and ideologies through their lyrical and verbal pronouncements. The lyrics of songs are repeated in everyday conversations and find their way into explanations on women’s intrinsic ‘nature’ and pronouncements on how gender relations do, or should occur. Often songs even justify negative stereotypes or the unjust treatment of women. Musicians, music producers, DJs, and researchers agree that musicians can transform popular culture in positive ways. Thus, CEGENSA is looking for an empowering song that portrays women, aspects of women’s lives, or gender relations in positive and empowering ways.</p>
<p>Who can enter? Professional or amateur musicians and song writers who are Ghanaians or resident in Ghana. A team made up of singer(s), songwriter(s) and musicians can enter but the team can only enter ONE song.</p>
<p>What should you enter? An empowering song that portrays women, aspects of women’s lives, or gender relations in positive or empowering ways, AND which can capture the popular imagination. Each individual/team can enter only one song. Songs which have already been recorded are not eligible for entry; however, adaptations of existing songs may be entered if all copyright issues have been addressed. Entries must include the song in audio format plus together with the lyrics in text format. Songs should be a maximum of five (5) minutes.</p>
<p>How to enter? Submit a song as a music file with accompanying lyrics (a) via email as an audio file plus accompanying lyrics as a text attachment; OR (b) to our offices on DVD/CD (audio) with accompanying text in hard copy. All entries must include name(s) and contact details (phone, e-mail address) of the participant(s), and the title of the song. Incomplete applications will not be considered. Please note that THERE IS NO APPLICATION FEE!</p>

<p>All songs will be assessed by a team of judges whose decision shall be final. The winning song will receive advertising coverage in the print and electronic media and be launched at a public event in August. CEGENSA will also seek support for the creation of a music video for the winning song. ALL songs or other creative productions (e.g. video) will remain the intellectual property of the artiste(s) although CEGENSA reserves the right to refer to and share these works for academic and intellectual pursuits.</p>
