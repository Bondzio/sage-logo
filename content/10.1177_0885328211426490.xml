<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study aimed to determine the efficacy of experimental calcium phosphate-based solutions (sCaP) containing fluoride (F), with and without zinc (Zn) ions on reducing susceptibility to acid dissolution and <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (<italic>S. mutans</italic>) colonization of dentin surfaces.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Dentin sections were treated with double distilled water (control) and with sCaP solutions differing in pH and in F<sup>−</sup> and/or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations. Solutions A (pH 7); B, C, and D (pH 5.5); solution C, twice Zn<sup>2+</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ion concentration compared to B; solution D is similar to C but without Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The dentin surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction, and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Dissolution was determined in acidic buffer. Bacterial (<italic>S. mutans</italic>) attachment and growth were evaluated using SEM and Bioquant. Statistical analyses applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s multiple Range test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to control, dentin surfaces treated with sCaP solutions showed: (a) occluded dentin tubules; (b)reduced susceptibility to acid dissolution; and (c) Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions were more effective than F<sup>−</sup> ions in inhibiting bacterial colonization.</p>
<p><bold>Significance:</bold> Acidic sCaP containing both F and Zn ions have mineralizing, acid resistance, and antibacterial effects and may be potentially useful as a strategy against dentin caries formation and progression.</p>

<p>Acid produced by the fermentation of food carbohydrates by oral bacteria initiates the dentin caries process, that is, dissolution of the dentin mineral (apatite) followed by the breaking down of the organic matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211426490">1</xref></sup> Culture-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426490">2</xref></sup> and culture-independent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211426490">3</xref></sup> demonstrated that <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (<italic>S. mutans</italic>) and <italic>lactobacilli</italic> are the principal microorganisms associated with root caries.</p>
<p>Root caries has become a significant oral health issue especially among the middle aged and the elderly with treated and untreated periodontal disease.

<p>Double distilled water (DDW) was the control solution. The experimental sCaP solutions (A, B, C, and D) were prepared from mixtures of Ca-deficient apatite (prepared by precipitation) and sodium F with (A, B, and C) or without (D) added zinc chloride (Fisher Scientific, New Jersey) and dilute phosphoric acid. The saturated solutions were filtered off from the undissolved mixture. The release of ions from the mixtures solution A had pH of 7, of solutions B, C, and D, pH 5.5. Solutions A and B had similar F<sup>−</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions concentration; solution C had twice Zn<sup>2+</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ion concentration compared to B; and solution D is similar to C but without Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The solution concentrations of Ca, P, and Zn ions were determined using inductive coupled plasma, ICP (Thermo Jarrell Ash Model, Waltham, MA, USA) and the solution F concentration by F-ion selective electrode (Metrohm 867 pH module) using appropriate standards. Solution composition and pH of the sCaP are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211426490">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec4-0885328211426490"><title>Dentin section preparations</title>
<p>Caries-free extracted human permanent molars obtained from the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery were stored in saline and sterilized by gamma radiation. The crowns were removed using a water-cooled diamond-bladed saw (Series 15 HC Diamond, N 11-4244, Buehler, USA) and the roots were attached to mounting stubs with epoxy resin. Buccal 1/2 or lingual 1/2 dentin sections were obtained by dividing the roots along the mesio-distal direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211426490">19</xref></sup> The dentin sections were polished on one side sequentially using 320 grit, 600 grit, and then 1000 grit wet paper and a polishing wheel, ultrasonically cleaned, rinsed with DDW, and dried with compressed air.</p>
<p>The dentin sections (6 sections/group) were randomly distributed into the treated (Groups A, B, C, and D) and control groups reflecting the treatment solutions (Solutions A, B, C, and D) used. The sections were immersed in the solutions for 4 min rinsed with DDW and dried with compressed air.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211426490"><title>Characterization of dentin surfaces</title>
<p>The dentin surfaces were characterized using x-ray diffraction(XRD; Philips X’ Pert X-ray diffractometer), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR; NicoletMagna IR 550 Spectrometer Series II, France), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-3500 N; Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Crystallite sizes were determined from the broadening at half height width (β<sub>1/2</sub>) of the [002] diffraction peaks using the Debye-Scherrer formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211426490">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the FT-IR analysis, 1 mg of the powdered material scraped from the treated dentin surfaces was mixed with 250 mg KBr and pressed at 10,000 psi (Carver laboratory press, mode C, Fred S. Carver Inc.). Absorption band assignments were based on those of carbonate apatites and other CaPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211426490">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426490">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>For SEM analyses, the dentin sections were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter coated with gold. SEM images were taken under the same magnification andworking distance, taking random 10 images per sample from selected fields in the cervical portion of each section.</p>
<p>For the XRD, FT-IR, and SEM analyses, 6 dentin sections per group per analyses were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211426490"><title>Dissolution experiments</title>
<p>Nail varnish was applied on all parts of the dentin surfaces (three dentin sections per group) except for a circular area (diameter, 5 mm). Each dentin section was immersed in an acidic buffer (0.1 M KAc, pH 6, 37°C) for 90 min and the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the buffer with time was monitored using inductive coupled plasma (Thermo Jarrell Ash Model, Waltham, MA, USA). We speculated that 90-min immersion of the dentin sections in acidic buffer will be sufficient time to discriminate differences in the dissolution properties of the control and treated dentin surfaces and that longer time might involve the dissolution of the dentin below the coated surface and thus confound the results obtained.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0885328211426490"><title>Bacterial adhesion and colonization experiments</title>
<p>A reference strain of <italic>S. mutans</italic> ATCC 25175 (provided by Dr. Robert Boylan, New York University College of Dentistry) was suspended in 200 mL brain heart infusion broth and inoculated into brain heart infusion agar. After incubation in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in an anaerobic atmosphere at 37°C for 48 h, <italic>S. mutans</italic> was cultured in brain heart infusion broth overnight under the same anaerobic condition. The concentration of the bacterial culture was adjusted to 0.30 at OD<sub>600</sub> using SynergyTM Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., USA).</p>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211426490"><title>Bacterial adhesion experiment</title>
<p>Each dentin sections (6 sections per group) were placed in 24-well plates (Corning). Two milliliter aliquots of the bacterial suspension were added to each well. The specimens were then incubated for 4 h at 37°C in an anaerobic atmosphere. The incubation time of 4 h was chosen based on reports that complete biofilm formation in the oral environment occurs in 2 to 4 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211426490">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211426490">24</xref></sup> After incubation, each section was washed three times with 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were fixed for 1 h using Trumps fixative (glutaraldehyde in a mixture of sodium cacodylate buffer), washed in PBS, dehydrated using increasing concentrations of ethanol (50–100%), and dried using DCP-1 critical point drying apparatus (Enton Scuum Inc., USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211426490"><title>Bacterial colonization experiment</title>
<p>The concentration of <italic>S. mutans</italic> ATCC 25173 cultures were adjusted to a turbidity of 0.30 at OD<sub>600</sub>, then 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. The treated dentin sections (6 per group per time point of 8, 16, and 24 h) were placed in 24-well cell culture plates. Two mL aliquots of the 10-fold serial diluted bacterial culture were added to each well. The specimens were then incubated at 37°C in an anaerobic atmosphere. The samples were taken out after each time period, fixed, and dried as described above.</p>
<p>We compared two methods (i.e., turbidity measurement method and the SEM/Bioquant method) of assessing the number of viable bacteria. We found that the SEM/Bioquant method gave a better estimation of bacterial population. The SEM images were loaded in Bioquant program (Bioquant Nova Advanced Image Analysis apparatus, 200 R&amp;M Biometrics, Inc.), using the manual measurement function to count the number of bacteria (10 random areas per specimen) on each image. This direct counting method may minimize the underestimation of bacteria population that are encountered using the usual turbidity measurement after sonicating bacteria from the samples and culturing for a period of time because even low frequency ultrasound could kill bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211426490">25</xref></sup> thereby causing loss of original data.</p>

<p>Dentin surfaces treated with saturated sCaP used in this study provided coatings that were less susceptible to acid dissolution and that were less susceptible to S.<italic>mutans</italic> colonization compared to those treated with distilled water (control). Solution C with lower pH (5.5) and containing both F<sup>−</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions were more effective than solutions with neutral pH (pH 7, solution A), or solution B containing half F<sup>−</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations of solution C, or solution containing only F<sup>−</sup> ions (solution D). In addition, the solution C-treated surfaces showed significant number of occluded dentin tubules and tubules with smaller diameters.</p>
<p>Deposition of a coatings on the dentin surfaces treated with sCaPs were indicated by differences in: (a) surface morphology (from SEM images); (b) crystallite size (X-ray diffraction and FT-IR analyses); (c) organic/inorganic ratio of materials scraped from dentin surfaces (FTIR analyses); and (d) dissolution properties. The amount deposited is greater from solutions with lower pH and/or higher concentrations of F<sup>−</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. Solutions with lower pH (solutions B, C, and D) are expected to cause partial dissolution of the dentin mineral, which would cause greater amounts of Ca and P ions to be released compared with the solution with neutral pH (solution A).</p>
<p>The larger crystal size of apatite deposited on dentin surfaces treated with solutions C and D and the less susceptibility to acid dissolution of these treated surfaces are due to the incorporation of F<sup>−</sup> ions in the apatite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426490">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211426490">26</xref></sup> Our recent study showed that occlusions in the dentin tubule (from treatment with either solutions B or C) still remained even after 1-h exposure to acidic buffer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211426490">19</xref></sup> Although it has been shown that the incorporation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions increase the solubility of apatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426490">22</xref></sup> or tricalcium phosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211426490">27</xref></sup> in cases where Zn<sup>2+</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ions were simultaneously incorporated, the F<sup>−</sup> effect was more dominant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211426490">28</xref></sup> In addition, acid exposure of the dentin surfaces treated with sCaP solutions could lead to partial dissolution of the coating releasing Ca, P, and F ions to the micro-environment that will inhibit further dissolution of the dentin surface. It has been shown that solution containing Ca, P, and F ions simultaneously was most effective in inhibiting the dissolution of synthetic or enamel apatite compared to solutions containing (Ca + P), (Ca + F), or (P + F) or F ions alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426490">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mechanism for the observed cariostatic effect of F is a combination of the following effects: (a)forming (F, OH)-apatite crystals that are more acid-resistant;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211426490">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426490">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211426490">29</xref></sup> (b) enhancing mineralization; (c)reducing the metabolism of oral bacteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211426490">12</xref></sup> and (e) formation of “CaF<sub>2.</sub>” The contribution of the antibacterial effect of F to its cariostatic property is still debated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211426490">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>A study using a biofilm model showed no difference in the initial growth (initial 20 h) of <italic>S. mutant</italic>s between F-free and F-substituted apatite and that only at low environmental pH (pH 5.5) or under glucose excess, was the <italic>S. mutans</italic> cells accumulation on the F- apatite surfaces significantly reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211426490">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results showed that dentin surfaces treated with solutions containing Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in addition to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ions (solutions B or C) inhibited bacterial attachment and colonization. Although solution C had double the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration of solutions A or B, dentin sections treated with solution C showed no higher antibacterial effect compared to solutions A or B. The dentin surfaces treated with solution D, which had the similar F<sup>−</sup> ion concentration as solution C but did not contain Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, had no significant antibacterial property. However, surfaces treated with either solution A, B, or C (containing both F<sup>−</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions) inhibited bacterial attachment and colonization compared to those treated with DDW (control) or solution D. These results suggest that the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions were more effective than the F<sup>−</sup> ions (at least at the F<sup>−</sup> ion concentrations used in this study) in inhibiting bacterial adherence and colonization<italic>.</italic> It is also possible that Zn<sup>2+</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ions act synergistically in inhibiting bacterial colonization. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>In conclusion, results of our study suggest that acidic sCaP containing both F and Zn ions have mineralizing, acid resistance, and antibacterial effects and may be potentially useful as a treatment strategy against dentin caries formation and progression.</p>
