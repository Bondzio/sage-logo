<body>
<p>We read with interest Howell et al.’s systematic review of specialist palliative care (SPC) input for patients with haematological malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311434952">1</xref></sup> They highlighted that these patients are less likely to receive SPC than those with other cancers. They propose several possible explanations:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘ongoing management by the haematology team and consequent strong bonds between staff and patients; uncertain transitions to a palliative approach to care; and sudden transitions, leaving little time for palliative input.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They make it clear that this does not mean needs are not being met as they may be met by the haematology teams looking after these patients. In order to facilitate access to our SPC unit, we increased the number of patients who could have blood transfusions in our day hospice. Through negotiation with the local acute trust, working closely with their haematology team, we developed protocols and agreed a service level agreement for a pilot where haematology patients could have red cell transfusions at the hospice. This letter reports on the satisfaction survey relating to this pilot for the period January–April 2011. As this is a patient satisfaction survey, and not research, ethical committee review was not sought.</p>
<p>Through this period, 59 patients received blood transfusions at our day hospice. All patients who attended were given a questionnaire to fill in at home and return via post. Thirty were returned.</p>
<sec id="section1-0269216311434952">
<title>Results</title>
<p>All 30 had received blood transfusions in hospital previously, 23/30 were male and half were under 80 years old.</p>
<p>All of the patients said there was no delay in treatment, that they found the environment relaxing, felt that they were given enough privacy and were treated with respect and dignity. None of them experienced staff talking in front of them as if they were not there or had questions about their care that they wanted to discuss but could not.</p>
<p>All of the 17 patients who used their own transport could find a car parking space and of the 13 patients who needed to, all were seen by another member of the day hospice team on the day of the transfusion.</p>

<p>Responses are expressed as x/n where x is the response and n the number of patients who responded to that question.</p>

<p>n varies as some patients omitted some questions.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>We would have liked a higher response rate than 50% but we did not wish to burden patients by sending reminders. Satisfaction for those who responded was high and there are services a hospice can provide that a hospital will find more difficult – easier parking; volunteer drivers; as well as access to members of the multidisciplinary hospice team. It is interesting that only 6/29 admitted to having concerns about coming to the hospice and yet 17/28 said that their perceptions had changed and 20/28 said their levels of worry or fear had lessened after their transfusion.</p>
<p>We strive for 100% satisfaction and there are areas that could be improved. Interestingly, 5/29 said that they had complications, one of which was not dealt with to their satisfaction. As our questionnaire did not ask for further detail about the complications experienced, we are unable to elaborate further. However, there were no adverse reactions to blood transfusions other than a temporary rise in temperature leading to the rate of transfusion being slowed.</p>
<p>We know that referral to hospice and SPC can be stressful for patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311434952">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311434952">3</xref></sup> It saddens us to know there are patients who need our services but do not want to engage with us. We believe that day hospice services may allow us to meet some patients earlier in their illnesses. We want to deliver blood transfusions, bisphosphonate infusions, intravenous diuretics and ascitic taps for patients so that they can meet hospice staff, see what the hospice is like and get referred to other members of the multidisciplinary team or other services if needed. Then, perhaps, patients would be more accepting if there came a time when they have complex needs and require further hospice input.</p>
<p>Finding out whether attending a day hospice for therapies earlier in an illness means patients are more accepting of SPC or are more likely to die somewhere other than hospital would be difficult and a randomised controlled trial would be fraught with methodological difficulties. This does not mean, however, that it should not be done. We are soon to start recruiting for a qualitative study where we will conduct semi-structured interviews with patients who had blood transfusions in our unit. We hope that information from this will be helpful for planning a randomised controlled trial in the future.</p>
