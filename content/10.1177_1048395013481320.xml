<p>Ludlow, A., Heaton, P., Rosset, D., Hills, P., &amp; Deruelle, C. (2010). Emotion recognition in children with profound and severe deafness: Do they have a deficit in perceptual processing? <italic>Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 32</italic>, 923–928.</p>
<p>When children with severe prelingual deafness are not exposed to natural (sign) language from infancy, they exhibit pronounced delays in social knowledge and competence and social adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048395013481320">Weisel &amp; Bar-Lev, 1992</xref>). Researchers have suggested that these difficulties are a direct effect of delays in language acquisition and missed opportunities to converse with others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048395013481320">Peterson &amp; Siegal, 1998</xref>). Among the social impairments documented in the deaf population are mentalizing problems and deficits in theory of mind (ToM; that is, understanding of others’ emotions and actions). These difficulties have been observed in congenitally deaf children of hearing nonsigning parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048395013481320">Peterson &amp; Siegal, 1999</xref>), but they are less likely to be found in deaf children of deaf parents who sign. Another crucial component of social cognition that may be affected by deafness is the ability to understand other people’s emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048395013481320">Rieffe &amp; Terwogt, 2000</xref>). Although such deficits are less well documented than ToM deficits, findings from several studies suggest that deaf children are more prone to errors in recognizing facial expressions of emotion than are their hearing controls. Some studies have revealed the emotion recognition deficits in deaf children were comparable with those reported in children with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048395013481320">Dyck, Farrugia, Shochet, &amp; Homes-Brown, 2004</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these emotion recognition deficits in deaf children and adolescents are poorly understood, and it is currently unclear whether they are specific to social stimuli, thereby reflecting their atypical experience, or reflect more general abnormalities in visual perceptual information-processing strategies.</p>
<p>The aim of the current study was to determine whether deaf children, who experience difficulties in processing emotions on faces, will manifest atypical perceptual processing strategies in response to face stimuli.</p>

<title>The Study</title>
<sec id="section2-1048395013481320">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 26 deaf children, 10 boys and 16 girls, aged between 6 years and 16 years 8 months participated in the study. The children had either severe or profound prelingual hearing loss. Thirteen children were profoundly deaf (hearing loss &gt; 90 db), and 13 children were severely deaf (hearing loss &gt; 70 db), meaning that none of the children in the deaf sample could hear conversational speech (approximately 60 dB) and consequently did not spontaneously learn to talk. In all, 7 preferred to communicate via sign, 13 were bilinguals, and 6 preferred to communicate verbally. A group of 26 control children were matched on sex and mental age with the deaf children, and a second group of 26 control children were matched on sex and chronological age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1048395013481320">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The stimuli comprised 18 black-and-white pictures of faces (nine female, nine male), of which 6 were photographs of human faces, 6 were human-like cartoon faces, and 6 were cartoon faces that did not look human. Pictures were presented in upright and inverted conditions. Each face was presented in happy, sad, and angry conditions, resulting in a total of 54 images. Human and nonhuman cartoon faces were chosen from cartoon movies. All faces were presented in full-face presentation and were cropped at the neckline.</p>
<p>This continuum of faces (human, human-like cartoon, and nonhuman-like cartoon) provides a way to identify the importance of features in processing emotions. Cartoons contain fewer and more distinguishable features than real faces. Cartoons may also be processed differently, as social impairments are less likely to interfere with this (less sociable) type of stimulus. As a further test of perceptual strategy, the stimuli were presented in two different orientations (upright and inverted). Neurotypical persons process emotions on upright faces more accurately than on inverted faces. Persons with autism are less likely to exhibit this difference in emotion recognition between upright and inverted faces because they use a more locally oriented than configural approach to facial processing. Any absence of this face inversion effect is taken as a sign of a locally oriented rather than a configural processing bias. This is because only local information is available in inverted faces.</p>
<p>Children viewed stimuli on a computer screen and were asked to categorize the emotion displayed. To make sure instructions were understood, all participants were presented with 12 training trials. Following this, they were presented with 108 test trials, corresponding to three blocks of 36 trials. Each block comprised 18 upright and 18 inverted faces: 6 human faces, 6 faces of human cartoons, and 6 faces of nonhuman cartoons. Stimuli were displayed on the screen until the participant responded. The experimenter scored the children’s verbal responses identifying the emotion 1 if correct or 0 if incorrect.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<list id="list1-1048395013481320" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Deaf children were significantly less accurate in identifying emotions on faces than were hearing children matched on chronological and mental age.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although deaf children were consistently poorer across the three types of faces, they showed an advantage, similar to hearing controls, for identifying emotions on real faces.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Age and task performance correlation was not significant. This suggests that results cannot be attributed to a delay in ability but rather to a relative deficit in emotion recognition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both hearing and deaf children performed more poorly on inverted faces than upright faces, thus indicating that both the hearing and deaf children used a configural rather than locally oriented approach to processing emotions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The findings from this study show that deaf children have emotion recognition deficits despite using a configural processing style. Performance on the emotion recognition task appeared to be related specifically to deafness. Both signing and oral deaf children had similar deficits in emotion recognition. The exact reason for the deaf children’s ability to accurately identify emotions from facial expressions in this study is not known. Two factors may have contributed to their difficulty with emotion recognition. Oral deaf children may focus on the face to gain speech–reading cues. Hence, they attend to the mouth area of the face, rather than the eyes which convey more emotional information. Deaf signers attend to the face to process linguistic features of sign. Processing these linguistic features may be at the expense of configural processing of facial emotion cues. Whatever the basis for the difficulty deaf children exhibit in ToM tasks and recognizing emotions, these areas need to be addressed in interventions designed to promote social skills.</p>
