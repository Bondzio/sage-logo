<title>Background:</title>
<p>Foot infections are limb-threatening complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and proper classification of the severity of diabetic foot infection (DFI) is important in determining an effective antibiotic regimen, the need for hospitalization and surgery, and the risk of amputation.

<p>Foot infections are limb-threatening complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and proper classification of diabetic foot infection (DFI) severity is important in determining the antibiotic regimen, the need for hospitalization and surgery, and the risk of amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712467980">15</xref></sup> In 2004, a consensus report by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) described 4 grades of severity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712467980">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712467980">14</xref></sup> The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) established a virtually identical severity classification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712467980">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712467980">15</xref></sup> The IDSA classification was later validated by Lavery et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712467980">12</xref></sup> who observed a trend toward an increased risk for amputation, higher level amputation, and lower extremity–related hospitalization with increasing infection severity.</p>

<p>Severe IDSA (IWGDF 4) infections are distinguished from moderate IDSA (IWGDF 3) infections by the presence of systemic signs of toxicity and/or metabolic instability; however, no precise values have been established to constitute fever, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, acidosis, severe hyperglycemia, or azotemia in patients with DFI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712467980">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712467980">9</xref></sup> Although the validation study by Lavery et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712467980">12</xref></sup> classified infection severity based on the presence or absence of systemic findings of infection, the authors did not define fever, leukocytosis, or metabolic aberration. Similarly, another study evaluating clinical and laboratory testing in DFI used the IDSA/IWGDF classifications but did not define the parameters of a severe infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712467980">7</xref></sup> A recent study of amputations after DFI defined severe infection as a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, temperature less than 96°F or greater than 100.5°F, pulse less than 49 or greater than 125 beats per minute, respiration rate less than 10 or greater than 29 breaths per minute, or altered mental status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712467980">17</xref></sup> Another study defined severe infection as University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) stage 2 and 3 infections and did not consider systemic signs or laboratory findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712467980">16</xref></sup> Most recently, an expert panel convened by the IWGDF and IDSA defined a severe (IWGDF 4) infection as any foot infection with 2 or more signs of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712467980">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712467980">15</xref></sup> These signs included temperature greater than 38°C or less than 36°C, heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute or Pa<sc>co</sc>
<sub>2</sub> less than 32 mm Hg, and white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 12,000 or less than 4000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. These reports did not include hyperglycemia, azotemia, or acidosis in defining a severe infection in contrast to the previous guidelines. Finally, another recent review reported similar signs with the exception of a temperature threshold of greater than 39°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712467980">23</xref></sup> It is apparent that there is no consensus on the precise definition of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability in patients with DFI.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis was that patients with severe DFI would have a longer hospitalization than would patients with moderate DFI. The purpose of this study was 2-fold. The first purpose was to define DFI using readily available clinical information and objective parameters outlined by consensus statements. The second purpose of this study was to assess amputation and limb salvage rates for hospitalized patients with DFI.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>After gaining approval by our local institutional review board, we reviewed the database of a single academic foot and ankle program for patients who were hospitalized for a DFI from 2006 to 2011. Both inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records were reviewed, and 100 patients were identified who were hospitalized for DFI. Although we did not develop the parameters that distinguished moderate from severe DFI according to the IDSA consensus, our goal was to define them based on clinical information using vital signs and laboratory studies that were readily available. Severe DFI was defined as having 2 or more objective findings of systemic toxicity and/or metabolic instability at the time of initial assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712467980">Table 2</xref>). We elected to use 2 or more of these parameters to define a severe DFI based on the recommendations for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We used the thresholds for temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and WBC count as described for SIRS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712467980">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712467980">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712467980">24</xref></sup> Sepsis-induced hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 based on the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712467980">3</xref></sup> Hyperglycemia was defined as serum glucose greater than 200 mg/dL since patients undergoing noncardiovascular surgery with values above this level had a 2-fold increased risk of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712467980">19</xref></sup> Major infections are associated with prerenal azotemia secondary to decreased renal perfusion and hypovolemia, and we defined azotemia as a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio of greater than 20 (normal 10 or less).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712467980">18</xref></sup> The primary findings of diabetic metabolic acidosis are a reduction in serum bicarbonate and an increased anion gap. Arterial blood gases were not available in the vast majority of our patients, so we defined metabolic acidosis as serum CO<sub>2</sub> levels less than 22 mmol/L (normal 22-32) and anion gap greater than 15 mEq/L (normal 7-15) as determined using serum electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712467980">25</xref></sup> All infections were assigned a wound grade according to the UTSA classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712467980">9</xref></sup> All of the hospitalized patients had moderate or severe infections according to previously defined parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712467980">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>As part of our academic teaching program, all patients with DM who were evaluated had a thorough neurovascular examination. Peripheral pulses were evaluated, and if the dorsalis pedis or posterior pulse was not palpable, noninvasive studies were obtained. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) was diagnosed if the ankle brachial index was less than 0.9 or if the patient had previously undergone open or endovascular surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712467980">4</xref></sup> Peripheral neuropathy was assessed using the Michigan neuropathy screening index (MNSI), which uses monofilament, vibration, reflexes, deformity, and ulceration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712467980">26</xref></sup> Neuropathy was defined as MNSI score of 2.5 or greater.</p>
<p>Minor amputations were defined as removal of a part of the foot distal to the transverse tarsal joint with preservation of the talus and calcaneus. Major amputations were defined as a transtibial amputation, since none of our patients underwent a Syme’s amputation. Limb salvage was defined as avoiding an amputation proximal to the transverse tarsal joint (Chopart’s joint), which is consistent with previous reports and equates to minor or no amputation in this series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712467980">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712467980">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Continuous data were inspected to determine whether it was reasonable to assume approximate normality. If the distribution of a variable was approximately normal, the mean (standard deviation) was compared between the 2 groups using a 2-sample t test. If the distribution of a variable was not approximately normal, the median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) was reported and the 2 groups were compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum statistic. For categorical variables, a chi-square statistic was used except for a few count variables for which Wilcoxon rank sum statistics were used. SAS Version 9.2 Cary NC was used for statistical analyses. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Using our methods to define infection in hospitalized patients, we noted 69 severe infections and 31 moderate infections. Characteristics and demographics of patients with severe and moderate infections are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712467980">Table 3</xref>. Baseline demographic data demonstrated that patients with moderate and severe DFI were similar with regard to age, body mass index, gender, duration of DM, type of DM (type 1 or 2), use of insulin, and complications of DM (PAD, neuropathy, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and end-stage renal disease). An equal number of patients in both groups had osteomyelitis (71%). Baseline laboratory studies demonstrated significant differences between moderate and severe infections with regard to serum albumin, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, platelet count, anion gap, WBC count, percentage of neutrophils, and serum glucose. No significant differences were observed with regard to glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, hemoglobin, and CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>

<p>Amputations were more common among patients with a severe DFI than those with a moderate DFI, but the differences were not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .22) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1071100712467980">Table 4</xref>). In addition, we observed a nonsignificant trend indicating higher rates of limb salvage in patients with moderate infections compared with patients with severe infections (94% vs 80%, <italic>P</italic> = .081) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1071100712467980">Table 4</xref>). A post hoc power analysis demonstrated that a total sample size of 213 patients would have been required to achieve 80% power to detect a significant result at an alpha level of .05 between limb salvage rates of 94% and 80% for moderate and severe infections, respectively.</p>
<p>Patients who ultimately required below-knee amputation (n = 16) had lower serum albumin levels than patients who had successful limb salvage (n = 80) (2.1 ± 0.4 vs 2.8 ± 0.7, <italic>P</italic> = .001). Serum albumin levels were lower in patients who required any form of amputation (n = 49) (2.5 ± 0.7 g/dL) compared with those who did not require an amputation (n = 47) (2.8 ± 0.8 g/dL), but the differences were not statistically significant with the numbers available (<italic>P</italic> = .089). Four of the 100 patients did not have preoperative serum albumin levels measured.</p>

<sec id="section8-1071100712467980" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, patients with severe DFI had a median hospital stay that was 60% longer than the hospital stay of patients with moderate DFI. In this sample, 55% of patients with a severe DFI required some type of amputation compared with 42% of patients with a moderate DFI. A consistent trend toward increased limb salvage was achieved in patients with moderate infections (94%) compared with patients with severe DFI (80%). Although these differences did not reach statistical significance with the number of patients available for analysis, we believe that the observed differences are meaningful clinically since the rate of major amputation was 3 times higher in patients with severe DFI (20% compared with 6%). We did not identify significant differences in the distribution of the UTSA classes between the moderate and the severe infection groups, but some trends were evident. The majority of infections in this study were deep infections (UTSA 3B and 3D), which would be expected in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>Another important finding of this study was that serum albumin level differed significantly between those who had limb salvage and those who had a transtibial amputation (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Other studies have reported a relationship between lower albumin levels and treatment failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712467980">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712467980">16</xref></sup> Serum albumin levels have traditionally been thought of as markers of nutritional status, and lower levels have correlated with poor healing at amputation sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712467980">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712467980">21</xref></sup> Another plausible explanation for this relationship is that serum albumin is a marker of inflammation. During catabolic states such as sepsis, hepatic albumin synthesis decreases and albumin can be lost through peripheral wounds and edema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712467980">10</xref></sup> Our patients with severe infection had significantly lower serum albumin, higher percentage of neutrophils, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate than those with moderate infection, findings that are consistent with an increased systemic inflammatory response. It is unlikely that suboptimal nutritional status alone was responsible for this difference given the similar diabetes status and body mass index between the 2 groups.</p>
<p>Of the 8 objective signs of systemic toxicity/metabolic aberrations that were used in our study, the findings in descending order of frequency in severe DFI were hyperglycemia (75%), WBC greater than 12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (71%), tachycardia (68%), temperature greater than 38°C (41%), prerenal azotemia (36%), respiratory rate greater than 20 (25%), metabolic acidosis (22%), and systolic hypotension (3%). Systolic hypotension was the only factor that did not differ significantly between patients with moderate and severe DFI. Subjective symptoms of nausea, vomiting, chills, and anorexia were significantly more common in patients with severe versus moderate DFI and should prompt the clinician to suspect a severe DFI.</p>
<p>A large multicenter study from France demonstrated that 35% of hospitalized patients with DFI underwent amputation during their hospitalization and an additional 19% underwent amputation during the first year after discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712467980">22</xref></sup> The conclusion was that the prognosis for DFI remained poor and that severity of the wound was related to the need for amputation. A recent study from Korea evaluated limb salvage for patients with severe IDSA infections and reported that limb salvage was accomplished in 98% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712467980">11</xref></sup> They included 1 case of a Syme’s amputation as limb salvage, although this is not consistent with the definitions used in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712467980">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712467980">20</xref></sup> Similar to other reports, this study did not define what constituted a severe IDSA infection. The limb salvage rate of 98% may be artificially high since the investigators excluded patients with dry gangrene of the entire foot who required transtibial amputations. Notwithstanding the limitations of that study, the high limb salvage rate illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary team and advanced technology. Another important finding of that study was that nearly 70% of patients required some type of amputation. The study that validated the IDSA classification reported that 77% of patients with a severe DFI required some type of amputation and that major amputations were performed in nearly 30% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712467980">12</xref></sup> Our overall rate of major and minor amputations of 51% in hospitalized patients with DFI is consistent with the recent literature.</p>
<p>Monitoring clinical signs of infection is important. This article does not address which of these clinical parameters are most important; however, other studies have addressed this. A leukocytosis of greater than 11,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> has been demonstrated to be associated with a 2.6 increased risk of amputation, and fever greater than 100.5°F (38°C) was associated with a 1.3 increased risk of amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712467980">17</xref></sup> Patients with DM may not mount the normal inflammatory response to DFI such as leukocytosis and fever. Nearly 15 years ago Armstrong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712467980">2</xref></sup> reported that 54% of patients with DM and acute osteomyelitis of the foot had a normal WBC count and 82% had a normal oral temperature. A more recent study demonstrated that the mean oral temperature of patients who had a poor response to treatment was 99.1°F (37.2°C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712467980">7</xref></sup> A study of 400 patients with moderate or severe DFI demonstrated a mean WBC count of 8240 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and the mean WBC count of those who failed treatment was 9977 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> compared with 7933 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> for patients who had a favorable response to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712467980">16</xref></sup> Considering these studies, we believe that it is important to include other variables in addition to leukocytosis and fever in defining severe infection. The patients in our study demonstrated a positive response to treatment during their hospitalization manifested by a significant decrease between admission and discharge WBC and serum glucose. By the time of discharge there were not any significant differences in WBC or serum glucose levels in moderate versus severe infections. This finding would add credence to our inclusion of hyperglycemia greater than 200 mg/dL as an objective variable of distinguishing severe from moderate infection. Anecdotally, we have observed that many patients with DFI report a recent worsening in glycemic control as one of the earliest signs of DFI.</p>
<p>Our aim was to incorporate previously identified objective signs of systemic toxicity and/or metabolic instability and to define those parameters based on readily available information such as vital signs, complete blood count, and serum metabolic panel. The new consensus statements take a huge step forward by using the parameters defining systemic inflammatory response syndrome as the criteria for severe infection. Thus far, these new guidelines have not been validated.</p>
<p>This study is limited by its retrospective nature and arbitrary definition of severe infection, although we have used clinical findings recommended by an expert panel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712467980">14</xref></sup> Another limitation of this study is the high prevalence of severe infections in our patients. Since all of the patients were hospitalized, our cohort included only the sickest patients and excludes those patients with mild infection and some patients with moderate infections. This is analogous to Grayson’s study on the probe to bone test where the prevalence of osteomyelitis was high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712467980">8</xref></sup> Since nonhospitalized patients with moderate DFI do not require surgery or amputation, we believe that inclusion of this group would only strengthen our observations regarding the trends in limb salvage. Lavery et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712467980">12</xref></sup> were able to manage 48% of moderate infections as outpatients. At our medical center, surgeons typically don’t evaluate mild or nonhospitalized moderate DFIs since they are managed by their primary care team. In addition, some hospitalized patients with moderately severe infections do not receive surgical consultation. Consequently, our cohort of patients is biased toward the most serious DFIs. Our definition of severe DFI needs to be independently validated, ideally with a prospective study that includes mild, moderate, and severe infections (outpatient and inpatient). Patients with DM often do not manifest the classic signs of inflammation and/or infection, and using 8 different objective signs assists in identifying severe infections. It is clear from this study and others that moderate DFIs can also be limb threatening, as 6% of our moderate infections required transtibial amputation and 36% required a minor amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712467980">12</xref></sup> Finally, another limitation of this study is that it is underpowered with regard to identifying a significant difference between limb salvage and amputation rates in patients with moderate and severe DFI. We are continuing this study in an effort to achieve adequate power to definitively determine whether a significant difference exists.</p>
<p>In summary, using readily available clinical information and objective parameters outlined by consensus statements, we were able to classify hospitalized patients with DFI into moderate and severe infections. Patients with DFI who manifested 2 or more objective signs of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability required significantly longer hospitalization than patients who manifest fewer than 2 signs. A trend toward increased need for major amputation (reduced limb salvage) was observed in patients with severe infections. Another finding of this study was that all of the patients who presented with wet gangrene or soft tissue emphysema manifested at least 2 of the previously described objective signs and should immediately be considered to have severe infections requiring emergent surgical debridement. Patients who required transtibial amputation had significantly lower serum albumin levels than did patients who had successful limb salvage.</p>
