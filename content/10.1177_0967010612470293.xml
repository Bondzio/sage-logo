<abstract>
<p>This article develops critical feminist engagement with human security by interrogating the taken-for-granted category of the ‘human’ therein. Failure to reflectively deconstruct this category has contributed to human security’s reproduction of dominant norms and the emptiness of its apparent radical promise. The article shows how the ‘human’ has historically been constructed as an exclusionary – and fundamentally gendered – category, and examines its construction in human security discourse and the capabilities approach in which the latter is rooted, as well as its discursive effects. The article troubles the model of the autonomous, rational human subject who is the bearer of capabilities, which human security inherits from the liberal humanist tradition of thought, and which obscures the matrices of power through which individuals become socially differentiated. It then considers the implication of human security in demarcating differences as ‘morally relevant’, including its instrumentalization in the ‘war on terror’.</p>

<title>Introduction: Human security and its feminist interlocutors</title>
<p>A rich feminist literature has critiqued and troubled the category of ‘security’ as a field of discourse and praxis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0967010612470293">1</xref></sup> highlighting how (neo)realist conceptions of ‘national’ security can have pernicious political-material effects, serving to paradoxically <italic>de</italic>secure particular categories of people and (re)produce (gendered, gendering and gender-based) violences (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612470293">Cockburn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612470293">Cockburn and Zarkov, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612470293">Cohn, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470293">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612470293">Enloe, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612470293">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612470293">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612470293">Peterson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612470293">Price, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612470293">Seifert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0967010612470293">Tickner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0967010612470293">Young, 2003</xref>). However, traditional (neo)realist narratives of security have to some (contested) extent been upseated by the human security paradigm propagated by the United Nations Development Programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612470293">UNDP, 1994</xref>) and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470293">Commission on Human Security (2003)</xref>. Repackaging disparate, marginal strands of critical intervention questioning state-centric approaches to security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612470293">MacFarlane and Khong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470293">Christie, 2010</xref>: 171), human security shifted the referent object from the (nation-)state to the individual, and in so doing transformed ‘security’ from the securing of national borders to the securing of people, irrespective of nationality or any other axes of difference. Its uneven mainstreaming in supranational policy arenas has prompted claims of a ‘paradigm shift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612470293">Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, 2007</xref>: 19–21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612470293">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The human security paradigm has attracted a still-evolving body of gender scholarship, including critical feminist engagements (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612470293">Truong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612470293"><italic>Peace Review</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0967010612470293">Fox, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612470293">Hoogensen and Rottem, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612470293">Chenoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470293">Hudson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612470293">Hoogensen and Stuvøy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612470293">Denov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612470293">2011</xref>). This work encapsulates a range of perspectives, but is decidedly ambivalent in its slippage between celebration and critique. Other (and overlapping) recent critical work on human security has contested the paradigm-shift argument, suggesting that human security is not a radical departure from (neo)realism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612470293">Chandler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612470293">Nuruzzaman, 2006</xref>) and fails to sufficiently conceptually rethink ‘security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0967010612470293">Wibben, 2008</xref>), but reinforces dominant norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 168) and has become a ‘new orthodoxy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470293">Christie, 2010</xref>). Feminist interlocutors share some of these concerns but remain interested in opening up critical feminist trajectories for reclaiming and rethinking human security (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470293">Hudson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612470293">Hoogensen and Stuvøy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612470293">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article picks up a strand of feminist critical engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 173–6) that seeks to rethink human security in ways that privilege context, relationality and intersubjectivity over the abstract individual (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470293">Hudson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612470293">Hoogensen and Stuvøy, 2006</xref>), by interrogating the category of the ‘human’ therein. Although there is a long history of critique of this particular category, particularly within feminist theory, it is largely taken for granted in dominant understandings of human security. This, I contend, contributes to human security’s ‘reproduc[tion of] dominant norms’ and ‘power relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 168). The category of the ‘human’ deeply entrenches human security in its liberal humanist, normative intellectual heritage, the excavation of which feminist critical scrutiny cannot afford to bypass. The ‘human’ has been signalled as problematic by feminist commentators – notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470293">Hudson (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson (2008)</xref> – but not subjected to sustained analysis. I therefore consider how the category of the ‘human’ has been constructed in the intellectual traditions informing human security, as well as the discursive work that it does in and through human security discourse itself, arguing that it produces gendered and exclusionary effects. Deconstructing the ‘human’ offers possibilities for intervening in and reworking these theoretical underpinnings and for ‘opening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0967010612470293">Wibben, 2008</xref>) the meaning of ‘security’ itself.</p>
<p>Human security is not a single, unified paradigm: it is ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612470293">Paris, 2001</xref>: 88), contested and permutated through multiple interpretations. This article therefore recognizes human security as a broad discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0967010612470293">Gasper, 2005</xref>) and understands it to have discursive, political and material effects. In order to narrow the scope, however, I anchor my analysis to two ‘primary’ texts: the 1994 <italic>Human Development Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612470293">UNDP, 1994</xref>) and <italic>Human Security Now</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470293">Commission on Human Security, 2003</xref>). These texts have been fundamental to the inception of the human security concept within the institutional arena, as well as to the articulation of a vision of human security as a philosophical basis for national and international policy frameworks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612470293">3</xref></sup> I also engage closely with influential academic work such as Sabina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470293">Alkire’s (2003)</xref> <italic>A Conceptual Framework for Human Security</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612470293">4</xref></sup> and the capabilities approach developed by Amartya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0967010612470293">Sen (1999)</xref> and Martha Nussbaum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470293">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612470293">2000</xref>), which underpins the 1994 <italic>Human Development Report</italic>.</p>
<p>I first examine the construction of the ‘human’ in human security discourse and the capabilities approach in which it is rooted, as well as its discursive effects. I then draw on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">Butler (2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470293">b</xref>) and feminist critics of human rights frameworks – on which dominant understandings of human security are based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 175) – to further interrogate the category of the ‘human’. In the third section, I problematize the model of the human subject that human security inherits from the liberal humanist tradition, arguing that it obscures the matrices of power through which individuals become socially differentiated. The fourth and fifth sections then consider the implications of human security’s orientation towards the ‘developing’ world for its production of the ‘human’ and of ‘morally relevant difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>), which include the links between human security and ‘war on terror’ discourses.</p>

<title>What does it mean to be human/<italic>Human</italic>?</title>
<p>The ‘human’ in human security discourse serves to qualify the discursive terrain of ‘security’. The ways in which the interrelated categories of the ‘human’, ‘the individual’ and ‘the vital core of all human lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470293">Alkire, 2003</xref>: 23) are constructed have significant implications for the kind of ‘security’ that can be imagined, not least because these terms mark out what is to be secured. The ‘human’ in human security is constructed as composed of unitary individuals or persons, each sharing in common a set of basic rights and potential ‘capabilities’, giving rise to a set of universally valid life claims – that is, entitlements to the fulfilment of ‘basic human needs’, the conditions required to furnish the opportunities to make the best use of these capabilities. The individual is conceived as having the innate capacity to make free choices between a range of opportunities, but as requiring certain minimum conditions to be met in order to properly exercise freedom of choice, the expansion of which is the goal of both developing and securing the ‘human’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612470293">UNDP, 1994</xref>). The human individual is universally concerned about securing her/his own life and dignity, able to take charge of her/his own life if so empowered through fulfilment of basic needs, and active in determining her/his well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470293">Commission on Human Security, 2003</xref>). S/he is an actor imbued with both vulnerabilities and the capacity to effect change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612470293">Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The construction of the ‘human’ within human security discourse, like human security’s normative dimensions, is firmly grounded in the capabilities approach pioneered by Amartya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0967010612470293">Sen (1999)</xref> and Martha Nussbaum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470293">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612470293">2000</xref>). The capabilities approach is intimately connected with the human rights tradition, but seeks to account for the positive, substantive, social and economic entitlements typically neglected by rights-based frameworks, while allowing space to specify the precise content of these entitlements contextually. ‘Capabilities’, explains Alkire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470293">2003</xref>: 25), ‘are composed of the freedom to enjoy a set of various valuable “beings and doings,” such as being nourished, being confident, being able to walk about without terror, being able to wear what you’d like, having a say in group decisions.’ I draw particularly on the work of Martha Nussbaum in my analysis of the construction of the ‘human’ that human security imports from the capabilities approach, because of her explicit attention to matters of gender inequality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612470293">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of the lack of critical attention to it in this context, the ‘human’ is definitive of human security, through which it is constructed as novel and distinctive. The ‘human’ in human security does three significant things: it indicates the shift of the referent object of ‘security’ from the (nation-)state, or any bounded political community or collective, to the human being, on the basis of an understanding of human beings as individuated, unitary actors or ‘persons’; it serves as an adjective that embodies a value judgement indicating the threshold, or minimum conditions, for a liveable life (a ‘fully human’ life) and thereby serves to <italic>humanize</italic> ‘security’; and it serves as a universalizing category that connotes the global, the traversing of borders and boundaries, of differences and fissures, the shared characteristics of a universal, essential human ‘nature’ or common humanity. I elaborate and comment on the significance of each of these three effects in turn.</p>
<p>First, the inscription of the ‘human’ or ‘individual’ as the referent object of security is critically important in positioning human security as an alternative conception of ‘security’ that holds potential appeal for some feminist theorists. It guards against the subordination of the ‘security’ and well-being of particular individuals to the (imagined) ‘security’ and well-being of the collectives or communities of which they are a part, which can be a particular risk, for instance, for women whose bodies are iconized as symbolic repositories of culture or national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0967010612470293">Yuval-Davis, 1997</xref>: 67). Nussbaum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612470293">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612470293">2002</xref>) argues that women’s (in her view, near universally) stunted ability to realize the capabilities necessary for a ‘fully human life’ stems in part from the sociocultural instrumentalization of women’s bodies and labour as <italic>means</italic> to the well-being and ‘security’ of others. In contrast, she describes her capabilities model as a moral philosophy that posits human beings as having intrinsic value, ‘as ends in themselves’ – a conceit that is taken up repeatedly in human security discourse. This function of the ‘human’ in human security discourse is indispensable, therefore, for a feminist conceptualization that positively demands that women’s bodily integrity, dignity and entitlement to a life free from violence (among other things) be recognized as irreducible values in and of themselves, which governments and international organizations have a duty to secure. It is crucial in that it ascribes intrinsic value to each and every human being regardless of nationality, sex or any other marker of identity and difference.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the way in which the ‘human’ functions here is problematic in three aspects, which are all interrelated. First, the individual subject is constructed as an autonomous chooser: human development and ‘security’ are conceived as enabling the flourishing of human beings through the exercise of practical reason and moral choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612470293">Nussbaum, 2002</xref>). I explain what is problematic about this in the third section of this article, which discusses subjectivity and difference. Second, this construction of the human fails to account for how the conditions through which individuals are <italic>recognized</italic> as ‘human’ in particular contexts can function in exclusionary ways. Again, I will elaborate this argument over the next two sections. Third, the positing of each individual’s well-being, ‘security’ and ‘flourishing’ as ends and values in themselves in human security requires some careful attention to conflicts of interests between individuals or groups. The discourse does not fully account for the fact that an individual’s ‘security’ and well-being are to a large extent a function of their social situatedness, their location in a web of interpersonal and social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 184), power relations and intersecting fields of discourse, indeed their very status as an inescapably embodied and intersubjective being.</p>
<p>The second significant effect of the ‘human’ in human security discourse is its function as a value judgement. This function is implicit in the notion of ‘the vital core of all human lives’ – which is a key concept in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470293">Alkire (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470293">Commission on Human Security (2003)</xref>. It is not simply the vital core of life itself that we mean to secure, but the vital core of all <italic>human</italic> lives – that is, a particular set of minimal conditions that make a life worthy of a human being. Nussbaum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470293">1999</xref>: 39), for instance, argues that those potentialities that count as human capabilities are those that ‘are so central that they seem definitive of a life that is truly human’. Capabilities – or, at least, the nurturing and realization of a particular set of capabilities – are what <italic>dignifies</italic> a life as human.</p>
<p>Notice that there are two uses of the term ‘human’ here, which, though intertwined, signify slightly different things. The ‘human’ in the first meaning is a noun that designates the foundational, stable subject who comes into being as bearer of a set of ‘basic’ or ‘innate’ potentialities (the ‘human’ individual who is the referent object of ‘security’). In the second meaning, the term is used as an adjectival value judgement: the <italic>Human</italic> life to which all individual human beings are entitled by virtue of their status as human beings. These potentialities (which Nussbaum calls ‘basic capabilities’ and which relate to the animal – read, ‘subhuman’ – fulfilment of basic needs) must be nurtured and developed through the exercise of practical reason and moral choice (and thus cultivated to the level of ‘higher’ capabilities, in Nussbaum’s vocabulary) for a life to become ‘fully human’ – that is, worthy of a human being. What this implies is that some people are born or live under conditions that render them less than human – or rather, to be precise, less-than-<italic>Human</italic>. Hence, Nussbaum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612470293">2000</xref>: 1–4) argues that many women in the world are denied the opportunity to live a life that is fully human (read, <italic>Human</italic>). What human security does not appear to acknowledge is that there are (context-specific) conditions for <italic>recognition</italic> as ‘human’ – and thereby entitled to the realization of the <italic>Human</italic>, that is, a ‘fully human life’ – in the first place. The significance of <italic>recognition</italic> here anticipates my use of Butler’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612470293">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">2004a</xref>,b) work and the importance she accords to <italic>recognition</italic>, which she posits as performative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470293">Butler, 2004b</xref>: 43) in the construction and production of the ‘human’, in the following section. Individual ‘human beings’ assume an <italic>a priori</italic> self-evident existence in human security discourse, with little analysis of how they are <italic>produced</italic> as ‘human beings’.</p>
<p>The third significant effect of the ‘human’ in human security discourse that I have identified is its universalist and universalizing claims and ambitions. The universalizing aim of ‘human security’, then, is to lift all individual ‘human beings’ up to the level of the <italic>Human</italic> – that is, to secure the conditions for all individual ‘humans’ to realize the capabilities necessary for a ‘fully human’ life. Paradoxically, being included in this field of <italic>a priori</italic> entitlement to the <italic>Human</italic>, to a ‘fully human life’, is dependent upon being <italic>recognized</italic> as already ‘human’ in the first sense of the term. This inclusivity in the first meaning of the ‘human’ is simply presumed, and I will argue that this fails to acknowledge or account for difference, specifically how some differences are construed as ‘morally relevant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>) and thereby as affecting one’s entitlement to a ‘fully human [<italic>Human</italic>] life’. In the next section, I will show how (socially and historically specific) criteria for recognition as human, in the first sense, have historically been constituted in exclusionary ways.</p>

<title>Some humans are more <italic>Human</italic> than Others</title>
<p>The category of the ‘human’ has a history shaped by particular traditions of philosophical and political thought, such that we can situate ‘human security’ in relation to those fields of power/knowledge. The construction of the ‘human’ as an exclusionary category is intimately related to the liberal construction of the human subject as an autonomous chooser that underlies human security discourse. Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">2004a</xref>: 2) writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes the very terms that confer ‘humanness’ on some individuals are those that deprive certain other individuals of the possibility of achieving that status, producing a differential between the human and the less-than-human…. The human is understood differently depending on its race, the legibility of that race, its morphology, the recognisability of that morphology, its sex, the perceptual verifiability of that sex, its ethnicity, the categorical understanding of that ethnicity. Certain humans are recognised as less than human, and that form of qualified recognition does not lead to a viable life. Certain humans are not recognised as human at all, and that leads to yet another order of unliveable life.</p>

<p>The content of the ‘human’ is marked out through its exclusions, by what it is <italic>not</italic>. This content is historically and culturally contingent and subject to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">Butler, 2004a</xref>: 2), but because ‘the “human”’ has also typically been constructed as a <italic>universal</italic>, its universalist claims have served to efface the very exclusions through which the category comes to be constituted in specific ways, obscuring the contingency of its foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612470293">Butler, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The terms by which humans become recognizably human, according to Butler, function as norms that have discursive and material effects, ‘far-reaching consequences for how we understand the model of the human entitled to rights or included in the participatory sphere of political deliberation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">Butler, 2004a</xref>: 2), producing the human through the delineation of boundaries that cast into abjection the devalued, or not valued, or ‘illegible’ Other(s) who are produced as lacking the criteria for recognition under the sign of the ‘human’. As a historically constituted category, Butler adds, the human bears the marks of its particular histories and the exclusions by means of which it has been produced in specific historical contexts. It is inscribed, for instance, with the history of ‘race’ as a category mobilized to designate some humans as less ‘human’ than others. It also brings with it a deeply gendered history, which I explore in more depth.</p>
<p>Feminists have long argued that human rights discourse is androcentric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470293">Peterson and Parisi, 1998</xref>) – its heritage lies, after all, in the Rights of <italic>Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612470293">Ahmed, 1998</xref>: 24). Rights discourse thereby constitutes the ungendered, universal ‘human’ in implicitly masculine terms. The ‘human’ refers to the universal man whose experience effaces that of women. The kinds of rights violations that predominantly affect women – indeed, particularly those that affect women <italic>because they are women</italic> – have therefore not always been properly addressed within the human rights framework. According to this argument, human rights discourse presupposes a masculine (white, heterosexual, able-bodied) subject – and, insofar as such a subject is presupposed as universal, it delineates the boundaries of the ‘human’ and relegates others to the less than human.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">Butler (2004a)</xref> points to the use of the human rights framework both by women and by gay and lesbian activists to demand ‘women’s rights’ and ‘gay and lesbian rights’ as human rights. The fact that such claims must be articulated in this way indicates the prior systematic exclusion of women, and of gay and lesbian people, from the universal ‘human’ of human rights discourse, even as they are mobilizing that discourse to claim their rightful inclusion in its projected inclusivity. The claims themselves have the effect of making visible the exclusionary boundaries of the universal category of the ‘human’, but also of testing and reconfiguring those boundaries as the claimants insinuate themselves within them (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612470293">Ahmed, 1998</xref>: 35).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470293">Peterson and Parisi (1998)</xref> also take up the critique of human rights by looking explicitly at how the ‘human’ is constructed, developing and building on the feminist critique of androcentrism in rights discourse by drawing attention to the effects of ‘coding the human body as two mutually exclusive and oppositional “types” cast as male and female’ such that to be ‘human’ means to be (heterosexually) sexed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0967010612470293">6</xref></sup> They show that the dichotomy of sexual difference is constructed as intrinsic to the human in the Western liberal humanist tradition, and they argue, drawing on Butler’s theory of gender as the effect of the discursive category ‘sex’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612470293">Butler, 1990</xref>), that sex and sexual difference are in fact historically contingent regulating categories that are mutually constitutive of the institutionalized heterosexism that is integral to the modern state system and its modes of organizing and regulating political and social life. The mature, adult ‘human’, they contend, has typically been constructed as a free chooser, an autonomous rational agent – a status limited to (heterosexual, white) males, who historically had exclusive access to the public sphere of political and economic life in the liberal state, and therefore an exclusive claim to the ‘authoritative status of personhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470293">Peterson and Parisi, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Their arguments are further substantiated by feminist theory, which has shown that the tenets thought to distinguish ‘humans’ in this liberal tradition, particularly ‘reason’ and rationality, have been constructed as masculine virtues inhering in the transcendence of all that is designated feminine – the body, ‘nature’, emotion, immanence, care, attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470293">Lloyd, 1986</xref>). For Peterson and Parisi, the gendered construction of the ‘human’ in Western political theory is not merely coincidental: it is constitutive of that category. The ‘human’ is produced as unmarkedly masculine through the transcendence of the abject, feminine, Other. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470293">Nussbaum (1999)</xref> argues that exclusions occur within liberal humanism only when it is misapplied by states and governments, Peterson and Parisi contend that liberal humanism <italic>per se</italic> constitutes the ‘human’ in human rights discourse through exclusions and exclusionary practices. Furthermore, they argue, the principle of gender hierarchy as naturalized in heterosexist social relations underpins other forms of ‘Othering’ and the ensuing forms of domination, subordination and structural violence they legitimate.</p>
<p>What, though, if the category of the ‘human’ in human security <italic>is</italic> as all-inclusive as the discourse claims? Does this solve the problem of how the human, as a universalist category, is produced through exclusions that have far-reaching political implications? Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612470293">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">2004a</xref>) contends that a ‘false’ universal cannot be expanded into a ‘real’ universal by enumerating every possible specificity or axis of difference, since it will always fall short of capturing whatever is beyond the scope of our current knowledge and imagination, and because every possibility <italic>cannot be known in advance</italic>. The possibilities for continuing to engage the category of the ‘human’ (and the risks therein) lie in the recognition that the category is subject to change, reconfiguration, rearticulation, reinvention. Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470293">b</xref>) does not suggest dispensing with the category altogether, but deploying it self-consciously, testing its boundaries and constantly interrogating the terms by which it is recognizable, so as to unearth and question the exclusions through which it is produced. Above all, she argues, the ‘human’ must remain a site of contestation, always open to resignification.</p>
<p>How successful is human security at maintaining the fluidity of the boundaries of the ‘human’, in opening the category to contestation? How attentive is it to the exclusions through which it is produced, to the contingency of its foundations? In the human security framework, the specific capabilities that make up the ‘vital core of all human lives’ to be secured are not specified, but are left open to ‘democratic deliberation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612470293">Nussbaum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470293">Commission on Human Security, 2003</xref>). Alkire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470293">2003</xref>: 27) merely proposes that the capabilities to be specified in context fall into the categories of ‘survival (freedom from premature preventable death), daily life (basic material needs), and dignity’. What is the effect of not specifying the set of capabilities that make a life ‘fully human [<italic>Human</italic>]’?</p>
<p>Nussbaum thinks it <italic>is</italic> necessary to specify the content of the capabilities framework, however tentatively. Her version of the capabilities approach proposes a tentative list of those capabilities that are so central as to define a life as ‘human’, on the basis of extensive cross-cultural research that, she insists, is open to constant contestation and revision. She argues that by failing to specify which capabilities are essential to a liveable life, we admit dangerous forms of cultural relativism, the possibility of ‘bad’ freedoms finding their way into the ‘vital core’ (‘the freedom to have non-consensual intercourse with one’s wife, the freedom to harass women in the workplace’ – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612470293">Nussbaum, 2005</xref>: 179), while good and necessary ones are detrimentally neglected as the specific content of ‘the vital core’ is battled out in particular contexts. The proposed ‘democratic deliberation’ through which the content of the ‘vital core’ is to be contextually constructed is an emphatically political process, and, Nussbaum points out, these kinds of processes have historically done a poor job of addressing violence against women.</p>
<p>On the surface, the refusal to specify the content of the ‘vital core’ appears to be consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">Butler’s (2004a)</xref> plea to retain the ‘human’ as a site of contestation, open to multiple resignifications. On the other hand, Nussbaum’s concerns are compelling, and hint at the possibility of the process of ‘democratic deliberation’ through which core capabilities are to be identified opening up gaping contradictions between the laudable stated aims of ‘human security’ and its political-material effects in particular contexts. The problem is that, in the process of operationalizing human security, the category of the ‘human’ is likely to be ‘closed’ or ‘finished’ in the particular context of its application. Decisions will have to be made about what or <italic>who</italic> is to be secured, from what or whom, and how. Such processes are mediated by social norms and hegemonic discourses, there will be power and interests at stake, and there is little to safeguard against the ‘human’ being contextually constituted in exclusionary ways.</p>
<p>The refusal to specify what makes a life fully ‘human’ is in itself insufficient to guard against the construction of the ‘human’ as an exclusionary category, which remains an ever-present risk. This is partly because, as Butler argues, the exclusions that constitute the ‘human’ are produced through the conditions of <italic>recognition</italic> of entitlement to a fully ‘human’ life. It is one thing to leave the minimum conditions of a life that is worthy of the ‘human’ [<italic>Human</italic>] unspecified and open to democratic deliberation: the conditions of <italic>recognition</italic> of entitlement to such a life are another matter altogether, and less likely to be spoken about, questioned or discussed at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ‘human’ in human security is not as indefinite as it appears even at the theoretical level. The precise content of the ‘vital core of all human lives’ to be secured may be a matter for contextually grounded deliberation and debate, but the human individual who is the bearer of these fundamental capabilities is presupposed to be a stable, bounded subject and an autonomous, rational chooser. This model of subjectivity has a particular history, and functions in human security discourse to produce particular, discursive effects. In the next section, I situate human security discourse against that history, drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen (2001)</xref> to argue that human security does not adequately account for – indeed, it obscures – the matrices of power through which individuals become socially differentiated.</p>

<title>Subjectivity and the less-than-human as the repository of ‘morally relevant’ difference</title>
<p>The implicit assumptions about human subjectivity that human security inherits from the liberal humanist tradition from which it emerged are strikingly reminiscent of the Kantian conception of the universal, rational subject –‘a self-enclosed ego that inhabits but is distinct from a body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0967010612470293">Young, 2005</xref>: 5). Feminist theorists have problematized this model of the human subject as a projection of masculine (and Western) ideals masquerading as gender-neutral description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470293">Lloyd, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612470293">Battersby, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612470293">Mackenzie and Stoljar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470293">Peterson and Parisi, 1998</xref>: 6), and have argued that this model of subjectivity has functioned as a ‘universal norm’ in Western philosophical and political thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612470293">Mackenzie and Stoljar, 2000</xref>: 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612470293">Schott, 1997</xref>: 321). Such norms are instrumental in the construction of the human as an exclusionary category, because not everyone meets the standards set by the norm. Thus human security reproduces an Enlightenment model of human subjectivity that, ‘in masking its specificity behind a veneer of universality … functions coercively to suppress different others’, and that has been shown to be ‘complicit with structures of domination and subordination, in particular with the suppression of others – women, colonial subjects, blacks, minority groups – who are deemed incapable of achieving rational self-mastery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612470293">Mackenzie and Stoljar, 2000</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>The normative projection of the autonomous, rational subject in Western metaphysics is both constitutive of and ‘an effect of particular gender relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612470293">Schott, 1997</xref>: 321). Feminist theory has shown this subject to be implicated in a masculinist system of binaries (subject/object, culture/nature, self/other), ‘whose discursive application has practical effects’ across numerous fields of social and political life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0967010612470293">Young, 2005</xref>: 5) and that both underpin and legitimate gender hierarchies (and other kinds of shifting and unstable hierarchies that are gendered in complex ways) and enable the constitution of the self through the constitution of an (abject) Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470293">Lloyd, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612470293">Battersby, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612470293">Peterson, 1992</xref>). The ‘rationality’ in which this model of subjectivity inheres has historically been constructed as characteristically masculine, in that it amounts to no less than the transcendence of all that is coded feminine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470293">Lloyd, 1986</xref>), representing ‘an expression of the flight of masculinity from the temporal, embodied, uncertain realm of phenomenal existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612470293">Schott, 1997</xref>: 321).</p>
<p>Such a conception of human subjectivity is therefore deeply problematic from a critical feminist perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen’s (2001)</xref> critique of Nussbaum’s capabilities approach is particularly useful for deconstructing the universal human subject assumed in human security discourse, and it shows how problematic this model of the human subject is, even when the capabilities model is theorized in a self-consciously gender-sensitive way. Quillen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">2001</xref>: 90) unpacks a foundational premise of Nussbaum’s conception of social justice founded in the capabilities approach, namely that ‘morally irrelevant differences’ between individuals cannot legitimately serve as ‘systematic sources of social hierarchy’. Quillen argues that Nussbaum’s capabilities approach fails to account for how ‘morally relevant’ difference is produced. Nussbaum does not explain how to distinguish a morally <italic>relevant</italic> difference from a morally irrelevant one. Quillen points out that it is precisely by being designated as morally relevant that differences <italic>do</italic> form the bases of social hierarchies that systematically <italic>dehumanize</italic> those people whose differences are constructed as morally relevant, such that ‘liberalism’s foundational principles … do not protect them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 96). She adds that in the USA, for example, differences that have functioned as morally relevant have included gender, race, age, wealth, ability to work, marital status, sexual orientation, ethnic heritage, country of citizenship ‘and a host of other factors in various contexts’.</p>
<p>Quillen contends therefore that ‘what we most need to understand is precisely what the discourse of liberal humanism occludes: the difference-making mechanisms that function within it, or in some cases in spite of it, to create or perpetuate systematic hierarchies among persons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 96). For Quillen, we need to understand how differences are imagined, constructed, produced as ‘morally relevant’ through feelings, fears and fantasies, but Nussbaum’s ‘liberal humanism has within it only <italic>limited resources</italic>’ for evaluating these processes, because ‘its assumptions about what we share: our common humanity … obscure how differences get marked as incidental or morally relevant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 97, emphasis added). This attests, Quillen proceeds, to a paradoxical ‘logic that sustains the category of the not-fully-human even as it imagines a natural equality of dignity for all humans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 98). Her argument here reflects Butler’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470293">b</xref>) proposition that the universalist category of the ‘human’ is produced through exclusions, because ‘the category of the not fully human persists both as <italic>the necessary condition of the human</italic> and as the repository of morally relevant difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 98, emphasis added).</p>
<p>The dehumanization of those whose differences are marked as morally relevant is linked to the reification of sameness and difference. In order to claim entitlements as ‘human’, although their marginalization is mutually constitutive of the ‘morally relevant’ status of their ‘difference’, the marginalized must assert their <italic>commonality</italic> with – rather than difference from – those in power, to win respect for their claims to inclusion. ‘Others’ are thus produced ‘either as the same (our common humanity) or radically different … but never dynamically and contingently, as the same and also different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 119). Differences are either erased or fetishized.</p>
<p>Quillen argues that this problematic (the production of the ‘less than human’ as a condition of the ‘human’, the fetishization of difference) is inherently symptomatic of a moral philosophy grounded in a conception of the ‘essential human person’ as a disembedded rational agent. This starting point ‘decouples an analysis of human capabilities from an analysis of the structures – social, economic, and discursive – that in any given historical context largely determine how these capabilities are actualized, structures that often enable some at the cost of disabling others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470293">Quillen, 2001</xref>: 98). Such assumptions about universal common humanity, she claims, both mask and leave us short of resources to conceptualize how differences become marked as ‘morally relevant’ and reified.</p>
<p>In human security discourse, the human person or individual is posited as a bearer of potential capabilities as a function of his or her essential status as an autonomous rational agent. Thus, human security inherits the fundamental features of the capabilities approach that Quillen’s analysis so astutely troubles. The individual emerges as an originary category, a stable foundation onto which to project the ‘vital core of all human lives’. It is unsurprising, then, that scholars of gender and human security such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470293">Hudson (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612470293">Denov (2006)</xref> have critiqued the paradoxically individualizing effects of human security’s universalizing narrative, arguing that it offers an inadequate account of how social relations, power and structures shape subjectivity and agency and produce (‘morally relevant’) differences between individuals. The next two sections consider the kinds of ‘difference-making mechanisms’ that the ‘human’ in human security both obscures and is implicated in.</p>

<title>The not-yet-modern as not-fully-<italic>Human</italic></title>
<p>A further, and significant, way in which the content and meaning of the ‘human’/‘<italic>Human</italic>’ in human security discourse is implicitly specified is through the orientation of human security towards developing-world peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield, 2006</xref>: 14, 17), which is unequivocal in the primary human security literature. The 1994 <italic>Human Development Report</italic> positioned human security at the ‘sharp end’ of a continuum of human development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612470293">UNDP, 1994</xref>). This orientation has the effect of projecting such populations as not fully <italic>Human</italic>, resting on unexamined assumptions about the content of the <italic>Human</italic> and an underlying, universal ‘human nature’ that serve a surreptitiously normative function. The developed/underdeveloped, modern/not-yet-modern axes insidiously become axes of the production of what Quillen might call ‘morally relevant difference’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">Charusheela’s (2009)</xref> postcolonialist critique of Nussbaum’s universalism is particularly useful for drawing out some critical implications of this orientation of human security discourse towards the developing world. Charusheela shows how the ‘developmental modernist’ framework in which Nussbaum’s universalism is embedded – and which, I would argue, human security discourse similarly inhabits – can insidiously reproduce the structural conditions that render some humans less than <italic>Human</italic>, not only in spite of but <italic>through</italic> the interventions and strategies aimed precisely at securing the status of being ‘fully <italic>Human</italic>’ for all humans. Charusheela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">2009</xref>: 1136, 1146) argues that in her search for a non-ethnocentric universalist ethics, Nussbaum shifts ethnocentrism into social analysis – into the cognitive frameworks through which her approach <italic>applies</italic> her universalist ethics to the social world. She recaps how Nussbaum arrives at her list of ten central human functional capabilities (which can be understood as equivalent to ‘the vital core of all human lives’), through cross-cultural dialogue, and thus comes to conclusions about what universally dignifies a life as fully <italic>Human</italic>. As the list, in an effort to remain sensitive to cultural difference, is only a very general guide to ethical practice, Charusheela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">2009</xref>: 1139) points out that social analysis of how a society is organized and functions is required before it can be applied.</p>
<p>Charusheela examines Nussbaum’s arguments for the importance of literacy to demonstrate her critique. Literacy is a subcategory under the central human capability of senses, imagination and thought on Nussbaum’s universal list. Charusheela looks at how Nussbaum’s arguments for the universally emancipatory potential of literacy rest on implicit social analyses – that is,<disp-quote>
<p>they assume the existence of a layer of institutions that organize the production of knowledge and culture, and assume that literacy is needed to engage with those institutions…. These assumptions deny even the possibility that ‘literacy’ has been used, and indeed organized via these institutions, to exclude subaltern groups and privilege educated elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">Charusheela, 2009</xref>: 1140).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charusheela draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470293">Nzegwu’s (1995)</xref> alternate analysis of women’s right to work in Nigeria, and the significance of literacy therein, which shows that various governmental, nongovernmental and international institutions have institutionalized literacy as a criterion for attaining equal access to jobs and resources. This analysis contrasts with the assumption that illiterate women are less skilled, less productive or less politicized than educated women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">Charusheela, 2009</xref>: 1142) and that these factors account for their limited access to jobs and resources. The cognitive frameworks that uncritically privilege literacy and that, Charusheela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">2009</xref>: 1143) argues, are smuggled into Nussbaum’s framework ‘slip in an ethnocentric normative assessment of the capabilities of the illiterate’ – in doing so, they both reproduce and legitimate structural inequalities. In Quillen’s terminology, then, (il)literacy is surreptitiously produced as a ‘morally relevant’ difference.</p>
<p>Charusheela then revisits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612470293">Nussbaum’s (1995)</xref> reply to Nzegwu, arguing that Nussbaum (mis)reads this alternative social analysis as a reclaiming of ‘tradition’, and thereby deploys the modern/traditional binary as an interpretive frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">Charusheela, 2009</xref>: 1145). Nussbaum thus applies what Charusheela calls a ‘modern developmentalist’ framework. Charusheela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">2009</xref>: 1147) stresses the implicit normative dimension of this framework, which rests on assumptions about appropriate institutional modes for political, cultural and social organization (privileging the nation-state), along with a corresponding set of assumptions about human nature that consist, <italic>inter alia</italic>, in ‘reason and voice deployed in ways appropriate to these institutions’.</p>
<p>Human security might also be understood as a discourse that inhabits, is shaped by and simultaneously reproduces a similarly modernist developmental framework. This is evident from its continued privileging of the nation-state, no longer as the referent object but as the provider and arbiter of security and source of legitimate political authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield, 2006</xref>: 23; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612470293">UNDP, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470293">Commission on Human Security, 2003</xref>) – as well as from its positing of the human individual whom it seeks to secure, as discussed above, as an autonomous rational chooser.</p>
<p>Charusheela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">2009</xref>: 1142) argues in effect, on the basis of her reading of Nzegwu, that ‘literacy’ is in fact <italic>not</italic> intrinsically a universally necessary and fundamental criterion for a fully <italic>Human</italic> life, <italic>except under certain institutional conditions –</italic> tied to, and reproduced in and by, the modernist epistemological frameworks she critiques, which institutionalize literacy as a filter for access to various entitlements – entitlements that, in the terms of my discussion, we might construe as basic requirements for a life that is fully <italic>Human</italic>. She writes, ‘cognitive frameworks that uncritically privilege literacy … naturalise the higher value … accorded to the literate, and legitimise the very power structure they are trying to undo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470293">Charusheela, 2009</xref>: 1142–3). Thus, the criteria for achieving ‘a life that is fully <italic>Human</italic>’ in Nussbaum’s model (according to Charusheela) are determined and produced by and through a modernist frame that is <italic>normative</italic> but that masquerades as <italic>descriptive</italic> and <italic>universal</italic>. Its normative function itself, rather than ‘poor implementation’, contributes to reproducing the exclusion of some ‘humans’ from the <italic>‘Human</italic>’, and to reproducing the less-than-<italic>Human</italic> as a necessary condition of the <italic>Human</italic>.</p>
<p>The targeting of human security at developing-world peoples <italic>in and of itself</italic> positions these subjects as <italic>not fully Human</italic> – the aim of human development and human security being to make these [poor less-than-human] people <italic>more Human</italic> – but <italic>Human</italic> according to what Charusheela calls ‘developmental modernist’ standards, which remain unexamined. Human security discourse implicitly equates full humanness or being <italic>Human</italic> with modernity – an equation that, again, is normative but masquerades as descriptive. The effects of this normative association, if we are to take Charusheela’s analysis seriously, paradoxically can include the reproduction of structurally unequal relations of power that condition access to basic ‘human/<italic>Human</italic>’ entitlements, and thus the structural exclusion of various categories of people from attaining the status of being <italic>Human</italic>.</p>

<title>Human security, the security–development nexus and the ‘war on terror’</title>
<p>The demarcation of ‘morally relevant’ difference, in Quillen’s account, which (in the terms of this discussion) produces some humans as more human/<italic>Human</italic> than others, is contextual, contingent and multidimensional, as well as (I would add) often unstable and shifting across different temporal and spatial locations. I wish to make a further link between the orientation of human security towards developing-world populations and the production of the less-than-human/<italic>Human</italic> as the repository of ‘morally relevant’ difference. Human security, according to Duffield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">2006</xref>: 14), encapsulates ‘the fusion of development and security’, which he characterizes as a broad international policy consensus emerging in the 1990s whereby the idea of sustainable development became ‘securitized’, accompanied by a change of focus from inter- to intrastate conflict, closely wedded to the take-up of the ‘new wars’ thesis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0967010612470293">Kaldor, 1999</xref>). This consensus sees organized conflict as ‘development in reverse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield, 2006</xref>: 20): underdevelopment – poverty, exclusion, alienation – are understood as incentivizing ‘new wars’-type conflicts and, conversely, sustainable development is constructed as a bulwark against conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield, 2006</xref>: 20–1).</p>
<p>Human security was instrumentalized in the service of the ‘war on terror’ project in the 2000s, as I have argued elsewhere with reference to British national security discourse in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612470293">Marhia and Davies, 2013</xref>), despite the discomfort this caused to some of human security’s advocates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield (2006)</xref> explores how the ‘war on terror’ impacted human security, and deepened and reoriented the security–development nexus, such that (<italic>their</italic>) development became necessary for (<italic>our</italic>) security (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470293">Christie, 2010</xref>: 174). In contrast to Duffield’s focus on how this played out through the biopolitics of international security, I am interested in how the conceptual construction of human security facilitated its instrumentalization – how ideas about civility and freedom, and the aim of lifting the less-than-<italic>Human</italic> up to the status of the <italic>Human</italic>, played into a cultural and ideological war in which the main protagonists claimed to be standing for these very values (and thus, implicitly, defending the human/<italic>Human</italic>) in the face of those who would ostensibly destroy them/‘our way of life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0967010612470293">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have demonstrated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612470293">Marhia and Davies, 2013</xref>) that there are significant continuities between human security discourse and the justificatory discourses of post-9/11 and ‘war on terror’ security discourse, policy and practice. The discursive terrain carved out in security and foreign policy discourse that both made space for and reflected the rise of human security in the 1990s was marshalled in the service of constructions of security as ‘security from terrorism’, where terrorism was identified with Islamic extremism and posited as an attack upon ‘our way of life’ in the liberal West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612470293">Marhia and Davies, 2013</xref>). Hence, humanitarian discourses were woven into the justifications for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and the strategies for dealing with the aftermath of both conflicts. Cross-governmental mechanisms were established by the British government, for instance, not only at the policy level but also linking the infrastructures for implementing ‘development’, ‘security’ and foreign policy in ways that reflect the deepening of the security–development nexus indicated by Duffield. Duffield shows how key actors such as the US government, the European Union and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ‘all highlight[ed] development assistance as a strategic tool in the war against terrorism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield, 2006</xref>: 27), and how aid resources were refocused on regions, populations and issues seen as potentially threatening ‘homeland security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">Duffield, 2006</xref>: 14). It became crucial to secure failed and fragile states identified as pivotal to preventing terrorist networks from flourishing and penetrating the centres of Western modernity. For Duffield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470293">2006</xref>: 27), this positioned the ‘war on terror’ as ‘a multidimensional conflict that also engages with questions of poverty, development and internal conflict’. Raising the (not-yet-<italic>Human</italic>) inhabitants of certain unruly spaces of the global South up to the level of the <italic>Human</italic>, then, was cast as helping to secure our (Western, modern) way of life against external threats, and terrorism in particular.</p>
<p>Part of what enabled this instrumentalization was human security’s orientation towards developing countries or ‘non-modern’ populations on the presumption that they have not yet attained the status of being fully <italic>Human</italic>. This creates room for a slippage into a discourse that more actively and aggressively dehumanizes (rather than just failing to recognize as human) certain categories of people construed as potential threats to ‘our way of life’ in the centres of Western modernity. Continuities between human security and ‘war on terror’ discourses also reflect the ways in which both can be understood as offspring of (what Charusheela calls) a ‘modernist developmentalist’ framework and a modernist, liberal humanist philosophical tradition. As counterintuitive as this may seem to advocates of human security who saw the ‘war on terror’ as undermining the humanization of security in which they were invested, even a cursory look at the language of this ideological ‘war’ indicates that it was waged in the name of ostensibly liberal normative aims – which, I suggest, cannot be straightforwardly or exclusively reduced to a cover for ulterior, material motives.</p>
<p>Quillen’s argument, discussed above, alerts us to the need to look for how human security discourse has been marshalled in ways that contribute to, and reproduce, ‘difference-making mechanisms’, such as between ‘us’ in the ‘civilized’ West and the barbaric ‘others’ of radical Islam and/or the ‘new wars’ of the global South. Indeed, the ‘war on terror’ project provides a very stark, recent example of how purportedly inclusive liberal norms of personhood, freedom and rights in which human security is deeply invested can serve to (produce and) demarcate the boundaries of ‘morally relevant’ difference, with those whose differences are marked as morally relevant being implicitly – but also materially and consequentially – cast as inhuman or subhuman. Being marked by morally relevant difference had severe consequences for some in the age of indefinite detention, Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay. The dehumanizing practices of this project ranged from the insidious to the spectacularly corporeal, and were certainly gendered (and frequently sexualized), although not straightforwardly gender-based. Explicit claims about gender, and about humanizing women and girls, were marshalled in the very demarcation of particular differences as ‘morally relevant’ in this complex arena of ideological warfare, and an intricate matrix of differentiation along cross-cutting lines of nation, religion, culture, race and sexuality shaped the dehumanizing violences – against particular groups of minority-ethnic men and against whole populations – through which this project was, in part, played out (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612470293">Bhattacharyya, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612470293">Butler, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The troubling of the ‘human’ in human security discourse, then, has implications for efforts to rethink the latter from a critical feminist perspective. In order to address the uneven global distribution of embodied vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470293">Butler, 2004a</xref>), human security must do <italic>more</italic> than secure the (individual) ‘human’. Truong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612470293">2006</xref>: xii) argue that the referent object of security cannot be reduced to the individual as the bearer of rights and entitlements, but must also include ‘the social relations that mediate human life in ways that ensure its quality and flourishing’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 184). There is no <italic>a priori</italic> formula for intervening in these relations: this requires situated empirical analyses and is inevitably (and productively) a source of contestation. Moreover, this discussion underscores that a normative approach does not go far enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612470293">Robinson, 2008</xref>: 169). Such an approach projects an ideal without accounting for the kind of complex work that is needed to arrive there. The ideal itself is so ambiguous and malleable that it can be taken up and adapted to an extensive range of contradictory agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470293">Christie, 2010</xref>: 176). From a critical feminist perspective, the normative must be informed and inflected by a critical/interpretive dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470293">Hudson, 2005</xref>: 164; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612470293">Truong et al., 2006</xref>: xii).</p>
<p>I have argued that human security must therefore interrogate the production of ‘morally relevant’ difference and the conditions for recognition under the sign of the ‘human’. It needs theoretical resources to account for how the ‘human’/<italic>Human</italic> is produced through matrices of power/knowledge, not only in the specific empirical contexts in which the ‘human’/<italic>Human</italic> is applied, but in and through the very conceptual frameworks that underpin the human security paradigm itself, its take-up by various actors in a range of contexts, and therefore the interventions carried out in its name – which are indeed multiple and varied and do not necessarily form a single, coherent or monolithic project. This could lead to a deeper and more critical perspective on the reproduction of the structural inequalities and violences underlying the insecurities that human security seeks to address and, in the spirit of the existing tradition of feminist critical engagement with security, a more critical and reflexive perspective on the implication <italic>of</italic> (human) ‘security’, not just as a public good, but as an institutional field of power, in the reproduction of such structural inequalities, violences and <italic>in</italic>securities.</p>

<p>I am referring here to a broad and eclectic body of literature, representing a range of feminist and gender perspectives, approaches and methodologies, which do not form a homogenous, seamless whole, although they share a critical stance (or stances) on state-centric, (neo)realist, masculinist security theory.
