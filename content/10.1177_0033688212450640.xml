<abstract>
<p>For second language learners vocabulary growth is of major importance, and for many learners commercially published coursebooks will be the source of this vocabulary learning. In this preliminary study, input from three levels of the coursebook series <italic>New English File</italic> (Oxenden and Latham-Koenig, 2006; Oxenden, Latham-Koenig, and Seligson, 2004, 2005) was analyzed using the computer program <italic>VocabProfile</italic> (Cobb, 2009). The results suggest that learners who complete three coursebook levels will receive exposure to fewer than the first 1,500 most frequent words in English. This has important pedagogical implications for learners, teachers and materials writers. Supplementary sources of suitable reading input are recommended, as is instruction in effective vocabulary learning strategies, if learners are to have regular opportunities to meet the most frequent 2,000 words of English.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212450640">Nation and Macalister (2010)</xref> suggest 20 principles based on research and theory which can help guide and inform the curriculum design process. This study is guided by their first principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212450640">2010</xref>: 40):
<disp-quote>
<p>A language course should provide the best possible coverage of language in use through the inclusion of items that occur frequently in the language, so that learners get the best return for their learning effort.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This study focuses on the vocabulary coverage of the most frequent 2,000 words in a popular series of coursebooks used to teach English as a Foreign Language (EFL). These coursebooks are found in many second language classrooms around the world and frequently provide the structure and syllabus for a language program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212450640">Richards, 2001</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>Vocabulary is often cited by learners as their number one concern in language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212450640">Green and Meara, 1995</xref>). Research has shown an important link exists between vocabulary knowledge and reading ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212450640">Nation and Coady, 1988</xref>), its effect on writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212450640">Laufer and Nation, 1995</xref>) as well as on listening and speaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212450640">Joe et al., 1996</xref>). High frequency vocabulary provides the most benefit to learners, as the most frequent 2,000 word families cover over 80% of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212450640">Carroll et al., 1971</xref>) and account for nearly 95% of spoken language, thus providing learners with the lexical foundation to engage in everyday conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212450640">Adolphs and Schmitt, 2003</xref>: 433).</p>
<p>Second language learners around the world attend language classes in the hope of improving their overall English proficiency and one of the key components in these language classes is the coursebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212450640">Richards, 2001</xref>: 12). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212450640">Richards (2001</xref>: 12) states that ‘much of the language teaching that occurs around the world today could not take place without the extensive use of commercial textbooks’. The coursebook provides teachers with direction, support, and a variety of activities for classroom practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212450640">Mares, 2003</xref>: 130). Commercially produced coursebooks come in a range of levels and are designed to guide learners from their beginning efforts at language learning all the way through to advanced levels of proficiency. Many private language academies around the world base their general English courses around these coursebooks, as they help to standardize instruction. Learners who are studying EFL appreciate their familiarity, with part-time learners at these language institutions usually using the book for a year. It is fair to say that coursebooks have a significant effect on language classes and the teaching that goes on within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212450640">Mares, 2003</xref>: 130).</p>
<p>One of the main advantages cited for the use of coursebooks is the element of quality assurance, as a well developed coursebook exposes students to tried and tested materials based on sound learning principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212450640">Richards, 2001</xref>: 13). These teaching materials are written by experts in the English language teaching field, who are familiar with current theoretical approaches and teaching methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0033688212450640">Rubdy, 2003</xref>: 39). The coursebook syllabus is systematically planned and developed so learners will receive the appropriate instruction at each level of their learning experience. Vocabulary learning is given special attention by publishers, with the global coursebook <italic>New Headway</italic> advertised as providing a ‘strong lexical syllabus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0033688212450640">Oxford University Press, 2009</xref>) while <italic>Cutting Edge</italic> claims to ‘focus on high-frequency vocabulary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0033688212450640">Pearson Education Limited, 2009</xref>). However, these claims have been challenged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212450640">Folse (2004</xref>: 127) who suggests it is a myth that vocabulary is adequately covered in coursebooks and states that most ESL coursebooks do not deal with vocabulary in a systematic way at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0033688212450640">
<title>Previous Studies</title>
<p>There is little published information investigating the vocabulary presented in coursebooks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212450640">Cobb (1995)</xref> analyzed the vocabulary coverage of three commercial coursebooks in order to see if they were meeting the needs of learners taking the Cambridge PET proficiency test. Cobb took a total of 200 words from the 2,387 items on the PET vocabulary list, which was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212450640">Hindmarsh’s (1980)</xref> <italic>Cambridge English Lexicon</italic>, by taking groups of 20 words at 10 randomly selected points. These words were compared with the vocabulary lists provided in three different series of coursebooks. In Cobb’s study, if the word was found in any level of the coursebook series it was counted as being present. After computer analysis Cobb determined the <italic>New Cambridge English Course</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0033688212450640">Swan and Walters, 1990</xref>) provided the best result with 53.5% coverage, which accounted for less than 1,500 words. Cobb found that none of the coursebooks systematically covered high frequency words and concluded that they failed to provide learners with the necessary vocabulary required to pass the PET test.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450640">Eldridge and Neufeld (2009</xref>: 227) analyzed the <italic>SUCCESS</italic> coursebook series and discovered it contains only 1,400 of the first 2,000 words of English in its first four levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212450640">Arkin (2005</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450640">Eldridge and Neufeld, 2009</xref>: 227) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212450640">Billuroğlu (2007</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450640">Eldridge and Neufeld, 2009</xref>: 227) both claim similar findings in the coursebook series <italic>Headway</italic> and <italic>Pathfinder</italic> respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450640">Eldridge and Neufeld (2009)</xref> suggest that Cobb’s findings are just as relevant today and that the lack of focus on these high frequency words is not limited to any one coursebook series.</p>
<p>In another recent study focusing on the vocabulary load of coursebooks, and the vocabulary learning opportunities they provide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450640">Matsuoka and Hirsh (2010)</xref> used the computer program <italic>Range</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212450640">Heatley et al., 2002</xref>) to analyze all 44,877 running words from the 12 chapters of the course book <italic>New Headway Student’s Book Upper-Intermediate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0033688212450640">Soars and Soars, 2005</xref>). The results showed that the 2,000 words from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0033688212450640">West’s (1953)</xref> <italic>General Service List</italic> (GSL), combined with other assumed known words for learners at the upper-intermediate level, accounted for 93.4% of the entire text. This figure rose to 95.5% with the addition of words from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212450640">Coxhead’s (2000)</xref> <italic>Academic Word List</italic> (AWL). The researchers also found that the coursebook provided learners with a good opportunity to deepen their knowledge of some vocabulary from the GSL and AWL, as well as words outside those lists, due to the frequency of their occurrence in the coursebook, their repetition across chapters, and the variety of contexts in which the words appear. However, it was also found that a large number of words occurred only once within the coursebook. One of Matsuoka and Hirsh’s conclusions is the importance of supplementing the coursebook with graded readers or other suitable extensive reading material.</p>

<sec id="section3-0033688212450640">
<title>Research Question</title>
<p>This leads to the following research question: <italic>Does a learner who follows a series of coursebooks receive sufficient exposure to the most frequent 2,000 words in English?</italic></p>
<p>In this study, ‘sufficient exposure’ will be defined as whether or not a word is present in any level of the coursebook. In many cases the coursebook is the only written input learners have available to them, and will be their main source of vocabulary.</p>
<p>This question will be addressed by looking at three different types of input:</p>
<list id="list1-0033688212450640" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Does the reading input provide sufficient exposure to key vocabulary items?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the reading input combined with the listening input provide sufficient exposure?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the reading and listening input combined with the supplementary text provide sufficient exposure?</p></list-item>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-0033688212450640">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The coursebook series <italic>New English File</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0033688212450640">Oxenden and Latham-Koenig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0033688212450640">Oxenden et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0033688212450640">2005</xref>) published by Oxford University Press was selected for analysis and for the following reasons: it claims to focus on high-frequency vocabulary in each lesson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0033688212450640">Oxenden et al., 2004</xref>: 8), it was reported as being the biggest selling coursebook worldwide in the popular EFL industry newspaper <italic>EL Gazette</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212450640">2008</xref>), it is published for the international English teaching market, and it is highly regarded by teachers within the EFL teaching profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0033688212450640">Starry, 2009</xref>). The coursebook series also aligns itself with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).</p>
<p>Each coursebook level contains a series of units, referred to as ‘files’, which are divided into seven separate sections. The first four sections of each unit are labeled A to D and are two-pages long. Each of these two-page sections has a specific grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation focus. These are then followed by the fifth and sixth sections titled <italic>Practical English</italic> and <italic>Writing</italic>, which are each one-page in length. The Practical English section concentrates on functional, ‘survival’ English, while the Writing section focuses on different text types and writing skills. The seventh, and final, section in each unit is called <italic>Revise &amp; Check</italic>, which reviews the grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation from the unit. Furthermore, at the back of each student’s book there are three banks of material: a <italic>Grammar Bank, Vocabulary Bank</italic> and <italic>Pronunciation Bank.</italic> These banks contain exercises linked to the relevant unit in the student’s book.</p>
<p>An electronic document was created which contained all texts at the Elementary, Pre-Intermediate and Intermediate levels of New English File. At each coursebook level the texts were separated into three sections: reading input, listening input and supplementary text. The following is a description of what is contained in each of these sections:</p>

<sec id="section6-0033688212450640">
<title>Reading Input</title>
<p>The coursebooks contain a number of different text types, such as newspaper and magazine articles, letters, emails, CVs, written interviews, fictional stories and questionnaires. Texts were classified as reading texts by using the following criteria:</p>
<list id="list2-0033688212450640" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Does it look like a typical text type which learners would find outside the context of a coursebook?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there an expectation for learners to comprehend this text?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some of the reading texts are incomplete, with learners required to match vocabulary items, questions or isolated sentences with gaps in the text. Other texts contain spelling and grammar errors inserted by the coursebook writers for learners to correct. As these reading texts are used as a vehicle for the teaching of grammar and vocabulary, it is highly likely learners will complete these activities within the class. Therefore, reading texts such as these were included in this section under the following conditions:</p>
<list id="list3-0033688212450640" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Spelling and grammar errors inserted within the reading texts for learners to correct were corrected prior to their inclusion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vocabulary items, questions and isolated sentences which learners are expected to insert into the gaps in order to complete the text were also included as part of the reading texts.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Comprehension questions, instructions to activities, and sentences used as the basis for speaking activities were not included in the reading input. These were later included under the section <italic>supplementary text</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0033688212450640">
<title>Listening Input</title>
<p>Each level of <italic>New English File</italic> contains listening transcripts at the back of the coursebook. These transcripts were used to form the listening texts for each coursebook level. It is important to note that the listening transcripts do not cover all the listening learners may experience in the classroom, as pronunciation activities are not in the listening transcripts at the back of the coursebook. Optional activities contained in the teacher’s book, such as song worksheets, are also not in the listening input.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0033688212450640">
<title>Supplementary Text</title>
<p>This section is comprised of the written text taken from the first unit of each coursebook level and which is not already part of the reading or listening input. For example, it includes all text which is used for headings, instructions, communication activities and activity prompts. It also contains the corresponding grammar and vocabulary bank exercises for Unit One taken from the back of the book.</p>

The lists used for analysis are the first 1,000 words and the second 1,000 words from the GSL.</p>
<p>The texts were analyzed and the number of word families within the first 2,000 words was determined. This was undertaken progressively using the different sections of the input at each coursebook level. At each level the texts were analyzed as follows:</p>

<p>At the Elementary level a learner will be exposed to a total of 718 word families. This number increases to 1,139 families at the Intermediate level. When the reading texts from all three levels are combined, the analysis shows that a learner will be exposed to 1,311 word families, which is 172 more than the number at the Intermediate level. This suggests some word families are present in the Elementary and Pre-Intermediate level reading texts which are not in the reading texts at the Intermediate level.</p>

<title>Supplementary Text</title>
<p>The number of running words in the supplementary text is significantly smaller than the other two sets of input (reading, listening). Similar to the reading and listening texts the size of the supplementary text increases with the progression of levels. It is worth noting that there are only seven units in the Intermediate student’s book compared to nine in the first two levels, which may explain the size of the supplementary text at this level.</p>
<p>Learners are exposed to a total of 833 word families when all coursebook levels are combined. A learner at the Elementary level is exposed to 316 word families, which is less than half of the 657 families present at the Intermediate level. 176 word families are introduced at the Elementary and Pre-Intermediate levels which are not found again in the Intermediate student’s book.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0033688212450640">Table 4</xref> shows us that when the listening and reading input are combined for analysis the total number of word families at each level increases. If we take the Elementary book as an example, a learner receives exposure to a total of 718 word families in the reading texts, and 542 in the listening texts. However, when the reading and listening input for that level are combined, the learner will be exposed to 820 word families. Therefore, we can conclude that there are 102 word families in the Elementary listening texts which are not in the reading texts. This is established by subtracting the 718 word families in the reading texts from the total 820 word families. This shows us that the listening texts provide exposure to vocabulary which learners will not meet in the reading texts at the Elementary level.</p>

<p>We can undertake the same equation with the total number of word families when all levels are combined. For example, a learner is exposed to a total of 1,311 word families in the reading texts alone. However, when all three levels of the reading and listening texts are combined we can see in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0033688212450640">Table 4</xref> that a learner will have encountered 1,395 word families, which represents an additional 84 word families. These additional word families are comprised of 28 word families from the first 1,000 word list, and 56 from the second 1,000 word list, and a learner will encounter these words through the listening materials in the coursebook, not in the reading input.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450640">Table 5</xref> shows us that there is a total of 1,435 word families contained in the reading, listening and supplementary texts. At the first 1,000 word level 877 are covered, and 558 of the second 1,000 word level are present. The addition of the supplementary text increases the total number of word families at each level of the coursebook. Importantly, some of these word families are drawn from within the 1,000 most frequent words, which are of great benefit to learners. There are 20 word families present at the Elementary level, 13 at the Pre-Intermediate level and 12 at the Intermediate level which are not in the reading or listening texts at the first 1,000 word level.</p>

<p>It is worth noting the difference in the total number of word families at the Intermediate level (1,291) and the combined total of all three books (1,435) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450640">Table 5</xref>. This shows us that 144 word families are introduced to learners in the first two levels which are not repeated in any of the reading, listening or supplementary text for learners at the Intermediate level.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0033688212450640">Table 6</xref> shows that as a learner progresses through the coursebook the ratio of word families present between the first and second 1,000 word levels will become smaller. At the Elementary level there are 23.93 word families present at the first 1,000 level to every 10 word families in the second 1,000. However, at the Intermediate level this gap has reduced to 17.64 word families to every 10, which shows us that word families from the second 1,000 word level are being introduced at a greater rate than the first 1,000 as the levels progress.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When we look at the results of the analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450640">Table 5</xref> we can see that a learner who follows the coursebook, <italic>New English File</italic>, from Elementary to Intermediate level will be exposed to almost three quarters of the most frequent words in English, leaving them with just over 500 word families to meet. Some examples of words which are not present in any of the texts but which are within the first 1,000 words in the GSL are <italic>concern, doubt, join, provide, trouble</italic> and <italic>various</italic>. Missing words from the second 1,000 words are <italic>absolutely, baggage, bottom, avoid, pattern</italic> and <italic>rubbish</italic>. When we consider the importance of these words and the value they have for learners it is surprising not to find them at any stage in the reading or listening input.</p>
<p>However, it is worth pointing out that not all of the words from the GSL may prove useful for learners today and reflect the age of the list. Many general English learners around the world will have no immediate use for words like <italic>vessel, miner</italic> or <italic>coal</italic>, which are taken from the first 1,000 words, or <italic>plough, shilling</italic>, and <italic>hurrah</italic> from the second 1,000 words. These words were not present in the coursebooks and would not be considered frequent for many English speakers these days.</p>
<p>If we look at words included in the coursebook which are not in the GSL, we can see that some of these are important for learners. Some examples of these words are: <italic>television, computer, email, plastic, online</italic> and <italic>airport</italic>. These words have been created, or have come into more frequent use, since the GSL was put together. Other words, such as <italic>bye, guys, kids, chat, OK</italic> and <italic>yeah</italic>, are not on the list but would prove useful to learners who are studying general English. Words such as <italic>whiteboard, workbook, classroom, answer</italic> and <italic>homework</italic>, may not be classed as high frequency words in the GSL yet are useful for teachers and learners in the language classroom, as are words used to describe language such as <italic>syllable, tense, preposition, contraction</italic> and <italic>plural</italic>. Although these words are outside of the GSL there are strong reasons as to why they deserve the learner’s attention.</p>
<p>There were also 231 word families from the <italic>Academic Word List</italic> (AWL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212450640">Coxhead, 2000</xref>) present in the coursebooks. Words from this list are usually a focus for learners who wish to go on to academic study, however some words, such as <italic>adult, licence, professional, drama</italic> and <italic>transport</italic>, for example, are also useful for general English learners. These words also provide important coverage in newspaper texts, which is the source from which the coursebook reading material has been adapted.</p>
<p>However, even after acknowledging the presence of useful words classed as outside of the GSL or the AWL, we can still find a large number of words used in coursebooks which appear to be of little use to learners. This suggests that the selection of many words within the coursebooks has not been guided by principles on frequency of use. Learners should be spending time on words which provide the greatest benefit when we consider the time and effort it takes to learn them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212450640">Nation, 1995</xref>: 6). The following is a selection of some of the words present in the three levels which are outside the lists: <italic>boomerang, jacuzzi, gatophobia, orangutan, kevlar, grange, medial, hydrate, matriculate, impersonate, chic, interrogate, vegetation, manicure, spire, chimpanzee, lagoon, ovation, muse, inscription, confiscate, syndicate, exorbitant, claustrophobia, baptism, teller, monument, shutter, verdict, reconcile, refuge, medieval, hooligan, divine, palette, psychic, mallet, volition, plantation, frivolous</italic>, and <italic>pedicure.</italic> Over half of the word types identified as outside of the GSL from the combined texts occur only once in the coursebooks. As a result, teachers and learners will inevitably spend class time on low- frequency words which are not repeated within the same coursebook, or subsequent levels.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212450640">Schmitt (2008</xref>: 333) sees the vocabulary learning process as dependent on four important ‘partners’ who each play a crucial role: learners, teachers, materials writers and researchers. The results of this study appear to have important pedagogical implications for three of these partners.</p>
<sec id="section16-0033688212450640">
<title>Teachers and Learners</title>
<p>This study highlights the fact that learners must maintain their motivation for learning over a long period of time. For example, language learners in an EFL context who are attending language classes on a part-time basis will typically take three years to reach the end of the Intermediate level. After this significant amount of time, they will have been exposed to fewer than 1,500 word families from the GSL after completing these three levels of the coursebook. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212450640">Meara (1995)</xref> stresses that vocabulary learning does not need to proceed at such a slow pace, and that teachers can encourage faster vocabulary learning progress through the use of word lists, such as the GSL, as well as encouraging deliberate learning using word pairs, thus providing learners with access to a lot more vocabulary than is present in early coursebook levels. It is necessary for the teacher to guide learners to study words which are useful, and provide information on how to use deliberate learning strategies, such as using word cards or the keyword technique effectively (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212450640">Nation, 2001</xref>: 311-16). In a recent case study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450640">Fitzpatrick, Al-Qarni, and Meara (2008)</xref> noted that a beginning student of Arabic was able to successfully learn 300 new words using deliberate learning strategies in the space of 20 days, working for only 20 to 30 minutes each day. This suggests that 15 new words a day is a reasonable goal for a motivated language learner.</p>
<p>In addition to vocabulary learning strategies, teachers should also guide learners towards supplementary sources of suitable reading material. Graded readers are one way for learners to read large amounts of comprehensible input, and give learners much needed opportunities to repeatedly encounter vocabulary in a variety of contexts so as to master the different types of word knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0033688212450640">Webb, 2007</xref>: 60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212450640">Schmitt, 2008</xref>: 335). Aspects of knowing a word such as collocations and intuition of frequency are difficult to teach, and substantial amounts of exposure to text is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212450640">Schmitt, 2008</xref>: 333).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0033688212450640">Nation and Wang’s (1999</xref>: 359) study shows that a graded reader at the first level of a graded reader series contains, on average, 5,455 running words. Therefore, a learner who finishes just two books at this beginning level will read more running words than those present in the entire reading input in the Elementary coursebook (8,753 tokens). Remarkably, if the learner reads another six books at this level they will read more running words than the combined reading input in all three levels of the coursebook (40,751 tokens). This highlights the fact that there is a strong case for supplementing the coursebook with graded readers or other suitable reading input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450640">Matsuoka and Hirsh, 2010</xref>: 67). Unfortunately, many learners are unaware of graded readers, or fail to see the usefulness in reading a text in which almost all the words are known, so it is incumbent on teachers to raise learners’ awareness of their importance and value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0033688212450640">
<title>Materials Writers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212450640">Schmitt (2008</xref>: 333) notes that materials writers are the ‘obvious conduit for delivering research-based information to teachers and learners in a form that is usable’. There is a large amount of vocabulary research which materials writers can take advantage of when putting together coursebooks. <italic>VocabProfile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212450640">Cobb, 2009</xref>) is freely available, and reading and listening texts could be analyzed so that low frequency vocabulary is minimized.</p>
<p>The importance of the most frequent words and their value to learners is clear, and coursebook writers are in a position to ensure these words are available to learners. For example, learners could be made aware of high frequency vocabulary through a list in the back of the coursebook. Some coursebooks, such as <italic>Straightforward</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212450640">Kerr and Jones, 2005</xref>), incorporate word lists after each unit and provide frequency information for each word, using a star coding system. These word lists have been cited as having a positive effect on learners, who realize the need to focus their attention on words which have been identified as the most useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212450640">Gillway, 2009</xref>). There is no reason why word lists such as the GSL, or other more recent frequency based lists, should not have the same effect on learners if they were included in the coursebook. It should also be noted that coursebooks influence teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0033688212450640">Rubdy, 2003</xref>: 49) and this information would also serve to raise the teacher’s awareness of the importance of these items. Furthermore, materials writers could include information on deliberate learning strategies together with the lists.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0033688212450640">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This particular study aims to show which words learners are exposed to in coursebooks, however there are some limitations. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212450640">Cobb’s (1995)</xref> study, a word is considered present even if it appears in only one of the levels and not all three, which means that important aspects of vocabulary learning, such as repetition and recycling are not considered, nor is the depth of knowledge involved in knowing a word. How the teacher uses the teaching materials, which is one of the biggest variables in successful vocabulary teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212450640">Folse, 2004</xref>: 133), is also not considered. Also, while we can safely assume that the student’s book will always be used in classrooms, in some contexts teachers will also have access to supplementary activities and materials for the <italic>New English File</italic> series, such as a teacher’s book, workbook, DVDs or other online resources which may provide further exposure to high-frequency vocabulary. However, the analysis of these optional materials are beyond the scope of this preliminary study.</p>
<p>A further limitation is that only the supplementary text from the first unit from each coursebook was included for analysis and it is likely there are more word families present in the coursebooks than those reported in the results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0033688212450640">1</xref></sup> However, the inclusion for analysis of the reading and listening texts compensates for this limitation to some degree. Analysis showed that 40 of the 1,395 word families were unique to the supplementary texts across all three levels of the coursebook, and not already in the reading or listening input. Five of these were from the first 1,000 word level, and 35 from the second 1,000 word level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0033688212450640">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212450640">Schmitt (2008</xref>: 343) notes that materials writers need to think longitudinally and target lexical items to ensure they are being recycled in a principled way. In future studies it would be useful to look at whether vocabulary is being systematically recycled through the units of a single coursebook, as well as through the different coursebook levels. The importance of vocabulary repetition within a single coursebook for part-time learners is clear. The coursebook writers do attempt to recycle vocabulary in the <italic>Revise &amp; Check</italic> section of each unit, however this vocabulary appears to be limited to that particular unit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with optical character recognition software such as <italic>ABBYY FineReader</italic> becoming more widely available, the analysis of coursebooks on a large scale is more practical for researchers. A number of different coursebooks could be analyzed, which may provide a greater perspective on how high frequency vocabulary is being presented throughout the different levels of various coursebook series. Many learners will follow the same series of coursebooks, however there are some language institutions which require learners to change coursebook series as they move through the proficiency levels.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212450640">Nation (2007)</xref> points out that meaning-focused input, in which learning occurs through listening or reading, is one of four major strands in a balanced language program. A necessary condition for this strand to exist is that learners are familiar with 95-98% of the running words contained in the input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212450640">2007</xref>: 2). It would be worth exploring if the reading and listening texts within coursebooks meet the conditions necessary for this strand to be present.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings in this study suggest that the first three levels of the coursebook series <italic>New English File</italic> expose learners to a large amount of high frequency vocabulary, although a substantial number of such words are still not met. Therefore, in addition to the use of the coursebook, teachers should be aware of the need to provide learners with access to large amounts of supplementary comprehensible reading input, such as graded readers or other suitable extensive reading material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450640">Matsuoka and Hirsh, 2010</xref>: 67), as well as the importance of introducing effective vocabulary learning strategies, such as deliberate learning from word lists. This would give learners much needed opportunities to meet high- frequency vocabulary not already contained within the coursebook.</p>
