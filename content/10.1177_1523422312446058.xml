<body>
<p>Knowledge, innovation, and adaptive capacity are seen as drivers for competitive advantage as nations and organizations transact within the knowledge economy. We use the Kingdom of Bahrain (Bahrain) as a lens for human resource development (HRD) professionals to understand the environment in which organizations transact, as well as the weaknesses that can affect future competitive advantage. Our enquiry was stimulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446058">Baby (2008)</xref>: “Bahrain is the most ideal place in the Gulf to develop a Knowledge City. . . . As a pioneer in education in the region, Bahrain has all the ingredients to make the knowledge concept a reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446058">Baby, 2008</xref>). We were interested in why this was needed, whether the conditions existed for this to occur, and what the implications could be if they did not.</p>
<p>First, we introduced the concept of knowledge for public good. Examining the concept of the knowledge economy, we surfaced links between societal competitive advantage and knowledge cities or regions. We illuminated the need for a triumvirate approach to building societal competitive advantage, linking education, business, and government. Our focus is on higher education institutions (HEIs), but we raised awareness of the need for HRD professionals to respond to weaknesses in the education sector on which they are reliant for their own future competitive advantage. Our findings are presented, with recommendations for practitioners, HEIs, and policy makers.</p>
<sec id="section4-1523422312446058">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The literature review focused on concepts important for the development of this article: knowledge as the common good, the meaning of HRD in societal development, and knowledge regions or cities.</p>
<sec id="section5-1523422312446058">
<title>Knowledge for the Common Good</title>
<p>Theorists have argued that knowledge exists for the public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312446058">Spender, 1996</xref>):
<disp-quote><p>While land, labor, and capital are private goods, knowledge is often said to be a “public good”, meaning that it is infinitely extensible and its use by one person does not deprive others of its use. (p. 48)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is based on knowledge being nonrivalrous and nonexcludable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312446058">Olson, 1971</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446058">Hess and Ostrom (2006)</xref> believed knowledge to exist as a public good; as, once a discovery emerges, it exists in the public domain for use by all. However, knowledge is also seen as an excludable resource through the resource-based view of the organization, where it is developed for rivalrous advantage, thereby depriving others of its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312446058">Spender, 1996</xref>). In a societal view, it is perhaps necessary to speak of knowledge in nonrivalrous and nonexcludable terms. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446058">Reichert (2007)</xref> claimed that even here it is excludable, through the tacit dimension of knowledge, existing within the person, as it can be bound to geographic location, whereas the explicit, or externalized, dimension exists as a portable resource, emancipated from the confines of a geographic location.</p>
<p>Some knowledge, such as scientific knowledge, can be seen as a “common-pool,” “open-access” resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446058">Dietz, Dolssak, Ostrom, &amp; Stern, 2002</xref>, p. 3). The common-pool concept has traditionally been applied to natural resources, such as fish or water. However, it evolved to encompass knowledge through the term <italic>knowledge commons</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446058">Hess &amp; Ostrom, 2006</xref>, p. 3), reflecting the complexity and variability of modern knowledge-based resources. The need for knowledge resources is driven by what the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) termed “The Four Pillars of the Knowledge Economy”: technology, human capital, innovation, and adaptive capacity, where knowledge is the driver of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446058">Asgeirsdottir, 2005</xref>, p. 2). This means that human resources, being the active protagonists in the creation of knowledge, are key drivers of growth. This leads to the concept of HRD and the role of industry/enterprise and HEIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1523422312446058">
<title>The Meaning of Human Resource Development in Societal Development</title>
<p>HRD emerged from HR management; where a shift occurred from legacy activity, such as contract management, toward skills development of staff against the strategic and operational needs of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446058">McGoldrick, Stewart, &amp; Watson, 2002</xref>). This gave rise to strategic HRD, where the HR function operates as a business partner within the organization, both reacting to and informing organization strategy and operational development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446058">Garavan, 2007</xref>). This seems to place HRD professionals as a key partner in the development of knowledge as a commodity, both within and outside the organization, especially if the quality of provision in HEIs, which affects the availability of skills within the emerging workforce, is brought into question.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312446058">Wiig (2007)</xref> stated that societal competitive advantage requires an organic stock of intellectual capital, the motivation of the individual to participate in the needs of society, and a culture that feeds the individual’s motivation. This could be termed <italic>societal HRD</italic> (Soc HRD). Here, HRD professionals are required to understand the wider challenges for society as a whole to contribute in a way that includes and extends the needs of the organization to affect the competitive advantage of a region or country; this could be considered to be a valuable contribution to an organization’s corporate social responsibility mission. Also, where deficiencies are surfaced in HEI provision, HRD professionals could become key stakeholders in progressing societal knowledge to develop their future workforce and mitigate risks to their own future competitive advantage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1523422312446058">
<title>Knowledge Regions or Cities</title>
<p>This brings the discussion to knowledge regions or cities as a form of competitive advantage. These are seen as a network of places, people, processes, and purpose, enabled by knowledge moments or essential conversations between people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312446058">Dvir, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446058">Reichert (2007)</xref> positioned their advantage as being brought about through the exploitation or exploration of geographically embedded tacit knowledge, where knowledge-regions form clusters that are seen as a catalyst for innovation:
<disp-quote><p>A knowledge-intensive firm benefits from the proximity to a cluster of related firms because it can exploit . . . the competitive advantages provided by critical mass. Knowledge-industries are thus more likely to locate to cities in order to achieve these advantages. Hence, city-regions have become the main drivers of the knowledge-economy. (p. 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312446058">Wiig (2007)</xref> warned that cities often have a surplus of human capital, in relation to employment opportunities and infrastructure capabilities, causing slums to develop. Extending this thinking, slums could occur through a disconnect between the indigenous population and economic need. For example, if the population is underskilled, they could be incapable of attracting knowledge-intensive employment opportunities that would allow the city or region to prosper. This points toward the need for cooperation between industry/enterprise, HEIs, and government policy in order to lift the indigenous skills within society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312446058">McLean, 2004</xref>). For HRD professionals, the interest is one of future competitive advantage for the organization, brought about through the development of the emerging workforce.</p>
<p>The National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312446058">NESTA, 2007</xref>) reinforced this, stating that a network of people, education, and commerce is key to an adaptive society, where a reciprocal relationship of attraction builds between skilled people and businesses. However, NESTA warned, “In isolation and without intervention, cities that are not part of this [relationship] may fall victim to a downward spiral of economic stagnation and declining skills base” (p. 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446058">Florida (2003)</xref> linked knowledge cities to improved standards in wider society, where higher skilled workers and creative classes generate enhanced cultural and consumer standards, as well as an improved quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1523422312446058">
<title>Higher Education Institutions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446058">Florida (2003)</xref> emphasized the need for HEIs to act as an incubator for future competitive advantage, which we believe to be a warning for HRD professionals, especially in regions where the standard of education provision is brought into question:
<disp-quote><p>Those cities hosting HEI have an inherent advantage as a source of knowledge-production. However, an HEI’s primary contribution to its local innovation system is not knowledge, but a workforce capable of exploiting knowledge. (p. 3)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Inward investment in education, skills-base, historic culture, tradition, and links between business and education become the currency for innovation and national competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446058">Reichert, 2007</xref>). National and regional strategies, such as The Europe 2020 Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446058">Barroso, 2010</xref>) and The Economic Vision 2030 For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446058">Bahrain (2009)</xref>, have emphasized the importance of knowledge growth. However, it is the management of common-pool resources at a local-level that, we would argue, must include HEIs and HRD professionals that economic theorists have targeted as being pivotal to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446058">Agrawal, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>National governments in nearly all developing countries have turned to local-level common property institutions. . . . Resource management can never be independent of collective human institutions that frame governance, and local users are often the ones with the greatest stakes in sustainability of resources and institutions. (p. 41)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The focus on education and HEIs as a local partner in the development of society’s skill resonates throughout the literature:
<disp-quote><p>People are society’s basic knowledge agents and their knowledge growth through formal and informal education is required for competence to tackle challenges in the private and public sectors and are central to function and progress. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312446058">Wiig, 2007</xref>, p. 147)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The important contribution of education to the development of knowledge for public good is evidenced in Europe’s 2020 strategy call for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446058">Barroso, 2010</xref>):
<disp-quote><p>Smart growth means strengthening knowledge and innovation as drivers of our future growth. This requires improving the quality of our education, strengthening our research performance, promoting innovation, and knowledge transfer. (p. 9)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This strategy also called for national and regional governments to improve innovation capability by maximizing education opportunities for society as a whole; but what if there are issues with regard to the quality of our education? This again could be linked to HRD in organizations, through corporate social responsibility, especially in regions where there are identified skill gaps in the labor market or the economy is in a state of transition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312446058">Spender (1996)</xref> saw education as a process whereby previously discovered knowledge could be communicated to mass society. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312446058">OECD (2008)</xref> agreed, observing tertiary education as a pivotal element in the development of human capital, the development of knowledge-stores, the sharing and use of knowledge, and the maintenance of knowledge. The OECD also stressed the need for tertiary education institutions to become partners in the strategic development of economic competitiveness to ensure the responsiveness of the skill base to community needs; the same could be said for HRD activities within organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422312446058">
<title>Higher Education Institutions and Societal Competitive Advantage</title>
<p>The link between innovation and education has been evidenced through the Premier League of Innovative European Regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446058">European Commission, 2011</xref>). The league demonstrates that the vast majority of the top 22 innovative regions in Europe are linked to universities with strong research traditions. For example, the United Kingdom’s three representatives have well-established universities: Oxfordshire, Cambridge, and Edinburgh. A point reinforced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312446058">Scott (2010)</xref>, citing the chief executive of the Manchester Knowledge Capital project in England, “Education is a key selling point for the city as it bids to attract more business to the area” (p. 11); we contend that the same could be said about organizations looking to attract the best human resources.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446058">Harloe and Perry (2004)</xref> suggested that HEIs, as with organizations, have a duty to transform knowledge production into economic competitive advantage: “. . . to fulfill this role, universities must produce exploitable knowledge and facilitate its diffusion” (p. 214). This would not seem unreasonable, for if HEIs exist for the development of societal resources then its output must surely lead to the development of societal competitive advantage. This seems to indicate the need for universities to engage with industry in order for knowledge to be disseminated, developed, and exploited for the wider good of the society to which they transact; in our opinion, it also demonstrates the need for a willingness on the part of HRD professionals to engage with HEIs as part of a flow of knowledge exchange. This is championed in OECD reports “Knowledge Management: New Challenges for Educational Research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312446058">OECD, 2003</xref>) and “Education Today” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312446058">OECD, 2009</xref>); both advocated the need for research strategies that acquire, store, generate, and share knowledge with the wider business community to enhance capacity-building within society. They also recommended a triumvirate of researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to facilitate this; again, this reinforces the role of HRD professionals in the development of knowledge for societal and organizational competitive advantage.</p>
<p>If this can be accepted, then it would seem necessary to enquire into the capability of HEIs in developing the skills and knowledge required to develop a society’s competitive advantage and for HRD professionals to understand the feedback in order to recognize potential challenges that could affect their future competitive advantage.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1523422312446058">
<title>The Problem Statement</title>
<p>If knowledge and human resources are of value to society, then the analysis of the processes supporting its development is a significant issue for policy makers. If existing provision proves inadequate, an alternative solution needs to be considered to develop knowledge for the public good and lift a society’s competitive advantage; this intelligence can also be used to alert HRD professionals to potential challenges within the emerging workforce and the impact on future competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Therefore, using Bahrain as a lens, the question for this article is “What is the nature of the contribution of HEIs to the development of national competitive advantage through Soc HRD and what does this signal to the triumvirate of policy makers, HEIs, and industry/enterprise?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1523422312446058" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>With the research team having experience of working in the region, we identified Bahrain as a suitable lens for enquiry; due to the stated aim of the government to transition to a knowledge economy, brought about by the limited remaining natural resources within its oil and gas fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312446058">Tamkeen, 2009</xref>). It was decided that limitations of geographic location and time would not allow for interviews at this stage of the research process. Document analysis was therefore selected as the method for enquiry, which is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446058">Dew (2006)</xref> for ease of access, repeatability of the process, and the wealth of information available to the interrogation of documents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446058">Dew (2006)</xref> recognized that documents are created to achieve an end and are embedded within their own social, historical, and cultural processes. He also stressed that such analysis could be subject to the cultural and historic bias of the researcher. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446058">Bowen (2009)</xref> cited failures within research, where rigorous data-collection frameworks were not put in place, which affected the credibility of the findings. Issues included insufficient detail, or completeness, linked with comprehensiveness, where documents do not provide enough detail to answer the research question or do not cover the context of enquiry in sufficient detail; retrievability, where documents cannot be accessed or are blocked; biased selectivity, where documents are biased toward the views of the researcher.</p>
<p>We attempted to overcome these challenges through the understanding of the lead researcher, who had worked with (in) the higher education sector in Bahrain and was familiar with local custom and practice. The researchers were also supported by senior research staff within the University of Edinburgh and Bahrain Higher Education Council by providing an external third-party view of the process. Only documents generated by international bodies, such as the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), national and local government organizations, and HEIs in Bahrain were used for the enquiry; this decision was taken due to concerns with regard to the reliability of data generated through other local sources—an example of an accepted document would be the Economic Vision 2030 for Bahrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446058">Bahrain Government, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446058">Bowen (2009)</xref>, there are five conditions for a document-analysis approach: Documents can (a) provide context, (b) suggest direction for research questions and observations, (c) be used to provide additional or complimentary data, (d) provide an evidence chain for change or development processes, and (e) be used to triangulate data collected from other sources. All five aspects had the potential to be relevant to this research.</p>
<sec id="section12-1523422312446058">
<title>Data-Collection Framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446058">Bowen (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446058">Fereday and Muir-Cochrane (2006)</xref> described the document-analysis process used in this research as thematic. Thematic analysis is used as a means to explore patterns emerging from within the data pool through scrutiny of the text.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The reviewer takes a closer look at the selected data and performs coding and category construction, based on the data’s characteristics, to uncover themes pertinent to the phenomenon. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446058">Bowen, 2009</xref>, p. 32)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The researcher is required to overcome issues of bias and demonstrate an ability to react to subtle changes in text to capture the essence of the data and the emerging pattern it may represent; this is achieved via a review process described later. The researcher is also required to investigate with the help of a broad sample of documents; although there are no set parameters for the number of documents that are needed for any given data pool, the focus should be on quality through breadth and comprehensiveness of the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446058">Bowen, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1523422312446058">
<title>Coding Protocol</title>
<p>Guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446058">Bowen (2009)</xref>, we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446058">Fereday and Muir-Cochrane’s (2006)</xref> six-stage coding framework: (a) Develop a coding manual, (b) test the reliability of the codes, (c) summarize data and identify initial themes, (d) apply template of codes and additional codes, (e) connect codes and identify themes, and (f) corroborate code themes. We also used their definition of a code as a basis for the research:
<disp-quote><p>A “good code” is one that captures the qualitative richness of the phenomenon. Encoding the information organizes the data to identify and develop themes from them. . . . [A] theme [is] a “pattern in the information that at minimum describes and organizes the possible observations and at maximum interprets aspects of the phenomenon.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446058">Fereday &amp; Muir-Cochrane, 2006</xref>, p. 4)</p></disp-quote>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Bahrain sets out its strategy for the development of knowledge resources, and the benefits to the development of society, through the “Economic Vision 2030 for Bahrain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446058">Bahrain Government, 2009</xref>). The following demonstrate areas of interest to this research, in terms of indicators of the need for Soc HRD: “Bahrain’s economy will attain increasing levels of sophistication and innovation, enabling the country to claim an attractive position in the global value chain. As a result, we will capture emerging opportunities, particularly by expanding to knowledge-based sectors . . .” (p. 16). “Education empowers people to reach their full potential in business, government, and society. It will shape and develop the successive generations of leaders that our country needs . . .” (p. 21). “The strategy will need to . . . encourage research and development in universities to create a platform for a knowledge-based economy” (p. 22)</p>
<p>In terms of existing Soc HRD performance, Bahrain ranked 49th in the 2009 World Bank Knowledge Economy Index (KEI), which took into account weighted scores for innovation and education, being the 4th highest ranked Middle East country; only Israel (26th), Qatar (44th), and United Arab Emirates (45th) ranked higher. However, Bahrain ranked 80th in the innovation table, 8th in the Middle East region, and 60th in the education table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422312446058">World Bank, 2009</xref>); this seems significant given the need for innovation in a knowledge-driven economy, such as that being proposed by the government.</p>

<p>Most recently, in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report (GCR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446058">Schwab, 2010</xref>), Bahrain was ranked 44th in the world in the area of education. Of significance, the third most problematic factor for doing business in Bahrain was an inadequately educated workforce; this would seem to be important, not only for HEIs but also for organization HRD professionals looking to contribute to the society within which they transact and, in doing so, mitigate risks to future competitive advantage. The WEF findings also suggested there to be a shortage in research and training services, where Bahrain ranked 81st globally. The quality of management schools in Bahrain received a ranking of 45th, compared with their neighbor, Qatar, who ranked 1st. This was supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312446058">Tamkeen (2009)</xref>, a skills-funding gatekeeper in Bahrain, who noted that Bahrain ranked 96th in 2007 for availability of research and training facilities. These challenges, though a warning for HEIs, could provide opportunities for organizations and HRD professionals looking to generate revenue through the provision of external services via, for example, a consulting model.</p>
<p>Of particular interest was the Bahrain Quality Assurance Authority for Education and Training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312446058">QAAET, 2009</xref>) review of 12 undergraduate business programs. Their findings revealed “no confidence” in four programs and “limited confidence” in four others. This is of concern as these business programs could be seen as the foundation for the development of Bahrain’s future competitive advantage, which, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312446058">NESTA (2007)</xref>, means that universities could be failing in one of their primary functions, being the provision of a skilled workforce for deployment in the knowledge economy. This also sounds a warning for organizations transacting in the region and provides a rationale for HRD professionals to invest time with HEI partners in developing the future workforce, protecting their investment and their future competitive advantage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312446058">Tamkeen (2009)</xref>, reporting on education in Bahrain, emphasized the problem, where “48% of graduates who qualified in 2007 were not working 3 months after graduating, which is a serious concern . . .” (p. 75). Bringing balance to the negative view of Bahrain presented thus far, the QAEET recognized the need to improve provision in HEIs to address innovation and the competitive position of Bahrain within the Gulf States Region. “The Kingdom of Bahrain has chosen education as the path through which it will overcome various obstacles and be at the cutting edge of development in every aspect of Bahraini life” (QAAET, citing His Excellency, Shaikh Khalid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312446058">2009</xref>, p. 8). This recognition of these deficiencies, and a willingness to reflect and address issues in the education sector, demonstrates Bahrain’s desire to improve its adaptive capacity and should serve the country well as it looks to enhance national competitive advantage.</p>

<title>Innovation Performance</title>
<p>The GCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446058">Schwab, 2010</xref>) observed Bahrain as being in a state of transition from “factor driven,” having unskilled labor and a reliance on natural resources, to, “efficiency driven,” developing efficiency and quality processes within their labor markets. However, Bahrain was seen as being a considerable way off the desired state of “innovation driven,” where organizations possess mature adaptive capacity processes that enable them to compete more effectively in the global knowledge economy. This signals the need for HRD professionals to develop skills within the workforce that can contribute to these aims, as the GCR report speaks of “organizations” and not of HEIs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312446058">Mouton and Waast (2009)</xref> conducted a report for UNESCO into the performance of national research systems; this was used as an indicator of the HEIs contribution to knowledge within society. Bahrain placed 10th in the Middle East region, with an output of 55 in 2006 and a growth factor of 1 for the period between 1987 and 2006; the median score for Asia and the Middle East was an output of 350. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312446058">Mouton and Waast (2009)</xref> criticized HEIs in the Middle East for not developing a clear research strategy, which could provide an opportunity for organizations and HRD professionals to act as the catalyst for growth by stimulating the engagement.</p>
<p>The Bahrain government has recognized its deficiencies: “On a global scale, Bahrain’s innovation output is currently negligible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446058">Bahrain Government, 2009</xref>, p. 9) and the government challenges the country to develop new economic advantage through the knowledge inherent in its people, “. . . innovation and productivity have become crucial sources of competitive advantage” (p. 9), although no documentation could be found to demonstrate “how” this was to happen, which could point to an opportunity for organizations and HRD professionals looking to inculcate strategy in the societies within which they transact.</p>

<title>Recommendations For Practitioners and HEIs</title>
<p>There are lessons to be learned in highlighting the need to recognize gaps in the contribution of HEIs to the development of a society’s knowledge capacity and, as a consequence, future competitive advantage. For organizational HRD professionals, there would seem to be opportunities and challenges. First, there is a need to recognize the risks associated with HEIs that are not providing the societal knowledge and innovation foundations needed to secure future competitive advantage for the organization. Second, there would seem to be an opportunity for qualified HRD professionals to improve their value proposition within the organization, while at the same time contributing to the wider good of society, by outsourcing research and training services in collaboration with HEIs, in an effort that could be termed Soc HRD.</p>
<p>For HEIs, there are clear warnings that collaboration with industry/enterprise is crucial to the development of societal competitive advantage. In the case of Bahrain, the Higher Education Council and Ministry of Education have responded through a strategic and operational review. In the first instance, they have developed new strategic statements for HEIs:
<disp-quote><p>Develop mechanisms to encourage collaboration between higher education and business and industry that have a demonstrable impact on teaching and learning, and research to ensure in particular that: All students are prepared for the world of work through the provision of generic (work ready) skills on every program; the development of generic skills to take account of employers’ views. (F. Maraghi, personal communication [original text translated], July 26, 2011)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition, the Higher Education Council has moved to develop a “knowledge network” as an interface between HEIs, policy makers, and industry. This network will include an audit of the challenges being faced by industry in Bahrain, in contrast to the undergraduate and postgraduate courses being offered in HEIs—leading to a review of current provision and a proposed development of courses in the areas of innovation, sustainability, HRD, and training and development. This will progress to an audit of expertise within HEIs, and the development of quality standards for research, that will inform a research directory, accessible by industry. This will also include a knowledge-mapping exercise, in an attempt to capture key expertise, as part of a wider knowledge-management program that attempts to mitigate the risk of knowledge loss as senior university staff retire; a program of professional development for university staff, informed by the gaps identified through the environmental analysis; a research strategy for HEIs, focused on the needs of new skills for the Knowledge-Economy; Action-Learning groups that bring academic and industry HR experts together to plan strategy and action for the future; and a challenge/reward framework, where industry partners set challenges for academic colleagues with a reward being offered if the challenge is met.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as suggested throughout this article, organizational leaders have the opportunity to recognize the risk, and contribution they can make, to their future competitive advantage by engaging with HEIs, to help in the development of the emerging workforce, which, it could be argued, will provide a valuable return on their investment of time and finance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1523422312446058">
<title>Recommendations For Policy Makers</title>
<p>Policy makers within HEIs and government can learn from the reaction of the Bahrain Ministry of Education to the challenges facing their HEIs. There is a need to raise awareness with regard to the importance of research to innovation, HRD, the development of knowledge for societal good, and the competitive advantage of society as a whole. The Bahrain example provides an example of a government led intervention that brings together the triumvirate of stakeholders; nevertheless, we would suggest that there is no reason why this could not be led by independent organizations using foresight to mitigate potential future risks to their business.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1523422312446058">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There was a need to progress research to an interview-based method, as, for example, literature pertaining to the research activity of Bahraini universities was difficult to acquire. A restrictive word count for this article also limited the data that could be presented. The researchers also found English-language versions of government and HEI strategies difficult to obtain. However, a Bahraini national employed in the Ministry of Education assisted in overcoming some of these barriers. These shortcomings accepted, our belief is that this should not detract from the fact that there was sufficient evidence, from numerous credible sources, to support the recommendations put forward.</p>
<p>We would recommend that future research explore links between corporate social responsibility and organizational contribution to the capability and capacity of the society within which it transacts. We recommend interviewing senior or executive managers to explore the level of knowledge and understanding of Soc HRD and the implications for the organization’s future competitive advantage. Finally, there is a need for further research into the capability/capacity for organization HRD professionals to operate at the level suggested in this article.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article used Bahrain as a lens through which HRD professionals can better understand their environment and their potential contribution to the development of wider society. We began with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446058">Baby’s (2008)</xref> call for Bahrain to become a knowledge city. Our literature review found successful societal knowledge, innovation, and human resource processes to be closely linked to education, which we believe to be the same as HRD in organizations. We highlighted the role of HEIs in developing resources that enable innovation, knowledge, and adaptive capacity for societal good. We also put forward an argument for the potential involvement of organizational HRD professionals in this process, especially where there is a perceived weakness in the quality of HEI provision. The signals resonated clearly in the literature; education, or the development of people, is a key element in the development of knowledge for the public good. We contend that this occurs inside organizations, as well as through HEIs, and that this is what could be considered to be Soc HRD.</p>
<p>We found Bahrain to be a country in the embryonic stages of knowledge-capacity building and, as such, HRD. The quality of HEI provision could be seriously questioned, which needs to be recognized by the organizations transacting within the country. There would appear to be both opportunities and risks for these organizations; risk, in terms of impact on future competitive advantage, and opportunities, in terms of its contribution to society as a whole and the development of the internal HRD value proposition.</p>
<p>Looking again to Bahrain, although the negatives cannot be ignored, the government is motivated to address these issues and there is evidence of change that could affect the wider Gulf region. This should be recognized by organizations operating in the country, with the government providing an opportunity through the “knowledge network” for a closer relationship between industry/enterprise HRD professionals, and HEIs that could set the course in terms of the country’s competitive advantage for generations to come. We would also suggest that this is a model that could potentially be replicated in other countries experiencing similar difficulties.</p>
<p>Closing at the point from which we started, the statement by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446058">Baby (2008)</xref> about Bahrain being an education pioneer in the region appears to be overstated. However, if the issues highlighted in this report can be addressed, there would seem to be no reason why the Kingdom cannot achieve the aspiration of becoming a knowledge city, driving knowledge for the public good through Soc HRD.</p>
