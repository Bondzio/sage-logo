<body>
<p>Palliative care for non-malignant disease has attracted much discussion in terms of identification of patient groups, who should deliver care and the content of that care. It has also attracted admissions of how we fall short of appropriate end-of-life care for patients with chronic non-malignant disease. The challenge is a significant one.</p>
<p>There are key areas that contribute to the current challenges in non-malignant palliative care and the following are core.</p>
<list id="list1-0269216312437281" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Palliative care developed from within cancer care facilitated by the interest and support of a small but extremely important group of oncologists. Some of these oncologists were among the first doctors to work fulltime in palliative care, abandoning their oncology positions. Initially, many services had regular input from an oncologist. The nursing component of palliative care also has a strong oncology background, and still does in most countries. Modern palliative care would not exist in its present state without this history, core collaborators and general support from oncology.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Palliative care is not a neat predetermined package, even in cancer care where advanced incurable illness can usually be identified. Rather, it consists of components that need to be adapted according to the individual situation. It follows that we need to understand the components of the individual case and, in particular, the fundamentals of the disease process. Just as modern palliative care developed under the umbrella of oncology, the widespread development of non-malignant palliative care can only be achieved by a close, meaningful collaboration with specialists in the various non-malignant disease areas.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The strong base in cancer care has informed the current approach to symptom control. While the evidence base for many areas of symptom control is poor, the experience is large. It does not follow that this extensive experience and limited evidence base could be transferred automatically to all areas of non-malignant symptom control. There has been some important pioneering work in the area of symptom control for non-malignant disease; however, this is minuscule in relation to the size of the area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312437281">1</xref></sup> In collaboration with appropriate other specialties we need to develop a detailed understanding of the disease process, characteristics of symptoms and a strategic approach to the potential use of current strategies used for malignant disease.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Palliative care teams, particularly if hospital based, are now seeing patients at various points in a cancer illness, from diagnosis if symptoms are problematic, into survivorship if distressing treatment-related side effects exist. A collaborative interdisciplinary approach early in a cancer diagnosis, if appropriate, is now seen more frequently and often means stepping in and out of patient care, as dictated by the patient’s needs. This is far from proposed models for non-malignant disease, which focus on end-of-life care. Many problems are managed effectively if targeted earlier in the course of an illness, rather than awaiting the end-of-life phase. Pain and its neurobiological sequelae is an excellent example of this. Additionally prognostication is an ever greater challenge in non-malignant disease.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The accumulation of relevant knowledge to manage the spectrum of palliative care problems in life-limiting non-malignant disease is challenging. An example is neurological disease, which represents many distinctive challenges, although parallels can be found in other non-malignant areas. In neurological conditions there is wide variability in disease processes, complexity, symptoms, disease-modifying options, rate of deterioration and fluctuation in condition, prognosis and complex care needs. Diseases range from insidiously progressive congenital disorders affecting children and young adults (such as muscular dystrophies) to sudden-onset devastating loss of function in later life (for instance stroke disease). In many of these diseases the duration and course of illness can be hard to predict. The fact that some of these diseases are extremely rare also has the potential to compound planning and prognostic difficulties. The care required by patients with neurological disease can likewise be complex in reflecting the multidisciplinary needs of the patient. Many specialists (primary care, neurosurgery, neurology, psychiatry, care of the elderly) may be involved, sometimes without clearly defined boundaries. Specific medications, as well as non-pharmacological treatment (non-invasive ventilation, intrathecal devices, deep brain stimulators) may be unusual and complex even for a specialist, and potentially daunting for clinicians who rarely deal with them. In turn, a patient may be affected in multiple ways by neurological disease, ranging from effects peripherally on the muscle and nerve, to subtle higher cognitive and perceptual difficulties. In particular, cognitive and processing problems (commonly associated with a huge range of neurological illnesses) may impact on communication and capacity, even at an early stage in the disease, despite sometimes not becoming clinically more apparent until the later stages of disease.</p>

<title>Moving from the challenges, what is currently advised and is happening?</title>
<p>At present the view is that access to palliative care should be based on need rather than diagnosis, and on that basis many patients with non-malignant disease qualify. The potential requirement for palliative care in non-malignant illnesses is reflected in UK National Service Frameworks (NSFs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312437281">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312437281">3</xref></sup> Palliative care is specified as a ‘Quality Requirement’. In relation to neurological disease:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>People in the later stages of long-term neurological conditions are to receive a comprehensive range of palliative care services when they need them to control symptoms, offer pain relief, and meet their needs for personal, social, psychological and spiritual support, in line with the principles of palliative care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The obvious question is when this is applied to all patients with non-malignant life-limiting illness, how can it be achieved and, realistically, can it be achieved?</p>
<p>Effective communication about palliative care issues both between and within specialties should increase. We need to understand colleagues’ beliefs and expectations and accept that an improved knowledge base has to evolve. We need to believe in interdisciplinary integration and be proactive in its facilitation.</p>
<p>The evolution of palliative medicine as a subspecialty of medicine, with its recognised training programme and now its own exit exam, has certainly been important in UK culture, while parallel developments in other countries have also been of great importance. Imaginative involvement of trainees in palliative medicine and in the core non-malignant areas, in reciprocal clinical placements, and in research has to evolve more. This will increase cross-fertilisation and is an obvious mechanism to be exploited. Joint supervision, especially of research, between palliative care and the relevant non-malignant disease specialty is important. Similar methods could be used with senior nursing staff for clinical attachments and for those considering research topics.</p>
<p>There are logistics, not least identifying key professionals in the various specialties to partner palliative care clinicians, who are enthusiastic but also have the potential to develop clinical and/or research collaborations. In addition, this needs to be co-ordinated across large networks of palliative care for non-malignant disease so that information is shared, and work is developed in a meaningful and complementary fashion. Underpinning this, agreement on a system and common language for describing a wide range of problems and interventions is fundamental. Without a language that facilitates the sharing and transfer of results, then areas of excellent development will remain in silos.</p>
<p>Consideration of a qualification for time spent by non- palliative care trainees in palliative care should be considered as rarely, if at all, would joint accreditation be achieved. We need to be open and positive in our encouragement of others, as our specialty is of relevance to everyone and it is clear that we cannot meet the needs of all patients who require palliative care. This should be discussed with the core non-malignant relevant specialties to explore potential reciprocal acknowledgement for trainees who might wish to spend time in one of these areas. In other words, if it is important then we should not just facilitate it, but also badge it.</p>
<p>There has been some landmark work developed to bring specialties together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312437281">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312437281">5</xref></sup> In the UK Marie Curie Cancer Care has been pioneering innovative work with the British Heart Foundation. A wider network to facilitate relevant cross-talk and developments in a systematic manner would be very positive. We can build on the guidelines already available and ask ourselves how we can make them more focused.</p>
<p>The balance between a pragmatic symptoms- and needs-based approach, predicated upon identifying common ground between patients and between specialties, needs to be balanced, or combined, with a subspecialised approach recognising the varying needs of differing groups of patients with life-limiting, non-malignant disease.</p>
