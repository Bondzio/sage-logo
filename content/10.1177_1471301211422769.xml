<abstract>
<p>Dementia is a common illness that is increasing in frequency and set to challenge the resources and expertise of health and social care services over the coming years. Increasingly, there has been interest in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as they are both common and associated with a range of negative outcomes. BPSD are associated with the admission of people with dementia to care homes. Limited resources and lack of knowledge in permanent care settings often lead to BPSD being managed with antipsychotic medications, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is evidence for the benefits of exercise within care home settings, although only a few studies include those with cognitive impairment. Tai Chi is a mind-body exercise combining relaxed physical movement and meditation, and has been suggested to have many health benefits. This article discusses the rationale and available options for treating BPSD and the current practice and reviews theliterature regarding the benefits of exercise and, in particular, Tai Chi in the management ofBPSD.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211422769" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There can be no doubt about the current and future challenges posed by caring for people with dementia. Described as the ‘dementia time bomb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211422769">Donnelly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211422769">Roberts, 2007</xref>), the number of people with dementia in the UK is forecast to increase by 154% over the next 45 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211422769">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, 2008</xref>). ‘One third of people with dementia live in care homes and at least two thirds of all people living in care homes have a form of dementia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211422769">Great Britain, Department of Health, 2009</xref>). The high prevalence of dementia within care homes means that any interventions provided within this setting are likely to reach a significant number of people with dementia and hence be more cost effective. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211422769" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>This paper will review the literature around the use of Tai Chi and its potential benefits for people with dementia who experience BPSD within a care home setting, as well as the benefits for their caregivers and staff who work with them. The relevant literature was obtained by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO using the search terms ‘dementia’, ‘exercise’ and ‘Tai Chi’. The authors’ personal files and the results of internet-based searches were also reviewed to assist in ensuring the relevant literature was reviewed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211422769"><title>Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia</title>
<p>BPSD is a term used to describe the disturbed perception, thought content, mood or behaviours that frequently occur in patients with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211422769">Finkle &amp; Burns, 1999</xref>). BPSD are common and have been found at clinically significant levels in more than 70% of care home residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211422769">Margallo-Lana et al., 2001</xref>). It is believed that BPSD ‘occur as a result of a complex interplay between the illness, the environment, physical health, medication and interactions with others’ (Royal College of Psychiatrists, n.d.). The Royal College of Nursing estimates ‘that only 10 percent of challenging behaviour occurs as a consequence of dementia, with 90 percent occurring in response to care practices and environmental factors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211422769">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>BPSD can lead to a number of negative outcomes, such as premature institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211422769">Morriss, Rovner, Folstein, &amp; German, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211422769">O'Donnell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211422769">Steele, Rovner, Chase, &amp; Folstein, 1990</xref>), increased cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211422769">Cohen-Mansfield, 1995</xref>), decreased quality of life for both the caregiver and the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211422769">Burgio, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211422769">Deimling &amp; Bass, 1986</xref>), significant caregiver stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211422769">Rabins, Mace, &amp; Lucas, 1982</xref>), stress to nursing staff in residential facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211422769">Draper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211422769">Rodney, 2000</xref>) and excess disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211422769">Brody, 1982</xref>), that is, people with BPSD function at a lower level than those without.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211422769"><title>Pharmacological management of BPSD in residential/nursing settings</title>
<p>In the UK, only risperidone is licenced for the short term management of “persistent aggression in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia unresponsive to non-pharmacological interventions and when there is a risk of harm to self or others.” (British National formulary 62, 2011). Some experts suggest that at least 70% of prescriptions of antipsychotics in care homes are not appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211422769">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, 2008</xref>). Antipsychotics are significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Side effects include sedation, dizziness and Parkinsonism, which may increase the risk of falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211422769">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, 2008</xref>). In addition, their use may accelerate cognitive decline, reduce well-being and increase social withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211422769">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, 2008</xref>). In 2004, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) issued an alert highlighting the increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAEs) with Risperidone and Olanzapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211422769">Committee of Safety of Medicines, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211422769"><title>Non-pharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia</title>
<p>Current UK guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211422769">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007</xref>) suggest first-line management of aggression should use non-pharmacological methods; however, in practice this is rarely attempted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211422769">O'Donnell et al., 1992</xref>). Antipsychotics should be used ‘in the first instance only if there is severe distress or an immediate risk of harm to the person with dementia or others’. Current non-pharmacological interventions for the management of agitation recognized by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211422769">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Social Care Institute for Excellence (2006)</xref> as being appropriate, depending on the person with dementia's preferences, skills and staff skills/availability, include aromatherapy, multisensory stimulation, therapeutic use of music and/or dancing, animal-assisted therapy and massage.</p>
<p>Depression/apathy, wandering and repetitive questioning appear to be most responsive to non-pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211422769">Teri, Logsdon, Uomoto, &amp; McCurry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211422769">Teri et al. 2000</xref>). Behavioural approaches identify and target symptoms, look for triggers or consequences of behaviours and attempt to modify behaviour by setting realistic goals. Other approaches used include reality orientation and music therapies, which have the strongest research base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211422769">Spector, Orrell, Davies, &amp; Woods, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211422769">Woods, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211422769"><title>Current use of exercise in residential homes</title>
<p>In the UK, regular exercise therapy is not routinely available to care home residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211422769">Brittle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211422769">O'Dea, Kerrison, &amp; Pollock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211422769">Sackley, Gatt, &amp; Walker, 2001</xref>). One recent study looking at the effect of group exercise on mobility and depression in care home residents, including those with cognitive impairment, concluded that ‘group exercise is not suitable for residents with severe cognitive impairment’, because they were ‘unable to engage in exercise sessions' and ‘struggled to follow instructions’ and also some exhibited ‘socially disruptive behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211422769">Brittle et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211422769"><title>Benefits of exercise</title>
<p>‘Research evidence strongly suggests that increased physical exercise may not only improve physical functions in older adults but may also improve mood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211422769">Teri, Logsdon, &amp; McCurry, 2008</xref>). To date, ‘The literature contains very few controlled studies of the effect of exercise onaffect or mood in cognitively impaired elders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211422769">Williams &amp; Tappen, 2008</xref>) or BPSD. Acontrolled trial of older adults with dementia in a nursing home by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211422769">Sung, Chang, Lee,and Lee (2006)</xref> found the forms of movement and music preferred by the patients were beneficial in managing agitation and recommended that these be incorporated into care routines. A controlled study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211422769">Alessi et al. (1995)</xref> revealed that physical activity helped reduce daytime agitation and night-time restlessness in care home residents with incontinence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211422769">Williams and Tappen (2008)</xref> found that a comprehensive exercise routine of walking, strength training, balance and flexibility resulted in better outcomes in mood and affect than social conversation alone in nursing home residents with moderate dementia. However, measurements of disturbed behaviour were not included in this study.</p>
<p>Repetitive movements without apparent purpose, such as pacing, trying to get to a different place and handling things inappropriately, are defined by Cohen-Mansfield and colleagues as ‘physically non-aggressive behaviours’.</p>
<p>They suggested that<disp-quote>
<p>… these may be adaptive for a resident who presents a deteriorating stage of dementia since these behaviours offer stimulation and exercise. The use of exercise to release emotional frustrations and boredom appears to be beneficial. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211422769">Cohen-Mansfield, Marx, &amp; Werner, 1992</xref>)</p></disp-quote>There has been one study, although not in care homes, that looked at different approaches to improve implementation and maintenance of exercise in cognitively impaired persons living in the community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211422769">Teri et al. (2008)</xref> found ‘teaching both cognitively impaired participants and their caregivers, behavioural and problem solving strategies for establishing and maintaining’ any programme; and ‘providing handouts, information’ to be helpful in sustaining the exercise programme. In focusing on ways to ‘maximize enjoyment’ of exercise and in using a collaborative approach, it has been suggested that ‘better adherence may be achieved by educating staff, residents and relatives about the benefits of exercise and negotiating times’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211422769">Brittle et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211422769"><title>Barriers to exercise within a care home setting</title>
<p>The risk of falls is frequently cited by staff as a reason to discourage mobility, but a lack of physical activity in itself increases the risk of falls. Many units are ‘understaffed, unsupported and untrained’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211422769">Stokes, 2009</xref>). It has been suggested that future studies ‘should consider ways to promote and facilitate adherence to exercise sessions’, provide ‘better integration of exercise sessions into care home schedules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211422769">Brittle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211422769">Galik, Resnick, &amp; Pretzer-Aboff, 2009</xref>) and should include ‘training of care home staff’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211422769">Brittle et al., 2009</xref>). Other restraints on implementing exercise programmes in care homes highlighted in the literature include the following: ‘typically there is one shared room for activities and it is not practical to restrict the use of that room to a select group’ and, ‘financial constraints limit the availability of an adequate number of personnel to implement exercise programmes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211422769">Williams &amp; Tappen, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211422769"><title>Tai Chi and Qigong</title>
<p>Tai Chi, also written as T'ai Chi or Taiji, is considered to be a mind-body exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211422769">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 2009</xref>) that seeks to combine meditation with relaxed physical movement to enter into a state of ‘heightened awareness’ in order to achieve inner balance and harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211422769">Wainapel &amp; Fast, 2002</xref>). Although Tai Chi was developed as a martial art for self-defence (Charman et al., 2000; Jahnke, 2007), the exercise form Tai Chi is based on flowing sequences of movements, creating something more akin to a dance. These individual exercises are drawn from a wider school of mind/body exercise developed within a branch of traditional Chinese medicine known as Qigong (pronounced Chee Goong) or Chi Kung (Charman et al., 2000). The nearest interpretation of the word Qigong in broad terms is qi or chi (energy) gong (exercise), so the word loosely means ‘energy exercises’. Many of the simpler exercise movements of Qigong involve making slow, steady and repetitive movements, while standing or sitting in one place. These simpler movements may be suitable for use with people suffering from dementia. The principles of Qigong are the same as those of Tai Chi and combine movement, relaxation and breathing.</p>
<p>Tai Chi comprises a series of flowing, circular movements performed slowly. There are many types of Tai Chi and Qigong. Movements are performed in sequence and the complete series constitutes a ‘form’ that generally takes at least a year to learn and several years to perfect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211422769">The Qigong Institute, 2004–2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211422769">Wainapel &amp; Fast, 2002</xref>). The usual method of teaching Tai Chi is to teach the first few movements in the first session, then recap and go to the next movements in subsequent sessions to build up knowledge of the full form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211422769">Wainapel &amp; Fast, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211422769">Yao, Giordani, and Alexander (2008)</xref> describe the ‘Sticky Hands’ form of Tai Chi, where hand contact with a partner is maintained, and use it in conjunction with positive emotion motivators, with the premise that emotional arousal leads to enhanced memory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211422769"><title>Current research into the benefits of Tai Chi</title>
<p>One of the potential benefits of Tai Chi training, as gained from studies amongst older people, is the potential for falls prevention. Early studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211422769">Wolf, Coogler, &amp; Xu, 1997</xref>) and the Fraility &amp; Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques (FICSIT) trials in the USA found evidence that Tai Chi has great potential to improve postural stability. A more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211422769">Choi, Moon, &amp; Song, 2005</xref>), utilizing a 12-week Sun-style Tai Chi exercise programme, reported significantly improved muscle strength in knee and ankle flexors, alongside significantly more confidence in fall avoidance in the intervention group. Evidence also suggests that Tai Chi can be beneficial, leading to a reduction of anxiety, falls and related injuries, improving mood and self-esteem, cardiovascular and respiratory functions, muscle strength, flexibility and balance (Lan et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211422769">Verhangen et al., 2004</xref>). The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong has initiated a territory-wide program for fall reduction that includes Tai Chi classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211422769">Chu, Alice, Chiu, &amp; Chi, 2007</xref>). The National Service Framework (NSF) for the elderly standard six (falls) advocates the use of exercise. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211422769">Health Education Authority (2000)</xref> factsheet, ‘Older people and physical activity’, reports that regular exercise can greatly reduce falls and, with balance training, the risk was reduced by 25%. However, with regular Tai Chi, the risk was reduced by 47%. Tai Chi has been found to reduce blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure, over a 12-week period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211422769">Westcott, 2007</xref>). However, this study does not divulge sample size or age of participants, which makes it difficult to generalize these findings. A more recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211422769">Chen et al. (2008)</xref> suggests that simplified Tai Chi implemented three times a week for 50 minutes can significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (<italic>p</italic> = 0.017) and diastolic blood pressure (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and improve hand grip strength and lower body flexibility at six months. However, this study excluded those with dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211422769">Tsang, Fung, Chan, Lee, and Chan (2006)</xref> found that regular Qigong practice could relieve depression and improve self-efficacy and personal well-being among elderly persons with chronic physical illness and depression. Much of the existing research is conducted in countries such as Taiwan and Asia, where Tai Chi is culturally accepted and practiced more widely across the generations as opposed to Europe and more specifically in the UK, where this is not the case. Few of these studies relate specifically to people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211422769">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Although the mechanisms underlying the benefits are not wholly understood, recent theories suggest that memory may be stored in body tissues; this opens up possibilities for future research into memory and healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211422769">Oschman, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211422769">Chan et al. (2005)</xref> found that mind-body exercise improved learning and memory in older adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211422769"><title>Tai Chi/Qigong and dementia</title>
<p>As people with dementia have difficulty with new learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211422769">Gibb, Morris, &amp; Gleisberg, 1997</xref>), the length of the sequence and complexity of the movements is likely to be a barrier to their use of Tai Chi. It would therefore be preferable to devise a simpler, flexible program based on the Sticky Hands version of Tai Chi or on Qigong exercises, which can be performed in sitting or standing positions. As cognitive impairment increases and expressing needs becomes more difficult, the extent to which a person will be willing and able to stay in synchrony with others’ movements within a group context varies; it may be that one-to-one interaction is required to facilitate movement and guide with the use of physical contact, such as is used in the Sticky Hands form. Physical contact in a supportive and caring way is something people with dementia may find soothing.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211422769">Yao et al.’s study (2008)</xref> of couples in which one had dementia, family members with an established emotional connection were used as partners. The Sticky Hands technique is reported to minimize the cognitive challenge, and caregivers reported their perceived benefits as helping both partners to stay active, spend more time together, gain relaxation and pain relief and engage in mental exercise. Perceived obstacles were mainly motivation issues when practising away from the group. The authors conclude that further studies might reveal enhanced cognition, caregiver well-being and a better relationship between older adults with dementia and caregivers.</p>
<p>Qigong exercises may be a particularly suitable choice for the following reasons: Qigong exercises involve repetition of simple movements, which helps learning and retention and avoids some participants being left behind. Mirroring of movements allows for constant visual feedback, assisted by the rhythm of the music, especially ‘as cognitive impairment increases, non-verbal communication becomes more important’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211422769">Everett, Dennis, &amp; Ricketts, 1995</xref>) and more accessible. Qigong requires minimal explanation and instructions, and ‘too much music and noise and too many directions and distractions can increase anxiety’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211422769">Best-Martini &amp; Botengagen-Digenova, 2004</xref>)<sup>.</sup> A non-verbal rapport can be developed along with the use of music in a way that is supportive, using movement as a language of direct communication. The slow gentle moves of Qigong exercises allow time for the person with dementia to respond and follow at their own pace. Many of the moves in Qigong mimic animal movements, such as flying, or familiar everyday tasks that would have been familiar to the Chinese at the time, such as ‘casting the fishing net’. These can be likened to actions more familiar to us, such as the visualization of ‘stirring the cake’ or ‘feeding the birds’. Placing the emphasis on flowing, whole body movements, away from positions of tension, encourages the release of muscle tension. The body naturally gains a more rhythmical and deeper range of breathing, which may benefit emotional states such as BPSD.</p>
<p>In relation to physical health and mobility, a broad spectrum of impairment is seen in those with dementia and BPSD. Some people with dementia are very mobile, whilst others are restrained by postural instability and fear of falling, pain, motor apraxia, visual agnosia, visuo-spatial difficulties, generalized weakness, frailty and fatigue and some are chair bound. Exercise protocols need to be tailored not only to the level of dementia, but also to the resident’s physical functioning and their presenting behaviour. Qigong can be adapted for those with cognitively or physically based impairments to movement. Preferred music has been found to have positive effects on reducing agitated behaviours in older people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211422769">Wall &amp; Duffy, 2010</xref>). Likewise, as with all of us, individuals with dementia have preferences in relation to exercise and physical activity. It is important to gain as much information as possible regarding previously preferred activities.</p>

<p>The call to find alternative or complementary therapeutic interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia is nothing new, but there is a need to provide people with dementia, staff and caregivers with more evidence-based alternatives to the prescription and use of antipsychotic medication. There have been many reasons cited in the literature as factors that have prevented the use of non-pharmacological interventions in long-term care settings and it is important to explore these when developing an evidence base for the use of therapies such as Tai Chi in dementia.</p>
<p>Most of the current research into Tai Chi and Qigong is conducted in the USA and across Asia. It focuses mainly on the physical health benefits for older adults who are reasonably mobile and score above 23 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Most studies reviewed focus on long-term conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and arthritis, or older adults at increased fall risk. Studies often use quite complex forms of Tai Chi, which may exclude people who may be unable to follow, learn and participate in a lengthy, complex exercise programme.</p>
<p>The benefits of exercise are well established and there is definitely a need to offer more opportunities for one-to-one interactions or group work in care homes for those with dementia and BPSD. Forms of exercise such as Qigong look promising. However, the body of research that supports the use of Tai Chi with dementia is sparse and a recent Cochrane systematic literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211422769">Forbes, Forbes, Morgan, Markle-Reid, &amp; Culum, 2008</xref>) suggested that there is little evidence to support the use of exercise regimes, including alternative therapeutic approaches such as Tai Chi, in dementia care. The recently published review around physical activity programs for people with dementia suggests that it is not that exercise itself is ineffective in dementia care settings, but that there is a lack of good-quality research to support the effectiveness of exercise in managing behavioural symptoms of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211422769">Forbes et al., 2008</xref>). The review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211422769">Forbes et al. (2008</xref>) in fact suggests that exercise programs can halt cognitive decline in later life in healthy adults and the authors feel that a systematic review incorporating meta-analysis is required to determine the effects of physical activity programs on cognition function, behaviour, depression and mortality in older people with dementia.</p>
<p>Whilst there is some evidence that may suggest the benefits of Tai Chi, it would be naïve to suggest that Tai Chi is the only possible beneficial exercise program for dementia. Further investigation of all the many forms of Qigong may prove enlightening over time. This is not to suggest a reductionist path; Tai Chi is holistic in nature, having physical, mental, spiritual and philosophic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211422769">Galante, 1981</xref>), but for dementia sufferers, simplicity would be of the essence. Exercise should be offered as part of a package of care alongside behavioural solving strategies within a person-centred approach to care.</p>
<p>A collaborative approach involving education of staff, residents and relatives about the benefits of exercise/movement for both physical and mental health is important. There can be no doubt that a randomized control trial conducted in a residential/nursing homes setting could give us a greater understanding as to whether Tai Chi would have any significant role in the future for the management of residents who suffer from dementia, especially those who exhibit the most challenging clinical presentation of BPSD.</p>
