<p><italic>Background</italic>: Successful small intestinal (SI) adaptation following surgical resection is essential for optimizing newborn growth and development, but the potential for adaptation is unknown. The authors developed an SI resection model in neonatal piglets supported by intravenous and enteral nutrition. <italic>Methods</italic>: Piglets (n = 33, 12–13 days old) were randomized to 80% SI resection with parenteral nutrition feeding (R-PN), 80% SI resection with PN + enteral feeding (R-EN), or sham SI transection with PN + enteral feeding (sham-EN). In resected pigs, the distal 100 cm of ileum (residual SI) and 30 cm of proximal SI were left intact. All pigs received parenteral nutrition postsurgery. Enteral nutrition piglets received continuous gastric infusion of elemental diet from day 3 (40:60 parenteral nutrition:enteral nutrition). Piglets were killed 4, 6, or 10 days postsurgery. <italic>Results:</italic> By 10 days, R-EN piglets had longer residual SI than R-PN and sham-EN pigs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). At days 6 and 10, R-EN piglets had greater weight per length of intact SI (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and isolated mucosa (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) compared to other groups. Greater gut weight in R-EN piglets was facilitated by a greater cellular proliferation index (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) by 4 days compared to other groups and greater overall ornithine decarboxylase activity vs R-PN piglets (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). <italic>Conclusions</italic>: This new model demonstrated profound SI adaptation, initiated early postsurgery by polyamine synthesis and crypt cell proliferation and only in response to enteral feeding. These changes translated to greater gut mass and length within days, likely improving functional capacity long term.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to develop therapies to avoid prolonged dependence on PN and the serious complications associated with PN. Identification of factors that enhance SI adaptation in a relevant animal model could quickly translate into accepted therapies for children. Successful SI adaptation will reduce the high health care costs associated with SBS and improve overall quality of life for children with digestive diseases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607111417447" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a clinical condition that occurs following intestinal resection. It is defined as intestinal failure characterized by malabsorption due to a shortening of the intestine with a concomitant reduction in absorptive capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111417447">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111417447">4</xref></sup> This condition commonly leads to malnutrition, and individuals with SBS often rely on parenteral nutrition (PN) for an extended period. The extent of this reliance is normally dependent on the location and quantity of intestine removed, as well as the morphologic and functional changes that occur following the resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111417447">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intestinal resection and subsequent SBS commonly occur in newborn and preterm infants because of congenital abnormalities of the intestine or the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111417447">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111417447">10</xref></sup> Moreover, survival rates have greatly improved for extremely premature infants, leading to an increase in gastrointestinal complications related to immaturity. The complications of SBS can have a profound effect on whole body growth of an infant due to lack of nutrient absorption from a shortened intestine. Survival rate of infants with SBS correlates with a greater amount of residual bowel, which generally is associated with a shorter period during which PN is required by the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111417447">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Small intestinal adaptation has been partially characterized in individuals with SBS, although more understanding is needed about the factors that maximize adaptation. Oral feeding intolerance, a common manifestation of SBS, may be related to small intestinal atrophy induced by prolonged PN. This phenomenon has been characterized in neonatal piglet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111417447">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111417447">12</xref></sup> and rodent models of PN feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111417447">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111417447">14</xref></sup> Because enteral feeding is key to maintaining gut mass in the neonate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111417447">12</xref></sup> regeneration of intestinal mucosa with initiation of early enteral feeding following resection may potentiate intestinal adaptation and reduce the transition time and dependence on PN. Successful adaptation of the SI postresection would improve nutrient absorption and facilitate adequate growth in neonates with SBS.</p>
<p>The majority of studies that have investigated small intestinal adaptation after resection have used adult rodent models with oral intake of food following resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111417447">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111417447">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111417447">16</xref></sup> Only a small number of studies have been conducted in young pigs, which is a more relevant preclinical model for infants. Most of these piglet studies have employed either full enteral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111417447">17</xref></sup> or full parenteral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111417447">18</xref></sup> feeding strategies. Enteral feeding is necessary to optimize adaptation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111417447">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111417447">19</xref></sup> but full enteral feeding may lead to prolonged feeding intolerance and, consequently, a significant interruption in growth. In this study, we employed a combination of enteral and parenteral feeding to provide the enteral stimulation necessary for adaptation while ensuring adequate nutrition support in the form of parenteral intake.</p>
<p>The mechanisms responsible for adaptation due to enteral nutrition have not been well described, and the maximal capacity for small intestinal adaptation in a neonate is certainly not known. Previous studies in piglets have assessed intestinal changes no earlier than 2 weeks following surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111417447">20</xref></sup> and as late as 8 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111417447">21</xref></sup> after resection, which is probably too late to assess mechanisms of adaptation. To begin to address such mechanistic questions, we have developed a young piglet model and measured indices of adaptation at 2, 6, and 10 days postresection to assess the timing of early adaptive responses.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of the present study was to establish a neonatal model of small intestinal resection in Yucatan miniature piglets to study intestinal adaptation following a combination of EN and PN support. Based on this model, our objective was to characterize early structural and functional indices of intestinal adaptation that occur following a massive resection.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0148607111417447">
<title>Animals and Surgical Procedures</title>
<p>Thirty-three Yucatan miniature piglets were obtained from a breeding herd at Memorial University of New-foundland (St John’s, Canada) and removed from the sow at 12–13 days of age. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. Anesthesia was induced with an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (22 mg/kg; Bimeda Canada, Cambridge, Canada) and acepromazine (0.5 mg/kg; Vetoquinol Canada Inc, Quebec, Canada). After atropine sulphate injection (0.05 mg/kg; Rafter Dex Canada, Calgary, Canada), the piglets were intubated and maintained under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories Ltd, Quebec, Canada) mixed with oxygen (1.5 L/min). In each piglet, 2 venous catheters were surgically implanted under aseptic conditions. One catheter was introduced into the femoral vein and advanced to the inferior vena cava for blood sampling and drug delivery. A second catheter was introduced into the jugular vein and advanced to the superior vena cava for PN. The abdomen was opened, and approximately 80% of the proximal SI was resected for 2 groups, leaving 100 cm of the distal ileum proximal to the ileocecal valve intact. Continuity of the SI was restored using an end-to-end anastomosis. One of the resected groups was maintained on 100% PN (R-PN, n = 9); the second group was maintained on a combination of 40% PN and 60% enteral feeding (R-EN, n = 13). For the third group of animals, the ileum was transected at the same site as the resected groups, with less than 5% of small intestine removed for tissue analysis purposes only (sham-EN, n = 11). Sham-EN and R-EN animals also underwent implantation of a gastric catheter to allow for “enteral” infusion of the elemental diet.</p>
<p>After surgery, piglets immediately received intravenous antibiotic (20 mg of trimethoprim and 100 of mg sulfadoxine; Borgal, Intervet Canada Ltd, Kirkland, Canada) and analgesic (0.03 mg/kg of buprenorphine hydrochloride; Temgesic, Schering-Plough, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey); Borgal was given daily and Temgesic every 12 hours for the first 3 days postoperatively. Piglets were fitted with jackets secured to a tether-swivel system with dual-infusion ports (Lomir Biomedical, Quebec, Canada), allowing for the continuous infusion of parenteral and enteral fluids. Piglets were housed in individual circular metabolic cages (1 m diameter), which allowed visual and aural contact with other piglets; toys were also provided. Lighting was maintained on a 12-hour light:dark cycle, and room temperature was maintained between 23°C and 28°C with supplemental heat provided by heat lamps.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607111417447">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>Immediately following surgery, diet infusion was initiated via the jugular vein at 50% of targeted intake. On the morning of day 1, the rate of infusion was increased to 75% for 12 hours and then to 100% by the end of day 1 (13.5 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). On day 2, the presence of ileus was tested in animals designated to receive enteral diet. A 10-mL bolus of the complete PN diet was infused into the stomach via the gastric catheter. If gastric emptying was evident, then enteral feeding was initiated on day 3, with 20% of total daily dietary intake delivered enterally and 80% delivered parenterally. On the morning of day 4, the enteral intake was increased to 40% and by the evening of day 4, increased to 60%. Animals were maintained in the study for 4, 6, or 10 days postsurgery (n = 3–5 per condition and time point). Piglets killed 4 days after surgery did not progress beyond the 20:80 enteral:parenteral ratio.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607111417447">
<title>PN/EN Diet</title>
<p>To prepare the elemental diet, crystalline L-amino acids were dissolved in water at 60°C under a blanket of nitrogen. Dextrose and minerals were added, and the solutions were brought up to volume. Diets were sterilized by cold filtering through a 0.22-µm filter into sterile intravenous bags (Baxter, Mississauga, Canada). The sterile diets were refrigerated and protected from light until needed. Diet bags were weighed routinely to accurately record the amount of diet that was infused. The complete diet provided 1.1 MJ of metabolizable energy·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> with glucose (24.5 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>) and lipid (20% Intralipid, Pharmacia, Mississauga, Canada), each supplying 50% of nonprotein energy and 15 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> of protein, supplied as free amino acids. The amino acid composition was as follows (per gram of total L-amino acids): alanine, 80 mg; arginine, 65 mg; aspartate, 60 mg; cysteine, 14 mg; glutamate, 103 mg; glycine, 27 mg; histidine, 30 mg; isoleucine, 45 mg; leucine, 102 mg; lysine-HCl, 102 mg; methionine, 19 mg; phenylalanine, 54 mg; proline, 81 mg; serine, 94 mg; taurine, 5 mg; threonine, 40 mg; tryptophan, 21 mg; tyrosine, 8 mg; and valine, 52 mg. Just before feeding, vitamins (Multi-12K<sub>1</sub> Pediatric, Sabex, Boucherville, Canada), trace minerals (200% of NRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111417447">22</xref></sup>), lipid, and iron dextran (Fe, 3.0 mg/kg; Vetoquinol Canada Inc, Quebec, Canada) were added to the PN solution. The diets were continuously infused intravenously and/or enterally by pressure-sensitive peristaltic pumps.</p>

<sec id="section7-0148607111417447">
<title>Tissue Collection</title>
<p>At necropsy, the site of anastomosis was identified and the small intestine removed, from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve. The weight and length of the small intestine and the “residual” small intestine were measured. The residual intestine was considered the segment of gut from the site of anastomosis to the ileocecal valve, which was carefully measured at surgery. The first 50 cm of residual intestine was isolated, weighed, mucosa harvested, and mucosal wet-weight measured. A 3-cm segment was also immersed in neutral buffered 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific, Whitby, Canada) for histologic analyses. To obtain mucosa, the intestinal section was slit open longitudinally and placed on a glass plate on ice. The mucosal tissue was scraped from the underlying muscle using a glass slide. Portions of mucosa were allocated for ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) assays, and the remainder was frozen at −80°C for subsequent analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607111417447">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>After fixation in 10% buffered formalin, samples were dehydrated in several ethanol concentrations, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin wax, and sliced into 5-µm sections. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fisher Scientific). Villus height and crypt depth were measured with a Zeiss Axiostar microscope (Carl Zeiss Canada Inc, Toronto, Canada) and with an Infinity 1 camera and Infinity Analyze software (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa, Canada). Twenty measurements of villus height and crypt depth were performed per pig. All histology measures were performed in a blinded manner.</p>

<sec id="section9-0148607111417447">
<title>Ornithine Decarboxylase Assay</title>
<p>Fresh mucosa for the ODC assay was obtained from a small segment of resected ileum collected during surgery and at necropsy as described above. In sum, 2 g of mucosa was homogenized in 8 mL of buffer (250mM sucrose, 10mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1mM EDTA, 5mM DTT, and 100 µL of protease inhibitor; Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) and centrifuged at 90,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 1 hour at 4°C. The supernatant was then frozen at −80°C and assayed later. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Biuret method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111417447">23</xref></sup>: 4 mg of protein was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask containing assay buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.22mM EDTA, and 0.1mM pyridoxyl-5-phosphate). The flask was sealed with a rubber stopper, from which was suspended a center well containing filter paper soaked in 200 µL of NCA II tissue solubilizer (Amersham, Oakville, Canada). Tubes were equilibrated to 37°C in a shaking water bath for 3 minutes; then, the reactions were started with the addition of ornithine solution containing 9.6 mL of 4mM L-ornithine (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.4mM of L-[1-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111417447">14</xref></sup>C] ornithine (approximately 0.5 µCi/mol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St Louis, MO). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and stopped with the addition of 200 µL of 2.5M sulfuric acid. Flasks were incubated for an additional hour at 37°C to collect liberated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111417447">14</xref></sup>CO<sub>2</sub>. The center well and its contents were placed in a scintillation vial with 10 mL of Scintiverse (Fisher Scientific) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. ODC activity was calculated by subtracting the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> released by nonspecific decarboxylation, and it was expressed as picomoles CO<sub>2</sub> released per milligram of protein per hour.</p>

<title>Cellular Proliferation Index Using 5-Bromo-2′-Deoxyuridine</title>
<p>Animals were injected intravenously with 50 mg/kg of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 4 hours before necropsy. Intestinal samples from necropsy were preserved in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into 5-µm sections using a microtome. Immunohistologic analyses were performed to measure incorporation of BrdU into proliferating cells of small intestinal crypts (BrdU labeling kit; BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada) with visualization based on DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlington, Canada). Data were expressed as the number of cells labeled with BrdU per total number of cells in an individual crypt (10 crypts per animal).</p>

<sec id="section11-0148607111417447">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for each group of animals. Sample size was 3 to 5 piglets per treatment group, except for ODC activity, which was 9 per treatment. Data were analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc testing, with treatment and time after surgery as the 2 factors. When no interaction was evident (ie, for ODC activity), data within treatments were pooled and a 1-way analysis of variance was used.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study establishes an excellent neonatal piglet model for intestinal adaptation and demonstrates a clear association between early delivery of enteral diet and stimulation of adaptive responses within the small intestine. The provision of partial elemental enteral feeding resulted in profound gross morphologic changes compared to PN support alone. Furthermore, these in vivo adaptations coincided with in vitro indices of crypt cell proliferation, likely mediated by increased ODC activity and polyamine synthesis.</p>
<p>Infants and children with severe intestinal resection generally experience lifelong complications related to the shortened gut. To prevent malnutrition, reliance on PN for an extended period is usually necessary until an adequate amount of oral diet can be tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111417447">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111417447">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111417447">25</xref></sup> Although the effect of resection on intestinal morphology and function has been described in a variety of animal models, there still remains much to be learned with respect to the factors that may contribute to restoration of optimal gut function. In humans with SBS, there is some evidence that absorption of nutrients is increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111417447">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607111417447">28</xref></sup>; however, intestinal adaptation is still poorly understood, especially in neonates where intestinal growth and development may also increase plasticity of adaptation. Because the physiology and degree of maturity at birth are similar between the piglet and infant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111417447">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607111417447">30</xref></sup> we established a neonatal piglet model of intestinal resection and examined morphologic and cellular changes that occurred during administration of an elemental enteral diet.</p>
<p>Most studies carried out to establish animal models of SBS, specifically to investigate factors that might enhance intestinal adaptation after resection, employed ad libitum feeding protocols. Moreover, the few studies performed in young animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607111417447">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607111417447">32</xref></sup> investigated the role of either PN feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111417447">18</xref></sup> or total enteral nutrition in intestinal adaptation after resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111417447">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607111417447">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607111417447">34</xref></sup> This study is the first to investigate a combination of parenteral and enteral feeding of an elemental diet in a neonatal model of massive intestinal resection. Our results indicate that early enteral introduction of a complete elemental diet, combined with administration of PN, enhances intestinal adaptation. An obvious advantage of our model is the certain delivery of partial nutrition support parenterally while concurrently providing enteral stimulation.</p>
<p>Maintenance of growth and development are important objectives for neonates following intestinal surgery. In our study, there was no apparent lag in growth related to recovery from the small intestinal resection surgery. Not only did the animals receiving PN and enteral diet demonstrate intestinal adaptation, but daily body weight gain was also maintained. These key findings are in contrast to previous studies that reported weight loss after resection in both premature infants fed infant formula enterally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607111417447">35</xref></sup> and in resected 7-day-old piglets fed modified whey protein–based infant formula orally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111417447">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Resected piglets that received 60% of their diet enterally demonstrated a profound response in residual gut length growth by 10 days postsurgery. This enormous potential for adaptation in length growth is consistent with some clinical observations in children that reported lengthening of the small intestine by at least 20 cm after a resection that left &lt; 90 cm of intestine intact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607111417447">36</xref></sup> Studies of nongrowing adult rodent models have reported either no increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607111417447">37</xref></sup> or only a modest increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607111417447">38</xref></sup> in residual gut length after an 80% resection. It is likely that the growing neonate has a much greater capacity for gut length adaptation than adults. However, it is also possible that forced infusion of nutrients helped enhance gut growth in our study, as opposed to depressed ad libitum feed intake after surgery in rodent models.</p>
<p>In determining the proportion of enteral diet delivery, we chose a target of 60% (complemented with PN), which was found to be necessary to maintain small intestinal weight, protein, and DNA content in neonatal piglets with PN-induced small intestinal atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111417447">12</xref></sup> Our results suggest that this balance of nutrient delivery routes was also adequate to potentiate synthesis of new intestinal tissue after massive intestinal resection. In addition to enhanced length growth, the residual gut was heavier per centimeter in enterally fed resected animals. Thus, by day 10, it is possible that uptake of nutrients may have been enhanced so that absorption across the intestine was more efficient in resected animals, which could contribute to length and mass growth. Interestingly, this greater SI mass was not associated with a measurable difference in villus height; however, other studies in piglets have reported no differences in villus height following massive intestinal resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111417447">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111417447">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607111417447">35</xref></sup> We also found similarities in intestinal growth outcomes between the enterally fed sham-treated piglets and the resected piglets given only PN. Short-term PN has been shown to induce intestinal atrophy in piglets at all sites along the small intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111417447">13</xref></sup> Thus, the lack of intestinal atrophy in our R-PN group is indicative that some adaptation has occurred postresection. This has also been demonstrated in PN-fed resected rats as early as 8 hours and up to 7 days after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607111417447">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Polyamines are important for crypt cell proliferation and differentiation and are normally supplied to the intestine either exogenously (via diet) or synthesized endogenously via the rate-limiting enzyme ODC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607111417447">40</xref></sup> In adult SBS patients receiving both cyclic parenteral diet and nonrestricted oral diet, ODC activity was lower compared to control groups, presumably limiting gut crypt cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607111417447">41</xref></sup> In our study, the resected animals had higher ODC activity after receiving 60% enteral diet, indicating that enteral feeding was more effective at stimulating polyamine synthesis compared to PN feeding alone. Indeed, supplementation of an enteral diet with polyamines or their precursors contributed to adaptation in a rat model of intestinal resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0148607111417447">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0148607111417447">43</xref></sup> Therefore, provision of enteral feeding ensures that the precursor amino acids necessary for polyamine synthesis, such as arginine and proline, are available to promote crypt cell differentiation and proliferation. Rate of crypt cell proliferation was estimated by analyzing the incorporation of BrdU into crypt cells. As early as 1 day after the introduction of an enteral diet, rapid crypt cell proliferation was evident in resected animals, and by day 6, a corresponding increase in crypt depth was observed. Crypt cell proliferation and crypt depth were also significantly higher than nonresected piglets at day 10. The lack of difference in cellular proliferation at the day 6 time point may reflect a transient surgery response in the sham animals that subsided by day 10. In PN-fed animals, crypt cell proliferation was different from EN-fed resected piglets only at day 4, which suggests a slower adaptive response without enteral feeding. Thus, the residual intestine has the capacity to change and adapt quickly, and it does so by increasing cell number within the crypt, probably via increased ODC activity. Similar responses in ODC activity and BrdU labeling in the intestine were observed in neonatal piglets during recovery from PN-induced atrophy when 40% of total diet was delivered enterally, demonstrating that enteral diet is the key stimulant for intestinal adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111417447">12</xref></sup> Although increased crypt cell proliferation has been observed after a massive intestinal resection in rodent models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111417447">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607111417447">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0148607111417447">44</xref></sup> our results demonstrate that at least for neonates, early introduction of enteral feeding is crucial for optimizing adaptive responses. These early proliferative changes resulted in significant gross morphologic improvements within 10 days of resection.</p>
<p>We quantified the time course of structural and functional indices of intestinal adaptation following a massive resection in a new neonatal model of SBS. This is the first report of characterization of a model of SBS in the Yucatan miniature piglet, a species bred for biomedical research. Its reduced size and higher proportion of weight gain as fat mass compared to domestic pigs make it an ideal neonatal animal model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0148607111417447">45</xref></sup> Our model employed the removal of jejunum and proximal ileum, leaving a portion of the distal ileum, the ileocecal valve, and colon intact. Although, clinically, a distal ileal resection is a more likely consequence of necrotizing enterocolitis, we hypothesized that the ileum would demonstrate more intense adaptive responses. Indeed, we observed significant changes in morphologic outcomes as well as indices of proliferation. We are currently using this new model to investigate potential trophic factors that enhance intestinal adaptation, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved.</p>
