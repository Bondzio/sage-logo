<title>Background:</title>
<p>Plastic surgeons are competing for their share of a growing but still limited market, thus making advertising an important component in a successful plastic surgery practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X13481350">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The authors evaluate the variables, characteristics, and presentation features that make print advertisements most effectively pique the interest of individuals selecting a plastic surgeon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X13481350">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>An online survey was administered to 404 individuals with active interest in plastic surgery from 10 major metropolitan areas. Participants were presented with 5 different advertisements from plastic surgeons throughout the country and were asked a series of both closed- and open-ended questions to assess verity, quality, and marketability of each advertisement. Reponses to open-ended questions were analyzed using the Wordle program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wordle.net">www.wordle.net</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X13481350">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The most frequent themes identified for all 5 ads were “Being beautiful is possible” (41%), “I could be beautiful” (24%), “Some people need surgery to be beautiful” (16%), and “Being beautiful is important” (14%). Advertisement 1—featuring 3 women and no pre- or posttreatment photography, no physician photography, and a listing of the 3 physicians’ credentials but not a list of the services provided—received the highest overall preference rating.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X13481350">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Factors including emotions felt while reading, unique qualities of the advertisement, list of procedures performed, use of models versus actual patients, and pictures of the plastic surgeons were found to contribute to the respondents’ overall perception of advertisements used to market a plastic surgery practice.</p>

<p>Plastic surgery represents a continually growing marketplace. With the demand for cosmetic procedures increasing markedly over the past decade and the number of “noncore” surgeons performing cosmetic procedures rising, competition has tightened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13481350">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13481350">2</xref></sup> Selection of a plastic surgeon depends on referrals from other physicians, word of mouth from family and friends, and advertisements. Historically, advertising in plastic surgery has been limited to print ads in magazines, newspapers, and the phone book, but with the impact of the Internet, electronic advertisements are now another significant avenue for publicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13481350">3</xref></sup> Many surgeons might wonder, if they decide to create an advertisement, what form and design will be effective in attracting patients? What information should be highlighted and what aspects of the practice featured? It remains difficult to standardize the most effective design criteria used by prospective patients in selecting a plastic surgeon. This study was constructed to scientifically identify some of the important factors in designing a well-received print advertisement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13481350">1</xref></sup> Print advertising was selected for testing in this study as it represents the most level playing field and remains a significant method utilized by plastic surgery practices today. However, we hypothesize that many of our findings will be applicable to Internet marketing as well.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X13481350" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional survey of individuals who have undergone or are considering a plastic surgery procedure(s). The market research company ResearchNow (Plano, Texas) was hired to administer an online survey to a sample of its national consumer panel during a 2-week period in July 2011 to compare the effectiveness of print ads promoting individual physician and physician group practices specializing in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Screened participant characteristics included age, sex, highest level of education, ethnic background, and income level. Participants were selected from affluent areas (chosen by US Internal Revenue Service publications of income by zip code) around Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Phoenix/Scottsdale, Seattle, and Washington, DC, with the majority of participants from the New York City and Los Angeles markets. Affluent zip codes were selected for survey distribution, as they were deemed to correlate better with a likelihood of participants having undergone plastic surgery.</p>
<p>The convenience sample included 5 advertisements for cosmetic surgery practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13481350">Figures 1A</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13481350"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X13481350">5A</xref>) from “up-market” publications representing different parts of the United States. The ads were selected for diversity in appearance. One ad featured a discount coupon, 1 featured patients, 1 featured photos of the doctor, and 1 featured limited graphics. These were all aspects being tested in our survey for preference. Our ad was developed to include pre- and postoperative clinical results, as well as a photo of the physician with a patient, because these were aspects missing from the existing advertisements. Each of these advertisements had been published at least once. Most physicians in the ads were unaware that their ads were being used for our research study, with the exception being the senior author (J.H.S.), whose ad was constructed for the purposes of this study to test additional variables not readily highlighted in the other advertisements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350">Figure 3A</xref>). Participants were screened for appropriateness, then asked to take an online survey intended to evaluate the variables, designs, and presentation that make plastic surgery advertisements successful and well received.</p>

<p>Specifically, participants were shown each of the 5 advertisements, then asked a series of questions (consistent for each advertisement) that included both closed- and open-ended questions. These questions assessed the idea each respondent identified as the main message or theme of each advertisement (such as “I could be beautiful” or “I need surgery”), the 3 things the respondent liked and disliked about each ad, which parts of the ad did not appeal to the respondent, how “believable” they found certain preidentified aspects of the ad to be, and which of the emotions on a predetermined list were “triggered” by the ad. Participants were also asked to select words that best described each ad and to grade each ad on a scale from A to F. A question at the end of the survey asked participants to select the ad icon that gave them “the best reasons to pick that doctor.” Responses to this question were calculated as a preference score (ie, the percentage of the respondents who selected a given ad as the one with the “best reasons”). A full list of survey questions appears in Appendix 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com">www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Reponses to open-ended questions were analyzed using “Wordles,” created from the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wordle.net">www.wordle.net</ext-link> (copyrighted by Jonathan Feinberg). These devices visually displayed the frequency with which a respondent used a word within his or her response as a percentage of all the words used. The size of the word illustrates how many times, in proportion to other words, a respondent used that word to describe his or her thoughts. To understand the significance of the responses overall, it is important to note how many comments the response contained overall. Questions with few responses are less significant to the respondent. If few people respond, then it can be assumed the responders are outliers to a degree. Having a greater number of responses for a certain question helps control for outliers and increases statistical power.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Seventy-five percent of our respondents were between 35 and 65 years of age (age range, 21-65 years) and 80% were women. Half (50%) had undergone a cosmetic or plastic (including reconstructive) surgical procedure in the past 5 years; of the remaining 50%, 28% were very likely and 72% were somewhat likely to have a cosmetic or plastic (including reconstructive) surgical procedure in the coming 2 to 5 years. A description of previous plastic or reconstructive surgeries undergone or considered by participants can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13481350">Table 1</xref>. The respondents were 87% white, 71% had achieved a 4-year college degree or higher education, and household income in every case exceeded $75 000 per year.</p>

<title>Advertisement 1</title>
<p>The first advertisement shown to participants can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13481350">Figure 1A</xref>. In describing the advertisement’s message, 49% of respondents identified “Being beautiful is possible,” 31% identified “I could be beautiful,” and 21% identified “Being beautiful is important” as the main theme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X13481350">Table 2</xref>). In terms of what participants liked (a question with a 97% response rate), nearly every participant found the ad universally appealing. Specifically, participants liked the photography of women of various ethnicities without an overemphasis of their physical features. Among the strongest elements of this ad was the motto, “EveryBODY is beautiful.” Respondents also noted the appeal of the colors and described the advertisement as natural and relatable. Respondents also mentioned the detailed credentials of the physicians and the name of the center as having great appeal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13481350">Figure 1B</xref> shows the overall impression the ad created. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13481350">Figure 1C</xref> depicts responses to the question about what respondents disliked in the advertisement. The majority of respondents felt that the women, while lovely, were models and did not represent the “real” woman. Also, the small percentage of men surveyed all questioned, “What about us?” It is also important to note that less than half of the respondents did not share comments. Another frequent remark was that the ad lacked a list of procedures in which the physicians specialized. Finally, the surgical group’s motto that “everyBODY” can reach their potential seemed very misleading to 23 respondents.</p>
<p>In an additional question, respondents who did not like something about the advertisement were asked to identify the specific elements that were problematic in the parts of the ad they disliked. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13481350">Figure 1D</xref> represents the responses of about 200 people for advertisement 1. This number of responses indicated that people who also answered 1 or both of the first 2 open-ended questions answered this question as well. The findings are very similar to the other Wordle images for advertisement 1. Primarily, people were opposed to the use of models in this setting and did not like the lack of detail about procedures performed. Less than half of the respondents left comments.</p>
<p>Most respondents (60%) found the ad somewhat believable, 51% believed that it differentiated itself somewhat from other ads, 41% believed that it somewhat and 39% believed that it definitely had a message worth remembering, 46% said that it somewhat and 34% said that it definitely spoke to things they cared about, 43% said that it made them somewhat and 34% said that it made them definitely curious to learn more, and 48% said that the ad somewhat gave them good reasons to select this doctor/group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X13481350">Tables 3</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1090820X13481350"/>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1090820X13481350">8</xref>). When asked to select 3 words that expressed their emotions after reading this advertisement, participants’ top responses were <italic>comfortable, hopeful, respected, confident</italic>, and <italic>supported</italic>. Participants selected <italic>easy to follow, nice, fresh, engaging</italic>, and <italic>interesting</italic> as words that they would use to describe the advertisement. Once responses were averaged, the overall grade for this ad was an A–.</p>

<sec id="section11-1090820X13481350">
<title>Advertisement 2</title>
<p>The second advertisement shown to participants can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2A</xref>. In describing the advertisement’s message, 37% responded “Being beautiful is possible,” 21% responded “I need surgery from this group,” and 16% responded “I could be beautiful” as the main theme. Interestingly, 35% said that none of the predetermined comments accurately identified the main message or theme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X13481350">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>For this ad, 96% of the respondents left comments about what they found appealing, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2B</xref> depicts these responses. Among the strongest elements of this ad was the motto, “The Beauty of Experience.” The photo of the physicians resonated with about 50% of the respondents, with comments citing the professionalism, the quality, and the overall appearance of the physicians. Additionally, many survey respondents indicated that the surgeons’ Harvard and Stanford credentials were impressive.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2C</xref> depicts the participants’ responses about what they disliked in the advertisement; 216 participants responded to this question. The majority of the negative comments included observations that the photography felt fake, staged, or too “professionally done” to be real. Many respondents commented on the practice’s composition, which included only 1 woman. Finally, respondents deemed the dark image as too serious and off-putting. However, 26 of 389 respondents (96% of the 404 respondents wrote something) said they disliked nothing about the ad, as evidenced by the word <italic>nothing</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2C</xref>. The final open-ended question was posed for those who did not like something about the advertisement and allowed them to share what specifically was problematic for them. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2D</xref> represents comments from about 150 respondents who identified specific features that were problematic. The findings were very similar to those from the prior question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Respondents generally found this ad to be believable (50% answered somewhat, 40% answered definitely) and thought that it differentiated itself from the other advertisements (43% answered somewhat, 34% answered definitely). They believed that it had a message worth remembering (45% answered somewhat, 33% answered definitely); some also thought that it spoke to things they cared about (46% answered somewhat). Just under half of the respondents were somewhat curious to learn more (44%) and somewhat believed that the advertisement gave them good reasons to select this doctor/group (45%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X13481350">Tables 3</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1090820X13481350"/>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1090820X13481350">8</xref>). The top emotions identified by respondents after reading the advertisement were <italic>confident, knowledgeable</italic>, and <italic>comfortable</italic>. When asked to select words or phrases they would use to describe the ad, respondents selected <italic>easy to follow, interesting, nice</italic>, and <italic>engaging</italic>. Once averaged, the overall grade for advertisement 2 was roughly a B.</p>

<sec id="section12-1090820X13481350">
<title>Advertisement 3</title>
<p>The third advertisement shown to participants can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350">Figure 3A</xref>. In describing the advertisement’s main message, 35% identified “Being beautiful is possible,” 27% identified “Some people need surgery to be beautiful,” and 17% identified “I could be beautiful” as the theme. Twenty-nine percent felt that none of the preselected items accurately represented the ad’s theme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X13481350">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (95%) provided an answer about what they liked or found appealing in advertisement 3. The responses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350">Figure 3B</xref>. Among the strongest elements of this advertisement were the pre- and posttreatment photo comparisons of real patients. Additionally, respondents liked the photo of the physician in action. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350">Figure 3C</xref> depicts the elements that respondents disliked in the advertisement; 77% of participants responded to this question. Interestingly, most of the negative comments related to exactly what others found positive. For example, some respondents said that although the pre- and posttreatment pictures were a great idea, they did not feature pretty people. Also, survey respondents considered the working photo of the surgeon too dramatic. Finally, there were many comments about disliking grammar and word choice (for example, <italic>unparalleled</italic>). Many observed that beyond initials, this advertisement failed to present the credentials of the physician. In terms of specific problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350">Figure 3D</xref>), the responses were very similar to those given for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13481350">Figure 3C</xref>.</p>
<p>About half (54%) of respondents found the ad somewhat believable but believed that it did not significantly differentiate itself from other ads (47% answered not at all and 42% answered somewhat). When asked if the ad had a message worth remembering, 43% answered somewhat and 41% answered not at all; 47% said that it somewhat spoke to things they cared about, and 42% answered not at all. About half (48%) said that it did not at all make them curious to learn more, nor did it give them good reasons to select this doctor/group (49% answered not at all) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X13481350">Tables 3</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1090820X13481350"/>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1090820X13481350">8</xref>). When participants were asked to select words that expressed their emotions after reading this advertisement, the top 3 responses were <italic>skeptical, hopeful</italic>, and <italic>neutral</italic>. Respondents’ selections for words/phrases that they would use to describe the advertisement included <italic>cheesy, easy to follow</italic>, and <italic>interesting</italic>. The average overall grade for this ad, according to respondents, was a C+.</p>

<sec id="section13-1090820X13481350">
<title>Advertisement 4</title>
<p>The fourth advertisement shown to participants can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13481350">Figure 4A</xref>. In describing the advertisement’s message, 31% identified “Being beautiful is possible,” 23% identified “I could be beautiful,” 16% identified “Some people need surgery to be beautiful,” and 16% identified “Being beautiful is important” as the theme. Twenty-five percent thought that none of the preselected themes accurately identified the message (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X13481350">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority (94%) of participants responded to the open-ended question about what they liked or found appealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13481350">Figure 4B</xref>); among the strongest elements of this advertisement were its simplicity, short message, beautiful woman (although it was noted that she was a model), the discount of 10%, and the youthfulness and credentials of the physician. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13481350">Figure 4C</xref> depicts the things respondents disliked about the advertisement. Respondents left more negative remarks than positive. Again, participants responded negatively to some of the same factors to which others responded positively. Most of the negative comments related to the distasteful representation of the woman model, her breasts, and the fact that she was scantily clad. Second, people found it distasteful and discrediting that a physician would offer a coupon/discount. For the open-ended question asking which items of the ad were specifically problematic, the respondents gave answers very similar to those in the previous question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13481350">Figure 4C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13481350">D</xref>). Primarily, people were opposed to the use of models. The discount and coupon were also cited as detracting from the professionalism of the physician and his practice.</p>
<p>Respondents found this ad somewhat believable (52%), but 52% also said that it did not differentiate itself from other ads “at all.” In terms of whether it was worth remembering, 37% answered somewhat and 43% answered not at all. When asked whether the ad spoke to things they cared about, 36% answered somewhat and 48% answered not at all. About half (53%) of respondents said it did not make them curious to learn more “at all,” and 53% also said that the ad did not give them good reasons to select this surgeon group “at all” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X13481350">Tables 3</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090820X13481350"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1090820X13481350"/>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1090820X13481350">8</xref>).

When asked to select words or phrases that they would use to describe this advertisement, respondents selected <italic>cheesy, easy to follow, irritating, disrespectful</italic>, and <italic>forgettable</italic>.

The strongest element of this advertisement was the motto “Transform Yourself.” Additionally, respondents liked the descriptions of comfort and privacy in the treatment settings, the formatting and color use, the images, the listing of procedures, and the credentials of the doctors. Many also mentioned the “MFA” seal in the lower corner.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X13481350">Figure 5C</xref> depicts aspects respondents disliked in the advertisement (292 participants [72%] responded to this question). Most of the negative comments related to the image appearing too old-fashioned, the motto seeming too lofty of a promise, and the extensively long list of credentials for the doctors (including the fact that they were from different specialties). About 200 participants responded to the additional question asking, if they disliked elements of the ad, which elements were specifically problematic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X13481350">Figure 5D</xref> represents their responses, which were very similar to those to the previous question.</p>

Of the 5 ads tested, advertisement 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13481350">Figure 1A</xref>)—featuring 3 women and no pre- or posttreatment photography, no physician photography, and a listing of the 3 physicians’ credentials but not a list of the services provided—received the highest overall preference rating, with 40% of respondents indicating that it gave them “the best reasons” to select this practice. Advertisement 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13481350">Figure 2A</xref>)—which features a large, formal photo of the 4 surgeons in the group and generously describes their training and procedures—finished second overall in preference (30%). The remaining 3 advertisements were statistically even for overall preference, with each receiving around a 10% preference score. Overall preference, therefore, corresponded with overall grade.</p>
<p>Advertisement 2 made the most believable claim to the respondents that the doctors could perform the services listed in the ad (40% of respondents said that they “definitely” believed this). It was also identified by respondents as the most differentiated or unique of the ads (34% said that it “definitely” distinguished itself). Advertisement 1 was deemed most worth remembering (39% “definitely”), and it contained the most relevant information (34% “definitely”). Many respondents (34%) also said that it “definitely” made them curious to learn more. Finally, advertisements 1 and 2 received nearly equal responses (29% and 31%, respectively) in terms of the number of participants who said that the ad “definitely” gave them “good reasons to use this doctor.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Assuming print advertising is an important element for increasing awareness of a physician’s practice, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of understanding the elements that will draw a potential patient into the ad and motivate him or her to read it, make note of the physician and his or her credentials, relate to the message being presented, and easily allow an opportunity for the patient to follow up on his or her interest.</p>
<sec id="section17-1090820X13481350">
<title>Aesthetic Appeal</title>
<p>Advertisements 1 and 2 had the highest overall preference. Subjectively, we believe that they both have similar layouts and organization. They each used a company logo, a large picture of either models or surgeons, and a description of services provided. The respondents reported that the advertisements had a calming effect and were easy to navigate. These ads did not inundate the reader with too much information, and they allowed the reader to logically process the advertisement. In assessing commonalities between these ads and considering the participants’ responses, we believe that (1) using a standard layout/design is valued, (2) balance between pictures and words furthers aesthetic appeal, and (3) readers appreciate selection of a font that is soft (not bolded) and has cursive elements. These ads, which had high preference percentages, were also highly rated in the sections where respondents were asked whether the ads made them curious to learn more and gave them a good reason to select the doctor.</p>

<sec id="section18-1090820X13481350">
<title>Use of Real Patients vs Models</title>
<p>Advertisements 1, 3, and 4 all featured real patients or models. In our study, these pictures did not correlate with advertisement performance. Based on responses, the important factor seemed to be the appearance of the person in the ad. If the person was too realistic, observers tended to be disappointed in the advertisement, suggesting that perhaps the surgery, its cost, and subsequent recovery may not be worth the investment. However, there is a fine and very personal interpretation of “beauty.” Although “sex sells” in today’s society for advertising a wide range of products, this adage did not necessarily hold true in plastic surgery advertising, at least for our study population. Advertisement 4 received negative responses because of the scantily clad model who occupied the majority of the advertisement. One of the few features that respondents appreciated about advertisement 3 was the pre- and posttreament pictures. The ideal visual combination, therefore, seems to be natural, relaxed models (as in advertisement 1) and comparison photos (as in advertisement 3), although these elements were not tested together in our study. Ultimately, we believe that choosing a representative patient or model is critical. The reader or target audience must be able to identify with the person depicted, likely within a motivational context.</p>

<sec id="section19-1090820X13481350">
<title>Picture of Surgeon and List of Surgeon’s Credentials</title>
<p>Based on our participants’ responses, it seems that ads should only feature photos of the physician(s) in cases where their appearance may clarify their ethnicity or provide a benefit by associating a face with an advertisement. Based on the fact that respondents criticized advertisement 3 for the overly dramatic rendering of the surgeon in action, it seems that surgeons should strive to find a balance between “introducing themselves” through their image and thrusting the patient into the operating room. People did appreciate the candid surgeon in advertisement 3, relative to the overly relaxed surgeon in advertisement 4 with his arms crossed and donning a “sporty” jacket. However, respondents also criticized advertisement 2 for the group of surgeons posing in an intimidating and rather formal fashion and dressed in suits. The ideal combination therefore appears to be surgeons wearing white coats, depicted “in action” in their office (but not operative) settings. It should be noted that 2 of the 5 advertisements did not profile the surgeon at all, and respondents did not comment on this. Surgeons should consider photography that shows the patient in a relaxed setting; photography should also demonstrate professionalism, competence, and privacy. Frequently, hospitals rely on pictures of surgeons in scrubs and white coats in a more consultative setting to show the patient there is nothing to fear.</p>

<title>List of Services Performed</title>
<p>Respondents met lists of services performed with varied criticism. Many did not like the extremes of either having no list or having a list that was too exhaustive. Having a list or description of some procedures performed appears to have contributed to the high ratings for believability that the surgeon could really deliver on what advertisement 2 promised. Having a list of procedures may help the patient decide to schedule an initial visit to the surgeon, connecting the patient’s desire with the skill set of the physician or confirming for the patient that this physician is qualified to perform his or her preferred procedure. We recommend a simple list of procedures performed in common language, minimizing medical jargon. The top 5 to 10 procedures listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13481350">Table 1</xref> may provide a strong starting point for physicians designing ads.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1090820X13481350">
<title>Colors</title>
<p>Soft, natural, earthy colors may have a more calming effect on the viewer. Respondents praised advertisements 1 and 5 for their color choices (cream, blue, light brown). There was no specific question assessing color preferences; these responses were part of another open-ended question. Colors were also mentioned in the open-ended question asking what respondents did not like about the advertisement. The other 3 advertisements featured predominantly dark colors (ie, black), which respondents viewed as overbearing. The large picture of surgeons dressed in dark colors with a black background in advertisement 2 appeared to be an intimidating image. Respondents criticized advertisement 3 for its “highlighter yellow” tagline and pure black background. Based on these results, color choice seems to play an important role in the reader’s perception of an advertisement, potentially affecting the time the reader will spend reviewing the advertisement. If the reader abandons the advertisement because the color disturbs him or her, the surgeon has lost an opportunity.</p>

<sec id="section22-1090820X13481350">
<title>Coupons/Discounts</title>
<p>Discounts and “Groupon”-like ads may work in other industries but did not seem to resonate with our respondents. Advertisement 4 was the only ad featuring a discount coupon, and respondents viewed it very negatively. It was deemed distasteful and discrediting that a surgeon would offer a discount to further his practice. In fact, it appeared to respondents that this surgeon might be substandard in quality if he had to resort to discounts to attract patients. Several made comments such as, “Why would a reputable doctor have to offer specials?” Therefore, surgeons should use discounts sparingly in their advertisements, if at all, as it may reflect poorly on the surgeon’s practice and motives. Discounts may still be appropriate for direct mail offers to former patients for their second (or subsequent) procedure(s). These patients, theoretically, already have had a positive experience and trust their surgeon, so quality would not be a factor.</p>

<sec id="section23-1090820X13481350">
<title>Motto/Tagline</title>
<p>Although the presence of a motto/tagline elicited many responses, it is not clear that this was a necessary component of a successful advertisement. Based on the results, though, we believe that advertisers should avoid extreme claims of beauty. The motto in advertisement 1, “EveryBODY is beautiful,” yielded a large percentage of comments alluding to the unrealistic claim of this statement (even though they also noted its universal appeal). Advertisement 2 had a well-received motto, “The Beauty of Experience,” with many citing it as a good catchphrase.</p>
<p>Use of a motto/tagline is a mechanism for differentiation in the marketplace as well as a targeted statement of the brand position. If a surgical practice has gone through the effort of creating a brand position and has tested the position/motto for its relevance within the marketplace, then using a tagline can be effective. We recommend keeping this type of statement simple, realistic, and relevant and researching/testing phrases for local appeal within the practice’s targeted audiences.</p>

<sec id="section24-1090820X13481350">
<title>Summary Recommendations</title>
<p>Advertisements should focus on helping potential patients select plastic surgery procedures rather than selling a laundry list of procedures performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13481350">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13481350">4</xref></sup> Use of light colors, less formal pictures of the physicians in a practice, realistic patient photos, clear description of services and surgeons’ credentials, a simple message, and a logical layout all seemed to contribute to a successful advertisement in our study.</p>
<p>Again, our survey focused on print advertisements, but it should be noted that online advertising demands shorter messages as well as cleaner imagery. Although this study did not focus on other advertising mediums, applying the principles we listed above can provide a baseline to assure advertisers that they have, at a minimum, adhered to the best standards available. Writing for the Internet (websites, in particular) requires rigor around understanding the target audience’s requirements, their ability to comprehend the information, and the relative value of the information available in a virtually unlimited space.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that there are many potential ways to improve the effectiveness of advertising in plastic surgery. In designing the optimal advertisement for print use in exclusive publications, surgeons should give consideration to aesthetic appeal; the use of real patients who are attractive enough that they appear to have been successfully treated; believable claims; demonstration that the physician(s) are well accomplished, competent, and approachable; and the assurance that the practice is concerned about the patient’s comfort and privacy.</p>
