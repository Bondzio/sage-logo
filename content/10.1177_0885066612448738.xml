<title>Introduction:</title><p>Vasoactive drugs are routinely used in critically ill patients with shock to optimize the hemodynamic state while evaluating and treating potentially reversible causes. Limited data exist on the use of multiple vasoactive drugs in the intensive care unit. We hypothesize that the use of 3 or more vasoactive drugs is associated with worse outcomes.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title><p>We retrospectively examined the outcome in patients, at least 18 years of age, in whom 3 or more vasoactive drugs were administered simultaneously. We included patients admitted between November 2007 and August 2009. Vasoactive drugs included dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin. The primary end point was survival to hospital discharge.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title><p>Sixty-six patients received 3 or more vasoactive drugs simultaneously. Nine patients (14%) survived to ICU discharge and 6 patients (9%) survived to hospital discharge. There was a significant difference in mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score II between survivors (32.3 ± 28.6) and nonsurvivors (72.1 ± 30.4), <italic>P</italic> = .003. Five of the 6 survivors had an acute cardiac procedure, either percutaneous cardiac intervention or heart transplantation. The 1 patient with septic shock who survived had surgery for a bowel perforation. All patients who survived received inotropic therapy (dobutamine).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with shock require judicious fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drugs to maintain cardiac output and tissue perfusion while the underlying cause is addressed. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock advise that vasoactive drugs be used to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg, with norepinephrine (NE) or dopamine (DA) being the first-line agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066612448738">1</xref>
</sup> Often, the use of 2 vasoactive agents as a combination has been recommended, such as the use of NE and dobutamine (DOB) for cardiogenic shock or the use of low-dose vasopressin (VP) in addition to NE for septic shock.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066612448738">1</xref>
</sup> However, there is little further guidance on what to do if the shock is still refractory. Though, the practice varies widely from center to center, we describe the use of multiple vasoactive drugs in patients with refractory shock and outcomes at our institution. Frequently, the question from families and clinicians alike is at what point is the prognosis so poor that further escalation is futile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0885066612448738" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston. The pharmacy database was searched for all patients admitted to an intensive care setting between November 2007 and August 2009. The following areas were considered intensive care settings: medical intensive care unit (MICU), surgical ICU (SICU), correctional care/Texas Department of Criminal Justice ICU (TDCJ ICU), and the coronary care unit (CCU). The TDCJ ICU is a mixed medical and surgical ICU for the prison population. UTMB was closed for over 3 months between September and December 2008, due to extensive damage by Hurricane Ike. Accordingly, the data represent ICU admissions over the course of approximately 18 months.</p>
<p>Patients who were at least 18 years of age and had medication orders for 3 or more vasoactive agents simultaneously were included in the study. No minimum length of time or dose of the agents was required for inclusion in the study. Vasoactive agents were defined as any intravenous agent administered to increase blood pressure and/or end-organ perfusion by an effect on the cardiac output or peripheral vascular resistance. Vasoactive agents included DA, DOB, epinephrine (EPI), NE, phenylephrine (PE), and VP.</p>
<p>After identification of the patients using the pharmacy database, the electronic medical records were reviewed by the study physician (B.D.W.) to ensure the patient met the study inclusion criteria. Patient who had orders for 3 or more vasoactive agents but did not actually receive the medications were excluded. Patient who did not receive all the agents simultaneously were also excluded.</p>
<p>Charts were reviewed for demographic data, admission unit, admission diagnosis, type of shock (septic, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and others), use of systemic corticosteroids, pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) use, transthoracic echocardiogram, and survival to ICU and hospital discharge.  In addition, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II scores were retrospectively calculated. The vasoactive agents used and the order of use were recorded. Of note, there was no established protocol for vasoactive drug administration, thus, the order, dose, and number of agents were at the discretion of treating physician.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Student <italic>t</italic> testing was used for comparing 2 continuous variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare more than 2 continuous variables, and the Fisher exact test was used to compare the nominal data. A p-value less than or equal to .05 was considered statistical significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0885066612448738">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 118 patients who received vasoactive drugs during the study period were identified from the pharmacy records. Of these, 9 were &lt;18 years, 21 received only 2 vasoactive drugs, and 22 did not receive 3 vasoactive drugs simultaneously and were excluded. The remaining 66 patients met the study criteria and were included in the study.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066612448738">Table 1</xref> presents the baseline demographics. Overall, 44% of the patients had septic shock, 35% had cardiogenic shock, 15% had hypovolemic shock, and 6% were others or combined shock. The patients were evenly split between the MICU (35%), SICU (30%), and TDC ICU (29%). Fewer patients receiving 3 or more vasoactive drugs were in the CCU (6%). The median SAPS-II scores were 39.5, 90.5, 91.2, and 57.5 for SICU, MICU, TDCJ-ICU, and CCU patients, respectively. In the study, 64% of the patients received 3 vasoactive drugs, 30% received 4 vasoactive drugs, and 6% received 5 vasoactive drugs. Patients who received more vasoactive agents had higher SAPS-II scores (3 agents 64.3, 4 agents 72.5, and 5 agents 79.9). Overall, NE (87% of patients), DA (83% of patients), and VP (78% of patients) were the most commonly used vasoactive agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885066612448738">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We further compared survivors to nonsurvivors and found survivors had a lower SAP-II score (32.3 vs 72.1, <italic>P</italic> = .003) and were more likely to be in the SICU. There was no significant difference in the use of vasoactive agents between survivors and nonsurvivors except that the use of DOB was more common among survivors, most of whom had cardiogenic shock (100% vs 43%, <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>
<p>Overall, 34 patients (52%) received systemic corticosteroids.  Patients were most likely to receive adjuvant steroid therapy in the SICU (80%) than in the MICU (35%), <italic>P</italic> = .005. However, there was no significant difference in steroid use between survivors and nonsurvivors. With regard to other adjunctive measures, a PAC was used in 15 (22.7%) patients and an echocardiogram was performed in 44 patients (63.6%) during their hospital stay. All 6 survivors had a PAC, while 9 (15%) of the nonsurvivors had a PAC. </p>
<p>Of the 6 patients who survived to hospital discharge, 5 required therapy with multiple vasoactive agents during periprocedure period for an acute cardiac intervention, such as left ventricular assist device placement, cardiac catheterization, or heart transplantation. Only 1 patient who received triple vasoactive agent therapy for septic shock survived, and this patient had surgical intervention for mesenteric ischemia and bowel perforation.</p>

<sec id="section4-0885066612448738">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Evidence to support the use of multiple vasoactive agents in management of refractory shock state is limited. Surviving Sepsis Guidelines advise the consideration of a fixed, low-dose VP infusion added to NE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066612448738">1</xref></sup> Multiple smaller studies have suggested that the use of VP may be beneficial in catecholamine-resistant shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066612448738">2</xref></sup>
<sup>-</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066612448738">5</xref></sup> In the recent Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) trial, the subgroup with a dose of less than 15 μg/min of NE had better outcomes with addition of VP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612448738">6</xref></sup> In addition, the use of DA or NE in conjunction with DOB has been recommended for cardiogenic shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066612448738">7</xref></sup>
<sup>-</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066612448738">9</xref></sup> Lastly, improved outcomes were seen in the trial on early goal-directed therapy, with the addition of DOB to patients with sepsis who have low central venous oxygen saturation despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066612448738">10</xref>
</sup> However, DOB was just one of the many interventions that were part of the protocol, thus it is unclear what effect DOB had to the positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Our study indicates that patients requiring 3 or more vasopressors have a poor outcome, and no one who received 4 or more vasopressors survived. Most of the survivors were patients with cardiogenic shock with the exception of 1 patient with a surgical cause of sepsis. These findings suggests that unless there is a specific intervention that could contribute to the reversal of the underlying shock, such as percutaneous cardiac intervention, heart transplantation, or source control surgery, addition of a third or fourth vasoactive agent is likely to be futile. Interestingly, all of the survivors received DOB, raising the possibility that searching for and treating a cardiogenic component of the shock may improve survival.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. While the ICU physicians generally followed the standard of care for management of shock, there was no standardized protocol in place during the study period. We did not have information as to whether other recommended therapies, such as early, appropriate fluid resuscitation, and timely antibiotic administration, were optimally performed in both survivors and nonsurvivors. In addition, information on the doses of vasoactive drugs used was not collected. It is possible that the addition of a second or third vasoactive agent was done without maximizing the dose of the preceding agent. Thus, patients who could have been adequately treated with fewer agents were included in the study. This would make our survival rate an overestimation and thus would not detract from the conclusion that adding a third agent after maximizing 2 other agents is likely to be futile. Alternatively, this study does not rule out the possibility that in certain instances, such as septic shock with signs of cardiac dysfunction (low central venous oxygen saturation), the use of 3 agents, at submaximal doses (NE at less than 15 μg/min, fixed dose VP, and DOB), may be beneficial.</p>
<p>A definitive answer to this question would require a randomized, controlled, superiority trial comparing a strategy of limiting patients to 2 vasoactive agents versus, allowing further escalation to 3 or more agents. While one can present an argument in favor of such a trial, it is unlikely to ever be performed, given ethical and practical concerns.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that in the setting of refractory shock, simultaneous requirement for 3 or more vasoactive agents is associated with an exceedingly poor prognosis. However, in patients where a source control surgery or immediate cardiac intervention can be performed, ongoing hemodynamic support with multiple vasoactive drugs is warranted.</p>
