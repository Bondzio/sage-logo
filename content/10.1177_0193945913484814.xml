<abstract>
<p>Spouses are the key in the recovery and coping of patients after a myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to examine changes in coping for spouses of post-MI patients over time. The study determined the contributions of a spouse’s demographic factors and of time since the MI to the changes in coping. A secondary data analysis from the Patients’ and Families’ Psychological Response to Home Automated External Defibrillator Trial was conducted. On average, older spouses coped better than younger spouses. Coping significantly decreased over time. The spouse’s coping decreased for spouses whose baseline coping was higher. Coping decreased more rapidly for spouses of patients who experienced an MI more recently. Patients and spouses need support to improve coping after an MI.</p>

<p>Coping strategies have cognitive and emotional aspects and occur when a stressful event arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913484814">Santavirta, Kettunen, &amp; Solovieva, 2001</xref>). After a cardiac event, significant others experience uncertainty and anxiety about a myocardial infarction (MI) and its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913484814">Jackson, McKinstry, &amp; Gregory, 2011</xref>). Psychological distress is closely associated with inappropriate coping use. Distressed spouses used significantly more negative coping strategies such as withdrawal and avoidance of the problem and had lower levels of family functioning than those spouses who were not distressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945913484814">O’Farrell, Murray, &amp; Hotz, 2000</xref>). Anxious and depressed partners of post-MI patients experienced poor coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913484814">Garnefski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913484814">Son, Friedmann, &amp; Thomas, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913484814">Son, Thomas, &amp; Friedmann, 2012</xref>). Spouses of patients with heart disease cope with stressors, including enduring the patient’s disability or death, child care and economic pressures, an unpredictable future, the patient’s emotional responses to the illness, and their own emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913484814">Hotz, Cazabon, O’Farrell, &amp; Robbins, 1991</xref>). Spouses of post-MI patients play a significant role in helping patients recover from the cardiac event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945913484814">McLean &amp; Timmins, 2007</xref>). The spouse’s inappropriate coping may influence negative health outcomes of the patient.</p>

<title>Factors Influencing the Coping Strategies in Spouses of Patients With Heart Disease</title>
<p>Previous studies of the relationship between the age of the spouse and the use of coping strategies produced inconsistent findings. In one study, older spouses of post-MI patients used more coping strategies and coped more effectively than younger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913484814">Yeh, Gift, &amp; Soeken, 1994</xref>), but a recent study showed older spouses tend to use more passive coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913484814">Santavirta et al., 2001</xref>). A qualitative study reported older spouses used spiritual conviction more frequently as a coping resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913484814">Salminen-Tuomaala, Åstedt-Kurki, Rekiaro, &amp; Paavilainen, 2012</xref>). In contrast, there were no age differences in coping scores for family members of critically ill Chinese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913484814">Chui &amp; Chan, 2007</xref>) or in specific use of coping strategies for relatives of patients in the intensive care unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913484814">Casarini, Gorayeb, &amp; Filho, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender did not influence the use of coping strategies in the early phase of a patient’s recovery from an MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913484814">Santavirta et al., 2001</xref>) or in family members of critically ill Chinese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913484814">Chui &amp; Chan, 2007</xref>). Male spouses of MI patients, however, used more problem-focused coping strategies than female spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913484814">Yeh et al., 1994</xref>). A qualitative study showed that coping experiences of female spouses included melancholy, tiredness, hopelessness, and fear of the patient’s death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913484814">Salminen-Tuomaala et al., 2012</xref>). No clear relationship of age or gender to changes in coping for spouses of post-MI patients is apparent from these studies.</p>
<p>Studies show that inappropriate coping strategies increase psychological and physical distress in spouses of patients with heart disease. Anxious and depressed spouses of post-MI patients experienced poor coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913484814">Garnefski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913484814">Son, Thomas, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913484814">Son, Friedmann, et al., 2012b</xref>). For patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft, those couples who used positive coping strategies (redefining the illness, seeking spiritual support, and adopting partnership) experienced better psychosocial outcomes compared with those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945913484814">Whitsitt, 2012</xref>). Spouses of critically ill patients who used more emotion-focused coping experienced more emotional and physical distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913484814">Nyamathi, Jacoby, Constancia, &amp; Ruvevich, 1992</xref>). Distressed spouses of cardiac patients used significantly more disengagement coping strategies such as withdrawal and avoidance of the problem than those who were not distressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945913484814">O’Farrell et al., 2000</xref>). The wives of post-MI patients who had very low anxiety over the whole period of 10 years used less denial coping styles, were more able to make plans for the future, and adjusted better to illness-related problems than other wives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913484814">Arefjord, Hallaraker, Havik, &amp; Maeland, 1998</xref>). Spouses using denial coping experienced increased hopelessness and depression over 12 months post MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913484814">Salminen-Tuomaala et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, psychological distress is associated with negative coping strategies.</p>
<p>The trajectory of heart disease requires patients and family members to continuously adjust in the acute and recovery phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913484814">Van Horn, Fleury, &amp; Moore, 2002</xref>). During early convalescence from a heart attack, patients and their partners experienced coping with changes, including adjustments to their lifestyles, a shift in roles, dealing with overprotection, and changes in family activities and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945913484814">Wang, Thompson, Chair, &amp; Twinn, 2008</xref>). Coping strategies of spouses of post-MI patients seem to be stable over time. A calm attitude toward MI at 4 months post MI was linked with a serene attitude at 12 months whereas the attitude of denial was maintained up to 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913484814">Salminen-Tuomaala et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Few studies have examined changes in coping over time for spouses of post-MI patients. Changes in coping of post-MI patients are better documented than those of spouses. For example, the patient’s coping did not change over time after an MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913484814">Kristofferzon, Löfmark, &amp; Carlsson, 2005</xref>). Similarly, in a longitudinal study of patients with traumatic brain injury, there was no significant change in use of task and avoidance-oriented coping strategies between 2 and 8 years after the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945913484814">Tomberg, Toomela, Ennok, &amp; Tikk, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Little is known about longitudinal changes in coping of spouses of post-MI patients. The aim of the study was to examine changes in coping for spouses of post-MI patients over time. The research questions were to examine whether (a) the total coping scores increase or decrease over 2 years in spouses of post-MI patients; (b) older age, male gender, increased baseline anxiety and depression, and lower baseline coping were related to decreased coping in spouses of post-MI patients; and (c) a shorter period of the time since MI decreased coping over 2 years in spouses of post-MI patients.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0193945913484814">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A secondary data analysis from the PRHAT (Patients’ and Families’ Psychological Response to Home Automated External Defibrillator Trial) was conducted to test the research questions. As a substudy of the HAT (Home Automated Defibrillator Trial) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913484814">Bardy et al., 2008</xref>), the PRHAT study was designed to compare the long-term effects of two interventions (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] training and CPR training plus automated external defibrillators [AED]) on psychosocial factors, including anxiety, depression, coping, and social support, in post-MI patient couples. As an international study, the PRHAT included 30 self-selected sites from four countries: Australia (12 sites), Canada (5 sites), New Zealand (2 sites), and the United States (11 sites). The parent study described the overall study methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913484814">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>). The present study examined spouse coping measured at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years for the outcome variable. The PRHAT data set included 460 couples. Each couple included a spouse or companion who lived with the patient and agreed to be trained in CPR or CPR and AED use. All participants signed a specific consent form for PRHAT. All spouses and patients were instructed to complete the consent form independent of each other. Nurse coordinators in the HAT study distributed the tools and were unaware of scores on the coping scales because all tools were sent to the principal investigator and scored by research assistants. Confidentiality in PRHAT was maintained by assessing a code number. No patient or spouse identification was on any of the forms.</p>
<p>The parent study showed that home AEDs did not influence changes in patients’ depression or anxiety or spouse depression as compared with the CPR group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913484814">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>). The present study’s purpose targeted spouses of post-MI patients, not focusing on the CPR and CPR/AED groups. Therefore, the data were not divided into the two groups as in PRHAT, but all analyses were adjusted for treatment group if necessary. The data set included individuals who were spouses or domestic partners. Excluded from the data set were siblings, children, and other relatives. The term <italic>spouses</italic> in this article only includes spouses and partners of patients who were cognitively intact.</p>

<sec id="section5-0193945913484814">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The instruments used for measurements have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913484814">Son, Friedmann, et al., 2012b</xref>). The ALFI-MMSE (Adult Lifestyles and Function Interview Mini Mental State Examination) was used for the exclusion criteria. For the present study, cognitive impairment was defined as a score of 17 points or less and spouses with those scores were excluded. The FCOPES (Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales) was used to measure spouse coping. The FCOPES is composed of 30 items that explain a choice of coping behaviors that individuals use in a stressful situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913484814">M. A. McCubbin &amp; McCubbin, 1987</xref>). The total score ranges from 30 to 150, and a lower total FCOPES score shows less coping strategies are used, which contributes to poorer adaptation. The FCOPES consists of five subscales including Acquiring Social Support, Reframing, Seeking Spiritual Support, Mobilizing Family to Acquire and Accept Help, and Passive Appraisal. For the present study, the total coping scores were significantly related to each time point: <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .714, between baseline and 1 year; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .647, between baseline and 2 years; and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .753, between 1 and 2 years. To assess baseline anxiety, the state portion of the STAI (State/Trait Anxiety Inventory) was used. The STAI is based on two facets of the theoretical conception of anxiety, which are the state scale and the trait scale. The state scale was developed to measure the transient state of arousal subjectively experienced as anxiety whereas the trait scale was designed to assess the more enduring characteristic presence of the emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945913484814">Spielberger &amp; Gorsuch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913484814">Spielberger, Gorsuch, &amp; Lushene, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913484814">Tluczek, Henriques, &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>). For this study, the state anxiety scores were significantly related to each time point: <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .524, between baseline and 1 year; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .470, between baseline and 2 years; and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .569, between 1 and 2 years. The BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory–II) was used to measure depression symptoms. The BDI assesses depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913484814">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>). For this study, the BDI scores were significantly related to each time point: <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .563, between baseline and 1 year; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .521, between baseline and 2 years; and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .704, between 1 and 2 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945913484814">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were completed. For longitudinal analysis, Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were used to test the aims using PASW SPSS 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, United States). Unconditional means models were tested for the dependent variable (total coping score) to provide a baseline model for comparison. Next, unconditional growth models were used to determine whether there was a significant change over time for the dependent variable. A third model included treatment, time, and the interaction between time and treatment group (0 = <italic>CPR only</italic>; 1 = <italic>CPR and AED use</italic>). For each of these models, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were examined to evaluate model improvement. Smaller values indicate better fitting models. Fixed and random effects were explored for a best model. Fixed models were examined first. Next, random effects were explored to see if the model improved prediction. Deviance tests (χ<sup>2</sup>) were conducted to compare nested models.</p>
<p>Prior to LMMs, normality tests were conducted for continuous variables. The dependent variable, spouse total coping score, was normally distributed. Spouse’s age and baseline coping scores were also normally distributed. Spouses’ baseline anxiety and depression scores were transformed to improve normality: natural log for baseline anxiety and square root for baseline depression. Time since MI was dichotomized as two levels based on a median split: experienced MI recently (less than 1.5 years) versus experienced MI long ago (more than 1.5 years).</p>
<p>The best models from the first research question were used as the basic models for the second and third research questions. Treatment was included in all models because of its centrality to the design.</p>

<p>Data were obtained from patients and spouses at sites in four countries: United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The commonality of variability in spouse coping within the four countries was examined with unconditional intraclass correlation criterion (ICC). Total coping among countries was 0.053 and was ignorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945913484814">Kreft, 1996</xref>), indicating that total coping scores were not nested within countries. Missing data analysis was conducted prior to the analysis of LMMs. Pattern mixture models were used to determine whether the missingness was random. The pattern mixture approach provides assessment regarding whether a model requires the missingness mechanism to be ignorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913484814">Hedeker &amp; Gibbons, 1997</xref>). Pattern mixture models indicated that data were missing at random or completely at random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484814">Son, Friedmann, &amp; Thomas, 2012a</xref>).</p>

For every year of the spouse’s age, the average coping score increased by 0.313, which indicated that older spouses coped better than younger spouses. The spouse’s gender did not predict total coping scores (parameter estimate = −2.721, <italic>t</italic> = −0.902, <italic>p</italic> = .367). The spouse’s age (parameter estimate = 0.028, <italic>t</italic> = 0.728, <italic>p</italic> = .467) and gender (parameter estimate = −0.274, <italic>t</italic> = −0.233, <italic>p</italic> = .816) did not interact significantly with time, which indicated that the changes in the total coping score did not depend on age or gender.</p>
<p>The spouse’s baseline anxiety was related to total coping. The best model included the spouse’s baseline anxiety, and it significantly improved the model fit as compared with the unconditional growth model for total coping, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 3) = 93.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The spouse’s baseline anxiety was significantly related to total coping (parameter estimate = −8.136, <italic>t</italic> = −2.252, <italic>p</italic> = .025). On average, coping was significantly worse for those who had higher baseline anxiety scores. However, the spouse’s baseline anxiety did not interact significantly with time (parameter estimate = 0.692, <italic>t</italic> = 0.490, <italic>p</italic> = .624), which indicated that the changes in total coping score did not depend on spouse’s baseline anxiety.</p>
<p>The spouse’s baseline depression was associated with total coping. The best model included the spouse’s baseline depression, and it significantly improved the model fit as compared with the unconditional growth models for total coping, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 3) = 79.918, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The spouse’s baseline depression was significantly related to coping (parameter estimate = −2.966, <italic>t</italic> = −3.548, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For every 1 point of increased depression, the average coping score decreased by 2.966, indicating that, on average, coping was significantly worse for those who had higher baseline depression scores. However, the spouse’s baseline depression did not interact significantly with time (parameter estimate = 0.410, <italic>t</italic> = 1.260 <italic>p</italic> = .208), which indicated that changes in total coping score did not depend on spouse’s baseline depression.</p>
<p>The best model included the spouse’s baseline coping, and it significantly improved the model fit as compared with the unconditional growth models for total coping, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 3) = 1441.689, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The spouse’s baseline coping was significantly related to coping (parameter estimate = 1.135, <italic>t</italic> = 24.728, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), which indicated that on average, coping was significantly better for those who had higher baseline coping scores. As 1 point of the baseline coping score increases, the overall total coping score increased by 1.135 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913484814">Table 2</xref>). There was a significant interaction between time and baseline coping scores. Coping decreased over time for spouses who had higher baseline coping scores, whereas coping was stable over time for those who had lower baseline coping scores (parameter estimate = −0.164, <italic>t</italic> = −7.228, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), which indicated that changes in total coping score depended on spouse’s baseline coping (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945913484814">Figure 1</xref>). Higher baseline coping was graphed at 1 standard deviation above the mean, and lower baseline coping was 1 standard deviation below the mean of the baseline coping score.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The experience of an MI is a source of stress for patients and their family members, and the cardiac event may be viewed as a family crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913484814">Van Horn et al., 2002</xref>). An MI influences family relationships and can disrupt family functioning and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913484814">Hildingh, Fridlund, &amp; Lidell, 2007</xref>). This study examined the longitudinal changes in coping of spouses of post-MI patients. We found that the total coping score significantly decreased over time for spouses of post-MI patients. On average, older spouses cope better than younger spouses. The average coping scores were lower for spouses who had higher anxiety or depression scores. Baseline coping scores contributed to the changes in coping, which indicated that coping decreased over time for spouses who had higher baseline coping scores. Coping decreased more rapidly over time for spouses of patients who experienced MI more recently.</p>
<p>The mean of the spouses’ total coping scores was relatively high (<italic>M</italic> = 98.61) as compared with the norm (<italic>M</italic> = 93.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913484814">H. I. McCubbin &amp; Thompson, 1991</xref>). This finding may be related to the good prognosis after the MI and that most patients (97%) had a mild degree of heart failure. Most patients had experienced the cardiac event a long time ago (median time since an MI = 1.5 years), which also may have contributed to the high coping scores. The spouse’s age did not contribute to the change in coping, but younger spouses had lower coping scores on average. The finding that older spouses cope better is consistent with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913484814">Yeh et al. (1994)</xref> study, but contradictory to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913484814">Chui and Chan (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913484814">Santavirta et al. (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913484814">Casarini et al. (2009)</xref>. This finding may be due to the difference in mean age (<italic>M</italic> = 44.9 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913484814">Chui &amp; Chan’s, 2007</xref>, study), the use of different instruments to measure coping (Folkman and Lazarus’s Ways of Coping Questionnaire was used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913484814">Santavirta et al., 2001</xref>), or the difference in study populations (patients intensive care unit in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913484814">Casarini et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, spouse gender was not associated with either overall coping or changes in coping. This finding is consistent with some cross-sectional studies of Chui and Chan and Santavirta et al. Another descriptive study found that male spouses coped better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913484814">Yeh et al., 1994</xref>), but the result is not comparable with the present study because of the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> of male spouses = 10) in Yeh’s study.</p>
<p>Higher spouse baseline anxiety and higher spouse baseline depression predicted lower overall coping scores. The findings of the relationship between lower coping scores and psychological distress were consistent with other studies that found that inappropriate coping was related to increased psychological distress in spouses of cardiac patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913484814">Garnefski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913484814">Son, Thomas, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913484814">Son, Friedmann, et al., 2012b</xref>). In the present study, the spouse’s psychological distress (anxious or depressed) did not contribute to changes in coping, which was contradictory to a qualitative study that spouses using denial coping experienced an increase in hopelessness and depression over 12 months post MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913484814">Salminen-Tuomaala et al., 2012</xref>). It may be related to the time elapsed since the MI or different sample size (28 vs. 442 spouses in the present study).</p>
<p>Coping significantly decreased over 2 years for spouses who had higher baseline coping scores (change in estimated coping score = 8.079), whereas coping stayed relatively the same for those who had lower baseline coping scores (change in estimated coping score = 2.213). The difference of changes in coping between the two groups may be explained by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913484814">Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984)</xref> model. According to the model, a stressful event requires coping to regulate distress. Spouses might adapt to the stressor over time. As a result, they might need to use less coping strategies.</p>
<p>There are several limitations in the present study. First, all participants were trained in CPR or in their use of defibrillator. The changes in coping may not be the same in post-MI patient couples who are untrained in resuscitation. In addition, most of the patients did not have symptoms of heart failure (NYHA Class I or II). The time since the most recent MI was 1.5 years. These three factors limit generalizability. In addition, the questionnaires measuring coping and psychological distress were based on self-report, which are simple and practical to measure at busy clinical settings but may overestimate or underestimate the findings. This study examined the changes in total coping scores. For any future study, the changes in different aspects or types of coping must be examined.</p>
<p>As a longitudinal study, this study shows the trajectories of changes in coping and the factors influencing the changes in coping for spouses of post-MI patients. This study included 442 patient couples in multiple sites in four countries and which included male and female spouses. Most of the participants experienced MI a relatively long time ago. Even in this population, coping decreased more rapidly for spouses of patients who experienced MI more recently. This finding indicates that the continuous assessment of coping should be immediately followed early after the MI. Attention should be paid to the spouses who experienced MI more recently.</p>
<p>Our study shows that spouses of post-MI patients have difficulty coping long after the cardiac event. Few studies have examined how to improve spouse coping. Most nursing interventions center on patient concerns and not on helping the spouse cope. Nurses can enhance spouses’ coping by reframing patient concerns as couple issues whenever feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945913484814">Martire, Schulz, Keefe, Rudy, &amp; Starz, 2008</xref>). Interventions targeting on couple issues with spouses and patients with osteoarthritis and pain increases spousal support and decreased symptoms of depression in the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945913484814">Martire, Schulz, Helgeson, Small, &amp; Saghafi, 2010</xref>). Meeting the needs of the patient and the spouse may improve communication and coping. Interviews of MI patient couples showed that the spouses focused on evaluating the MI as more positive in the absence of a poorer outcome whereas the patients focused on regaining control of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913484814">Panagopoulou, Triantafyllou, Mitziori, &amp; Benos, 2009</xref>). This supports our study findings of spouses’ difficulties in coping after an MI.</p>
<p>Nurses assess the physical and psychological needs of the patient after an MI. It is crucial to assess spouses coping after the event. The nurses could identify spouses who are coping poorly. Interventions including support groups and educational programs for spouses may be helpful to improve coping by modeling more positive coping strategies. Future research is needed to establish the specific coping strategies that are most beneficial when used by spouses. This would provide direction for future interventions.</p>
