<p>In 1998 I took my first venture into a virtual world, attracted by an online advertisement that read ‘experience graphical virtual reality in a place filled with hundreds of new towns and cities’. At the time I thought its thrill compared to the excitement of 19th century frontier America, and that such a place would make a solid foundation for the focus of a PhD. During my fieldwork I came across several almost impenetrable ethical quagmires. How do I gain informed consent from avatars? Is chat online public or private? How do I ensure participant anonymity in online spaces? How do I deal with a diverse cultural online population that is rapidly changing? At that time I could turn to very few articles and books that dealt with online ethics. So I did the best with what little I had. Of course, these once esoteric virtual worlds now sit comfortably next to the more mundane internet spaces such as websites and blogs. Yet the majority of social scientists remain relatively ill-at-ease with conducting research online. Difficulties of getting to grips with the technology aside, this trepidation has much to do with the mine-field of online ethics. Mckee and Porter’s book make this process somewhat less arduous.</p>
<p>For several reasons this book is essential reading for both students and academics that wish to delve into the murky waters of internet research. It is the first text on internet research ethics for five years. During this time many internet technologies have matured and several new have emerged complicating the ethical terrain for the social scientist. Mckee and Porter take the reader on a journey, showing how older internet technologies, such as text-based Multi-User Domains (MUDs) have given way to flashier, arguably more interactive and immersive virtual worlds. Similarly, they recognize how web pages have become increasingly interactive, populated with democratically produced content. This shift from Web1.0 (static non-democratically produced web content) to Web2.0 technologies (dynamic democratically produced content) has changed the research terrain considerably. In particular, the book makes specific reference to the ethics of researching social networking sites (such as Facebook and MySpace), which is ideal for the growing number of students who find them a tempting topic for dissertations. To ease the ethical navigation of these rapidly changing and technologically, socially and interactively complex online spaces the authors adopt a rhetorical case-based approach. Combined with a series of interviews with internet researchers the authors take the reader through the tricky process of ethical judgment in various contexts. However, the focus on grounded experience of internet research does not preclude the authors from delving into the complex arena of legal requirements and other relevant governance issues. The discussion of the ethics of intellectual property and copyright in online spaces is particularly illuminating, and should be part of any novice and established internet researcher’s ‘to read’ list.</p>
<p>The multiplicity of online contexts discussed in the case studies and interviews make the book relevant to scholars working in an array of disciplines and cultures. The global reach of the internet has always challenged researchers. When I first embarked on my fieldwork in a virtual world I came across a scantily clad female avatar whose user originated from Javea, Spain chatting to an avatar that resembled an American college jock, whose user originated from Utah. Their exchange was fraught with misunderstanding, which quickly resulted in both parties taking offense. For a moment I thought it may have been the mode of the interaction, but I quickly realized such misunderstandings were not uncommon between world visitors from different cultures. Virtual worlds are <italic>melting pots</italic> and it is the job of the internet researcher to navigate these and other multicultural online spaces with sensitivity. Mckee and Porter pay due attention to online diversity and their rhetorical case-based approach produces an authentic and authoritative voice on the issues.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of the text is the way in which theory and ethical frameworks are couched in the everyday practical experience of researchers in the field. This combination provides a perfect balance of ethical <italic>sophia</italic> and <italic>phronesis</italic>. A book of this quality and insight is long overdue. Increasing numbers of students and researchers are incorporating internet-based data collection into their research designs. Like few others, Mckee and Porter’s book demonstrates how to do this ethically with grounded examples from established internet researchers. I wish I had such a book back in 1998.</p>
