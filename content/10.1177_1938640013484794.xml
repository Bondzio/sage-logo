<abstract>
<p>Literature reports the incidence of failed isolated foot and ankle fusions as up to 23%. A contributing factor is the natural bone resorption, which occurs resulting in loss of compression and gapping at the fusion site when standard static compression plates and screws are used. However, an innovative dynamic compression screw may provide lasting compression despite resorption. This benchtop study shows that the FxDEVICES spring-loaded dynamic POGO screw maintains more compression and more consistent compression rate during simulated resorption, as compared with a standard compression screw. The novel screw maintained much greater compression strength within the first millimeter of simulated resorption (13.57 vs 4.38 lb) and maintained greater compression strength at the test completion (1.14 vs 0 lb). The novel screw revealed a more consistent resorption rate over the duration of the simulation. Clinically, this may result in more stability and improved fusion rates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Literature reports the incidence of failed isolated foot and ankle fusions as up to 23%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> A major contributing factor to failed fusions is bone resorption that occurs during the natural healing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> When traditional static fixation is employed, resorption results in loss of compression and stability, which leads to an increase in micromotion and gapping between the bone segments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013484794">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref></sup> However it is well known that compression creates conditions that are favorable for bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013484794">11</xref></sup> Therefore, what is needed is a device that will provide continuous dynamic compression at a fusion site despite resorption. It is hypothesized that the spring-loaded dynamic FxDEVICES POGO screw (FxDEVICES, Boca Raton, FL) will maintain more compression and minimize gap size during simulated resorption at the fusion site, as compared with a standard static compression screw.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1938640013484794" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method/Procedure</title>
<p>Maintenance of compression strength of a 7.0 predicate cortical screw and the novel dynamic compression screw during simulated resorption was measured and recorded. A fusion model was designed using 2 rigid, closed cell polyurethane foam blocks, with a density of 30 pounds per cubic foot stacked with a section of less dense foam 2 × 11 mm thick, 40 mm ×60 mm Styrofoam, placed in between.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013484794">12</xref></sup> A Tekscan compression monitoring device model 6220 (South Boston, MA) was placed between the ployurethane and Styrofoam components and measured the compression force for the duration of the experiment. The compression screws were then inserted through the models using the manufacturer’s described technique, and equal compression was applied, down to 0.5 cm at the Styrofoam level. The implant apparatus is then placed into an MTS 858 Mini Bionix ll to measure the distance of travel during the simulated bone resorption testing. To simulate osteoclastic bone resorption, 10 cm<sup>3</sup> of 100% acetone were injected into the Styrofoam using 2 separate 5-cm<sup>3</sup> syringes, over 1 minute, creating a dissolving reaction. The data were recorded for both compression and motion as related to time while the acetone was applied and the Styrofoam dissolved over the 1-minute period. The experiment was reproduced 6 times with the standard cortical screw and 6 times with the spring loaded compression screw to record accurate data points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013484794">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The novel dynamic compression screw outperformed the 7.0 static cannulated screw when comparing strength over simulated resorption (13.57 vs 4.38 lb) at 1 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640013484794">Figure 1</xref>). The novel screw also greater compression through the completion of the test (1.14 vs 0 lb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640013484794">Figure 2</xref>). It should also be noted that the novel screw also revealed a more consistent resorption rate over the duration of the simulated resorption. This indicates that the novel compression screw was able to maintain more compression across the simulated gap while the resorption occurred. This may translate into more compression being applied during the healing stages of bone repair.</p>

<p>Although the test was replicated several times, the data collection method yielded too much sampling noise to be used directly for interpretation. The data collected were then smoothed by applying a moving average method and then graphed. As such, there is not sufficient data to accurately determine standard deviations for the reported values. The reported values should be viewed in a qualitative manner and viewed as trending data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Applying compressive force across a fusion site enhances stable fixation, 1 of the 4 basic AO principles. Compression is conducive to primary bone healing largely because it maintains stability, minimizes motion, eliminates shearing and rotational forces, and maintains intimate bony contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013484794">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, Frost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640013484794">13</xref></sup> has shown that dynamic loads on bone actually stimulate remodeling whereas static loads do not. Therefore, more recent attempts have been made to develop fixation devices capable of providing dynamic compression.</p>
<p>During the first postoperative days and weeks, compression at a fusion site is strikingly diminished because of viscoelastic stress relaxation followed by bone resorption. One author states that within 2 weeks of surgery, 90% of initial compression is lost when standard static rigid fixation is employed due to mechanical creeping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been reported that resorption of only one cell layer thickness of bone (about 10 µm) results in clinically significant loss of compression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> At this present time, there is no literature which states the amount of bone resorption over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> This physiological process removes necrotic bone from the site very early in the healing process, during the first 2 weeks of healing whereas further decrease in compression is caused by the remodeling of the Haversion system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484794">14</xref></sup> The anatomical and physiological reasons for bone resorption at a fusion site include insufficient endosteum and periosteum bridging the gap, as well as the remodeling of the Haversian system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484794">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref></sup> Stripping of these structures inhibits osteoblastic activity during the process of joint fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref></sup> During the first 3 weeks postoperation, 0.5-mm thickness of periosteum forms; however, it undergoes resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013484794">15</xref></sup> These factors result in intermittent displacement or gapping of the contact surfaces and micro motion, which leads to gross instability and finally, clinical nonunion. Huber et al described the reasoning for loss of compression at the arthrodesis site leading to possible nonunion or malunion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> The joint capsule is not intended to create bone and lacks periosteum and endosteum. Once stripped at the joint for preparation of fusion, this leads to an insufficient amount of these structures thus inhibiting osteoblastic activity and increasing bone resorption.</p>
<p>Standard static internal fixation does not address the issue of resorption at fusion sites. Rigid internal fixation may serve to hold 2 opposing bony surfaces apart and actually prevent healing if significant resorption occurs. In other words, superfluous amounts of bone resorption increase the strain on the fixation device therefore causing the fixation to distract instead of ascertain compression thus leading to a nonunion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013484794">15</xref></sup> Eventually, in that situation the fixation will likely fail and all stability will be lost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484794">8</xref></sup> In the foot and ankle, fusions are often performed across relatively large joints in patients with poor bone density resulting in substantial resorption and large gap sizes. These factors, coupled with the foot being in dependency and often under weight-bearing loads and stresses, which results in micro- and macromotion, lead to high rates of nonunion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484794">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013484794">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The FxDEVICES POGO screw is designed with this high level of resorption-related complications in mind. The screw shaft is telescopic and houses an extension spring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640013484794">Figure 3</xref>). The screw is inserted with the shaft fully extended and with the spring under tension, respectively. After the screw is placed and initial manual static compression is achieved in the usual fashion, the insertion device is released, which loads the spring, thereby placing continuous dynamic compression across the fusion site.</p>

</fig>
<p>It follows that by employing the dynamic mechanism of compression inherent in the FxDEVICES POGO screw in vivo, bone healing may be enhanced by maintaining the stability needed. Under the described testing conditions, the novel dynamic compressive screw is certainly capable of generating higher compressive forces and allowing less gap formation over a site of simulated resorption. Clinically, this may result in better isolated foot and ankle fusions through decreased rates of nonunion. Clinical testing will be required to truly determine the POGO screw’s efficacy in foot and ankle surgery.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. This study only compared the difference between the novel screw to the standard 7.0-mm cortical screw. No other compressive devices such as staples, headless screws, intramedulary nail, or external fixation, were used for comparison.</p>
<p>Huber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> performed an in vitro study comparing the biomechanical efficiency of 3 cannulated screws for arthrodesis of the hindfoot. Compressive forces were measured in a 7.3-mm AO screw with and without a washer, a 6.5-mm Herbert screw, and a 6.5-mm ideal compression screw (I.CO.S) using different synthetic bone densities. The calculated work to reach 60 N compared with the AO screw with washer (100%) was I.CO.S (35.2%), Herbert (89.0%), and AO screw without washer (116%). Additional compressive force was applied because of the I.CO.S screw design, constructed with a screw nut at the proximal thread. Ogut et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640013484794">16</xref></sup> did a biomechanical comparison of external ring fixation to screw fixation for ankle arthrodesis. The study determined the difference in reliability in initial ankle joint fixation. Ankle arthrodesis was performed in 10 cadaveric legs initially testing the torsional stiffness of each joint fused with the external fixator. The fixators were then removed and the arthrodesis was tested using 6.5-mm cannulated screws. The results showed no statistically difference in both arthrodesis technique when it came to bending stiffness, torsional stiffness, and joint rotation. In comparing staples with cortical screws for triple arthrodesis, as studied by Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640013484794">17</xref></sup> on evaluating biomechanical characteristics were performed on 8 matched pairs of cadaveric feet. The 3 joints of 1 foot from the matching pair were arthodesed with cobalt-chrome staples and the other specimen with stainless steel screws. The liquid metal strain gauges were used to test the strength and eversion stress examination at each joint tested any displacement. There was no statistical difference in fixation strength between screws and staples for the triple arthrodesis (<italic>P</italic> = .862).</p>
<p>The POGO screw has been used in vivo; however, it has not been studied under these conditions or on cadavers. During this study, care was taken to not deform the screws and foam apparatus while in effort applying the maximum amount of compression; therefore limiting the amount comparable to cadaver studies. The benefit of using polyurethane foam is reproducibility of the mechanical performance of the compression screws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> To obtain accuracy, larger numbers of tests are needed to perform on cadaver bone because of the variation of density unlike the uniformity the synthetic bone presents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484794"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> Previous studies using polyurethane foam presented less than 10% of standard deviation because of its uniform properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref></sup> Synthetic bone can exhibit evident viscoelastic relaxation compared with cadaveric bone, which does not make the use of synthetic bone convenient for this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484794">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484794">3</xref></sup> Strength of the screws were not taken into consideration in this study when comparing compressive forces of the novel screw and the standard screw. However, the novel screw has demonstrated strength and fatigue characteristics equal to or greater than a substantial equivalent during Food and Drug Administration 510K clearance submission testing.</p>
<p>This study should assist physicians in understanding the amount of compression loss during the resorptive phase after foot and ankle fusion. Nonunion or malunion may result as a complication because of this issue; therefore, this novel device will decrease the amount of compressive loss during the healing process.</p>
