<p><italic>Most Welsh people buy London-based newspapers and there is also a worrying lack of local news in mainstream Welsh media</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In 1997, the Welsh voted by the wispiest of wafer-thin majorities to devolve important government decisions from Whitehall to Cardiff Bay. In 2011, an overwhelming majority of those voting decided that the law-making powers of the National Assembly should be extended. The media, though, can hardly have helped in the decision processes, since evidence shows Wales is barely mentioned in the national (for which read London-based) press, and network broadcasters give scant regard to events in the Principality. Perhaps more alarming is the fact most people in Wales −90 per cent-plus – do not consume Welsh-produced media products, preferring those London-based nationals where Wales is rarely mentioned and Welsh politics are not covered.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to explain this phenomenon. In 2008, the Institute of Welsh Affairs revealed the astonishing statistic that of 3.75m readers of newspapers in Scotland, barely 100,000 read papers without any Scottish content, while in Wales 1.76m read papers with zero Welsh content. That is an astoundingly high proportion, bearing in mind the Welsh population hovers around 3m. Broadcasting, too, has its problems when persuading people to think local. Along the North Wales coast, when Welsh-language TV channel S4C came on air in 1982, most aerials pointed to Winter Hill to pick up Granada TV and BBC1. In the South, aerials pointed to the Mendip transmitters. In Mid-Wales, offerings from Sutton Coldfield seemed to suit the majority. Geographical quirks also didn't help, with large areas of Flintshire and Wrexham, in the north east, receiving Central TV. Since choice has multiplied with the advent of digital TV, there's little evidence of an audience surge to consume domestic products. Figures show around one in six of the Welsh population watches the flagship Welsh news programmes on the BBC or ITV. As a result, the term “democratic deficit” has become a Welsh talking-point and is becoming a real and disturbing phenomenon.</p>
<p>Indeed, the debate over the future of Welsh broadcasting is increasingly coming round to <italic>demanding</italic> a Welsh broadcasting authority. While Welsh speakers are relatively well catered for – there are S4C and BBC Radio Cymru as national broadcasters – the number of programmes produced in English for the linguistic majority in Wales has dropped dramatically, with further cuts on the horizon, and Welsh political coverage bearing the brunt.</p>
<p>The former controller of BBC Wales and chief executive of S4C Geraint Stanley Jones recently suggested broadcasters are now less accountable to the people of Wales than they were pre-devolution. At present, broadcasting regulation is a non-devolved power, so decisions about Welsh broadcasting are taken in Westminster. Add to that the consolidation of commercial radio stations under brands such as Real, Heart or Capital, and Welshness is being squeezed out of the system. Jones suggested the National Assembly should have a formal role in scrutinising BBC Wales, ITV Wales and S4C as well as commercial radio stations. He called for a “broadcasting council with teeth that can safeguard the interests of viewers and listeners in Wales”.</p>

<title>Shambo the bull got greater coverage</title>
<p>An example of the indifference of the UK press regarding Wales came out in a study undertaken by Professor Anthony King and the Cardiff University School of Journalism into the coverage of the 2007 Assembly elections – the Welsh general election, effectively – which showed that only two London newspapers covered the event. <italic>The Independent</italic> noted it had taken place, in an in-brief story on an inside page two days after polling. <italic>The Sun</italic> also mentioned the fact, largely on the back of the story of Shambo the bull, a sacred animal at a Hindu establishment in West Wales that was facing being put down after contracting bovine TB. King also noted that the BBC's main 6pm and 10pm bulletins talked more about Shambo than Welsh political events.</p>
<p>Today, no London newspaper has a correspondent based in Cardiff Bay, relying rather on Press Association correspondents to provide their scant coverage. Indeed, national papers do not have anyone based anywhere in Wales. The last to base staff in Wales was the <italic>News of the World</italic>, yet as recently as the 1980s, the NUJ noted its Cardiff Branch had half a dozen members employed by London papers. Some broadcasters also sell Wales short. Sky News has no Welsh correspondent – though it does have for Scotland and Ireland. Sky's West of England correspondent covers South Wales. West, Mid- and North Wales appear to be cast adrift.</p>
<p>All this rather flies in the face of the struggle Wales has endured to gain a national identity. When Professor Gwyn Alf Williams wrote his book <italic>When Was Wales?</italic> in the mid-1980s – which coincided with his acclaimed series for HTV <italic>The Dragon Has Two Tongues: A History of the Welsh</italic> – the struggle seemed to be trying to establish whether Wales was a nation at all.</p>
<p>In 1979, the Welsh decisively rejected devolution in a referendum held, ironically, on St David's Day. Barely 10 weeks later, Margaret Thatcher swept into Downing Street and devolution was firmly off the agenda. The sheer size of the Conservative vote in Wales was significant. In 1979, they polled 35 per cent of the vote and held 11 constituencies. By 1983, the number of Welsh Tory MPs peaked at 14 out of 38 seats in the Principality. Labour, which rather took Wales for granted, held only seven more seats.</p>
<p>The unexpected Conservative win in 1992, plus the renewed zeal of the Nationalists (their vote surged in the 1994 European elections) meant that Labour needed to offer some form of electoral carrot to the Welsh. So it was that Scotland and Wales were offered referenda on devolution. The vote, in September 1997, was practically a foregone conclusion in Scotland but in Wales, things were nail-bitingly different and it was not until the very last declaration from Carmarthen that the tiniest majority of those voting (just about half of the electorate) favoured the founding of the Welsh Assembly.</p>
<p>The National Assembly seemed to be the next step for a nation where the trappings of nationhood had been developing over the century or so before the decisive referendum. The University of Wales received its Royal Charter in 1893. Both the National Library and National Museum received their Charters in 1907. The Anglican Church in Wales was formally disestablished in 1920, a year after the Welsh Board of Health was formed. A Welsh department at the Board of Education had been formed as early as 1907, followed by a similar department at the Ministry of Agriculture in 1919. The post of Secretary of State for Scotland had been recreated in 1885 but, despite hopes being raised many times, the first Secretary of State for Wales, James Griffiths, was appointed only in October 1964. By that time, Cardiff had been recognised as the capital (in 1955) and the Welsh Grand Committee had been formed (in 1960).</p>
<p>Through the 19th century, a vibrant Welsh press developed. By the middle of the century, smaller towns like Caernarfon and Blaenau Ffestiniog could boast 10 or more magazines and newspapers being published within their boundaries, while places such as Swansea and Cardiff were publishing centres of considerable influence. This publishing phenomenon went beyond Wales, to places like Liverpool and London, even New York and Philadelphia. Yet when broadcasting came along, the BBC dragged its heels and referred to both Scotland and Wales as national regions. Sir John Reith resisted attempts to broadcast in Welsh; Wales was not seen as a viable broadcasting entity and would need to be linked to the West of England (something which existed until very recently in the ITV regional structure). It was not until 1937, and after much heated argument, that Wales could transmit programmes – in either English or Welsh – on its own wavelength.</p>

<title>Scotland, by contrast, has a defined national press</title>
<p>However, it could be argued that it is journalism which contributed most significantly to the creation of a Welsh identity and a Welsh nation. The proliferation of 18th and 19th century periodicals, (highly influential papers in their day) such as the <italic>Western Mail</italic>, and the contribution of BBC Wales, made the country stand out as different. But now, with alarmingly few people consuming journalism created within the Principality (other than Welsh language journalism), things are different.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to Scotland where there's a defined national press and London papers produce Scottish editions. The only London paper which attempted a Welsh edition was the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic>, which abandoned its experiment in failure in 2003. The two morning papers published in Wales do not cover all the country. The <italic>Daily Post</italic>, published in Llandudno Junction after leaving its long-time Liverpool home in 2003, circulates widely in North and Mid Wales, while the <italic>Western Mail</italic>, supposedly the national newspaper of Wales, is largely a South and West Wales paper, though it takes an all-Wales view on major issues. The <italic>Daily Post</italic>‘s circulation hovers just above 30,000 but the <italic>Western Mail</italic> had collapsed to just 24,435 in August 2012. As recently as 35 years ago, the <italic>Western Mail</italic> sold nearly 100,000 a day. Its sister paper, the <italic>South Wales Echo</italic>, now sells 30,178, down from 120,000 in the 1970s. Many now fear the <italic>Western Mail</italic> could become a weekly, following other Trinity Mirror titles, such as the <italic>Liverpool Daily Post</italic> and the <italic>Birmingham Post</italic>.</p>
<p>Although only three out of the five daily newspapers published in Wales have Assembly-based correspondents, both morning papers have a presence. Welsh-based broadcasters dedicate considerable forces to reporting the Assembly and, according to a further report from the Cardiff School of Journalism, there has, of late, been an increase in news items relating to the devolved legislatures on BBC network news programmes. Yet all is not necessarily well on the broadcasting front. The BBC's “Delivering Quality First” agenda saw radical cuts to political coverage, and continued pressures on ITV Wales undermine a commitment to localised political coverage. This could have serious consequences since national network coverage is patchy with regard to Wales when reporting devolved matters such as health and education, where it is rarely recognised that Westminster's decisions regarding these matters refer only to England. The same is the case for the London papers. When the <italic>Daily Mail</italic> indignantly announced the Scots were to have free prescriptions, the Welsh shrugged their shoulders in the knowledge that it was already the case in Wales and had been so for some time.</p>
<p>Trinity Mirror further enraged Welsh politicians and journalists by announcing the closure of features desks at newspapers around the country, concentrating their efforts on a new operation in Liverpool. Plaid Cymru's media spokesman Alun Ffred Jones suggested “stripping out local features content in favour of generic UK-wide content will undoubtedly affect the appeal of the newspaper to Welsh readers. For example, if a health feature is going to be written in England, will it take into account the fact that responsibility for the NHS has been devolved to Wales?”</p>
<p>Many solutions to this particular Welsh problem are suggested. One is a Wales-wide broadcasting authority with powers devolved from Westminster. Another is the establishment of a daily all-Wales newspaper. But is that viable given that newspaper sales appear to be in freefall and local papers are merging? Trinity Mirror recently merged three Denbighshire titles into one, with much content shared with the <italic>Daily Post</italic>, thus undermining the strength of the local papers in that community. Valleys communities have seen reporting staffs greatly reduced (in 1999, <italic>Media Wales</italic>, formerly the <italic>Western Mail and Echo</italic>, had 700 editorial and production staff, a figure which has now dropped to 130). Significant towns such as Port Talbot and Neath have seen newspapers close.</p>
<p>There could be more digital TV stations. But who pays? Maybe outlets will drift towards social media. Or newspapers may go on-line only, relying on citizen journalists to contribute. What then of the democratic deficit?</p>
<p>Difficult questions need radical answers. Otherwise Wales risks being governed by people ever-more distant and out of touch with an electorate which will know nothing of what their representatives are doing on their behalf. But they will be incredibly well-informed about what's happening elsewhere.</p>
