<title>Background:</title>
<p>Breast milk composition can be affected by several factors, and it can exhibit short-term (weekly) variations. Investigating variations in breast milk composition is important to accurately estimate nutrient requirements of the infant.</p></sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412470213">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To investigate short-term changes in breast milk composition between left and right breasts, over a 3-week period within the first 6 months of lactation.</p></sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412470213">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The left and right breasts of the mothers of healthy, term infants (n = 23) were simultaneously expressed with an electric breast pump for 15 minutes, on 3 occasions within 3 weeks. Milk samples (5 mL) were collected from the total expression volume of each breast at each session. The macronutrient contents, total solids, and energy content were determined using a mid-infrared human milk analyzer. Mothers (n = 17) measured their 24-hour milk production, and the average 24-hour fat contents were also determined.</p></sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412470213">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Over the 3 weekly sessions, no significant changes were found in macronutrient contents. On average, total solids (<italic>P</italic> = .04) and energy (<italic>P</italic> = .04) decreased by week 3 of follow-up sessions from 14 to 13 g/100 mL and from 82 to 76 Kcal/100 mL, respectively; however, these changes became insignificant when expression volume was taken into account. The macronutrient concentration was similar for the left and right breasts; however, milk composition varied markedly between mothers. Furthermore, average 24-hour fat content was significantly lower than the mean fat content from a single expression session (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p></sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334412470213">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Our findings highlight that when determining the nutritional adequacy of a mother’s milk, assuming an average concentration requires caution. The study findings illustrate the importance of using average 24-hour fat content of milk to obtain representative measures of infant energy intake.</p></sec>

<title>Newly Expressed</title>
<p><italic>This study was designed to characterize the short-term (weekly) variations in breast milk macronutrient composition within and between mothers.

</sec>
<sec id="section8-0890334412470213">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Wide variations have been reported in the concentration of energy-yielding macronutrients (ie, fat, protein, and lactose) in breast milk both within and between individual mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412470213">2</xref></sup> Breast milk composition is affected by several factors including length of pregnancy, mother’s diet, stage of lactation, changes during a feed, and time of day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412470213">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412470213"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412470213">5</xref></sup> Protein concentration has been shown to decrease in the early stages of lactation, whereas fat content decreases and then increases as lactation progresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref></sup> In addition, a 2- to 3-fold change has been observed in the fat content of human milk over the course of a breastfeed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412470213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412470213">6</xref></sup> which accounts for the high variability observed in the energy content of human milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412470213">7</xref></sup> Therefore, all levels of variation should be taken into account to accurately determine the nutrient content of milk.</p>
<p>Most previous studies investigating macronutrient variation in term human milk are based on milk samples obtained during early lactation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412470213">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412470213">9</xref></sup> Only a few investigators have analyzed milk samples from late lactation, and to our knowledge, no study has investigated the week-to-week macronutrient variation in established lactation despite the reports of acute changes in milk composition during this period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412470213">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412470213">11</xref></sup> In addition, considerable variation in breast milk volume was found between individual mothers and at different stages of lactation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412470213">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412470213">13</xref></sup>; however, little information is available regarding the influence of variations in breast milk volume on breast milk composition.</p>
<p>Since breast milk composition is not uniform, the variability in breast milk composition could potentially influence the volume of milk consumed by the breastfed infant, either at each breastfeed or during the day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412470213">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412470213">15</xref></sup> Therefore, increasing our understanding of the factors responsible for the variation in breast milk composition may help explain the different feeding patterns in breastfed infants. Furthermore, without sufficient information regarding the variation in milk composition, it is difficult to recommend the appropriate method of milk sample collection for measurement of milk constituents to estimate infants’ nutrient requirements and energy intake.</p>
<p>This study aimed to develop a better understanding of the time-dependent variations in human milk composition during established lactation. We analyzed the macronutrients, total solids, and energy in term milk samples over a 3-week period within the first 6 months of lactation, and if the mother continued breastfeeding, at 6, 9, and 12 months of lactation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section10-0890334412470213">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Twenty-three mothers of healthy term infants participated in this study. Mothers were recruited through the West Australian branch of the Australian Breastfeeding Association and the Child and Adolescent Community Health Nurses in the Oceanic Region.</p>
<p>Breast milk samples were collected on 3 occasions over a 3-week period within the first 6 months of lactation. Some mothers also provided 1 or more additional samples at 6 (n = 7), 9 (n = 7), or 12 (n = 4) months. Participating mothers were also asked to measure their 24-hour milk production. All mothers provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of The University of Western Australia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0890334412470213">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Mothers performed a 15-minute simultaneous expression of left and right breasts using two separate electric breast pumps (Symphony, Medela AG, Switzerland) on 3 occasions within 3 weeks and repeating a single session at 6, 9 and 12 months, at the Breastfeeding Centre at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Subiaco, Western Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412470213">16</xref></sup> Milk samples were collected at each session from each breast at the beginning (pre, 1-2 mL), middle (mid, 5 mL), and end (post, 1-2 mL) of the expression session. The total volume of milk expressed during each session was recorded.</p>
<p>Samples were transported on ice to the laboratory, where they were stored at -20°C until further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0890334412470213">
<title>Mid-Infrared Analysis</title>
<p>As described previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412470213">17</xref></sup> a mid-infrared human milk analyzer (HMA; Miris AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to determine the macronutrient (protein, fat, and lactose), total solids, and energy content of the breast milk.</p>
<p>Mid milk samples (5 mL), collected from the total expression volume of each breast from each expression session, were used to analyze the macronutrient and energy content. Prior to analysis, all samples were thawed, warmed to 40°C in a digital water bath, and homogenized (1.5 seconds per 1 mL of sample) using an ultrasonic processor VCX130 (Sonics &amp; Material, Newton, Connecticut, USA). Then a 2-mL sample was injected into the HMA for analysis using the HMA calibration mode of processed (homogenized) milk. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.</p>
<p>The interassay coefficient of variation (CV) for fat, protein, lactose, and total solids was 4.4% (SD 0.1%), 4.4% (SD 0.1%), 3.0% (SD 0.2%), and 3.1% (SD 0.3%), respectively (n = 50).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0890334412470213">
<title>Twenty-Four-Hour Milk Production Measurements</title>
<p>Mothers measured their 24-hour milk production by weighing their baby before and after each feed, for each breast, using an electronic scale (Baby Weigh Scale, Medela AG). Mothers recorded the volume taken by the infant at each feed from each breast. Test weighing was done at each mother’s home for a period of 24-28 hours, and the measurements were later corrected to 24 hours, with no correction made for infant insensible water loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412470213">18</xref></sup> In addition, mothers collected and froze the small (1-2 mL) milk samples into 5-mL propylene vials (Disposable Products Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) before (pre) and immediately after (post) each weighing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0890334412470213">
<title>Creamatocrit Analysis</title>
<p>The cream and fat content of all the milk samples collected during expression sessions and those collected during the 24-hour milk production study was also measured by the creamatocrit method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412470213">19</xref></sup> using the Creamatocrit Plus device (Medela, Inc, McHenry, Illinois, USA). Cream content of the milk is related to degree of breast fullness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412470213">20</xref></sup>; therefore, the measurement of cream content in the samples was used to calculate the initial degree of fullness of each breast, for each expression session,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412470213">21</xref></sup> and the amount of milk available in the breast before expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412470213">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mean 24-hour fat content was determined as described by Mitoulas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref></sup> Briefly, pre- and post-feed milk fat contents were averaged to provide the fat content for each feed. The amount of fat consumed by the infant at each feed was then determined from the volume of the feed. The sum of the amount of fat for all feeds and the total volume consumed over the study period was then used to determine an average 24-hour fat content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0890334412470213">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the R program, version 2.7.2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412470213">23</xref></sup> The package nlme was used for linear mixed-effect modeling 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334412470213">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Milk intake variables (24-hour milk production of each breast) were compared using the paired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. The differences between macronutrient concentrations across the 3-week period were tested using linear mixed-effect models with the inclusion of week as a factor and with 2 possible random effects, the effect of mother, and breast within mother. Models were run for the explanatory variable (weekly interval) and for each response variable (fat, protein, lactose, total solids, energy, and volume expressed). The difference between the mean fat content at a single expression session and the mean 24-hour fat content was also tested using linear mixed-effect models.</p>
<p>To test for similarities and differences in milk composition between the left and right breasts, the absolute difference between breasts at each sampling point was calculated for each of the composition variables, and then linear mixed-effect models were used to test whether the differences were significantly different from zero. There were some missing values in the data (the complete 6-sample set was not obtained from 7 of the mothers); these missing data were taken into account in the analysis.</p>
<p>Owing to the scarcity of follow-up data at 6, 9, and 12 months, analysis was restricted to separately comparing each follow-up time point with the initial data for that subset of mothers, using a linear mixed-effects model with composition as the response, and time factor as the predictor. In addition, lattice plots were created to determine any longitudinal differences in these mothers’ milk composition.</p>
<p>Univariate relationships between expression variables (volume expressed, degree of breast fullness, available milk in the breast, and percentage of available milk removed) and milk composition were tested with linear mixed-effects modeling.</p>
<p>All values are reported as mean ± standard deviation, unless otherwise stated. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>All infants (n = 23) were fully breastfed on demand. The median age was 2.4 months (range, 0.9-5.6 mo), and most were male (n = 17). The mean age of the participating mothers was 33 ± 3.0 years (range, 28-39 y), and most were primiparous (n = 16, 70%). Of the 23 mothers participating in this study, 17 measured their 24-hour milk production. The mean 24-hour milk intake of the infants was 722 ± 136 g (range, 467-921 g), and there was no significant difference between the 24-hour milk production between the left (370 ± 109 g; range, 138-522 g) and right (352 ± 121g; range, 85-583 g) breasts.</p>

<title>Milk Composition over Time and between Breasts</title>
<p>The results of the biochemical analysis of macronutrient composition in milk samples over the 3-week period are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412470213">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To understand the time-dependent variations in milk composition, this study reports on changes in breast milk composition during established lactation on 3 occasions within 3 weeks in mothers of term infants. The milk production and intake characteristics of participating mother–infant pairs were variable, but the milk production of all participants was within the normal range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412470213">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Changes have been reported in breast milk composition in relation to growth and development of the infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412470213">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412470213">26</xref></sup> Protein concentration has previously been reported to decrease with the progress of lactation, rapidly during the first month and then slowly until 6 months, and it then remains relatively constant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412470213">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334412470213">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334412470213">28</xref></sup> Similarly, a rapid increase in lactose concentration was reported in the first few days of lactation, after which the lactose concentration remained constant throughout the first year of lactation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412470213">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334412470213">27</xref></sup>; however, fat content decreases and then increases over the course of lactation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref></sup> Our study showed that there were no changes in protein or lactose concentrations in the short term (across a 3-week period), which is similar to previous reports of no circadian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref></sup> and within-feed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412470213">6</xref></sup> variations in these macronutrients. Although fat content is more variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412470213">29</xref></sup> and can vary within a feed and diurnally,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412470213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334412470213">30</xref></sup> no significant changes (only a decreasing trend at the third week) were observed in fat content in the short term (across a 3-week period), whereas short-term changes in total solids and energy content were related to the expressed milk volume. Furthermore, changes observed in samples collected during the follow-up visits at 6, 9, and 12 months were similar to those previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412470213">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>These results showed that unlike early and late stages of lactation, which are characterized by considerable alterations in the composition, during established lactation, breast milk composition is not sensitive to short-term variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412470213">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we did not find significant differences in any of the measured macronutrients (fat, protein, and lactose) between milk from the left and right breasts, some mothers (n = 5) did have consistent between-breast differences in protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334412470213">Figure 2</xref>). This variation was linked to the volume of milk expressed from each breast; each mother had 1 breast that expressed at least 25% more milk than the other at all 3 weekly intervals, and this higher expression volume was associated with lower milk protein content. This negative association between protein concentration and expression volume may be caused by a dilutional effect resulting from increased milk production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334412470213">31</xref></sup> The individual differences and the similarity in milk composition between the left and right breasts suggest that milk synthesis and secretion are controlled by both local (autocrine) and systemic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412470213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334412470213">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334412470213">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The relationship that exists between the fat content of milk and the degree of breast fullness has previously been established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412470213">20</xref></sup> It has been shown that the increase in fat content over the course of a feed is related to the degree of breast emptying; in other words, the fat content increases steeply as the breast is emptied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412470213">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412470213">20</xref></sup> In showing a negative association between fat content and degree of fullness, the present study is in agreement with these prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334412470213">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334412470213">34</xref></sup> However, for 8% (n = 10 samples) of the pairs of pre- and post-milk samples in this study, the higher fat content was observed in pre-milk as compared to post-milk. This difference in the changes in fat content between pre- and post-milk might be a result of the differences in either degree of fullness among mammary lobes or inconsistent emptying of various sectors of the breast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412470213">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334412470213">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Variation observed in the total solids and energy content of milk needs to be considered with the fact that fat is the major contributor to these components and provides up to 50% of infant energy requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412470213">29</xref></sup> Therefore, these variables are not independent of each other and showed the same pattern of variation as in fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0890334412470213">Figure 3</xref>). This finding needs to be considered when interpreting these variables, that is, the same variability and influencing factors will be found for total solids and energy content as the fat. However, our results indicate that protein and lactose levels are not affected by degree of breast fullness and other expression characteristics, and therefore, these factors do not need to be considered when measuring these components.</p>
<p>The mean 24-hour fat content and protein and lactose concentrations in the present study are similar to those reported by other investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412470213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412470213">29</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334412470213">35</xref></sup></sup> The large difference in mean fat content between the single expression session and over the 24-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0890334412470213">Figure 4</xref>) indicates variation in the pattern of emptying of the breast. Infants empty the breast to a varying extent throughout the day, presumably according to their appetite. Therefore, to accurately estimate the mean fat content of a mother’s milk and infant energy intake, it is important to determine the fat content from each feed from each breast over the day.</p>
<p>This study highlighted the variability in breast milk composition between mothers, and consequently, the average macronutrient content that they supply to their infants. Of the 3 major macronutrients (fat, protein, and lactose), the highest variation was observed in fat content compared to protein and lactose (CV of 34%, 19%, and 5%, respectively). Limitations of the study are the small number of mothers participating in follow-up sessions at different stages of lactation, as well as the limited descriptive (such as absence of body mass index) data from these mothers. The anthropometric data of the mothers could be helpful in explaining the inter-individual differences in the milk macronutrient concentration observed in this study.</p>
<p>The differences in milk composition between mothers support the idea that each mother’s milk is unique and likely suited to the needs of her own infant. Therefore, assuming an average concentration to determine the nutrient and energy intake of individual breastfed infants requires caution, especially when recommending earlier, complementary feeding for infants based on their growth rate without knowing the actual composition of their mother’s milk. Furthermore, the variation observed in breast milk composition between mothers may relate to the individual feeding patterns observed in mother–infant dyads, but this hypothesis requires further investigation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, no short-term (week-to-week) variations were observed in breast milk composition during established lactation. Therefore, when sampling for nutritional studies, it is not necessary to account for these weekly variations. However, we found that the mean 24-hour fat content was consistently lower than the mean fat content from a single expression session by approximately 13 g/L. This finding highlights that to estimate the average fat content of the milk consumed by the infant during the day, determining the fat content of milk samples collected over 24 hours is a valuable method to obtain representative measures of infant energy intake.</p>
