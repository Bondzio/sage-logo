<p>We are excited to see the publication of this Special Issue consisting of selected articles that were presented at the 2011 International Workshop on Piezoelectric Materials and Applications (IWPMA) and 6th Annual Energy Harvesting Workshop (EHW), held at The Hotel Roanoke and Conference Center, Roanoke, Virginia, from 7 to 11 August 2011. The co-location of these two established international meetings brought together leading researchers from across the disciplines on one platform. The focus of the joint meeting was “energy.” The symposia provided in-depth information on the application of smart materials with a focus on energy-related issues. Presentations for the 6th Annual EHW concentrated on the following topics: (1) energy harvesting (piezoelectric, inductive, photovoltaic, electret, and thermoelectric), (2) microbatteries and ultracapacitors, (3) wireless networks for structural health monitoring, and (4) bio-inspired energy generation and conversion. In-depth research discussions were held on topics such as current progress and challenges in vibration harvester design and fabrication, thick- and thin-film material synthesis, three-dimensional (3D) deposition techniques, energy conversion devices, micro-/nanoelectronics, electrochemical storage systems, sensor development, integrated hybrid architectures, computational and theoretical modeling, and nanoscale fabrication techniques. The mixture of academic and industrial presentations provided information on the cutting-edge research taking place in the laboratories and on the progress made in transitioning of laboratory research into practical domain. The articles included in this issue were edited with the same quality standards as for regular issue articles, following the standard reviewing and revision processes of the <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures.</italic></p>
<p>Annual EHW series was founded in the year 2006 with the objective of identifying the challenges in launching and integrating the energy harvesting products. Most of the presentations in this workshop are from the industry with a good mix of speakers from academia and federal laboratories. First and second EHW was held in Fort Worth, Texas, in January 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 (24–27 February), the EHW was held in Eldorado Hotel, Santa Fe, New Mexico, in conjunction with International Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics (ISAF). In 2009, the EHW was held in The Inn, Blacksburg, Virginia, and in 2010, it was held in Hotel Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia. Despite economic slowdown, the EHW has continued to grow over the years, indicating the promise of this field. In these last 5 years, energy harvesting has become the key to the future of wireless sensor and actuator networks for a variety of applications, including monitoring of temperature, humidity, light, and location of a person in the building; chemical/gas sensor; structural health monitoring; powering accelerometers, strain gauge, and pressure sensors; and traffic signal lighting. As a result of strong industrial participation, the recently formed National Science Foundation Industry–University Collaborative Research Center, “Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems” (CEHMS), has continued to grow and expand. CEHMS is the main host of the EHW series. The 8th annual EHW is scheduled to be held from 14 to 18 July 2013, in Hannover, Germany (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sites.me.vt.edu/cehms/">http://www.sites.me.vt.edu/cehms/</ext-link>). The topics covered in the workshop will include, but will not be limited to, the following.</p>
