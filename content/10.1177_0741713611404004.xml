<p>As a mini encyclopedia, or pocket guide, this book is great. In this work, the author compiles a selection of contemporary learning theories as written by the primary authors (their creators). Each chapter provides a modern take on learning theories. It includes both previously published material (book chapters or articles) revised for this book by the original 17 theorists or stem from conference presentations.</p>
<p>The editor of this work chose contemporary theorists whose works and ideas appeared after 1990. These theorists conceptualized learning broadly and did not confine their ideas about learning solely to the ageing or maturing process. In doing so, the book appeals to a wide audience but does avoid extremist theories.</p>
<p>A brief introduction of the theorists at the chapter beginning gives the reader a better feel of what each chapter includes if you wish to use their approach. The theorists chosen to be included in this book are as follows. Knud Illeris, who is also the editor, presents his ideas on how adults learn to include several dimensions of learning, barriers to learning, and internal/external learning conditions. Peter Jarvis’s chapter is an expanded version of a presentation he gave relating to learning to be a person in society. It discusses the role the environment plays in learning. Robert Kegan’s chapter comes from a previous publication and discusses learning as a transformation and is creatively introduced as a dialogue between people.</p>
<p>Yrjö Engeström’s chapter comes from a published article regarding his thoughts on activity theory and specifically expansive learning. He suggests that learning is not an upward process but instead multidimensional. Bente Elkjaer discusses her interpretation of the works of John Dewey. Jack Mezirow discusses the history and concepts of transformative learning. Howard Gardner’s section discusses multiple intelligences with regard to learning to include transformative learning, critical pedagogy, and dimensions of adult knowing. Howard Gardner’s chapter is a reprint of a previously published book chapter and delves into how learning and education relate to his work on multiple intelligences.</p>
<p>Peter Alheit provides a biographical perspective to the understanding of learning. John Heron’s chapter comes from a compilation of a book and relates to his thoughts on life cycles and learning cycles. Mark Tennant’s chapter is a revision of a published article regarding how an individual looking internally can create change, as related to adult education. Jerome Bruner shares part of his previously published work summarizing the broad understanding of learning and education as cultural processes. Robin Usher informs the reader of the four postmodern modes of learning and practice with regard to adult education. The four quadrants described are expression, application, autonomy, and adaptation.</p>
<p>Thomas Ziehe writes about current forces that are directing the youth focusing on learning, development, and culture. Jean Lave describes the learning approach of the Russian theoretical school as it was developed in the 1930s. Etienne Wenger’s chapter is from his book and provides his understanding of approaches to learning. Finally, Danny Wildemeersch and Veerle Stroobants provide us a framework on transitional learning based on their previous works and research.</p>
<p>The most intriguing part of the book is that the theorists speak in their own words. Individual voices can be “heard,” making the reader feel a connection with the authors. It is refreshing to hear about people’s ideas in their own voice and hear the explanations as they intended them to be. Furthermore, this method takes away any ambiguity that could be created by second party interpretations.</p>
<p>The editor also criticizes the fact he imposed an arbitrary time frame for defining “modern” and mentions several other theories that could have been included in this work. Though Mr. Illeris recognizes this weakness, he does not mention the other weakness in this work, which is the underrepresentation of female voices in this book. Out of the 17 authors, only two of them, Jean Lave and Bente Elkjaer, were women.</p>
<p>This book is not organized thematically, resulting in little continuity between the chapters. Each chapter is devoted to the ideas of the author presenting them, and the individual chapters do not necessarily relate to the previous or subsequent chapters. This allows the reader the choice to read the book in its entirety or only read the portions that are of interest to him or her.</p>
<p>This book would be beneficial to all people interested in adult learning. Though many of the ideas have previously been presented or published, the author has managed to compile revised editions of the works in an effective way. This book is also a great starting point with regard to research. A plethora of learning theories are presented that provide fodder for more research.</p>
