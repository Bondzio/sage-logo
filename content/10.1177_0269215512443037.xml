<p>Urinary incontinence after stroke is common, is the best single indicator of a poor prognosis, and is inadequately managed with no evidence available to provide sound guidance. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511426160">A study</related-article> in three teaching hospitals reveals how unsystematic, how deficiently documented, and how arbitrary practice is in relation to catheterisation. Surely we can do better than this? Immobility after stroke may be one cause of incontinence. A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511425541">Swiss study</related-article> compared early (two days) and late (seven days) mobilisation and showed how deleterious prolonged bed rest can be; other studies are suggesting that immediate mobilisation may be best, and that 52 hours rest may be too long. Although loss of mobility is common, it also frequently recovers, to an extent at least, and there are tens of measures of mobility available. Often staff measure speed three times and then use the best, or the average; <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511423849">a study</related-article> has now shown that one single measure is just as valid which should reduce unnecessary assessments by two thirds! Being mobile involves exercise, and there is some suggestion that exercise may improve cognition. A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511425835">small pilot study</related-article> in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment failed to find any dose-response relationship – but it was a small study with a crude outcome measure. In contrast <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511421028">a study</related-article> in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, walking exercise improved cognitive function as assessed under dual-task conditions and on a measure of executive function. Osteoarthritis is also common in the hands and in some countries and cultures spa treatments including magnetotherapy are widely used and much appreciated by patients. Now <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511425961">a randomised trial</related-article> has found evidence of benefit on pain, strength, and function and quality of life. I hope that a larger confirmatory trial is carried out as soon as possible; one RCT is not enough. Returning to the knee, two alternative pathologies are studied in this issue. Anterior cruciate ligament repair is commonly undertaken, and rehabilitation may be central to a good outcome – but what about rehabilitation? The addition of <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511421029">neuromuscular stimulation</related-article> to normal exercise seems to improve outcome – but is exercise essential or will stimulation alone work? Patellar tendinopathy is also common, and many therapies are offered including stretching and exercise. It seems that <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511411114">adding static stretches</related-article> to eccentric exercise improves outcome – but is exercise essential or will stretching alone work as well? Finally, in this era of trying to be cost-efficient, a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215512443037" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511423279">systematic review</related-article> suggests that home treatment for elderly people with musculo-skeletal disorders may be more effective in some domains and is certainly no worse than inpatient rehabilitation – and is presumably much cheaper.</p>
