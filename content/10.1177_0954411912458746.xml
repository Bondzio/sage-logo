<p>We are living in the Bone and Joint Decade. Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common causes of severe long-term pain and physical disability, affecting hundreds of millions of people across the world. Joint diseases account for half of all chronic conditions in people aged 65 years and above, and the extent of the problem, together with its burden on patients and society, makes it crucial to address.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912458746">1</xref></sup> Although intense research toward prevention and therapeutic strategies for relief of osteoarthritis as a major cause of joint disease is ongoing, joint replacement still remains an important last resort. Primary total hip replacement (THR) is one of the most performed operations within orthopedic surgery worldwide, but the costs are rising steeply.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912458746">2</xref></sup> However, one of the major problems associated with this demanding surgical procedure is to find an optimized solution between hip biomechanics, tribology, and postoperative function in the implantation of the artificial hip components. In the end, all the three elements are dependent on each other: the position of total hip components correlates with the risk of dislocation, implant failure, articular wear, the prosthetic range of motion, and ultimately patient satisfaction.</p>
<p>Hence, efforts have been made to optimize and individualize the component position intraoperatively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912458746">3</xref></sup> It quickly became clear that neither orthopedic surgeons nor implant manufacturers could solve this challenge alone. In the 1990s, computer-assisted navigation technology was introduced into orthopedic surgery and shortly afterward also into THR.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912458746">4</xref></sup> Since then, the close cooperation between orthopedics and biomedical engineering has enabled significant progress in the understanding of structure, function, and biomechanical properties of the native and artificial hip joint. More recently, a further step toward a biomechanically orientated analysis of hip surgery has been made by utilizing computer-assisted surgical systems, gait analysis, and musculoskeletal modeling.</p>
<p>Despite all the progress made, the following question remains: Will orthopedic navigation technology pass the test to improve the postoperative outcome for our patients in the future? With this in mind, the goal of this special issue within the <italic>Journal of Mechanical Engineering in Medicine</italic> was to present the status, current developments, and future perspectives on “Orthopedic navigation technology and biomechanical evaluation for THR.”</p>
<p>The opening article by Jefferson reviews the evolution of controversially discussed hard on hard bearings and addresses particularly the importance of acetabular cup placement in this context. Current concepts and future applications for orthopedic navigation and computer-assisted methods are discussed in the first section. An overview of computer navigation is given by Franke et al., who discuss also the demanding case of revision surgery that may be an emerging field of application for computer navigation in the future. Nawabi et al. evaluate the use of a novel robotic arm–assisted THR system using the patient’s computed tomography (CT) scan data to reconstruct the anatomy and to create a patient-specific surgical plan for cup alignment and placement. Renkawitz et al. assess the reliability of an imageless three-dimensional impingement detection method for navigated THR, which has the potential to calculate an optimized cup position with a reduced risk for impingement prior to implantation of the cup intraoperatively.</p>
<p>The next section focusses on the biomechanical evaluation of preoperative status, outcome, and perspective for long-term behavior in prosthetic hip replacement. A step toward a biomechanically orientated evaluation of THR is the use of biomechanical models and scores that can be applied in clinical practice. Eschweiler et al. present a review of current approaches and show a comparison of the performance of the different methods for the prediction of resultant hip joint forces. The clinically important parameter of leg length is discussed by Budenberg et al. The group addresses the potential implications of leg length inequality on wear by combining clinical gait analysis and computational methods. Weber et al. present a method of combining gait analysis with musculoskeletal modeling to evaluate the functional outcome after THR and thereby gives us new insight into the biomechanical situation during gait with an artificial hip joint. To study failure mechanisms and predict failure is an essential step toward safe and successful surgeries. A method using advanced computational methods is presented by Galibarov et al. with the aim to understand probabilistic modeling of long-term failure of cemented THR.</p>
<p>As guest editors, we would like to thank all the authors who have contributed their research and views on the topic of “Orthopedic navigation technology and biomechanical evaluation for THR” and, as a reader, we hope you enjoy this edition.</p>
