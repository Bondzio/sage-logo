<abstract>
<p>In 1937, the Culver City Chamber of Commerce proposed that the city change its name to Hollywood to capitalize on its status as the leading center of film production. Once the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce learned of its counterpart’s intentions, a war of words ensued between the boosters in the local and national press. The dispute ended when the City of Los Angeles passed an ordinance establishing official boundaries for Hollywood; to this day, Hollywood is the only district within the city with such a designation. Filling a void in the literature about the industrial, place-based aspects of the film industry, this story illuminates the role of film studios in the intrametropolitan conflict in and urban development of Los Angeles, the significance of boosters in shaping places, and the complications of the decentralization of the film production economy from a cultural economy centered in Hollywood.</p>

<attrib>—<italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>, June 3, 1937<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420643">1</xref></sup></attrib></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nine white letters fifty feet tall perched atop a mountain spell out “Hollywood.” This familiar landmark conjures hopes and dreams of stardom, an industry that produces these fantasies, and the city in which all of it is possible. Originally constructed in 1923 to advertise a new residential subdivision called Hollywoodland, over time the sign lost four letters and gained mythic status. But Hollywood is a real place. It was subdivided in the 1880s, incorporated as a city in 1903, and consolidated with the City of Los Angeles in 1910 for access to water.</p>
<p>Hollywood is also the only neighborhood in Los Angeles with officially designated boundaries. In a vast city, such as Los Angeles, most residents are keenly aware of neighborhood and community boundaries, real or imagined. Such boundaries do not lie uncontested, but the city government does not intervene in these disputes. Instead, each municipal agency is free to use its own boundaries for communities. However, Hollywood stands apart with an ordinance passed into law in September 1937 that established its boundaries. Why?</p>
<p>Numerous local histories and one scholastic study have observed these distinct boundaries, but none have understood their origin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420643">2</xref></sup> The scholastic study is a cultural geography dissertation that contemplates the usefulness of standardized district boundaries for cities, utilizing Hollywood as an example. Joseph Beaton, the author, reports that he could not find a reason for Hollywood’s curious establishment of district boundaries in 1937, but he infers from the ordinance language that it may have had something to do with protecting the “Hollywood” name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420643">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>That assumption was correct. In 1937, Culver City, a four-square-mile municipality of then eight thousand people southwest of Hollywood, attempted to change its name to Hollywood. The solution of the City of Los Angeles and concerned Hollywood boosters to securing the name and thwarting Culver City’s actions was the ordinance establishing Hollywood’s boundaries.</p>
<p>This is a story about claiming Hollywood. It is also a story about boosters and boosterism’s role in shaping places and what people think of them. Boosters are place promoters; their professions vary from real estate entrepreneurs to local business owners to anyone involved in chambers of commerce or other local organizations that address community or economic concerns. In the grand narrative of American history, boosters are fundamental to the understanding of urban history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211420643">4</xref></sup> Traditionally, histories may have dismissed the significance of boosterism in shaping the American West, but recent studies have placed boosters and their efforts at the center of both historical and our contemporary understanding of the region and specific places within it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211420643">5</xref></sup> Boosters have long been understood as key players in the history and development of Los Angeles. In <italic>The Fragmented Metropolis</italic>, Robert M. Fogelson describes late-nineteenth-century boosters, desperate for migrants to make their way to Los Angeles, as selling the town on its abundant agricultural land, pleasant climate, and “hospitable society.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211420643">6</xref></sup> Other facets of boosterism in Los Angeles focused on its shifting racial demographics as both the city of the future and the heir to a romantic, Spanish past, especially through the remaking of the built environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211420643">7</xref></sup> During the 1920s, boosters’ imaginative industrial geographies shaped Los Angeles’s growth in manufacturing capacity and in spatial terms, determining land use patterns for the metropolis to the present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211420643">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, cultural products—such as language and visual arts, music, fashion, and certainly film and television—produced in Los Angeles or about the metropolis have historically and continually served as some of the most effective boosterism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211420643">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Boosters often played a critical role in the local economy’s frequent cycles of boom and bust. Fogelson details the emergence of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce following the boom and bust of the 1880s, which served as a promotion machine for the next thirty years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211420643">10</xref></sup> The Culver City Chamber of Commerce, attempting to transform the city’s fortunes from depression to prosperity, engineered a name change campaign—which many at the time dismissed as a clever publicity stunt—for this purpose. Meanwhile, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce fought its counterpart in Culver City in its attempts to usurp its name. While the dispute was over a name, it was also an intrametropolitan conflict over each locale’s role in the film industry.</p>
<p>As such, this is also a story about the role of the film industry and Hollywood in planning and shaping the Los Angeles metropolis. Although it may seem now that the film industry and “Hollywood” (as a construct for the American entertainment industry) is highly scrutinized because of its omnipresence, there is relatively little scholarship on the film industry in Los Angeles or urban history. While much academic work has been devoted to the films, the moguls, the auteurs, and the role of American cinema in the cultural imaginary and globalization, there is comparatively almost nothing about the industrial, placed-based aspects of the film industry. Canonical tomes of Los Angeles history only marginally, if at all, address the presence of the film industry. “Hollywood” may be found in indices but often only as a superficial qualifier. The term is often evoked in what I describe as a mythical nesting of concepts to represent the neighborhood, the American film industry, the Los Angeles metropolis, or even the entirety of Southern California. “Hollywood” is a synecdoche, and most authors take for granted what the term implies. Carey McWilliams’s relatively nuanced description of the film industry’s influence on Los Angeles is a rare example to the contrary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211420643">11</xref></sup> Otherwise, economic geographers have authored the most extensive—although by no means exhaustive—scholarship on the film industry in Los Angeles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211420643">12</xref></sup> Much else of what we know about its imprint on Los Angeles is limited to labor strife.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211420643">13</xref></sup> My project rectifies this wide-open gap in the literature by uncovering the film industry’s role in the Los Angeles metropolis. This essay explores the metaphorical role of “Hollywood” in shaping Los Angeles. Specifically, the story contesting the name “Hollywood” illustrates intrametropolitan conflict and competition in a fragmented climate that would escalate in the postwar era.</p>
<p>Even though film production has long been decentralized, since the early twentieth century through the present, Hollywood the place has been synonymous with the American film industry. On its arrival in Los Angeles in the 1900s, filming locations and production facilities sprung up everywhere across the large area (then sparsely populated) we understand as its metropolis today. In the 1910s, a concentration of such companies emerged in Hollywood, a former orange grove and residential suburb seven miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. However, at the time of this concentration of firms, “Hollywood” had not quite stuck as the generic reference for American film production. By 1924, the term was in use, signaled by the publication of the bizarre blend of racism, religion, and film in <italic>Hollywood as a World Center</italic> by Perley Poore Sheehan, who was better known as a screenwriter, director, and novelist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211420643">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why was Hollywood the center of the film industry? Joseph Beaton explains that the “movies chose Hollywood” for geographic, economic, and political reasons. While filming occurred all over the Los Angeles landscape, firms chose to locate in Hollywood for the following reasons: proximity to the Los Angeles central business district (CBD) where one could find film-processing facilities, goods and services, rentals, and active and high-quality legitimate theater. Hollywood was centrally located between the CBD and varied landscape locales such as the desert, mountains, and ocean compared to other places. At the same time, the local scenery was varied and of high quality for filming, including nearby Griffith Park, while the skies were generally clearer than costal locations. There was more land and space for lower prices in Hollywood than the CBD. As part of the city of Los Angeles, Hollywood offered firms access to municipal services not available in other locales, to which East Coast businessmen were accustomed. There was a “colorful array of fine residences” and inns for lodging and entertainment, despite the prohibition of alcohol sales. Most importantly, once there was a plurality there were benefits of economies of scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211420643">15</xref></sup> Once the movies chose Hollywood, the industry chose to keep the name no matter how far outward it spread.</p>
<p>As the name Hollywood formed attachment with the industry, filmmaking changed in the 1920s from small independent productions—often with socialist or politically varied themes—to a multimillion-dollar manufacturing industry financed by Wall Street.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211420643">16</xref></sup> As a result of the change in the business model, there was a change in physical requirements. Established and emerging firms left or settled outside of Hollywood seeking larger land parcels at cheaper prices to build their vast film manufacturing plants. These then far-flung places—Culver City, Burbank, West Los Angeles—were where ambitious real estate speculators had or would set their sights on subdivision and civic incorporation, but at the time they were small agricultural communities, clusters of individuals, or completely undeveloped. Where firms located and decisions they made about their land use—such as acquiring vast acreage during robust production eras and relinquishing that land or finding other nonproduction use for it when business models changed—effectively planned portions of the Los Angeles metropolis. This is a subject to be expanded elsewhere, however. As the film industry spread outward, not from the CBD “downtown” but from a site some seven miles northwest, firms—new and old—retained Hollywood addresses. Although most were not physically in Hollywood, they continued to advertise Burbank and Culver City studios as Hollywood. Film credits all read, “Made in Hollywood.”</p>
<p>While much of the production elements of “Hollywood,” or its production economy, spread outward seeking more abundant and cheaper land on which to expand, the cultural economy, or the promotion machine for the film industry, remained in Hollywood. The star system, which evolved as a key component of the studio era, beginning with the industry-wide changes in the 1920s, necessitated that film stars enjoy the vibrant nightlife at supper and night clubs along Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards in Hollywood and along the Sunset Strip in adjoining unincorporated territory of Los Angeles County known as West Hollywood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211420643">17</xref></sup> The press reported on these activities as an important part of the promotional machine for the film industry. The cultural economy also consisted of other networking events such as “doing lunch” and, most notably, glitzy movie premieres. Historian David Karnes observes, “The glamour which nourished movie culture depended upon the ways in which Hollywood’s worldly realities and fantastic appeals so irresistibly reinforced one another, and it was around this linkage that early movie premieres developed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211420643">18</xref></sup> While the production economy manufactured the films that were seen by nearly all Americans and many others around the globe, it was the cultural economy’s activities that promoted the fantasy and glamour of the movies to the world. As sociologist Harvey Molotch observes, “The image of places comes from the sense people have—local people and those far away—of the cultural-material interactions within them. And this reputation of place becomes another aspect of local economic structure, a part of its geographic capital.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211420643">19</xref></sup> This may, at least in part, explain the evolution of the mythical nesting of concepts bound in the term “Hollywood.” Anchored in Hollywood, the cultural economy generated images of the place for mass consumption. These images attracted tourists to Hollywood rather than the dispersed locations that undertook film production. As such, this tension was a source of intrametropolitan conflict, especially between Culver City and Hollywood.</p>
<p>Some representatives of Culver City’s business and economic interests were troubled by the undue attention the Hollywood district received rather than their own city, which produced more films than any other place. Culver City was home to three significant film studios, including the largest and most productive in the studio era, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). In 1937, the Culver City Chamber of Commerce officially expressed frustration with its lack of recognition for its role in film production and with it the tourist dollars that flowed directly to Hollywood, but this was not the first outcry of dissatisfaction for Culver City.</p>
<p>The first public rumblings for a change of name for Culver City occurred in 1934, spurred by a contest in <italic>The Citizen</italic>, a local newspaper. In the March 9, 1934, edition of the paper, the main headline read, “NAME CHANGE IS SOUGHT FOR CITY” in all capital letters. In addition to a boxed contest announcement, the front page contained one editorial and one article that may as well as been labeled an editorial touting the benefits of a name change. The contest requested that readers send in as many “suitable” names they could think of to replace “Culver City” with one that befit “a great center for motion picture production” by March 31 at 5 p.m. Three judges would award a $10 first prize, $5 second prize, and $2.50 third prize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211420643">20</xref></sup> The contest, of course, had no legal standing. It was perhaps a local publisher’s attempt to sell more papers during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The paper asserted that “the old western idea of naming a small town after one of her pioneer citizens afflicts the place with an immediate sense of limitations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211420643">21</xref></sup> The Culver of Culver City was Harry H. Culver, born in Milford, Nebraska, in 1880. In 1910, Culver arrived in Southern California and learned the real estate business from I.N. Van Nuys. After branching out on his own, he undertook careful study of the area and formed the Culver Investment Company. During a luncheon at the California Club in downtown Los Angeles in 1913, Culver announced his plans to develop a residential and commercial city halfway between Los Angeles and the ocean at a junction point of the Pacific Electric streetcar system. Culver was known for his promotional skills, and within a year his town boasted paved streets with trees and lighting, stores, a macaroni factory, a bank, a newspaper, and a real estate sales force of 150 selling homes. In 1915, while standing on the banks of nearby La Ballona Creek, Culver watched Thomas Ince direct a western on location, away from Inceville, his studio site north of Santa Monica. Fascinated by the movies and driven by his entrepreneurial spirit, Culver convinced Ince to purchase property on Washington Boulevard. The first of Culver City’s three major studio sites, it was developed by Ince along with D. W. Griffith and Mack Sennett as Triangle Studios, which is the site MGM took over nine years later. In 1917, residents rejected Los Angeles’s annexation attempts and instead voted to incorporate as an independent city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211420643">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The paper strongly advocated the name change—since Harry Culver had moved from the city that bears his name to a nearby neighborhood in Los Angeles—to one that more appropriately linked it in the mind of filmgoers to the numerous pictures it produced each year. The paper boasted that “more successful productions issue out of Culver City than come from Hollywood today,” yet it was Hollywood that had captured the world’s attention as the center of the film industry. “It is remarkable that the town has not claimed more of the distinction for herself that her studios have achieved,” an editorial exclaimed. The paper informed readers that there was an “enormous publicity value” to linking the name of the city to its chief industry, which “is apparent to all.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211420643">23</xref></sup> And how would this publicity be gained? The paper assured readers there would be an “enormous amount of country-wide publicity” with the announcement of the change in post office addresses posted throughout the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211420643">24</xref></sup> In addition, there was a lot of pride in Culver City’s status as an independent city and perhaps some resentment that Hollywood took center stage despite its status as a district of a much larger city. Although the paper bemoaned the special and unique attention Hollywood received, it dismissed it as “but a section of the City of Los Angeles without its own government or individuality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211420643">25</xref></sup> Some of that resentment stemmed from economic issues and heated municipal competition in the midst of the Great Depression. Because Culver City and Hollywood were often conflated, which the paper referred to more than once in its drive to change the city’s name, the city had presumably not been able to capitalize on some of the place-based economic benefits associated with the Hollywood label. For example, the paper contended that Hollywood’s real estate values had “held up” while those of other areas’, including Culver City’s, had plummeted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211420643">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the entry period for the contest, the paper reported receiving lots of positive feedback about its endeavor. It also continued to publish editorials in favor of the name change, reiterating the points espoused with the announcement. The paper reported that the Culver City Chamber of Commerce “indicated the belief that a change [in name] would be beneficial to the city at large”; however, I found no record of such a sentiment at the time in the official minutes of the organization. In the meantime, the paper reported that Community Post 46 of the Culver-Palms American Legion expressed opposition to the name change. A paper editorial argued with the Legion, dismissing them by asserting they are opposed to change in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211420643">27</xref></sup> But during all this, lest any Harry Culver fans worry about the total erasure of his name from the landscape, the paper assured that Culver Boulevard would remain as such.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211420643">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>On April 13, 1934, nearly two weeks after the close of the contest, the paper published three proposed names for the city and their recommenders in the paper: “Roosevelt,” submitted by Peggy Weaver; “Cinema City,” by Mrs. J. A. Moore and Mrs. Ruth Harrison, independently of one another; and “Filmville,” by Benjamin F. Bledsoe. Bledsoe, a once partner of Harry Culver’s and former superior court judge, was the most interesting of contestants. He wrote a letter to the paper expressing his position <italic>against</italic> the city’s proposed name change, but at the same time provided a suggestion and entered the contest. Among his reasons for opposing the change, Bledsoe explained that changing the name to better capitalize the way Hollywood has is not possible if the place does not have what Hollywood does.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211420643">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>This point drives a stake into one of the paper’s core arguments, which reappeared in the name dispute three years later, that Culver City name change proponents operated under the assumption that simply rechristening their town would bring sudden recognition and fortune by declaring more explicitly to the world that films are made there. However, they failed to acknowledge that the unequal reputations held by Hollywood and Culver City had been earned because they are fundamentally two different <italic>places</italic>. There is nothing about film in the word origin of the name “Hollywood” any more than there is of “Culver City.” Hollywood earned its badge of honor through its particular development history and the set of amenities the place possesses. Specifically, the distinction between the two places is drawn by their relationship to the film industry and its production and cultural economies. The district of the City of Los Angeles known as Hollywood, which began as a production and cultural center outsourced its production economy to locales with abundant, cheap, undeveloped land. By 1937, while production still occurred in Hollywood, Culver City was the leader of the American film production economy. Hollywood maintained its status as the center of the film cultural economy, where the schmoozing and star-studded nightclubs held the American public’s attention, further disseminating the appeal and allure of American studio films. Hence, Hollywood, rather than Culver City, represented film to most people.</p>
<p>The following week’s edition, April 20, 1934, was the last mention of the name change for three years. Buried on page 4, there was an editorial reiterating the paper’s support for the idea while blasting Bledsoe’s criticism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211420643">30</xref></sup> There was no announcement of suspended campaigning. It simply ended abruptly.</p>
<p>While there were no more name changing suggestions for the time being, the city did maintain an active interest in promoting its relationship to the film industry. Likely motivated by the previously identified concerns and aspirations, Culver City adopted its official city seal, which is still in use today, in 1936. “The Heart of Screenland” and an image of motion picture equipment appear on the seal, signifying the importance of the industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211420643">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the June 1, 1937, board of directors meeting for the Culver City Chamber of Commerce, President Blaine Walker presented, for the opinion of the board, the slogan, “Culver City, Where Hollywood Movies Are Made.” He also read a note of approval from the mayor. During the discussion that led to the adoption of the slogan, board member and automotive service station owner Geo L. Conaway suggested changing the name of Culver City to Hollywood. He further suggested sending out postcards to registered voters to poll their reaction to the name change. The board motioned to complete the second task, and more discussion followed about “the bad effect generally” of the name Culver City.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211420643">32</xref></sup> There was no mention of notifying the press or to capitalize on publicity, but word spread. The <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> reported the following morning on Culver City’s intentions to change its name to Hollywood.</p>
<p>The chamber minutes provide no detail as to the “bad effect generally” of the Culver City name, but speculation suggests it may have to do with resentment of Harry Culver’s departure from the city he founded and the city’s declining prosperity during the Depression. In 1926, Culver hired Wallace Neff to design a mansion on a five-acre parcel he purchased in nearby Cheviot Hills, outside the Culver City limits. To more effectively supervise the construction of his new home, Culver had his house on Delmas Terrace—only steps away from the central commercial area of Culver City—moved to his new property. Subsequently, Culver was less involved in his Culver City ventures as he rose to prominence in state and national real estate organizations. With substantial decline in his personal wealth during the Depression, Culver ramped up his speaking engagements across the country and even worked for one year for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. Other business pursuits drew his attention outside Culver City.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211420643">33</xref></sup> <italic>The Citizen</italic>’s editorials in its own campaign to change the city’s name alluded to these events. Why would Culver’s decreased involvement in the city offend some of its business leaders? Perhaps they resented the loss of the city’s number one booster, who had built the city from nothing to a 1920s boomtown, at its most critical time. Culver profited during its boom, but did not stick around for the bust. While the economic depression was universal, Culver City’s, like many other places, reaction was parochial.</p>
<p>What had spurred such a sudden and drastic action, to change the city’s name to Hollywood, on the part of the Culver City Chamber of Commerce? The chamber minutes are silent as to the sudden spark, but an article published in the <italic>Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine</italic> two days prior may have planted the germ of the idea in chamber members’ minds. In “No Movie Was Ever Made in Hollywood,” H. W. Little argued that because Hollywood consolidated with the City of Los Angeles in 1910, before any films had been made within its original boundaries, and that no film studios had located within those original city limits after consolidation, no movie had ever been made there. However, Little overlooked that the Fox Film Corporation, the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation (later Paramount Pictures), Warner Bros. Columbia Pictures, and others all had studios along Sunset Boulevard within those original Hollywood city boundaries (the Hollywood Hills south to Fountain Avenue and Normandie Avenue west to La Brea Avenue). Meanwhile, Little essentially argued that Hollywood was defined by those original boundaries, and once it relinquished its municipal status it did not exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211420643">34</xref></sup> Such logic left the Hollywood name for the taking.</p>
<p>Quickly, the Culver City Chamber of Commerce’s actions caught the attention of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. As you can imagine, the Hollywood chamber was opposed to its counterpart’s intentions, and a war of words between the two parties ensued in the local and national press. Blaine Walker, newsreel producer and president of the Culver City Chamber of Commerce, told reporters that Hollywood</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>has had easy coasting for twenty years on the films produced in Culver City. . . . That mythical spot called Hollywood is now on the spot. More than 30 per cent. of all motion pictures produced are produced in Culver City. No other single production-center approaches this figure. . . . The Directors of the Chamber of Commerce and the leaders of all the other civic and business organizations in this city are determined to obtain a rightful recognition for Culver City as the greatest single world center of motion-picture production.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Walker also asserted that no films were actually produced in Hollywood, but instead in “Greater Hollywood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211420643">35</xref></sup> As previously mentioned, that was not true. Walker may have been repeating Little’s argument in the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>.</p>
<p>In response to Walker’s continued assertions of Culver City’s dominance of film production, and therefore the rightful heir to the cache and fortune of the Hollywood name, Carl Bush, executive secretary of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce—who had recently attempted to acquire a Hollywood postage cancellation mark for the Los Angeles post office branch there—repeatedly pushed back at Walker and Culver City’s “publicity stunt.” He explained the Hollywood chamber’s three plans to thwart Culver City’s efforts. First, they planned to confer with the Culver City Chamber of Commerce to “show them the confusion that would occur.” Second, they would seek an injunction in Superior Court because it would be “bad public policy to call the election” mandated by the petition circulating, because of the confusion the name change would create. Third, “our real ace in the hole,” was to have the U.S. Post Office refuse to recognize the name change should it occur and still cancel their mail with “Culver City.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211420643">36</xref></sup> Bush did not provide any detail on how they could accomplish such an “ace.”</p>
<p>Culver City’s intentions also caught the attention of politicians. John Anson Ford, who represented Hollywood on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, told the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>, “It [Culver City’s proposed name change] would be an injustice to Hollywood, which as a community has an equity in culture and sentiment almost equal to her commercial and financial equities. Besides this, such a move would establish dangerous precedent—San Pedro would have a right to take the name of San Francisco, Pomona could called itself White Plains, Glendale could become Schenectady, Los Angeles might even call itself Palm—but why go on? Perish the thought!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211420643">37</xref></sup> In an effort to block Culver City’s efforts, Ford sent “frantic telegrams” to Senator William Gibbs McAdoo and Postmaster General James A. Farley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211420643">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The postal service figured prominently in the plans and solutions of both sides of the dispute. Independently of the combatants, a committee of the Los Angeles branch of the Railway Mail Association formed in opposition to the name change proposal. They petitioned authorities in Washington to veto any attempt to change the name because of the confusion it would cause. They stated there was already confusion and mistaken deliveries for mail destined for Hollywood, Florida. Another Hollywood in California would cause even more confusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211420643">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following the initial Culver City Chamber of Commerce meeting, the dispute between the Chambers of Commerce dominated the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>. For two weeks, the <italic>Times</italic> printed at least one article—often more—on the dispute each day, and most of them on the front page.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211420643">40</xref></sup> The reporting spawned letters to the editor and the attentive pen of the <italic>Times</italic> regular columnists. T. W. Bastyr, a <italic>Times</italic> reader, wrote in to suggest that Culver City consider a list of “many other famous and illustrious names that would mean much more to a community noted for its film studios.” The list he provided included “Will Rogers,” “Belasco,” “Ziegfeld,” and “Barrymore.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211420643">41</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> Columnist Chapin Hall offered a solution to the problem, suggesting a “Greater Hollywood,” modeled on the recent consolidation of Greater New York, whereby Culver City would be annexed to the City of Los Angeles but maintain a separate identity and government. This would invite other districts of Los Angeles to apply for borough status as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211420643">42</xref></sup> Trade paper <italic>Weekly Variety</italic>, published in New York City, reported that many favored the solution of consolidating all municipalities with film production companies into a city of Hollywood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211420643">43</xref></sup>
<italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> reader Benjamin E. Neal of Hollywood provided a similar suggestion. Less focused on governance but instead on the business of film, Neal suggested a “Greater Hollywood” comprised of Hollywood, Culver City, Burbank, Westwood, Universal City, and all other centers of film production for cooperation purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211420643">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>In reality, this type of Greater Hollywood had already long existed. It was not the film industry that was disgruntled with the conflation of Culver City and Hollywood. To the contrary, film studios had been active in keeping Hollywood addresses even when they moved to Culver City or Burbank or elsewhere. Although competitors, the studios cooperated with one another when it was in their interest to do so. Promoting “Hollywood” as a place of film production, despite the reality, was one such case. The relative lack of interest the film industry trade papers of the day showed the name dispute supports this assertion. Each paper at least mentioned the ongoing conflict but declined to offer opinion or prolonged consideration of the issue. Instead, the trades were focused on the conclusion of a labor dispute and the unexpected death of actress Jean Harlow.</p>
<p>While the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce maintained a stern and serious tone in its response to Culver City’s ploy, Hollywood stars provided comic relief to the press. Some conjectured that Washington Boulevard, a major east-west artery of Los Angeles that led to and through Culver City, would be renamed Hollywood Boulevard. Or that the famous Grauman’s Chinese Theater would have to be moved a few miles south to the new Hollywood and its boulevard. Actor Lionel Barrymore suggested that Culver City consider the name Southwest-by-West Hollywood since there was already a North, West, and East Hollywood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211420643">45</xref></sup> When Carl Bush remarked to the press about the eight-mile distance between Hollywood and Culver City, he suggested that Burbank had more of a claim on the name given its proximity and adjacency to North Hollywood. In response, Warner Bros. producer Mervyn LeRoy, whose studio was in Burbank, sarcastically remarked, “Why shouldn’t Burbank get a crack at the name? I’ll see the Mayor about it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211420643">46</xref></sup> Actor Edward Arnold jested, “We’re always having title changes out here.” Some were more practical. Actress May Robson, who owned property in Culver City, remarked, “If property values out there will go up as a result of the name change, by all means let’s change the name.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211420643">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet other stars took the matter more seriously. Several actors, led by John Boles and Richard Dix, banded together, retained lawyer William M. Raines, and threatened to initiate the secession of Hollywood from the City of Los Angeles to prevent Culver City from taking the name. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce vowed to fully support the secessionists. While this might have appeared as an empty threat, the City of Los Angeles took it very seriously. The City Attorney’s office issued a statement, which included the difficult legal hurdles ahead to actually secede. Of all registered Los Angeles voters, 25 percent would have to sign petitions calling for the vote to secede; and then a majority of voters in the election would have to support the position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211420643">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not five days after Culver City announced its intention to change its name to Hollywood, Culver City officials revealed the hoopla as a “clever publicity stunt” and “brain child” of Blaine Walker, president of the Culver City Chamber of Commerce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211420643">49</xref></sup> While the motion certainly generated publicity, there is no indication in the chamber minutes that this was intended solely as a publicity stunt. To the contrary, the notes are very matter of fact and serious in tone.</p>
<p>On June 6, 1937, the Culver City Chamber of Commerce called a special meeting of its board of directors to discuss the name change matter. For forty-five minutes, board members debated whether to adopt a resolution to change the city’s name to “Hollywood” or “Hollywood City.” The latter suggestion arose from concerns that local merchants might want to take advantage of the city’s new name in theirs, which might result in legal complications with rival businesses in that other Hollywood. Such a complication had already begun. On June 4, the front page of the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> carried a photo of a sign painter labeling a Culver City business “Hollywood Cleaners.” Soon after, the <italic>Motion Picture Herald</italic> reported that a Hollywood firm of the same name threatened legal action against the Culver City cleaning and dyeing establishment. Meanwhile, a number of board members expressed dissatisfaction with “Hollywood City” and claimed they would refuse to compromise. In the end, by unanimous vote, the board passed a resolution in favor of changing the name to “Hollywood City” and preparing petitions for voters to consider the name in an election. While a quorum was present, not all members who attended the June 1 meeting attended the special one. Most notably, Earl Eastham, Harry Culver’s brother-in-law, was absent from the special meeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211420643">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet another special meeting of the board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce was held on the following day, June 7. In the brief meeting, they held an “informal discussion of the name change situation” and considered that the local film studios might want to suggest a new name or offer their opinions on “Hollywood City.” Two members agreed to contact the studios and report back to the board the following day at another special meeting. The next day, they had nothing to report, and there was no further mention of consulting the film studios.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420643">51</xref></sup> While I have found no evidence of the opinions of any Culver City film studio executives or employees, they unlikely had one to offer. The film studios actively promoted the idea that Hollywood, of no specific geographic bounds, was the place where movies were made when they labeled their films as such. The film studios were not disgruntled that Culver City as an entity did not share in the tourist dollars and benefits of the area surrounding Hollywood Boulevard. Culver City’s lack of externalities from film production, especially the dearth of tourist dollars, was a problem for the local businessmen who were struggling during the Great Depression, and not the studios.</p>
<p>Most newspaper reporting of the dispute was sparse on details of how the name change would in reality benefit Culver City, giving the impression that the Chamber of Commerce thought just changing the name would be a “cure-all.” Blaine Walker offered some more details to <italic>The Citizen</italic>: “A name change should not be considered a cure-all for all community ailments. Progress under a name change would be stimulated and our community might have the opportunity of sharing in the tremendous amount of publicity emanating from the motion picture industry.” Walker continued, “Our prosperity for a major party comes from tourist dollars. In the past these dollars have been attracted to the mythical Hollywood, and Culver City with all or more than Hollywood has to offer, has remained isolated in the minds of Southern California tourists.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211420643">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Walker’s remarks return to an earlier criticism offered during the paper’s campaign to change the name three years earlier. Did Culver City really have all that Hollywood had to offer? Producing films was not Hollywood’s only claim to fame or attraction to tourists. Hollywood, as the site of the cultural economy, was also the center of film promotion and celebrity nightlife. Films premiered at Grauman’s Chinese and Egyptian theaters and stars were seen enjoying themselves at Hollywood’s numerous supper and dance clubs as part of the star system, a key component of the studio era’s business model. In comparison, Culver City could not offer the same glamorous haunts to tourists. Local histories compare 1920s Culver City’s nightlife to that of the Sunset Strip, where nightclubs proliferated outside the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department’s vice unit and were instead under the less watchful eye of the Los Angeles County Sheriff.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211420643">53</xref></sup> While Culver City may have had a locally colorful nightlife, it does not appear to have captured the attention of Hollywood’s elite. In 1937, Culver City was geographically isolated from the glamorous Hollywood and its adjoining Sunset Strip. At the time, even though the City of Los Angeles had annexed nearly all the territory it would, it was not a cohesive metropolis but instead clusters of population and development that eventually grew toward one another. Furthermore, by then, Culver City’s nightclub days had waned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211420643">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, tourists flocked to Hollywood, the center of the cultural economy, because images of the place were strategically disseminated through the media. In contrast, the production economy lacked comparable visual representation and therefore did not capture the public’s imagination. To see the exterior of a Culver City film studio—as studio tours were not available to the general public at the time—was in reality not that exciting. Studios were and remain manufacturing plants; they look much more like airplane manufacturing sites than star-filled playgrounds. The Culver City business leaders, attempting to capture some of the profits of the effects of the cultural economy, likely did not understand the distinction between the cultural and production economies. Their rhetoric was filled with references to the production economy and with none to the cultural economy. Furthermore, Culver City was a primarily working-class community. The studios employed local residents in behind-the-scenes work; stars and executives did not make Culver City their home. Such a status marker was perhaps best illustrated when Harry Culver, the city’s most elite resident, chose to move out of the city he founded rather than build a grander house within its bounds.</p>
<p>On the face of the controversy, it appears that Culver City attempted to reclaim the recognition, attention, and economic benefits its predominantly working-class city was due for its leading role in the film production economy. On closer interrogation, the complaints emanated not from the working-class people whose labor manufactured the films, but instead from the elite businessmen of Culver City, some of whom had nothing to do with the film industry, including G. L. Conaway, who initially proposed the name change. The reference of “Hollywood,” conflating the district with other parts of metropolitan Los Angeles, was a sticking point for Culver City’s businessmen because they were trying to improve the image and attraction of their city with the moniker. Other cities did not protest this conflation. For example, I have found no evidence that Beverly Hills residents cried foul at its mention as Hollywood’s chief residential suburb, and that’s likely because both “Beverly Hills” and “Hollywood” conjure images of glamour and grandeur.</p>
<p>Culver City wanted to cash in with tourists by changing its name to Hollywood, but it is unclear exactly how the city would have been able to do that simply by changing its name, especially given the earlier argument that they were two fundamentally different places. Hollywood was a tourist destination before the film industry arrived. In 1900, entrepreneur Charles M. Pierce offered a guided tour of the suburb via coach from the Hollywood streetcar depot. Later he helmed the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad trolley tour around the metropolis, including Hollywood, known as the Balloon Route Excursion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144211420643">55</xref></sup> Once the film industry arrived and developed its cultural economy, movie premieres grabbed tourists’ attention with spectacles resembling carnivals, illuminated by “klieg lights” innovated by Hollywood Chamber of Commerce President Otto K. Olesen and his lighting company. By the end of the 1920s, out-of-town tourists planned vacations to Hollywood around scheduled movie premieres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144211420643">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role of movie premieres and other facets of the film industry’s cultural economy illustrate how the allure of “Hollywood,” drawing tourists to Hollywood, was part of a colonial economy. While the film industry, by this time, had established Los Angeles as the undisputed center of the production economy—migrating in the early twentieth century from New York and New Jersey—film corporation headquarters and final decision making still emanated from New York. Executives in New York City determined when movie premieres would occur, and hence the resulting spectacles that lured tourists. Historian Hal Rothman described tourism as “the most colonial of colonial economies,” and places that set their sights on dominant tourist economies as entering into “devil’s bargains.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144211420643">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is unclear how aware either the Culver City or Hollywood Chambers of Commerce were in the limited amount of control each had over the tourism and allure of “Hollywood.” While neither may have thought increasing tourism revenue during the Great Depression to be a “devil’s bargain,” later they might. For example, Hollywood’s commercial corridors declined in the postwar period, like most other older urban cores. Despite concerted efforts for more than fifty years for Hollywood to shine once again, only in the past five has Hollywood Boulevard regained its leading edge in tourist traffic—by anchoring the two most famous intersections (Hollywood and Highland and Hollywood and Vine) with global brands in shopping, dining, and luxury hotels. There is less of what made Hollywood unique then now and little left of Hollywood to distinguish it from other global shopping destinations.</p>
<p>Returning to the Culver City Chamber of Commerce agenda, they unveiled the printed petition during a special meeting on June 8. The <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> reported that the chamber ordered three hundred petitions, each with space for ten signatures, to collect the required two thousand signatures from thirty-four hundred registered voters. Chamber members estimated only two days would be needed to collect the signatures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144211420643">58</xref></sup> Also discussed during the special meeting that day was the matter of financing the petition and name change campaign. They declared that no Chamber of Commerce funds should be used, but instead individual members would donate their personal money and accept donations from others for a special fund. This meeting was also the last where the name change was discussed in the minutes, but press coverage continued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144211420643">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, other Culver City community organizations joined in support of the name change. These groups included the Rotary Club, the Lions Club, the Main Street Business Men, the Knights of Pythias, the Washington Boulevard Association, and the American Legion, who had opposed <italic>The Citizen</italic>’s suggestion to change the name three years earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144211420643">60</xref></sup> This time around, they were more than supportive of the name change; they were on the front lines with a petition effort of their own. The <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> reported that the American Legion Culver City Post circulated a competing petition that called for a change in name to “Hollywood” rather than “Hollywood City.” When asked why, a legionnaire explained, “We don’t want no compromise, buddy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144211420643">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Culver City officials were not as enthusiastic as the community organizations about the petition to change the name to “Hollywood City.” Culver City Mayor Arthur Segrell, without tipping his hand to his opinion of the name change, acknowledged that it started as a publicity stunt, but that “it has given the people of Culver City an idea, and there’s no telling how they’ll handle it if a petition is circulated.” Meanwhile, City Attorney Mike Tellifon declared, “I’m against taking Hollywood’s name. It’s morally wrong and legally impossible.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144211420643">62</xref></sup> What happened with either petition is unclear. Culver City municipal records indicate that neither was submitted for official consideration.</p>
<p>While Culver City officials remained on the sidelines in the dispute, the Los Angeles City Council took an active interest in the controversy, doing what it could to protect “Hollywood” as early as June 4, three days after the Culver City Chamber of Commerce’s initial action. On that day, Councilman James M. Hyde presented a resolution to the council in response to the name change suggestion offered by “the gag man who now heads the Chamber of Commerce of Culver City.” Hyde justified his opposition to the proposal, asserting that “it is considered unethical in the picture industry for one who has not attained a full measure of success to attempt to assume the name of one who has made good in a large way.” Furthermore, the resolution declared sardonically,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>That this City Council in loving kindness toward Culver City and in compassion for our sister city now suffering the throes of an inferiority complex does hereby extend its sympathy, and offer its services in aiding the good people of Culver City to change their luck by assuming a suitable name of greater significance, and does hereby suggest to Culver City that it might fittingly call itself MAYERBURG, CRAWFORDSVILLE, GABLE CENTER, or possibly most appropriately “ME TOO”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144211420643">63</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Los Angeles City Council to officially sanction Hollywood with legal boundaries within the city, in a letter dated August 25, the council had been at work on the matter for two months, since June 24.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144211420643">64</xref></sup> On September 20, 1937, the Los Angeles City Council passed Ordinance No. 78499, fixing the legal boundaries for the Hollywood district. The boundaries are very generous at more than six miles between the eastern and western bounds (Hyperion Avenue and the border with Beverly Hills, respectively). The district extends from Melrose Avenue on the south to the Hollywood Hills on the north, including Griffith Park. The Hollywood boundaries were provided by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce as evidenced by the inclusion of the organization’s map, titled “This Is Hollywood,” in a related council petition file (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211420643">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144211420643">65</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The map and the official boundaries include most of West Hollywood, outside the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles. According to correspondence between Carl Bush and Los Angeles County Supervisor John Anson Ford, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce requested the boundaries extend into West Hollywood in the event that the territory be annexed in the future; should that happen, an amendment to the ordinance would not be required for the area to be officially designated Hollywood. At the same time, Bush explained that the chamber had wanted the southern boundary of Hollywood designated as Beverly Boulevard, but there were City Councilmen opposed to such an action, and therefore they compromised with Melrose Avenue. Bush requested that Ford initiate a similar ordinance for the county, declaring official boundaries for Hollywood as far south as Beverly, if possible. The County Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance declaring West Hollywood part of the territory of Hollywood in October 1937.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144211420643">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thirty years later, City Councilman Paul H. Lamport presented a motion, seconded by Arthur K. Snyder, to amend the ordinance and expand the Hollywood boundaries to include Universal City in the San Fernando Valley, north of the Hollywood Hills dividing line. The motion of October 2, 1967, cites Chambers of Commerce and other organizations in the Universal City vicinity as interested in identification with and official inclusion in the Hollywood district. Not everyone in this part of the city approved of the suggestion, however. The North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce sent the council a letter of protest, urging against such “poor districting policy” and that “geographically these properties in North Hollywood are separated from Hollywood, and we see no reason for extending the boundaries.” The Los Angeles City Council Planning Committee, which took up the matter following the initial motion, agreed with the dissenters and took the issue further. They voted to rescind the original boundary ordinance “in fairness” to other communities “well established without any official designation.” Although the Planning Committee saw “no legal reason for the subject ordinance to remain in effect,” the law remains today even though city agencies utilize differing boundaries for Hollywood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144211420643">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>The establishment of official boundaries for Hollywood ended the dispute. On October 4, 1937, the parties decided to hold a formal “bury the hatchet” ceremony. In a scene befitting a film shoot on a studio back lot, representatives of the Hollywood and Culver City Chambers of Commerce arrived at Grauman’s Chinese Theater shortly after noon on October 6, 1937, in a gilded coach drawn by four white horses. The coach followed twenty-six members of the King’s Guard, in costume, from Selznick International Company’s <italic>Prisoner of Zenda</italic>. The parties orchestrated the props, pomp, and circumstance in front of the famed theater and footprints on Hollywood Boulevard for a “bury the hatchet” ceremony. The figurative and literal—an actual hatchet was buried in a cement block—meeting symbolized the end of the four-month-long feud. California Governor Frank Merriam addressed the crowd of onlookers, which included chamber members, high-ranking civic officials, and Selznick staff. The ceremony was broadcast on radio as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144211420643">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just after burying the hatchet, Blaine Walker delivered Hollywood Chamber President Otto Olesen a package containing rolls of film made at the Selnick studio in Culver City labeled “Culver City Presents Hollywood with a Culver City Made Film.” In the end, Walker declared, “We never really wanted the name of Hollywood. All we wanted was to have it recognized we made good pictures in Culver City, too.” Olesen responded, “[T]he 165,000 residents of Hollywood who have enjoyed for fifty years the use of the name appreciate the fine gesture of the men from Culver City.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144211420643">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>What was actually resolved? I have found no evidence that Culver City attempted to change its name again, but to this day, many in Culver City express frustration with the lack of recognition the city has received for its role in film production. Film credits continued to read “Made in Hollywood.” It was not until 1991 when Sony Pictures, after acquiring Columbia Pictures and what remained of MGM’s production facilities in Culver City, first labeled films “Made in Culver City.” And that occurred only because local historian and land-use consultant Julie Lugo Cerra brought the issue to the attention of the studio during the planning process of renovating MGM’s facilities to Sony’s requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144211420643">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The story told above illustrates how the film studios metaphorically planned Los Angeles and how these efforts were contested. To this day—even as films are increasingly produced less in Hollywood or Los Angeles more generally—the name “Hollywood” conjures a district of Los Angeles, the American film industry, the whole Los Angeles metropolis, or perhaps even the entirety of Southern California. This mythical nesting of concepts had to begin somewhere. It began with major film studios promoting the notion of “Hollywood” beyond its initial borders as the production economy decentralized from the cultural economy. Meanwhile, “Hollywood” was not as sure of itself as its boosters would have you believe. Historian Sarah Schrank details how, around the time this dispute raged, powerful individuals in the film industry supported civic arts in Los Angeles to legitimate filmmaking as art and legitimate the film industry “as a mainstream economic force rather than a marginalized immigrant craft.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144211420643">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the film industry—perceived as the region’s monolithic and dominate industry—in reality was unevenly dispersed throughout the metropolis and served as a source of conflict and competition among the cities with production facilities and their boosters. The dispute between the two chambers of commerce, which escalated in the local and national press and involved politicians at the local, county, and state levels, illuminates Los Angeles’s intrametropolitan fragmentation and competition. Political fragmentation in metropolitan Los Angeles has only increased since this controversy, especially in the postwar era. In 1937, there were forty-three incorporated cities in Los Angeles County.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144211420643">72</xref></sup> As of 2010, there are eighty-eight cities. In <italic>City of Quartz</italic>, Mike Davis, who describes “homeowners as potent agents of metropolitan fragmentation,” explains that suburban incorporation in Los Angeles County exploded following the 1950s Lakewood Plan, which permitted the would-be city to contract its vital services to the county at “cut-rate prices.” Subsequently, the city minimized tax burdens and municipal-service costs while maintaining local control over zoning and land use. Many other communities followed Lakewood in this kind of incorporation. Previously, Davis informs, municipal incorporation of small populations were only economically feasible for “a handful of special interests.” For example, upper-class enclaves such as Beverly Hills and San Marino, near Pasadena, “were the first to realize the full potential of zoning law as barbed-wire social fencing around home values.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144211420643">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, Los Angeles has long been fragmented, and remains so today, along the lines of race, class, economics, and cultures (such as ethnic heritage or immigration status). The “Hollywood” name controversy was largely a conflict over economics, which may echo in some respects the contest between San Pedro and Santa Monica for the location of the Port of Los Angeles around the turn of the twentieth century. But these disputes are part of the larger tradition of intrametropolitan conflict that bore postwar neighborhood skirmishes and NIMBYism (“not in my back yard”) that Davis and others chronicle.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is hardly unique when it comes to boundary making, conflict, or competition. While we tend to focus on cities competing at regional, national, and international scales, the local level is often the most contested space. This is so when municipalities find themselves in competition for external economic infusions, such as jobs provided by national or international corporations (which control the film industry) or tourism.</p>
