<p>In <italic>From Africa to America</italic>, Moses O. Biney delivers an ethnographic account of Ghanaian immigration to New York. The book affords insight into the relationship between religion and immigration. Biney addresses the connection between immigration and the church, specifically, the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. This church is not simply an enclave of protection, but a communal space where an interrogation between home culture and American culture takes place. Immigrants are faced with two opposing models of integration: assimilation and multiculturalism. The church becomes a place of conflict and cohesion due to the contradictory nature of immigrants’ experiences. He structures his book around the conflicting and cohesive elements of immigrants’ experiences within and outside of the church.</p>
<p>A series of painful stories and narratives expresses the cultural conflict within the church. The striking accounts are complimented with photographs of the named people and places. The members of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana in New York (PCGNY) come from a Ghanaian homeland that is not monocultural; therefore, the diversity within the congregation leads to leadership, gender, and multigenerational conflict. Biney’s sociological approach to the conflict provides discussion on gender roles, racial identity, and cultural pluralism. Religiously, conflict arises at the crossroads of biblical life guidance and American sociocultural life.</p>
<p>Accounts of successful integration into American culture, while maintaining Ghanaian identity, provide the basis for Biney’s argument of the church as a source of cohesion. He tells the story of one successful Ghanaian American doctor who argues that adaptation strategies, such as gaining legal status and further education, are crucial to success in America. He adds that the church promotes a harmonious communal lifestyle reminiscent of “compound houses” in Ghana. Immigrants’ involvement in the communal lifestyle helps them to avoid feelings of isolation resulting from the harsh American individualism. Theologically, the author describes a Ghanaian belief in a holistic salvation that supports physical as well as spiritual needs.</p>
<p>Biney contends that Ghanaian’s search for survival and adaptation in New York led to the formation of the PCGNY as a spiritual and communal institution. The church has grown from 30 members in the 1980s to over 350 members today; it is religiously, culturally, sociologically, economically, and politically significant to immigrants in New York. Biney’s wealth of theological and sociological knowledge comprises a book worth reading for anyone interested in the relationship of religious institutions to immigration.</p>
