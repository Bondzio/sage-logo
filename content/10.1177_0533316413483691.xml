<abstract>
<p>Different therapeutic modalities have differential value in curing disorders. Group therapy and individual therapy may be complementary rather than alternative approaches; thus in therapeutic reality—both may be a ‘must’ in order for one to develop and get healthy. The unique advantages of small and median groups in the optimal treatment of personal and interpersonal patterns should be used in order to revise our therapy indication system.</p>

<title>Why Group Therapy?</title>
<p>Group therapists often feel very clear about the advantages of their particular approach. Yet it is not always easy to convey the unique benefits that come from participation in groups, especially median groups. Having a clearer indication for different spaces of treatment (individual, groups, couples and family therapy) could help to define the unique contribution of small and median groups.</p>
<sec id="section2-0533316413483691">
<title>Example</title>
<p>Uri, was 40, married with three children, felt internally insecure, anxious and particularly tense whenever he had to meet in a group. These symptoms did not change in spite of two ‘satisfactory’ individual therapies—and in great contrast to his professional success and his social life.</p>

<sec id="section3-0533316413483691">
<title>Group Therapy, Indications and Optimal Treatment</title>
<p>What makes small and median group therapy unique enough to justify a clear indication? How shall therapists be convinced that participation in group therapy is absolutely imperative? We are in need of a good enough indication system, which connects specific disorders with specific treatment strategies. Acute knee pain can be screened and diagnosed so that you know if and when you need either rest for your knee, physiotherapy or an operation. The physician’s suggestions may not be ego-syntonic or understandable to every patient. Nonetheless, patients tend to follow an indication for their optimal therapy.</p>
<p>Similarly, in psychotherapy we should ask: <italic>What</italic> is the disorder that needs to be treated? <italic>What</italic> is the <italic>optimal</italic> therapeutic <italic>space</italic>, and <italic>when</italic> should a specific optimal <italic>space</italic> be recommended?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0533316413483691">
<title>1. <italic>What</italic> Disorder should be Treated?</title>
<p>Should disorders to be treated only be defined in terms of the individual or perhaps they should be defined interpersonally? Classical individual pathologies such as depression or OCD reflect of course the traditional and common approach, although they often are not specific enough to serve as a particular indication for therapy. A narcissistic disorder can feel acceptable in a personal relationship but not in the family network, or vice-versa. And it may not feel acceptable in a group. Other perspectives for optimal therapy may be found in approaches such as psychological mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316413483691">McCallum and Piper, 1990</xref>) or object quality of relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316413483691">McCallum et al., 2003</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0533316413483691">1</xref></sup> In these approaches personal abilities in internal and external relations have been specified and their indication for group therapy have been investigated. I want to suggest another possibility, namely, defining disorders, which are specifically <italic>interpersonal</italic> and <italic>multi-personal</italic>. This will serve the psychotherapist in differentiating between groups, couples, families and individual therapy spaces—and which of these are appropriate treatment modalities for particular disorders.</p>
<sec id="section5-0533316413483691">
<title>Example</title>
<p>Uri was diagnosed as having experienced traumatic ostracism as a teenager, which led to great isolation and hurt. In spite of subsequent, good social development, a sense of basic insecurity remained when engaging with groups; and he needed to periodically retreat into dyadic protection.</p>

<title>Defining Relation Disorders: a Fundamental Turn of Mind</title>
<p>In the evolution of the depth psychologies, psychoanalysis developed in a manner consonant with Freud’s early premises as they presented themselves in classical individual theory. Then, Fairbairn and Balint, the former in Scotland and the latter in Hungary, working from very different starting points, each took the presenting detail of neurotic psychopathology and, in the 1930s, offered clinicians <italic>a fundamental turn of mind</italic>. They suggested that behind the symptomatic picture lay a basic relational problem at the pre-Oedipal level. According to Fairbairn most neurotic symptoms reflected unresolved dependency needs and, according to Balint, a faulty attachment pattern that he called ‘the basic fault’. Out of their fundamental turn of mind, object relations theory was created.</p>
<p>A generation later in the 1950s, Nathan Ackerman, Lyman Wynne and other early family therapists took issue with the existing view of the individual as the ‘unit’ of psychopathology and introduced another <italic>fundamental turn of mind</italic> by citing the attachment itself—the relational bond—as the issue for investigation and therapy. Foulkes worked under the impulse of this same trajectory of revision to bring transpersonal phenomena to the foreground.</p>
<p>I suggest here that it is now possible to propose categories of relational disorder for which group therapy is uniquely suited as the therapy of choice. In order to introduce the concept of relation disorders, we do well to cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316413483691">Foulkes (1975</xref>: 66) ‘ . . . It is not very helpful to speak of individuals in terms of conventional diagnostic labels.’ And further: we ‘ . . . should <italic>treat the “neurotic disturbance, as multipersonal ones”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316413483691">Foulkes, 1975</xref>: 65, my italics)’. ‘. . . transpersonal phenomena goes to the very roots of any approach to group psychology and requires a <italic>fundamental turn of mind</italic> . . .’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316413483691">Foulkes, 1964</xref>: 18). I suggest here a contemporary <italic>fundamental turn of mind</italic> by adding ‘relation disorders’ to our classic definition for individual pathology. Using the complementary optic of multi-personal dysfunctions will not only improve indications for psychotherapy but also facilitate optimal contribution of the different therapeutic spaces<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0533316413483691">2</xref></sup>, e.g. most of the following relation disorders may not even appear in the dyadic therapeutic space.</p>
<p>Relation disorders are multi-personal dysfunctional patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316413483691">Friedman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316413483691">2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413483691">2007</xref>). They are categories of reciprocal emotional and behaviour patterns detectable in society and group therapy. These disorders are co-created, interpersonal dysfunctions patterns, which are the result of a failure of all involved parties, e.g., failure to contain strong emotions, such as separation anxieties and needs for inclusion and aggression. The following are preliminary descriptions of interpersonal dysfunctions, categories of disorders based on Agazarian’s research of group functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413483691">Agazarian, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>A. In the <italic>Deficiency Relation Disorder</italic> there is an inability of the participants to contain the duality between weakness and strength in oneself and others. A group participant or a subgroup will feel chronically deficient, communicating anxious, depressive and inferiority messages in the interaction with others who are fixated by feelings of being functional, powerful and helpful. The split between what is called in family therapy ‘the Identified Patient’ and its counterpart: ‘the Identified Caretaker’ will often immobilize a group’s relations and create chronic pathology.</p>
<p>B. The <italic>Rejection</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0533316413483691">3</xref></sup> <italic>Relation Disorder</italic> results from an inability to contain the group’s aggression. Increasingly strong fantasized violence between a rejecting subgroup and an inclusion-starved individual may be acted out. Additional processes such as the tendency to scapegoat without guilt and shame on the one hand and the scapegoat’s increasing neediness to be included becomes surprisingly strong. The complementary relationship between rejected and rejecters in school classes and closed societies are pathogenic in more ways than one. These tendencies increase as modern communication makes it possible to reject facelessness.</p>
<p>C. By <italic>Relation Disorders of the Self</italic> a pathological relationship is specified, in which social over-identification results in an under-development of an autonomic, mature Self. Selfless ‘heroes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413483691">Agazarian, 1994</xref>) and their ‘selfish’ counterparts collude (in a gender-wise, different way) to serve the ‘cause’ while harming themselves and others. While women and men are educated to selflessly offer their lives for their families, communities and jobs, they become obsessively preoccupied with the sense of heroic using, and being misused by society, while also using and misusing others at the same time. This under-development affects the genders differently in contents, while presenting similar processes of harm to the Self.</p>
<p>D. In the <italic>Exclusion Relation Disorder</italic>, the core of a society does not wish to destroy individuals or subgroups but nonetheless acts to marginalize them. This phenomenon becomes a chronic illness for a group or society when the excluded accept marginalization, and no movement between the centre and margins is possible. Symptoms, which resemble a depression or an OCD may develop, resulting in a generally less than optimal level of energy, productivity and satisfaction in the whole group. Different ethnic groups, as well as ‘different’ people, such as women (still), homosexuals, ex-convicts, the poor and black, the ex-psychotic and many other communities are included in chronic marginalization. Good enough psychic adjustments must include membership in small groups that move from the margins to the centre and back again and can create a significant output. All forms of dysfunctional relations with the centre may be transformed in small, median or large groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316413483691">de Maré, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316413483691">Pisani, 2000</xref>). Only mutual changes of all involved will result in a movement to health.</p>
<sec id="section7-0533316413483691">
<title>Example</title>
<p>Uri went through group analysis, in which he worked mainly on three dysfunctional patterns consecutively:</p>
<p>His panic about becoming a scapegoat was elaborated in the relations between him and the group.</p>
<list id="list1-0533316413483691" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Mutual tendencies to avoid and reject along with a longing for irrational inclusion were worked through.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Later, the ambivalence about being a ‘weak’ person and maintaining a strong facade in the group were elaborated in connection with deficient relation disorders.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The characteristic pathological interactions were uniquely re-enacted in the group where they could eventually be appropriately treated, promoting a better circumscribed Indication. Eventually, Uri and the group succeeded in enlarging their freedom to choose a ‘hero’, or to selflessly give some of their own space away.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0533316413483691">
<title>2. <italic>What</italic> is the <italic>Optimal</italic> Therapeutic <italic>Space</italic>?</title>
<p>For many reasons, <italic>relation disorders, characterized by dysfunctional patterns, need to be treated where they were created.</italic> In group analysis, the human need to re-enact patterns is treated through ‘ego training in action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316413483691">Foulkes,1968</xref>: 181). Differentiating between the <italic>presence</italic> of a dysfunctional pattern and the <italic>therapeutic value</italic> of a specific space helps us to answer the question: When is the median group indicated as optimal treatment for relation disorders?</p>
<p>From my clinical experience I would say that at least three relation disorders (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th) will be uniquely (re-)enacted in small and median groups. Because of the need to intervene with all the sides that <italic>reciprocally</italic> contribute to conflict, median groups will be most efficient in the elaboration of the 3rd and 4th relation disorder (small groups probably more on the 1st and 2nd RDs). The possibility of elaboration will vary according to the intensity of the affects, e.g., hate, envy. The measure of destructive feelings and motivation or amount of emotional dysfunction will influence the optimal size of a working group for the treatment of relation disorders.</p>
<p>In Israel we have learned that for the treatment of social traumata, median group is clearly the optimal curing space. Experiences after the Second Lebanese War, when the North of Israel was in the process of recovering from the traumatic impact of thousands of rockets, have demonstrated that median groups were particularly efficient in working through feelings of exclusion, helplessness and defensive over-identification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0533316413483691">
<title>3. <italic>When</italic> will a specific optimal <italic>Space</italic> be recommended?</title>
<p>Most potential patients prefer to start with individual therapy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0533316413483691">4</xref></sup>. Newcomers to therapy are rather vulnerable and fear what they imagine will be group non-containment and lack of protection. When we feel acutely bad, we automatically shout: ‘Mamma’ and not: ‘Parents’ or ‘Family!’ The longing for care, soothing and protection in dyadic-kinds of therapy are connected with emotional experiences in the early mother–child relationship. Thus, rather than weigh a deeper or more specific Indication that would include median or small group therapy, we habitually turn to the unconscious promise of the individual therapy setting. I am suggesting, in a fundamental turn of mind, that we begin to adopt a two-step indications approach. This means that we should accept that the majority of patients will start therapy in the dyadic space. However, soon afterward, it would be wise for therapist and patient to consider group therapy as a next optimal treatment step. To bring about change in multi-personal dysfunctions, the group therapy space offers optimal possibilities.</p>

<p>PM is defined as the ability to identify conflictual dynamic components, e.g, wishes, anxiety, defences, and to relate them to a person’s difficulties. OQR is defined as a person’s tendency to establish certain kinds of relationships with others. It refers to the quality of a person’s lifelong pattern of relationships, not just current or recent relationships. Interviewers assess a contender for therapy by looking at five levels of relationships: mature, triangular, controlling, searching, and primitive.</p>
