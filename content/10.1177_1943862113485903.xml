<p>The objective of this article is to study the impact of Hindustani ragas on the cognitive functions of the right and left cerebral hemispheres, especially of the parieto-occipital lobe, in patients with cerebrovascular accident and diffuse head injury. A randomized control trial was conducted. The case group consisted of 30 patients who received both medicine and ragas, while the control group of 30 patients received only medicine. A total of 10 Hindustani ragas were taken up, and 4 follow-ups with baseline were conducted. Nahor-Benson test, a subtest of the Post Graduate Institute–Battery for Brain Dysfunction, was used at different time intervals. Univariate repeated measures analysis revealed significant differences between the 2 groups at different time intervals, confirming that listening to ragas improved visual perceptual acuity, spatial orientation, and the cognitive functions involving both right and left hemispheres of the case group patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article focuses on randomized control trial that was conducted to assess the impact of Hindustani ragas (North Indian Ragas) on patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and diffuse head injury (DHI) during a rehabilitation phase, at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi, India. The study found that, in addition to medicine, listening to ragas played a vital role in improving the cognitive impairment of the patients in the rehabilitation phase (after the patient is stabilized). This study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC), RIMS, Ranchi, India. A raga, the nucleus of Indian classical music (both Hindustani and Carnatic), may be defined as a melodic structure with fixed notes and a set of rules characterizing a certain mood conveyed by performance. By “a set of rules” we mean the typical way the permissible musical notes are to be used in the raga, the typical note combinations, the <italic>aroh–awaroh</italic> (ascent–descent) pattern to be followed, and so on. These rules help in characterizing the raga mood.<sup>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>There is a limited amount of valid clinical research material from which substantive and scientific conclusions can be drawn on the impact of music with this population. In many cases, neurological diseases become traumatic because of their abrupt appearance, resulting in physical and/or mental impairment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1943862113485903">2</xref>
</sup> Music appears to be a key in the recovery of former capabilities in the light of what at first seems to present as a hopeless neurological devastation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1943862113485903">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1943862113485903"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1943862113485903">5</xref>
</sup> For some patients with brain damage following head trauma, the problem may be temporary, such as a loss of speech (aphasia). Music therapy has been shown to play a valuable role in the aphasia rehabilitation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1943862113485903">6</xref>
</sup> A good account of research findings about the neurobiological foundation of rhythm and the brain, with a thrust on how music and rhythm can affect both musical and nonmusical brains can be found in Thaut’s work that provides a therapeutic methodology of neurologic music therapy dealing extensively with clinical techniques and implementations in rehabilitation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1943862113485903">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Much more information about music therapy in the context of Indian music is also developing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1943862113485903">8</xref>
</sup> Music therapy has a positive effect on mood in poststroke patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1943862113485903">9</xref>
</sup> Music therapy, used in rehabilitation phase, has been shown to stimulate brain functions involved in emotion, cognition, speech, and sensory perception.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1943862113485903">10</xref>
</sup> In a study on the mechanism of music therapy through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), unpleasant music showed activation of the limbic and paralimbic systems (the centers of feelings), but pleasant music stimulated the inferior frontal gyrus and Rolandic operculum that reflect working memory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1943862113485903">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Such results seem to indicate that music therapy can intervene with feelings through the stimulation and nonstimulation of these structures, and it appears that music can enhance functional abilities by inspiring motivation for rehabilitation treatment through improvement in depression and anxiety. Music is a multimodal stimulus that activates many brain structures related to sensory processing, attention, and memory and can stimulate complex cognition and multisensory integration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1943862113485903">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1943862113485903"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1943862113485903">14</xref>
</sup> After stroke, listening daily to self-selected music may improve verbal memory and attention. Music listening during the early poststroke stage can enhance cognitive recovery and prevent negative mood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1943862113485903">14</xref>
</sup> Significant improvements in speech-in-noise perception have been attained in adult individuals with no prior music training but with a training program that incorporated cognitively based listening exercises to improve speech-in-noise perception.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1943862113485903">15</xref>
</sup> Music listening could be considered a useful clinical tool in stroke rehabilitation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1943862113485903">16</xref>
</sup> Listening to pleasant music can have a short-term facilitating effect on visual awareness in patients with visual neglect, which is associated with functional coupling between emotional and attention area of brain regions. Second, daily music listening can improve auditory and verbal memory, focused attention, and mood as well as induce structural gray matter changes in the early poststroke stage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1943862113485903">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is no great deal of research that reflects the impact of Indian music. Although some descriptions are available about the impact of raga therapy, in-depth scientific research in Indian music especially from a therapeutic angle is still at a beginning stage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1943862113485903">18</xref>
</sup> Indian music therapy is an integration of ancient healing practices and musical traditions coupled with the recent modifications derived from the modern-day practice and the knowledge gained by current clinical studies undertaken.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1943862113485903">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Cerebrovascular accidents, traumatic brain damage, and congenital brain anomalies can lead to selective disorders of music processing. However, brain specialization for music should not be equated with the presence of a single “musical center” in the brain. Rather, multiple interconnected neural networks are engaged, of which some may capture the essence of brain specialization for music. The encoding of pitch along musical scales is an essential component. The implications of the existence of such special-purpose cortical processes are that the human brain might be hardwired for music. This valuable resource of evidence is suggestive of the existence of neural networks in brain, which are dedicated to music.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1943862113485903">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Notably, music therapy is showing significant results in the rehabilitation of patients with stroke and Parkinson disease. However, the author has suggested the need for more rigorous studies based on clear procedures and strong methodological research criteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1943862113485903">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A study giving special attention to the perception of components of music processing, music structure, laterality effects, cultural issues, links between music and movement, emotional processing, expertise, and amusias demonstrated the important role that music can play in forming broad theories of higher order cognitive processes, such as music, in humans.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1943862113485903">23</xref>
</sup> The incorporation of music into rehab training significantly improved both the objective measures of hand motor performance and the self-ratings of motivation for training in a single session.<sup>

<title>Objective</title>
<p>The objective of our study was to understand the possible impact that Hindustani ragas might have on visual perceptual acuity, spatial orientation, and the cognitive functions involving both right and left hemispheres in patients with CVA and DHI.</p>
<sec id="section4-1943862113485903" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A randomized control trial was conducted to assess the impact of Hindustani ragas in patients with CVA and DHI, during the rehabilitation phase, at RIMS, Ranchi, in collaboration with the Birla Institute of Technology (BIT), Mesra, Ranchi, India. A total of 60 patients 18 years of age or older, were recruited for this study. Rapport was established, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients or the head of his or her family. Baseline data were collected from all 60 patients. A case group (hereafter referred to as music group) of 30 patients were those to whom both medicine and prerecorded Hindustani ragas were administered, while the control group of 30 patients received medicine only. Ten Hindustani ragas were selected for the music group patients as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1943862113485903">Table 1</xref>, along with their suitable time of rendition. The intervention began on an average after 15 days only when the Glasgow Coma scale (GCS) score was recorded to be greater than 8, indicating that the patient was out of the life-threatening phase. The statisticians and the medical professionals were blinded for this study to reduce the researcher biasness. While the statisticians were involved with the analysis part, it is the medical professionals who are authorized to do the treatment of the patients, and hence the medical professionals are truly credited with data collection.</p>

<title>Intervention of Music Therapy</title>
<p>The patients in the music group were subjected to both medicine and music therapy (Hindustani ragas), while the patients in the control group were given medicine only. A prerecorded cassette and a cassette player along with a headset were used for listening to ragas. All cassettes, cassette players, and headsets used by the patients in the music group were identical and of the same company. The patients were subjected to each of the previously mentioned ragas for a duration of 20 minutes every day, for up to 6 months (total of 3 hours 20 minutes each day for all the 10 ragas), per their convenience but within the time of day as mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1943862113485903">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>While listening to the ragas, the patients were instructed to follow certain steps as listed here:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>closing their eyes;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>focusing on the breathing process by placing their hands on the abdomen; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>listening to the raga intently.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>For the patients who were unfamiliar with ragas, some songs based on a particular raga (even songs from movies) were played first before the raga itself. The idea is to get the patient acclimatized to the raga mood by listening to something familiar and related. Here selecting a movie song randomly will not help as the song has to be related to the raga. Although one of the researchers knows classical music and could easily do the song selection, we took the services of a DMus (vocal) artist (from Banaras Hindu University) who is not related to our research, in an attempt to reduce the researcher’s bias. Further, the song to be used for a specific patient was selected by lottery from the list of songs. For example, the songs “Chingari koi bhadke” sung by Kishore Kumar in the Bollywood movie <italic>Amar Prem</italic> and the song “Jyot se jyot jagate chalo” sung by Mukesh in another Bollywood movie <italic>Sant Gyaneshwar</italic>, both based on the raga Bhairavi, were in the list. But we decided by lottery which patient would listen to which of the 2 songs.</p>
<p>The patients were given liberty to adjust the music sound (volume, etc) per their liking. They were also encouraged to use their vocal cords through gentle murmurs. The patients in both the music group and the control group were observed, and the patients in the music group were helped to listen to the ragas directly during their stay in the hospital. Before discharge, the patients were again trained regarding the specific period of the day for listening to specific raga, duration of listening to each raga, and proper way of listening to each raga as mentioned earlier, so that they would follow the listening protocol at home.</p>
<p>The strategy behind the choice of the ragas in the present study is that the benefits of some of these ragas were explored in earlier studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1943862113485903">18</xref>
</sup> For example, <italic>Ahir Bhairav</italic> relieves stress-related disorders. <italic>Bhairav</italic> is thought to help in anger management, bringing down the excitement. <italic>Bageshree</italic> works well in sleep disorder. <italic>Yaman</italic>, being a restful raga, brings relaxation. <italic>Todi</italic> has been found to be useful in the treatment of hysteria, while <italic>Bhairavi</italic> works well for a number of maladies from sinusitis to cancer. <italic>Pilu</italic> tackles depression. The present study was expected to reconfirm the utilities of all these 7 ragas as well as explore the other 3, namely, <italic>Bilaval</italic>, <italic>Bhimpalashree</italic>, and <italic>Multani</italic> for possible therapeutic effects on such patients. Each raga is closely related to the specific part of the day, according to changes in nature and development of a particular emotion, mood, or sentiment in the human mind.</p>
<p>Since a higher frequency is beneficial rather than harmful (unlike higher doses of drugs that exhibit side-effects), the patients in the music group were subjected to each of the 10 ragas for a duration of 20 minutes only every day within the previously mentioned time of the day per their convenience, for a duration of 6 months. The choice of 20 minutes although subjective was necessitated primarily due to 2 factors: (1) the duration should not be too short as the raga atmosphere takes some time to build, and (2) the duration should not be too long either that it becomes taxing for the patients.</p>

<sec id="section9-1943862113485903">
<title>Nahor-Benson Test</title>
<p>It is one of the components of Post Graduate Institute–Battery for Brain Dysfunction (PGI-BBD), consisting of 8 cards (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1943862113485903">Appendix</xref>). Of these, 5 cards contain a design each and 3 cards contain the instructions to be followed. Cards 1 to 5 decide the perceptual acuity that will be disturbed depending upon the extent of lesion in the right parieto-occipital region. The last 3 cards (6 to 8), where instructions are to be read, understood, and executed, will involve the left hemisphere and disturbance in transference from left to right. Thus, this test provides for simultaneous assessment of cognitive behavior of both hemispheres of the brain. Generally, drawing tests measure the functioning of the right hemisphere related to parieto-occipital lobe.</p>
<p>Patients were asked to copy the design of the cards 1 to 5 one by one. Patients were asked to follow the instructions on cards 6 to 8. Scoring is given on the basis of the “all or none” law; that is, either a design is correct or it is incorrect. Each incorrect drawing was given a score of 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1943862113485903">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A template for data entry was generated in MS Excel 2007 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington), and 10% data were randomly checked to assure the quality of data. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we checked the normality of data on dysfunction score of Nahor-Benson test (N.B. test) in different follow-ups. Univariate repeated measures analysis (URMA) using a split plot design was used to see whether the dysfunction score of N.B. test was statistically significant between the 2 groups in different follow-ups. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Experimental Results</title>
<p>A total of 60 patients were studied. The majority of the patients were male (37 out of 60 [61.7%]). The average age of the patients was 55.5 years. Regarding the education status, it was found that the majority (54 out of 60 [90%]) of the patients were fifth standard passed. The details of the sociodemographic profile of the patients are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1943862113485903">Table 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1943862113485903">Table 4</xref> shows that the data were normally distributed in baseline as well as in all the 4 follow-ups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1943862113485903">Table 5</xref> shows that the mean of dysfunction rating score (DRS) of N.B. test before music therapy in both the music group and the control group was 3.00. The mean score after music therapy came down to 0.533, indicating a fall of 2.47 after the fourth follow-up, whereas in the control group, the score came down to 1.47, indicating a decrease of 1.53 only, which is comparatively less. This means the recovery rate is faster in the music group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1943862113485903">Figure 2</xref>). The recovery rate is also statistically significant in the fourth follow-up, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1943862113485903">Table 5</xref>.</p>

<p>The URMA using a split plot design revealed that the <italic>F</italic> statistic for dysfunction scores of N.B. test is 67.719, which is significant between the groups (<italic>P</italic> value = .000). This is for the group effect. Both the follow-up effect and the interaction effect between follow-up and group effects (indicated in the table as follow-up × group effect) use the error mean square as the error term. The <italic>F</italic> statistic for the follow-up effect is 319.303, which is significant (<italic>P</italic> = .000). The <italic>F</italic> statistic for follow-up × group effect is 19.599, which is also significant (<italic>P</italic> = .000; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1943862113485903">Table 6</xref>). Significance of the <italic>F</italic> statistic for the group effect implies the better response of the group given the combined treatment of medicine and music. Significance of the <italic>F</italic> statistic of the follow-up effects indicates the recovery rate of the patients in both groups gets better and better significantly with more and more follow-ups, but the important and interesting finding is that the interaction (group × follow-up) effect is also significant, substantiating the fact that the recovery rate is faster in the music group with follow-ups compared to the control group, which is a very positive sign that goes in favor of the therapeutic value of Hindustani ragas.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Further research is needed in the field of raga therapy before it can be formalized into a definite prescription for the patients. Until then, a balanced approach to understand and explore the role and effect of raga therapy seems necessary. In India, music therapy has not received as much attention as in the West. The Medical Council of India has so far not recognized music therapy as a branch of modern medicine, necessitating all the more effort for using an appropriate music scientifically. Despite its rich traditions in raga and yoga, strangely, India is very much lagging behind in such pursuits. The current research may be helpful in substantiating our existing knowledge of music therapy.</p>
<p>We studied the impact of Hindustani ragas on patients with CVA and DHI. The levels of cognitive functions of both hemispheres of the brain were found to be significantly improved as compared to control group as a result of music intervention. Furthermore, music reduced the time of recovery in the music group patients. These findings are similar to previous studies, showing that improvement on the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia correlated mostly with the recovery of focused attention, verbal memory, visuospatial perception, and attention in music patients from the acute stage to the 3-month poststroke stage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1943862113485903">25</xref>
</sup> In our study, we found that the improvement in visual acuity, spatial orientation, and cognitive functions involving both hemispheres is faster in the music group with follow-ups than that in the control group. It was also found that Hindustani ragas progressively improved the cognitive functions of the memory of patients with CVA and DHI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1943862113485903">26</xref>
</sup> The MST to patients with stroke resulted in marked improvement in movement quality, as assessed by the 3-dimensional movement analysis. Moreover, fMRI of a sequential hand movement revealed distinct therapy-related changes in the form of a reduction in excess contralateral and ipsilateral activations. This was accompanied by changes in cortical excitability evidenced by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Functional MRI in a music listening task suggests that one of the effects of MST is the task-dependent coupling of auditory and motor cortical areas.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The URMA revealed that improvement in visual acuity, spatial orientation, and cognitive functions involving both right and left hemispheres is faster in the music group with follow-ups than that in the control group. It is a positive sign that goes in favor of the therapeutic value of Hindustani ragas. Hence, this study concludes that Hindustani ragas as a therapeutic tool may act as a catalyst in improving cognitive functions of both hemispheres of the brain in patients with CVA and DHI. However, further studies are required in this field.</p>
