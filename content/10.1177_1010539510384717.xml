<abstract>
<p>In developing countries, where about 75% of births occur at home or in the community, logistic problems prevent the weighing of every newborn child. This study compares various anthropometric surrogates for identification of low birth weight neonates. A longitudinal community based study was done in an urban resettlement colony and 283 singleton neonates within 7 days of birth were examined for the anthropometric measurements such as head, chest, mid upper arm circumference and foot length as a screening tool for low birth weight. Chest circumference measured within 7 days of birth appeared to be the most appropriate surrogate of low birth weight with highest sensitivity (75.4%), specificity (78.4%), and positive predictive value (48.9%) as compared with other anthropometric parameters. Low birth weight neonates in absence of weighing scales can be early identified by using simple anthropometric measurements for enhanced home-based care and timely referral.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Of 26 million infants born in India each year, 7.8 million are born with low birth weight (LBW), accounting for about 40% of the global burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384717">1</xref></sup> LBW contributes to neonatal and childhood mortality and morbidity, impedes growth, development and intellectual performance during childhood and has been also linked to adult diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384717">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384717">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Birth weight is a reliable and sensitive indicator for predicting the immediate or later outcome of a newborn child. In Third World countries like India, recording every birth weight has always been a problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref></sup> Almost 60% to 70% of births occur at home or in the community and are attended by birth attendants or relatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510384717">5</xref></sup> Even for deliveries in primary health care centers, there is often a paucity of suitable weighing scales. In developing countries, where about 75% of births occur at home or in the community, logistic problems prevent the weighing of every newborn child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus there exists a need of objective methods for calculation of appropriateness of birth weight that are simple, low priced, reliable, and acceptable in a community-based setting which can be easily used by field workers. This study was performed to see whether other simple measurements such as mid upper arm circumference (MUAC), head circumference (HC), chest circumference (CC), and foot length (FL) could be substituted for birth weight to identify neonates of low birth weight. These circumferences can be easily measured by community based workers in field setting using a flexible fiberglass tape.</p>
<p>National Family Health Survey is a large-scale multiround survey conducted in a representative sample of households throughout India and provides estimates of indicators of population, health, and nutrition by background characteristics at the national and state levels. The third National Family Health Survey, India (NFHS-3) has reported that less than 40% of mothers received postnatal care from any health personnel within 48 hours of delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510384717">5</xref></sup> Thus, postnatal care within 48 hours of birth though important is not generally being widely carried out because of operational difficulties in field in India and other similar settings.</p>
<p>Low birth weight accounts for 60% to 80% of neonatal deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510384717">6</xref></sup> and 75% of these deaths happen in the first week after birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384717">7</xref></sup> Most deaths in moderately preterm neonates and in those born at term, but whose growth had been restricted in utero, can be prevented with extra attention to warmth, feeding, and prevention or early treatment of infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510384717">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510384717">10</xref></sup> Complex technology is not a prerequisite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510384717">11</xref></sup> Extra home visits must be made to these neonates and mothers must be educated about administering of essential interventions like “Kangaroo Mother Care,” early initiation of breast feeding, and recognizing danger signs (eg, apnea, decreased movements, lethargy, and poor feeding) to avert development of any complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510384717">12</xref></sup> Thus, in case of home deliveries it is desirable that LBW neonates are identified at least within 1 week of delivery and in those with no serious illness special considerations for feeding, fluid management, and maintenance of normal body temperature in home settings is given. Also, it has been reported that in situations where the birth weight cannot be recorded, the weight of the neonates taken within the first week after birth may be reliably used to assess the “birth weight,” particularly in relation to categorization as LBW.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510384717">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study was thus carried out to compare the weight and other anthropometric variables of the neonate measured within 1 week of delivery with the objective of identifying a surrogate parameter that is simple, reliable, and can be easily used for screening of LBW neonates in a community setting.</p>

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539510384717">
<title>Study Area</title>
<p>The study was done at a resettlement colony in an area of East Delhi, India. The area consists of 10 blocks, each with 280 to 500 houses with population of each block ranging from 1426 to 3297. The total population in the area was 25 127 (Census, 2001). Considering the average annual exponential growth rate of Delhi to be 3.81,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510384717">14</xref></sup> the population in 2006 was estimated to be about 30 000.</p>
<p>A number of public and private health agencies exist in the area providing both inpatient and outpatient care. Home deliveries are also conducted by both trained as well as untrained traditional birth attendants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539510384717">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A community-based longitudinal study was carried out from January to December 2006. This study compared the value of HC, CC, MUAC, and FL as a screening tool for LBW.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539510384717">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The study subjects comprised newborns of pregnant women who were identified after conducting door-to-door visits. The estimated population of the study area was approximately 30 000. Applying crude birth rate for Delhi (20 per 1000 population)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384717">15</xref></sup> and 10% of average pregnancy loss, the number of pregnancies in a year in the area were expected to be around 660. Pregnant women were enrolled prospectively from January to June 2006. This group was then followed for remaining half of the year till December 2006.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539510384717">
<title>Method</title>
<p>All pregnant women in the community were contacted and a record of last menstrual period and expected date of delivery of the registered women was maintained.</p>
<p>All efforts were made to visit newborns within 7 days of birth to ensure uniform time of visit. For this, the help of <italic>anganwadi</italic> workers (<italic>anganwadi</italic> is a government-sponsored mother and child care center in India where a female worker chosen from the community and trained in various aspects of health, nutrition, and child development provides services), traditional birth attendants, and informal women leaders in the area was sought and regular telephonic communication was done with them to track the deliveries of enrolled pregnant women.</p>
<p>A total of 358 pregnant women were registered in the study area. Out of all deliveries, 283 live born singleton neonates could be assessed in the planned time for the study. Anthropometric measurements, namely, weights, HC, CC, MUAC, and FL were recorded for all 283 neonates. In case of hospital deliveries, the records available with the mother were also examined at the time of visit. In case of any clinical complaints, necessary advice was given and referral was made as per the need.</p>
<p>The MUAC was measured at the midpoint between the tip of the acromion and the olecranon process in the left upper arm. CC was obtained at the level of the xiphisternum and below the inferior angle of the scapula during quiet respiration. HC was measured by passing the tape between the supra orbital ridges and the maximum occipital prominence. FL was measured on the plantar aspect between tip of great toe and end of heel. Anthropometric indices were measured using a flexible fiberglass tape. All the newborns were also weighed naked or in minimal clothing using a Salter’s spring type scale to the nearest 50 g using standard techniques. Same instrument by single investigator was used to weigh all the neonates and it was corrected for zero error before each measurement. Salter (hanging type) scale is commonly used in India and other settings to measure weight of infants in community especially in case of home deliveries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384717">16</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539510384717">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A pretested, semistructured schedule was used for data collection. SPSS 16.0 software was used for data analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated to compare anthropometric parameters as screening tool for LBW neonates in a community setting. Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of LBW neonates who were tested positive by anthropometric indices measurement whereas specificity was defined as the proportion of neonates who are not LBW and were tested negative by anthropometric indices measurement. Positive predictive value for anthropometric parameters indicated the probability that a neonate with positive test result in fact had LBW. Standard statistical methods of linear regression and correlation were applied to analyze the data.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539510384717" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 358 pregnant women, only 300 could be contacted within 7 days of birth. The remaining 58 women could not be contacted as many of them had either shifted their residence from the study area or had gone to their home village or relatives to seek social support for delivery. Two women reported giving birth to twins and adverse pregnancy outcome occurred in 15 women with 8 (2.7%) abortions, 6 (2%) still births, and 1 (0.3%) neonate with congenital abnormality. These fetal outcomes were excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510384717">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the anthropometric indices of 283 live born singleton neonates were analyzed for the study purpose. Of these neonates, 52.2% were male and 44.9% were female. In our study, there were no significant differences in birth weight and anthropometric measurements between male and female newborns. Therefore we analyzed the combined data for both genders.</p>

<p>The study was conducted in an urban resettlement colony of East Delhi with the objective of comparing various anthropometric measurements as a screening tool for LBW neonates. Many hospital-based studies have reported the utility of anthropometric measurements to screen for LBW neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510384717">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510384717">20</xref></sup> Different studies have identified various anthropometric measurements such as MUAC and CC as the most useful predictors of LBW. There exists a paucity of community-based studies that use these indices as a screening tool for LBW in field settings especially for home-based deliveries. Most of previously conducted studies are hospital based and thus enables the researcher to measure birth weight and other anthropometric indices in a standardized time interval soon after birth, for example, up to 48 hours after birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510384717">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510384717">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study evaluated the validity of various anthropometric indices in detecting LBW neonates within 7 days of birth because in developing countries there are limited opportunities for community-based workers to visit mother and child within 48 hours of delivery. The optimal indicator to be used as surrogate for birth weight should have the highest sensitivity to detect a good proportion of at risk neonates. Also, greater specificity is required so that unnecessary referrals do not pose avoidable burden on health centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384717">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, the cut-off points for MUAC, CC, and HC were 10 cm, 31.5 cm, and 33.5 cm, respectively. These correlated well with neonate weight &lt;2500 g in first 7 days with optimum sensitivity and specificity. Studies in other parts of India and neighboring countries reported cut-off points for arm circumference as 8.5 cm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384717">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510384717">22</xref></sup> 8.7 cm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref></sup> 9 cm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510384717">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510384717">25</xref></sup>, 9.1 cm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510384717">26</xref></sup> and 9.75 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510384717">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>For CC, the cut-off point reported from other Indian studies varied between 29.5 and 30 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384717">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510384717">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510384717">26</xref></sup> Taksande et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510384717">18</xref></sup> reported an HC of 33.25 cm as the cut-off point for identifying LBW neonates.</p>
<p>A study from Nepal reported that CC was superior to FL as an anthropometric surrogate to identify LBW neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510384717">27</xref></sup> However, this study did not compare other anthropometric surrogates with birth weight to select an optimal surrogate. None of the studies reported earlier have compared FL with birth weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510384717">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510384717">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510384717">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510384717">28</xref></sup> FL in our study varied between 7.5 and 8.0 cm. Although quite specific, this was not very sensitive, and thus cannot be recommended for screening of LBW neonates in the community. (FL &lt; 7.5 cm, 57.5% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity with 40.3% positive predictive value and at FL &lt; 8 cm, 41% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity with 56.1% positive predictive value).</p>
<p>All the previously reported studies measured anthropometric indices within 48 hours of birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384717">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510384717">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510384717">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510384717">28</xref></sup> This time period is difficult to replicate in community settings. The anthropometric cut-off points reported here are 0.25 to 1.5 cm more than other studies, which are mainly hospital based and measure birth weight and anthropometric indices within 48 hours of birth. Further studies are needed in the field to cross-validate our results.</p>
<p>Chest circumference appears as the most appropriate surrogate measure for birth weight. Similar findings were reported by other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384717">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510384717">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510384717">28</xref></sup> Also, CC can be conveniently measured in community settings because identification of nipple line is easy and reliable, making measurement more operationally feasible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510384717">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current study shows that chest circumference is a simple, quick, and valid screening tool for identifying LBW neonates in a community setting where there are problems of nonavailability of weighing scales. These measurements can be easily incorporated into the training sessions of paramedical workers and field-based volunteers to detect neonates at high risk and those who need referral for additional care. This can enhance and improve the safety of supervised home-based care and ensure timely referral in case of need.</p>
