<p>Sacrifice and dignity, though not opposites, appear to point in opposite theoretical directions. Sacrifice refers to what we give or offer up, sometimes willingly, sometimes under pressure. Sacrifice “modifies the condition of the moral person who accomplishes it or that of certain objects with which he is concerned.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0090591712470629">1</xref></sup> In contrast, dignity refers to what we should honor and respect in ourselves and others, come what may, or the particular way we should honor or respect ourselves and others. While sacrifice transforms, dignified and dignifying actions preserve and respect.</p>
<p>What spark could possibly fly by rubbing these two divergent concepts together? We might learn something about what happens when we sacrifice or are forced to sacrifice our dignity. Each of these small but very original volumes covers quite a bit of ground, not all of which will be surveyed here. Instead, I want to use their arguments to address the intersection of sacrifice and dignity through the explosive topics of self-sacrifice and suicide.</p>
<p>For Halbertal, the proliferation of violent self-sacrifice should not be understood as the work of irrational zealots. There is a method to the madness implicit in these acts of self-sacrifice that has precursors in ancient Judaism and early Christianity and that runs just below the surface in the “sacrificial logic” of modern doctrines of just war, political obligation, and political legitimacy. This undercurrent, Halbertal argues, has only recently emerged as a riptide pulling hard against the solidarity and love that the language of sacrifice promises. “Self-sacrifice, in all its subtleties and complexities, enables violence because it allows a role reversal between the aggressor and victim. The contemporary suicide bomber . . . is simultaneously initiating an act of self-sacrifice and murder. He constitutes himself as the victim of the violence that he is perpetrating” (74). According to Halbertal, one reason we have lost sight of these complex connections between sacrifice and violence is that we have been distracted by the distinction between self-interest and self-transcendence that moral theorists, inspired by Kant, have placed at the center of Western political discourse. The real moral challenge, according to Halbertal, is not how to transcend self-interest but rather how to distinguish between worthy acts of self-transcendence and “misguided” acts of self-sacrifice which, through a series of “reversals,” appear to legitimate hideous atrocities.</p>
<p>In contrast, Michael Rosen wants to re-center political theory around a moral duty to the self: the duty to recognize the dignity of timeless moral personhood. However, he too is critical of moral theorists, at least modern and contemporary thinkers, following Schopenhauer, who have dismissed dignity as the “shibboleth of all empty-headed moralists” (1). In order to defend dignity, he retraces its path through the history of moral theory, also emphasizing Kant and contemporary Kantians, and juxtaposing this secular moral tradition against modern Catholic doctrines. These secular and religious views have influenced important policy decisions on the rights of minorities, abortion, torture, slavery, and genocide. In cases such as these where humiliating and degrading practices are in question, the concept of dignity in its various forms has played a key but undisciplined role. Rosen argues that we should sharpen our understanding of dignity so that moral theory can play a more effective practical role. Surprisingly, he claims, it is the Kantian prohibition against suicide, not Kant’s proscriptions against doing direct harm to others, that may unlock the door to a more usable notion of dignity. Kant got it right, according to Rosen: suicide is the gravest threat to dignity, but in rare cases dignity may actually require self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Halbertal claims that suicidal self-sacrifice should not be reduced to the blindness of ideological true-believers, as many psychologists now are prone to do. It has its roots in the gift relationship itself.</p>
<p>Halbertal begins by recasting the story of Cain and Abel. Having one’s gift rejected is much more humiliating and ultimately more dangerous than not receiving a gift in the first place. “Because Cain’s gift was refused, he was excluded from the most meaningful bond. He brought forward his gift, thus showing his desire to take part, and was slapped in the face, annihilated” (19). The cruelty of Cain’s humiliation is that it renders him unable to express love through gifts of his own making while leaving intact his knowledge that he has lost that capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0090591712470629">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Halbertal argues that the instrumentalization of sacrifice can also lead to violence. Here too love is part of the story; however, the focus is not only on the anxiety of the would-be giver. Using the story of the binding of Isaac by Abraham, Halbertal is able to paint another complicated picture. This time it is what happens when the dominant party (God) begins to doubt the sincerity of the faith of the subordinate (Abraham). God wanted to be sure that Abraham did not worship him simply because God had granted him a son in his old age. So, God made the “horrifying request” that Abraham sacrifice Isaac to show that God’s gift of a son was not the reason for Abraham’s faith. (24) God then backed off, but the damage already had been done. The lesson, according to Halbertal, is not that God eventually came to his senses or that Abraham’s faith was so strong that he would have sacrificed Isaac to prove it. The point is that the fragility of sacrifice can lead to violence when the gift relationship becomes instrumentalized. The more asymmetrical the power of the parties, the more likely is the perversion of the gift relationship and the ensuing violence.</p>
<p>Have modern moral theorists done any better to limit practices of sacrifice so that they don’t entail violence? Unfortunately, according to Halbertal, they mostly have ignored the problem and in some cases they have made it worse. The past, Halbertal reminds us, is “open-ended” and “fragile.” That is, “whatever we accomplish in the past is at the mercy of future actions” (93). Like the adult child who suffers under the burden of an unwanted inheritance (e.g., the family business), a citizen who is “entrusted with the onus of a past, misguided sacrifice” may end up wrongly sacrificing his or her life “to redeem its meaning.” Sacrificing ourselves to a cause because our ancestors did may only lead to more unjustifiable violence. It depends on the cause. For example, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address was a call to sacrifice for the sake of past sacrifices, which enshrined equality and democracy, not merely the preservation of The Union. The burden of such a sacrifice is more justifiable than the sacrifice George W. Bush urged the United States to shoulder in Iraq after admitting that no weapons of mass destruction had been found.</p>
<p>Halbertal relies on the trope of the reversal of aggressors and victims in order to show how the violence of sacrifice is sublimated. The violent acts of war committed for an unjust cause receive more protection than purportedly unjust acts (e.g., the use of civilian disguises) committed for a just cause. This seems backwards to Halbertal (82). Similarly, the desire to repudiate a past unjust military campaign can be impugned as an act of violence against those who have already sacrificed their lives in it. In cases like these, acts of sacrifice do not merely sanctify acts of violence. They transform (“reverse”) moral responsibilities.</p>
<p>Michael Rosen’s “expanding narrative” of dignity begins on the secular side with Cicero, includes Pico della Mirandola, Bacon, Milton, Aquinas, and Schiller, but depends most heavily on Kant. On the religious side, his representative historical figures are Pope Leo XIII and Pope John Paul II. Using this cast of characters, he divides dignity into four parts: dignity as social status or rank, dignity as an intrinsic value, dignity as a form of behavior, and dignity as a way of treating people respectfully. Rosen uses diverse legal issues to demonstrate the limitations and weaknesses of the received wisdom on dignity and its associated harms. In the case of dwarf tossing, Rosen concludes that “the ubiquity of dignity in current legal discourse masks a great deal of disagreement and sheer confusion” (67). In the cases of torture and kidnapping, he “finds the Court’s claim that it has consistently interpreted dignity as an inner kernel of human value that may never be compromised or balanced hard to sustain” (114).</p>
<p>When we look at how the concept of dignity has been deployed in these cases through international humanitarian law and the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, there is some evidence to suggest that while Kantian and Catholic interpretations of the second usage (dignity as an intrinsic value) have been dominant, there is an underlying shift toward dignity as a way of treating persons respectfully (116). It is this fourth sense of dignity that Rosen wants to defend, and to do this he returns to Kant’s moral theory. He distinguishes his own reading of Kant from the dominant secular interpretations that treat Kant as a humanist and a voluntarist.</p>
<p>What emerges is an interpretation of Kant that places self-regarding moral duties at the center, in particular, the duty not to commit suicide. Rosen argues that properly understood from a Kantian point of view, suicide cannot be justified by appeals to self-ownership or diminished suffering. We don’t possess moral personality the way we own a material object, even a body part. And a duty to oneself is a duty to honor “the worth of humanity in one’s own person,” not a duty to mitigate our suffering based on “inclination or prudence” (149–50). Suicide harms one’s dignity because it expresses disrespect for the capacity to respect moral personhood.</p>
<p>However, quoting Kant, Rosen acknowledges that suicide is morally permissible, even obligatory, in one case: “If a man can preserve his life in no other way than by dishonoring his humanity, he ought rather to sacrifice it. He then, indeed puts his animal life in danger, yet he feels that so long as he has lived, he has lived honorably” (152). Dignity, then, “may require us to sacrifice our lives.” It is this surprising Kantian self-regarding moral duty to sacrifice one’s “animal life” in order to preserve and honor one’s dignity to which I want to call attention (153).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Neither Halbertal nor Rosen could condone the act of a suicide bomber. For Halbertal, it is clearly an example of a misguided “reversal” of aggressor and victim. For Rosen, it denies the respect owed to the timeless moral personhood we share with others.</p>
<p>However, consider a different case, the extraordinary number of poor, small-scale Indian farmers faced with bankruptcy who have committed suicide over the past two decades.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is estimated that more than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide in the last 16 years—the largest wave of recorded suicides in human history. A great number of those affected are cash crop farmers, and cotton farmers in particular. In 2009 alone, the most recent year for which official figures are available, 17,638 farmers committed suicide—that’s one farmer every 30 minutes. While striking on their own, these figures considerably underestimate the actual number of farmer suicides taking place. Women, for example, are often excluded from farmer suicide statistics because most do not have title to land—a common prerequisite for being recognized as a farmer in official statistics and programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0090591712470629">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The conditions leading to this crisis are complex. They include the shift to cash cropping, the reliance on imported genetically modified seeds without adequate information, the dependence on expensive irrigation, and the absence of government relief programs.</p>
<p>Do these suicides preserve dignity? It is difficult to defend these suicides as attempts to preserve dignity in Rosen’s sense. They may be excusable under the circumstances, but it is hard to interpret them as acts done for the sake of some self-regarding moral duty such as the duty not to dishonor or disrespect moral personhood. On the other hand, it is also hard to think of these acts of suicide as undignified self-degradation. These farmers are neither heroic resistors sacrificing their “animal lives” for the sake of dignity nor cowards unable to face the consequences of excessive borrowing. They have lost their particular way of life, not any timeless moral personhood.</p>
<p>Halbertal’s intuition that acts of sacrifice may lead to unwanted “reversals” may have more applicability here. “Surviving family members inherit the debt, children drop out of school to become farmhands, and widows and unmarried daughters may themselves commit suicides in despair.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0090591712470629">4</xref></sup> This does not mean that their families should not mourn the deaths of these farmers who seem to be up against overwhelming odds. However, indebted farmers naively hoping to put an end to the problems they and their family face by taking themselves out of the picture have been sorely mistaken. More likely their suicide only makes the situation much worse.</p>
<p>There may be other cases of large-scale suicide where this kind of reversal is occurring. Perhaps the large increase in the suicides committed by U.S. combat veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars can be seen in this way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0090591712470629">5</xref></sup> The clinical causes of these suicides are no doubt complex and quite varied. But the story, as Halbertal might say, is more complicated and much longer than that.</p>
<p>Jonathan Shay’s <italic>Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming</italic> examines this story through the lens of classical literature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0090591712470629">6</xref></sup> and others have used Greek tragedies to shed light on veterans’ injuries, including suicide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0090591712470629">7</xref></sup> In Sophocles’ <italic>Ajax</italic>, his wife Tecmessa argues in vain with Ajax not to take his own life after being humiliated by his fellow Greeks. “All is lost—I am finished, alone.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0090591712470629">8</xref></sup> After he has committed suicide she laments, “And my poor son—whose slaves will we become? / Who will be our new master?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0090591712470629">9</xref></sup> Then, Ajax’s half-brother Teucer continues: “Your face is so hard to look at, marked / With harsh defiance—what a bitter harvest / Your death has reaped for me! / Where can I go now? Where would I / Be welcome?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0090591712470629">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ripple effects among fellow soldiers, surviving family members, and other veterans may bear some resemblance to the devastating effects found among the families of Indian farmers. That remains to be seen. What can be said at this point is that just as suicide bombers should not be discounted as merely irrational zealots, large-scale suicides should not be dismissed as acts of mass delirium. One should not indict Ajax for the pain and suffering he causes his family any more than one should excuse the violent self-sacrifice of suicide bombers. However, if we want to tell these more complicated stories of self-sacrifice and suicide, as Halbertal does, then a wider lens that takes in more than the Kantian notion of dignity seems necessary.</p>
