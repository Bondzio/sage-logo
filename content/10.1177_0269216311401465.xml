<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Research has only started recently to specifically concentrate on the group of patients severely affected by multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Aim</bold>: The aim of this study was to assess the perception on patients’ unmet needs by healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Focus groups and expert interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed by qualitative content analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Unmet needs were identified in four main categories (‘support from family/friends’; ‘healthcare services’; ‘managing everyday life’; ‘maintaining biographical continuity’). Whereas physicians assessed most unmet needs in the category ‘healthcare services’, nurses and social workers focussed on unmet needs in the categories ‘support from family/friends’ and ‘maintaining biographical continuity’. Although the study focused on unmet needs of patients, professionals also voiced <italic>their</italic> unmet needs when caring for these patients. The group of professionals identified more subcategories than patients and included unmet needs of relatives.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Adding professionals’ perspective to that of patients is essential to gain a holistic view on patients’ unmet needs and to further optimize their care. The perspective of palliative care might contribute to meet unmet needs of severely affected MS patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Little is known about unmet needs of <italic>severely</italic> affected multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Most studies concentrate on needs assessment of MS patients in general, but do not highlight the severely affected subgroup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311401465">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311401465">2</xref></sup> However, Edmonds et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311401465">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311401465">4</xref></sup> demonstrated that severely affected MS patients need improved continuity and coordination of care and services and better information systems, as well as psychological support when coping with loss and changes. Higginson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311401465">5</xref></sup> could show that the burden of symptoms of severely affected MS patients is comparable to those of advanced cancer patients, suggesting that these patients could also profit from palliative care services. The first positive hints in favour of this hypothesis could be shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311401465">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311401465">7</xref></sup> for the UK, where a specialized palliative care team was offered in addition to existing services for a limited period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311401465">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311401465">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Germany, a first study concentrating on the unmet needs of <italic>severely</italic> affected MS patients started with a survey among experienced MS neurologists, as it was felt in the MS community that patients should not be approached directly with these issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311401465">10</xref></sup> This study indicated deficits in the holistic care for MS patients. The most frequently mentioned unmet needs of severely affected MS patients as presumed by these neurologists were psychological support, occupational therapy, speech therapy, palliative care, physiotherapy and spiritual support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311401465">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Actually we do not know whether severely affected MS patients are appropriately attended in Germany or if extended or even new services might be necessary. To gain a widespread picture on this topic the view of patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> as well as that of health professionals, should be taken into account, as both look from different perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311401465">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311401465">13</xref></sup> In routine medical tests, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311401465">14</xref></sup> is used to identify severely affected MS patients. However, patients might feel severely affected in spite of a low EDSS, as they might suffer from impairments not mentioned in the EDSS. Therefore, we studied patients who themselves felt,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> or who were regarded as, severely affected. Such an approach was chosen against the background that in palliative care the subjective assessment of suffering should be the most decisive factor triggering an intervention. Whereas the results from the patients’ perspective are described elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> the health professionals’ perspective is presented here and compared to that of patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269216311401465">
<title>Sample and data collection</title>
<p>Participants were selected using a purposeful and convenience strategy: physicians, nurses and social workers from a rural clinic specialising in MS, as well as from three urban neurological hospital units including a university, were invited to participate in the study in written form (mail or email) or via telephone call. Moreover, 60 resident neurologists and 88 general doctors were contacted by letters of invitation.</p>
<p>Finally 13 physicians, seven nurses and three social workers agreed to participate in the study. Reasons for refusal were missing time, missing payment or inexperience with MS patients. Participants either took part in a focus group or gave an expert interview. These were conducted by the first two authors at participants’ working place or at the Department of Palliative Medicine (University Hospital of Cologne); they lasted up to one and a half hours. A guideline pilot tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311401465">Table 1</xref>) was flexibly used, which allowed one to focus on certain topics but was open enough to give the opportunity of narrating or discussing. After interviews participants filled in a questionnaire and could comment on the interview situation. Interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were not returned to participants. Characteristics of health professionals and interviewers are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311401465">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311401465">3</xref>, respectively.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All transcripts of expert interviews and focus groups were coded by one of the interviewers and the thematic structure of each was reconstructed. In the analysis of focus groups we also considered the group interaction and the sequence of topics discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311401465">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311401465">17</xref></sup> Implicit views were considered in the coding process as well. All coded interviews and focus groups were compared for similarities and differences in mentioned topics. The raw data and the related codes were multiprofessionally discussed among the authors. The method of constant comparison was used for the codes of all cases (focus groups and expert interviews) in order to identify minimal and maximal contrasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311401465">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311401465">19</xref></sup> This comparison resulted in an ongoing refinement from first codes to preliminary categories and then to categories on a higher abstraction level that could be applied to all data. For this qualitative content analysis we used an inductive approach.</p>

<p>Unmet needs described by the physicians can be classified into the following framework of categories: ‘support from family/friends’, ‘healthcare services’, ‘managing everyday life’ and ‘biographical continuity’.

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269216311401465-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Physicians identified most unmet needs in the category ‘healthcare services’. Disabled MS patients could not reach the diverse services any longer and depend on home visits or transports (<italic>subcategory access to services</italic>), both of which are not adequately financed. Physicians stressed that care for MS patients could not be improved due to missing financial means and time strains. They underlined that the complexity of MS with progressive affection of body and mind could cause various somatic and cognitive symptoms. Because of this, much time must be funded and available, as it is needed for conversation, advice, specialised medical care and nursing (<italic>subcategories financing services and time</italic>). Otherwise the doctor–patient interaction, which was regarded as a key element, would be disturbed (<italic>subcategory doctor–patient interaction</italic>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, I would say the most important thing is, um, to take the person and disease seriously and to not question either, mhm. And to accept that patients clutch at straws, and, um, not to give the impression that it is a burden, this patient […]. gaar7 (199–220)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Financing services should enable home visits by general doctors, specialized consultants and nurses, as well as specialized hospital stays, which should be long enough to improve MS patients’ symptoms and assure autonomy to a certain degree (<italic>subcategory financing services</italic>). A secondary effect of such hospital stays might be that caring relatives recover and then could resume caring.</p>
<p>Physicians realized that apart from disease-modifying treatment, an optimal symptom control is necessary. For this, physical and occupational therapy, logopaedics, rehabilitation, special aids and psychological support for patients and relatives were perceived as most important aspects (<italic>subcategory treatment options</italic>). However, here again financial strains are noticed and physicians experienced that patients might blame them, as they could not understand the constraints posed upon by the healthcare system (<italic>subcategories financing services and doctor-patient interaction</italic>).</p>
<p>Physicians noted that caring for MS patients requires a special knowledge of MS. Quality circles with the focus on <italic>severely</italic> affected MS patients were supposed as helpful. Physicians experienced that MS patients often demand a great deal of them: apart from medical expertise they expect competence from them also in areas without a primarily medical background and moreover physicians regularly noticed that – during their chronic disease – patients desire <italic>one</italic> competent contact person who cares, informs and advises, and they often seem to expect this responsibility from their doctor.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[…]but if we look at the wishes of the patients, um, then surely it would be um * what we have already said, well the visiting and the accompanying, um * if possible always by the same person who already counts as family, like a family doctor, right, and the neurologist as well could visit regularly. Um, listen to everything, right, have a cup of coffee […]. fg2ga (877–885)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Physicians felt that actually patients suffer from insufficient communication and cooperation among physicians and other health professionals. So, information gets lost or treatment is discontinued (<italic>subcategory coordination and continuity of care</italic>).</p>
<p>Finally, patients wished to be cured, something that physicians could not offer. However, patients then might not feel treated in a competent way and in consequence frequently change their doctor, hindering constant care (<italic>subcategories competence, doctor–patient interaction</italic>).</p>
<p>Albeit to a lesser extent, physicians noticed that MS patients also have problems in other sections of life.</p>
<sec id="section7-0269216311401465">
<title>Maintaining biographical continuity</title>
<p>Physicians stressed that an intact social system enormously supports MS patients. They knew many patients whose social networks broke apart (<italic>subcategory relationships</italic>) or who dropped out of professional life without the opportunity of an occupational rehabilitation (<italic>subcategory work</italic>). Due to their experience, these patients frequently had to give up previously set aims in life, such as studying, children or simply autonomy, the latter especially if young patients have to live in nursing homes, which are primarily not adjusted to MS patients or, if they regress, to parents’ care who are regularly old and often need help themselves (<italic>subcategory meaning/identity</italic>). In their opinion patients consequently become rooted out of their lives and have to restore identity, which often overburdens them and might sometimes lead to suicide, as they might feel only sparse social acceptance, no self-respect or lost identity (<italic>subcategories meaning/identity and social acceptance</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269216311401465">
<title>Support from family and friends</title>
<p>Physicians stressed that relatives and friends need information on the course of the MS disease, including physical and mental changes. However, some physicians objected that special information arrangements for relatives were not well accepted. Apart from theoretical information, caring relatives need practical instructions and they need time for recreation (<italic>subcategory needs of relatives</italic>). Physicians noted that in many cases relatives help patients to organize medical care, including correspondence for aids and rehabilitation and support them beyond that in everyday life; their emotional support stabilizes patients (<italic>subcategories support in access to healthcare services, support in managing everyday life, support in maintaining biographical continuity and emotional support</italic>).
</p>

<sec id="section9-0269216311401465">
<title>Managing everyday life</title>

<sec id="section10-0269216311401465">
<title>Nurses and social workers</title>
<p>Nurses and social workers described unmet needs of severely affected MS patients also in the four main categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216311401465">Figure 2</xref>) and especially focused on unmet needs in the categories ‘maintaining biographical continuity’ and ‘support from family and friends’.</p>

<title>Maintaining biographical continuity</title>
<p>Nurses and social workers pointed out that MS frequently leads to complex physical and/or mental handicaps, which in detail are unforeseeable. These might lead to loss of previous roles, for example, in family, work or social life. This can be a main danger for patients’ stability, as they become disrupted from their previous path of life (<italic>subcategories work and meaning/identity</italic>).</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses and social workers underlined that MS patients have the same wishes as healthy persons, like individuality, privacy and especially they wish to be accepted as ‘normal’ human beings (<italic>subcategories meaning/identity, relationships and social acceptance</italic>). However, they noticed that MS patients often experience the opposite, namely a low social acceptance.</p>

<title>Support from family and friends</title>
<p>An intact social network was regarded as the most important relief for patients, as it regularly helps them to reorganise their life and offers them emotional support (<italic>subcategories support in maintaining biographical continuity and emotional support</italic>). In their opinion, family and friends support patients in many practical things, such as managing everyday life, getting access to the healthcare system or they even care for them (<italic>subcategories support in access to healthcare services and support in managing everyday life</italic>). However, nurses and social workers pointed out that family and friends themselves need assistance already at an early stage of disease. Such help might include psychological support, advice on disease and on possible physical and mental changes or, more concretely, on services that relieve informal carers at home (<italic>subcategory needs of relatives</italic>). Nurses and social workers gave many examples of broken families and relationships, demonstrating that needs of carers are not adequately considered.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[…] they are left alone with the situation, […], and even with care stage III assistance comes five times, three to five times per day, but that’s it. The rest, the rest, well real rest, and that is not little, um um, their families actually need enormous support there. fg2ga (1432–1439)</p>

<title>Managing everyday life</title>
<p>Nurses and social workers pronounced problems of those patients who live alone without any social network, as nobody helps them with domains of daily living, especially in larger towns. They recognised the necessity of increasing volunteer work and paid external services (e.g. for housekeeping), which are trained in the complex needs of MS patients (<italic>subcategories self-care, housekeeping and living</italic>).</p>
<p>They mentioned MS patients with extreme financial distress, for example, because of unemployment or early retirement. As a consequence they cannot afford their former lifestyle or actually needed aids and might become financially dependent on others or even run into debts (<italic>subcategory finances</italic>). Moreover, apart from handicaps, such a financial descent might also have the effect that parents suffering from MS cannot care for their children as they would like to do (<italic>subcategory children</italic>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0269216311401465">
<title>Healthcare system</title>
<p>Nurses and social workers experienced that patients desire a detailed exchange with health professionals about MS, how it might change their lives in the future and which treatment options are possible, including complementary approaches (<italic>subcategories time, information, treatment options).</italic> To prevent MS patients getting lost in the healthcare system, health professionals have to be skilled in the complexity of MS, irrespective of working place (<italic>subcategory competence</italic>).</p>
<p>Nurses and social workers realized deficits in communication and cooperation among physicians and other health professionals.

<p>Management during the night was regarded as a special problem, as sufficient services are either non-existent or are invaluable. Moreover, according to the view of nurses and social workers, at advanced stages the palliative aspect of MS gains in importance but nevertheless a lack of in- and outpatient palliative care for MS patients was identified (<italic>subcategories treatment options and financing services</italic>).</p>

<title>Unmet needs of health professionals</title>
<p>All health professionals experienced strains handling MS patients. In particular, they complained about the many restrictions established by the healthcare system, contradicting adequate care. All interviewees seemed to be motivated in their particular profession. However, they felt that in the present system motivation alone could not solve the diverse problems of their patients. As they were not able to achieve sufficient care in spite of extraordinary engagement, most of them expressed feelings of disappointment, resignation or anger.</p>
<p><disp-quote>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, during patients’ care stakeholders experienced emotionally demanding situations, for example, they were recurrently confronted with patients similar to themselves. So they often felt a special association and may even suffer from their patients’ fate. Some health professionals mentioned graduates who could not pursue their jobs anymore and finally became severely handicapped and dependent on social welfare. They saw families with challenging social structures, which might overstrain them.</p>
<p>They regularly felt cornered when breaking bad news or if desperate patients wished to die. In these situations in particular, physicians noticed that their training was not aimed at coping with such existential situations. They learned that their challenge is to cure and so they also expect this from themselves; they tend to interpret an incurable disease as personal defeat or might erroneously feel responsible for disease progression or death.</p>
<p><disp-quote>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on qualitative data, we here present the professionals’ views on unmet needs of severely affected MS patients. Adding this to patients’ perspective,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> a broad insight is gained into the variety of unmet needs of MS patients who are regarded or feel themselves to be severely affected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269216311401465">
<title>Comparison of patients’ and professionals’ views</title>
<p>Patients, as well as health professionals, recognized a variety of unmet needs within the healthcare services. Herein patients described as main concerns a satisfying doctor–patient interaction including time, continuity, competence and holistic care, including psychological support. Specifically, they expected from their doctors a sensitive conversation, especially when breaking bad news, and to be respected as a human being not just ‘as a patient’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The many specific examples and situations mentioned by nurses and social workers show that they perceive patients’ situations similar to patients themselves, for example, they too clearly recognized that patients regard their doctors as a confidant far beyond medical questions and wish for a faithful relationship allowing time, continuity and an individual approach.</p>
<p>Doctors too identified these wishes, but they tended to see them against the background of the financial and time strains that determine their daily routine and interfere with patients’ care. Several studies refer to physicians’ work as a balancing act between adequate care for the individual patient and the economic requirements of the healthcare organisation, leading to time pressure and less autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311401465">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311401465">22</xref></sup> In particular, time pressure seems to be an overall problem for doctors: they have the impression that they cannot provide high-quality care for their patients, which might be a factor in doctors quitting their practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311401465">22</xref></sup> However, predictors of work satisfaction among physicians seem to be multidimensional: apart from time spent with the individual patient, also personal autonomy, income, acceptance among colleagues and time available for family and personal life play an important role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311401465">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311401465">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>All stakeholders agreed that the complexity of MS with its extended physical and/or mental handicaps leads to extensive unmet needs requiring special competence of professional and informal carers. In particular, home visits by doctors and nurses are sparse. Moreover, nurses and social workers identified a lack of palliative care for MS patients, which is in accordance with the currently late access of non-tumour patients to specialised palliative care services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311401465">25</xref></sup> and with the fact that also inside palliative care, structures for neurological patients do not exist or just begin to develop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311401465">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311401465">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311401465">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311401465">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311401465">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients could barely cope with being uprooted from their previous life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> In addition, they suffered from low social acceptance accompanied with stigmatizing and social exclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> Physicians, and especially nurses and social workers, also specified these difficulties. Moreover, nurses and social workers mentioned many examples of difficulties in the category ‘managing everyday life’. They even identified more subcategories of unmet needs than patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216311401465">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269216311401465">3</xref>). Apart from this, the group of health professionals recognized more unmet needs in the category ‘support from family and friends’ than patients and herein they especially confirmed the relevance of relatives and their needs. The identification of more unmet needs by carers than by patients themselves was also found for cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311401465">27</xref></sup> This stresses the importance to regard unmet needs of patients not only from their point of view. Different perspectives are important to gain a complete picture: due to their education and occupational area, social workers have special insight into patients’ social life, including family structures or their fight for different aids. Nurses are especially close to patients due to intensive care. By this they gain deep insight into handicaps, unmet needs in everyday life or actual crises. The importance of specialized MS nurses for MS patients was also shown in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311401465">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311401465">30</xref></sup> These studies underline that these nurses often function as key persons: they listen to patients’ emotions and coordinate between MS patients and different health professionals.</p>

<p>Emotional support is one of the most important need of MS patients: they primarily wish this from their families and friends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311401465">11</xref></sup> Without support from them MS patients feel lost in general. This was also consensus in the group of health professionals, especially pointed out by nurses and social workers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216311401465">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216311401465">2</xref>).</p>

It becomes obvious that in such a complex situation as severely affected MS patients are in, only a holistic view can finally lead to appropriate care, which can only be realised by a multiprofessional team. However, this implies that stakeholders share their perspectives, that is, communication and exchange between the different health professionals, informal carers, relatives and patients, have to be intensified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311401465">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311401465">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>The final aim must be cross-linked and improved support in <italic>all</italic> categories, that is, isolated progress in single domains without improvement in associated categories will not satisfy patients’ unmet needs. This is in accordance with the experience that chronically ill patients, such as MS patients, profit from interventions in a positive way only if they are complex and involve widespread areas; specific interventions, if used alone, do not lead to major improvements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311401465">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311401465">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Which role could palliative care play in caring for severely affected MS patients? In agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, palliative care means holistic care for patients with incurable progressive diseases irrespectively of diagnosis, that is, also for MS patients. The question is how and to what degree palliative care could meet the unmet needs of severely affected MS patients. Palliative care will not solve all problems recognized here. There are missing services far beyond the palliative care approach, such as lack of competence, deficient structures in nursing homes, difficult access to medical care in general, low social acceptance and insufficient support for relatives or informal carers. However, palliative care could be a preferable approach for severely affected MS patients in addition to existing, improved or even new services. A palliative approach has been previously addressed for patients with non-cancer diseases, including MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311401465">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311401465">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311401465">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311401465">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311401465">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311401465">36</xref></sup> With respect to severely affected MS patients, Higginson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311401465">5</xref></sup> could show that – apart from severe neurological impairment – they suffer similar symptoms as patients with other advanced diseases and, furthermore, these patients suffer from enormous emotional and spiritual strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311401465">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311401465">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311401465">10</xref></sup> Hence, they rightly conclude that palliative care is a desirable approach for MS patients.</p>
<p>How could then palliative care be integrated into general and comprehensive care models for severely affected MS patients? Analogue to suggestions from Higginson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311401465">5</xref></sup> this might be achieved by concrete education and training programs for general doctors, neurologists and nursing services and by collaborations between them and palliative care services. Severely affected MS patients with complex symptoms might profit from specialized palliative care in addition to existing services. The first positive hints in favour of this hypothesis were shown by Higginson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311401465">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311401465">7</xref></sup> for the UK: during an observation period of 12 weeks caregiver burden, as well as patients’ pain, could be reduced while being cost effective at the same time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311401465">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311401465">8</xref></sup> Suited to the long lasting disease trajectory with intermitting deterioration, temporary palliative support could be a reasonable approach for MS patients. The aim would be to lead patients back into the general care as soon as they are stabilized again. Palliative care has to adapt its services to certain specialties of neurological diseases, such as MS. So it makes sense that palliative care consultants working in this field have a special interest in neurological conditions or have even passed neurological training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311401465">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311401465">8</xref></sup>

<title>Unmet needs of health professionals</title>
<p>All attempts made in favour of sufficient support for severely affected MS patients will only be successful if also the unmet needs of health professionals are considered. Our results clearly show that they themselves have many unmet needs and often feel overstrained in their daily work.</p>
<p>Cure is the aspired aim in medicine, and therefore physicians regularly feel under pressure if this cannot be achieved. Although it is known that MS is incurable, physicians might feel responsible and helpless once progression occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311401465">31</xref></sup> They might regard this as personal failure. Moreover, physicians express feelings of helplessness or anger in the face of financial regress, general work under time pressure or complex social situations, as their communicative skills are sparse due to little training at university. It is known that, in particular, those consultants who have inadequate communication and management skills are at risk of burnout,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311401465">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311401465">38</xref></sup> suggesting more support for physicians in this situation. Other coping strategies might be external help, such as supervision. Physicians should be encouraged to recognize their own unmet needs without interpreting them as weakness, but as a chance for improvement for themselves and their patients.</p>
<p>Our results show that not only doctors but also nurses and social workers often feel overstrained when in contact with MS patients:</p>
<p>Social workers are unsatisfied in situations in which they are not able to arrange adequate care. Frequently their hands are tied due to external strains, so that they cannot act according to their persuasions.</p>
<p>In particular, social workers and nurses feel that they do not have enough time for patients. In return they often work overtime or under time pressure but nevertheless they might not manage all their work, creating feelings of incompetence. They cited many examples of when they are emotionally touched by patients’ social, biographical, physical or mental difficulties. In particular, if a patient’s background resembles their own they regularly seem to be affected beyond their profession. Moreover, they have difficulties with MS diagnosis itself, its complexity and continuous progression, similarly to doctors.</p>
<p>Similar difficulties of health professionals were characterised by Carter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311401465">31</xref></sup> They also found problems in dealing with the diagnosis of MS, with psychiatric disorders of MS patients, with the progression and the unpredictable course of MS and with MS patients who were deemed difficult, demanding or inflexible. It was regarded as a challenge to remain positive and to convey hope in the face of progression and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311401465">31</xref></sup> Coping strategies may include not only improvement of communication and (conflict) management skills, coordination and liaison between different health professionals in different healthcare settings, but also more individual help might be indicated, such as the opportunity to reflect on their own practice, in order to understand their own anxieties and needs that result in particular behavioural patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311401465">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311401465">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311401465">38</xref></sup> The interaction between health professionals and patients is significant in determining patients’ level of hope; so not only patients but especially health professionals have to focus on realistic events in the near future.</p>

<title>Limitations and strengths of the study</title>
<p>Due to difficulties in recruiting health professionals, the number of interviews was small sized, which weakens the strength of the findings. However, this study covers a wider spectrum of physicians than our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311401465">10</xref></sup> addressing only neurologists, who predominately worked in university hospitals, that is, their perspective was probably biased towards younger, more mobile patients still receiving disease-modifying treatment. However, also in this study the interviewees did regularly not know where most of the highly handicapped MS patients live; they seem to vanish unseen and so their unmet needs might also be characterised incompletely in this study.</p>
<p>Our study focuses on unmet needs of MS patients who are <italic>regarded</italic> as severely affected, that is, the inclusion criterion was independent of the EDSS. This enables a wider view of severe affection, as also aspects apart from those named in the EDSS are considered.</p>
<p>The qualitative approach allowed presentation and discussion of concrete situations. This offers a widespread and individual insight into the perceived unmet needs of severely affected MS patients and – not primarily expected – also of health professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0269216311401465" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Combining the analysis of patients’ and health professionals’ views on the care situation of severely affected MS patients will provide a good first basis for developing concepts of how to improve the situation of this patient group, which so far has been nearly neglected by research.</p>
