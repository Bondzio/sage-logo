<abstract>
<p>Hepatic involvement is uncommon in dengue viral infections and is traditionally thought to be associated with severe disease in terms of morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted in order to assess the liver function in patients with dengue virus infection and to analyse its effect upon patient outcome. Three hundred and twenty-seven consecutive patients with dengue virus were categorized into groups A, B, C and D on the basis of elevation of either of the hepatic transaminases (normal, &lt;3, 3–10 and &gt;10 times, respectively). Primary and secondary outcome measures related to morbidity and mortality were studied. Hepatitis was seen in ∼3/4 patients; an increasing grade of liver involvement was significantly associated with fewer platelets (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Recovery of platelets, bleeding manifestations, renal dysfunction, platelet recovery and duration of hospitalization were similar in all groups. Among the patients with manifest bleeding, the platelet count did not differ significantly but the platelet recovery was significantly slower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.044) with increasing grade. Hepatic dysfunction is self-limited without any increase in morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>All adult (&gt;18 years) in-patients with dengue virus infection, presenting between July and November 2010 were enrolled for the study after receiving informed consent. Demographic, clinical, haematological and biochemical laboratory data were recorded in a pre-designed format. Serology for dengue antibody was done in all cases using SD Bioline Dengue Duo. Those on chemotherapy, with chronic liver disease or harbouring other infections, namely malaria, septicaemia, acute viral hepatitis, and so on, were excluded.</p>
<p>Hepatic involvement was graded on the basis of elevation above normal of at least one transaminase as in earlier studies:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513483281">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513483281"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513483281"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513483281">4</xref></sup> A = none; B = up to 3 times; C = 3–10 times; grade D = beyond 10 times. Primary outcome measures were: bleeding from any site; acute renal insufficiency (oliguria and serum creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dL); and encephalopathy (altered sensorium ≥8 h). Secondary outcome measures were mortality and morbidity evidenced by platelet recovery time and length of hospital stay. Length of stay was based on platelet recovery and at least a 50% decline in liver transaminases, wherever applicable. A rise in platelet counts in consecutive samples, or beyond 50 000/mm<sup>3</sup> when less at presentation, was considered to be a recovery of platelets.

<p>Of the 327 patients enrolled for the study, bleeding manifested in 67 in the form of: melena (50.7%); gum bleed (14.9%); vaginal bleed (13.4%); epistaxis (13.4%); and hematemesis (7.4%). Bleeding manifestations (47 versus 20; <italic>P</italic> = 0.043) and thrombocytopenia (43.61 ± 38.26 versus 55.72 ± 46.88 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.019) were pronounced in secondary dengue infection (<italic>n</italic> = 194; 59.2%) compared to primary infection (<italic>n</italic> = 133; 40.6%). However, renal involvement (14 versus 19; <italic>P</italic> = 0.828), platelet recovery time (3 ± 1.30 versus 2.81 ± 1.26 days; <italic>P</italic> = 0.202) and duration of hospitalization (5 ± 0.82 versus 4.86 ± 1.92 days; <italic>P</italic> = 0653) were comparable between primary and secondary dengue infection.</p>
<p>Elevation of hepatic transaminases was seen in 73.3% patients and jaundice was reported by only 16 (4.8%) patients. Transaminases began to increase from day 1–3 of the illness; the grade was unrelated to the duration of symptom onset – grade D hepatitis occurred by the end of the first week of illness in 76.4% patients. Aspartate transaminase (AST) increased earlier, peaked to a higher level and normalized earlier compared to alanine transaminase (ALT); both normalized in all patients within 2 weeks and neither re-elevated within a month of discharge.</p>
<p>Notably, prothrombin time and INR (international normalized ratio), in general, were within normal limits for all those with liver involvement and, in particular, those with bleeding manifestations. Although platelet counts at presentation varied significantly between the different grades of liver affliction, there was no significant difference in terms of bleeding between grades A, B, C or D (<italic>P</italic> = 0.070). Tables 1 and 2 depict the outcome measures in relation to the degree of liver involvement and primary and secondary dengue infection, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0049475513483281" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hepatic inflammation rather than dysfunction was apparent in almost 75% of all dengue patients and was significantly associated with fewer platelets. However, bleeding manifestations, renal involvement, clinical and platelet recovery and duration of hospitalization was apparently unaffected by the grade of hepatic involvement. Among those with manifest bleeding, although the platelet count did not differ significantly, platelet recovery was significantly slower.</p>
<p>Our finding contradicts earlier studies which found associations between transaminase levels and increasing severity of vascular leakage and bleeding severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513483281">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513483281">7</xref></sup> We observed preservation of the coagulation factor production even in those with grade D hepatic involvement, in contradiction to a prolongation of prothrombin time in similar patients with liver failure observed by Trung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513483281">2</xref></sup> We can conclude that bleeding occurred as a result of thrombocytopenia and dysfunction of the remaining thrombocytes.</p>
<p>A differential rise of AST and ALT in our study group indicates some degree of hepatic involvement with an additional non-hepatic source of AST, presumably skeletal muscle injury. A shorter plasma half-life of AST and slower evolution of the hepatic disease resulted in a slower improvement in ALT compared to AST. A limitation of our study was the non-availability of creatine kinase levels, known to be elevated during the acute phase of dengue infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049475513483281">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The magnitude and evolution of the liver enzyme changes suggest a relative contribution of a direct viral effect as well as immune dysregulation that was self-limiting. Almost 74%, 78% and 85% patients in groups B, C and D had the illness for less than a week indicating a direct viral effect on hepatocytes coinciding with peak viraemia. A lack of quantitative viral load estimates in relation to the transaminase levels to substantiate this point was another limitation of our study. Fewer platelets with increasing transaminases corresponded to the findings from Karachi by Prakash et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513483281">3</xref></sup> indirectly supporting the concept of liver dysfunction due to host immune response which is established by the 4th–6th day of illness leading to thrombocytopenia and shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049475513483281">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049475513483281">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondary infection was associated but hepatitis did not translate into morbidity and mortality. Renal insufficiency, encephalopathy and mortality, which were prominent features in earlier studies, were lacking in our study. Possibly, infection or co-infection with an unknown virus with low-virulence but cross reactivity with dengue viral antigen might have been responsible for the dengue-like clinical manifestations and liver involvement in our study group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0049475513483281" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We believe that this study contests the well-accepted notion that liver dysfunction and secondary infection in dengue infection causes an increase in morbidity and paves the way for further studies in this field.</p>
