<abstract>
<p>This article explores the significance of widespread debates in empires about the exercise of arbitrary power. As particularly evident in the decades around the turn of the nineteenth century, colonial conflicts often centered on the nature and scope of the legal prerogatives of middling authorities. The focus on the proper relation of multiple authorities within composite polities was accompanied by claims about particular configurations of rights, by references to divisible sovereignty, and by legal strategies that appealed to the intervention of imperial sovereigns in the exercise of judicial power within private or subordinate jurisdictions. The result was an intimate connection between persistent references to petty despotism and an emerging framework for imperial constitutional politics.</p>

<p>George Washington, that stolid figure we associate more with the eloquence of battle than with ironic musings, once remarked on the oddity of Americans’ complaining about their reduction to slavery by the British while raising no objection to the condition of “the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872111419583">1</xref></sup> A slaveholder, Washington was not delivering an abolitionist message but instead repeating two tropes familiar in imperial legal politics. One was the analogy of other types of subordination to slavery. Sailors, servants, colonists, soldiers, convicts, and religious minorities – all these groups and their advocates at some time compared their condition to the status of slaves. The repeating parallels surfaced in political contests ranging from individual to societal, and from reformist to revolutionary.</p>
<p>The other familiar formula invoked by Washington was the label “arbitrary” to describe the power wielded over slaves and their analogues. For Washington, and for many others who relied rhetorically on parallels between slaves and others, the injustice of tyranny over subordinates did not reside in the mere fact of domination. Critics complained that the way power was wielded produced injustices. The root of the problem lay with unchecked authority, in particular the unrestrained powers of judgment and punishment. Interpretation of the signs of arbitrary power was an open-ended and often culturally specific process.</p>
<p>Despotism has emerged as a familiar theme, of course, in contexts other than imperial politics. Historians have analyzed meanings of despotism in eighteenth-century revolutionary politics and in the history of absolutism. Orientalism crowned Asian rulers as despots and petty despots. Even democracies circulated notions of despotism in weighing the dangers of majority rule. The label came to attract an association with non-rationalized administration and stood as a shorthand way of referring to the theoretical opposite of ordered bureaucracy and the rule of law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872111419583">2</xref></sup> The accusation could be made about a wide range of actors – sovereigns, state officials, rebel leaders, ship captains, slave traders, magistrates, and others – and took on special salience in times of political and social instability.</p>
<p>In this article I address the theme of petty despotism to highlight patterns of legal politics emerging from the perceived arbitrary power of middling authorities in empires. Figures accused of acting as petty despots were ubiquitous in empire. Imperial administration could not function without delegating judicial power, and political strains often centered on the nature and scope of officials’ legal responsibilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1743872111419583">3</xref></sup> While a focus on petty despotism makes sense across many different imperial settings, the analysis is especially relevant in the history of European overseas empires. The distance of delegated authorities from centers of imperial power called attention to the threat of rogue officials usurping sovereign power. Particularly in times of rapid and far-reaching reconfiguration of sovereignty, such as the last decades of the seventeenth century or the period from the eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century, charges of “petty despotism” operated as potent political weapons in conflicts over the structure of rule. Jurisdictional conflicts that were familiar at home developed especially sharp variants in distant parts of empires, a phenomenon that highlighted understandings of sovereignty as divisible while drawing close scrutiny to the specific prerogatives claimed by middling authorities.</p>
<p>There was, to be sure, no status in any social order denoted by the term “petty despots.” They came into existence as subordinates and rivals complained about perceived injustice. It is as interesting to study the proposed remedies to petty despotism as it is to trace discourse about it. Sometimes complaints suggested the need for administrative reforms to create new constraints, but just as often they drew attention to figures accused of acting <italic>as if</italic> exempt from the control of regulations. When critics called for change, they were often advocating conservative reforms, including the consolidation of power at the top with the goal of protecting the liberties of those at the bottom by restraining the rights of delegated agents in between. Charges of petty despotism can be linked simultaneously to radical agendas and to projects of reinforcing imperial authority by streamlining bureaucracies, reducing the discretion of officials, and insisting on the subordinate status of colonial jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The focus on defining the power of intermediate authorities produced a jumble of arguments composed to define, attack, and protect officials’ prerogatives. Such rhetoric paralleled and sometimes merged with discourse about rights, which in many historical contexts did not correspond neatly to natural law understandings but were defined by the placement of rights-bearing subjects within political and legal structures. An emphasis on the prerogatives of intermediate or local power holders in imperial politics pushes historical analysis in two directions: in one way, toward a broader consideration of structural features and repeating patterns of conflict in imperial legal orders; in another, toward the study of specific cultural practices through which delegated legal authorities worked to sustain or defend the precarious legitimacy of their rule in the face of equally nuanced critiques of their actions by rivals, critics, and rebels. Both projects focus attention on a wide-ranging imperial constitutionalism that featured preoccupation with the right relation of authorities within composite polities.</p>
<p>This article begins by examining the ways in which ideas about plural legal orders – in particular, understandings of divided sovereignty and differential rights – helped to focus attention on the legal prerogatives of middling authorities in empires. I then turn to the structure of constitutional arguments to suggest that conditions in empire encouraged flexible claims about the basis of particular configurations of order and rights, including making use of labels of petty despotism in support of often opposed ideological projects. This point forms the basis for observing several prominent patterns of constitutional politics centering on the attack or defense of the prerogatives of middling imperial authorities. The article concludes with consideration of both the peculiar salience of petty despotism in legal politics at the turn of the nineteenth century and the insights applicable more generally in the study of imperial legalities.</p>
<sec id="section1-1743872111419583">
<title>I. Empire, rights, order</title>
<p>Despotism came to be referenced frequently within the politics of empires in part because of their deep dependence on structures of delegated legal authority. The Roman empire’s pretense that magistrates anywhere in the empire acted with full and not partial imperial powers did not carry over to early modern European territorial or overseas empires, which recognized expedition leaders, colonial officials, sea captains, and royal appointees as imperial agents holding a degree of legal authority awarded to them by the sovereign. Even the Spanish viceroys, stand-ins for the king, operated as officials with a defined set of legal competencies that marked their power as partial and required them to refer some kinds of cases to king and council.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1743872111419583">4</xref></sup> The sovereign reserved the power to execute subjects, though this prerogative could also be assigned. The lack of a clearly structured legal hierarchy produced tangles of jurisdiction, a widely shared condition in early modern empires that flowed from, and in turn reinforced, the notion that sovereignty was divisible and that legitimate authorities inside empires could claim and hold incomplete sets of legal prerogatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1743872111419583">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The persistent attention to the prerogatives of delegated authority also reflected an understanding of the concept of “right” that differed from its definition as “freedom of the individual apart from the law.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1743872111419583">6</xref></sup> A competing and at times dominant view going back to late scholastic thought defined “right” as <italic>dominium</italic>, “the relation of power or authority over other persons or things.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1743872111419583">7</xref></sup> Such an understanding is not unrelated to a later view of “right” as a capacity operating to restrain sovereign power. The approach cast civic privileges as lawfully held properties that were “owned” and held as a defense against the power of government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1743872111419583">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This argument was closely related to a well-established tradition of thought and practice about the divisible nature of sovereignty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1743872111419583">9</xref></sup> One facet of this tradition involved an understanding of the origins of a sovereign’s power as deriving from a grant of authority by subjects. Spanish scholastics developed an influential strand of this tradition. Sixteenth-century jurists such as Francisco de Vitoria and Juan de Mariana theorized that the sovereign’s power derived originally from a delegation of power by his subjects. The monarch held power through a grant of <italic>potestas</italic> – or sovereign power – from the political community to the monarch. <italic>Potestas</italic> was imagined as residing fundamentally in the community. In transferring <italic>potestas</italic> to the king, the community did not completely or permanently lose its <italic>potestas</italic> but held onto specific capacities and also retained the power to withdraw consent for the sovereign to govern under certain circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1743872111419583">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Vitoria, the community transferred to the king not <italic>potestas</italic> in full, but, in Latin, <italic>auctoritad</italic>, or the capacity to act legally or compel others to act in particular ways. In the terms of later continental scholars, this division resembles a distinction between sovereignty and jurisdiction. The crown held legal authority, or jurisdiction, a key function of sovereignty but not its only attribute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1743872111419583">11</xref></sup> In the sixteenth century, when jurists were responding both to empire and to the legacy of full-scale revolts at home, the core characteristic of this arrangement was that if the king broke his pact with the community, or wielded power in a way that was arbitrary or tyrannical, the community was entitled to nullify its pact with the king. As Francisco Suarez wrote, it was possible to wage a just war against the king.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1743872111419583">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In European empires, a shared understanding (despite variants in its application) of the origins and responsibilities of kingly power informed approaches to defining the basis and scope of authority of a wide variety of colonial and imperial officials, some formally deputized by the crown and some wielding legal power recognized by custom. While there is nothing about empire or imperial administration in the abstract that reinforced particular constructions or meanings of rights, the structure of layered authority in empires helped to concentrate attention on defining rights in ways connected to relations of power rather than as subjective capacities. Middling officials held power that was doubly deputized – that is, it derived from authority delegated to the sovereign and then flowed from the sovereign to offices occupied by individuals. Empire-states assigned different sets of rights to individuals depending on the positions they occupied in the imperial order. This point has been eloquently made by Jane Burbank, who argues that in the Russian empire, subjects not only understood rights as defined in connection with a particular imperial legal status but also lacked a vocabulary for talking about them in any other way, including as universal properties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1743872111419583">13</xref></sup> Even in the Atlantic cauldron at the end of the eighteenth century, when “rights talk” flowed from Enlightenment tracts and circulated with news of the American, French, and Haitian revolutions, political movements attacking or defending colonial and planter interests used the term ‘‘rights’’ to label the prerogatives of authorities within a fluid institutional order as often as to refer to the natural capacities of individuals or slaves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1743872111419583">14</xref></sup> More generally, Samuel Moyn has proposed that Enlightenment discourse should not be read as connected to “human rights” talk at all but as referring to rights “predicated on belonging to a political community.” The protection of rights therefore required the promotion of particular institutional arrangements since polities functioned as the “essential crucible” of rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1743872111419583">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>An analysis of empire as the “crucible of rights” recommends a shift in attention from the application and circulation of universal principles to the prerogatives assigned to particular stations within the imperial order. This perspective perhaps appears pedestrian beside the search for the moral grounding of transformative political movements. But the approach can help to explain aspects of such movements that otherwise appear odd or contradictory. Consider the example of abolitionists who, like Washington, criticized slavery because the institution empowered individuals to hold “arbitrary sway” over others. Though many historians emphasize the connection between abolitionism and Christian universalism, a key strand of the discourse on the abolition of the slave trade highlighted the petty despotism of slave owners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1743872111419583">16</xref></sup> That despotism was understood as flowing from a structural condition: the dearth of legal constraints on masters’ actions with respect to slaves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1743872111419583">17</xref></sup> A rare trial of a slave owner for the murder of a slave in Tortola in 1811 prompted prosecutors to observe, for example, that if the colonial state failed to regulate masters’ treatment of slaves, the result would be a kind of “anarchy” that would “leave every man to assert his own rights, and maintain what he may call, his own privileges in the best way he can.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1743872111419583">18</xref></sup> The rights under scrutiny here were those of slave owners, not slaves. The protection of individual rights appeared as a dangerous move that could potentially lead to disorder by enlarging the scope for the exercise of unchecked power by individual slave owners.</p>
<p>The threat of disorder lay, too, in the perception that planters’ power to judge and punish slaves could develop quickly from the legitimate authority over a petty jurisdiction to a usurpation of powers reserved for the sovereign. Debates about when despotism shaded into treason extended to multiple social and cultural spheres, in particular because “petty” treason was understood as occurring when there was a breach in relationships of mutual obligation, as between lords and subjects under them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1743872111419583">19</xref></sup> This definition encompassed realms we now consider private or semi-private, such as households and families, and extended to relationships within them. Husbands could be labeled as petty despots, and there is some evidence that the term migrated across spheres of authority, as when notices about wives fleeing the tyranny of their husbands mirrored notices about runaway slaves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1743872111419583">20</xref></sup> Disloyalty and the usurpation of authority were, of course, charges always open to interpretation; acts considered permissible at one moment could be quickly redefined as evidence of overreaching or rebellion.</p>

<sec id="section2-1743872111419583">
<title>II. Constitutional clutter</title>
<p>By defining tensions over petty despotism in broad terms, we run the risk of identifying strains that exist in every polity. The claim here is not that attention to petty despotism was unique to empires. Imperial contexts did, however, tend to bring questions about the scope for the exercise of authority by middling officials into sharper relief. Imperial politics also presented opportunities for creatively recombining disparate legal sources and arguments in contests over authority. Studying clusters of legal conflicts in empire, including jurisdictional jockeying, allows us to understand wide-ranging struggles over the relation of authorities within composite polities as part of a broad phenomenon of imperial constitutional politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1743872111419583">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consider two very different contexts in which charges of despotism connected closely to debates about the principles of unwritten imperial constitutions. The first concerns consent. Overreaching by delegated legal authorities raised the politically fraught prospect of the consent of free subjects to injustice. Consent was not a right so much as a condition of membership in a political community, so it could be imperiled simply when petty despots acted as if the recognition of their authority was independent of it. The subject of consent came up in many places, but it emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century with special sharpness in imperial settings in which the presence of settlers raised the constitutional problem of whether and how they had approved the arrangements of rule over them. Transplants and sojourners were in theory entering or establishing political communities to which they had given their consent. One of the multiple purposes of a class of founding rituals or documents – of which English charters are the most prominent example – was to record the consent of founders and to formalize their place within the imperial order. Jeremy Bentham drew attention to precisely this basis for imperial rule in developing an analogy of settlers to slaves in commentary on the unconstitutionality of the penal colony at New South Wales. He noted that the colony had no charter, but this defect could not be corrected because no group of subjects would accept a “charter to impower a free-man to lead a life of slavery, and to be flogged as often as he endeavors to escape from it!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1743872111419583">22</xref></sup> Hardly a revolutionary, Bentham was observing a central problem of imperial rule: submission to the exercise of power by appointed local officials whose actions were insufficiently controlled by the moral imperative to follow vague constitutional guidelines.</p>
<p>A similar call for penalties for overstepping the bounds of permissible authority emerged in a second context, that of movements to reconfigure empires or break away from them to create new polities. Rebel leaders’ legitimacy depended, after all, on their ability to show that they were not overstepping authority delegated to them by their followers. The example of South American provincial governments after the fall of the Spanish government to Napoleon is instructive. Leaders of new polities claimed both to act as replacements for the absent monarch and to derive their authority from subjects and citizens. Critics routinely derided caudillo statesmen for ignoring traditional checks on their actions, including constraints imposed by “the people,” either implicitly or explicitly. Charges of despotism issued from ideologically opposed camps. For example, as José Gervasio Artigas sought to position the Provincia Oriental to break away from the new government forming in Buenos Aires and to oppose the Portuguese empire to the north, he repeatedly insisted that his authority emanated from the sovereignty of the people of the Banda Oriental, and he contrasted this legitimate basis for rule with the tyranny of empires and traditional elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1743872111419583">23</xref></sup> His critics in turn labeled him a “tyrant” and criticized him for defying “the wishes of the sober and settled inhabitants . . . who are far from being satisfied with the prostration of all law and government, excepting that which emanates from the will of this despot.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1743872111419583">24</xref></sup> This attack was paired with accusations that Artigas was a traitor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1743872111419583">25</xref></sup> By positioning rebel leaders as usurpers of sovereign power acting as petty despots, critics and rivals sought to remind audiences of the superior order and greater legitimacy of empires – and of new polities formed peacefully from within empires.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1743872111419583">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the clear lessons of such examples is that constitutional discourse focusing on the legitimacy and structure of authority extended to a broad cross-section of participants and an even broader audience. Commentators and caudillos with even a casual familiarity with the law assembled multi-form arguments about the right relation of authorities. Imperial subjects joined in and invoked a variety of quotidian references, narratives, and examples to advocate particular configurations of order and rights. To engage in imperial legal politics of any kind was to act as a sophisticated critic of the cultural practice of power. One result was a relatively disordered jumble of legal references in imperial contexts, one we might describe as composing a cluttered constitutional field.</p>
<p>The unsystematic approach reflected, at the same time, a similarly supple manipulation of sources and arguments by jurists. David Armitage provides an example in analyzing the juxtaposition of natural rights language in the Declaration of Independence – in passages familiar to schoolchildren – with a pragmatic positivism that lays emphasis on the “declaration” as a legal act establishing a new polity. In its blending of natural and positive law arguments, the document was “jurisprudentially eclectic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1743872111419583">27</xref></sup> Such eclecticism ran deeply through attempts to define the contents of “the law of nations.” A related example of such eclecticism emerged in debates about whether the slave trade might be labeled as universally banned under the law of nations. Jurists argued that in order to declare an activity as prohibited on the basis of natural law, one would have to be able to perceive an existing consensus as expressed in polities’ positive law enactments of bans of the trade. Natural and positive law could not be disentangled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1743872111419583">28</xref></sup> One of the peculiar results of the relationship was that natural law references often gathered rhetorical force precisely at moments when they became less important as legal arguments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1743872111419583">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In seeking to generalize about the construction of arguments about justice, Amartya Sen points out that “plural grounding” often involves both assembling different arguments to support the same outcome and presenting different arguments to propose different outcomes. Neither method implies that one argument is true and the others false, or even that one argument is superior to others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1743872111419583">30</xref></sup> In imperial claims making and in other pursuits where plural grounding was common, historical actors did not always make clear which arguments were thought to be persuasive and which were merely added for effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1743872111419583">31</xref></sup> To this rich mix must be added constitutional pluralism. In presenting arguments and claims by appealing to the logic and power of constitutional arrangements, imperial subjects sometimes referred to different conceptions of constitutional order. Historians of the American Revolution have noted, for example, that whereas Americans referred to the rights embedded in an older English constitutionalism that defined ancient liberties as restraints on sovereign power, imperial officials imagined a constitution of “sovereign command.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1743872111419583">32</xref></sup> Yet, these constitutional frameworks were hardly separate or incommensurable in contemporaries’ eyes. Here and elsewhere, multiple and sometimes conflicting propositions about the right relation of colonial legal authorities to metropolitan power circulated and blended in a multi-form discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1743872111419583">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The result of combining strategies of eclecticism, plural grounding, and constitutional pluralism in empires was to create a field of discourse that was cluttered but not chaotic. The strategies tended to cluster around sets of conflicts over the distribution and exercise of legal prerogatives, especially those held by middling figures. Many such controversies blended easily with jurisdictional conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1743872111419583">34</xref></sup> Revolutionary politics did sometimes focus sharp attention on the nature and legitimacy of sovereign power at the top. But the more prevalent challenges to power emanated from familiar and largely local encounters with private and public authorities exercising vaguely defined legal capacities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1743872111419583">
<title>III. Patterns of imperial legal politics</title>
<p>Without seeking to generalize about the normative visions shaping conflicts in particular imperial settings, we can note several patterns that emerged from the combination of jurisdictional jockeying and multi-form arguments over authority. One pattern featured appeals to higher authorities to restrain the prerogatives of intermediaries, often on the basis of an imagined connection of right or obligation between subjects at the bottom and sovereign powers. Such appeals could include advocacy of far-reaching reforms. A second, related pattern did not necessarily imply a challenge to the existing order but centered on claims that specific intermediate authorities were violating fundamental precepts of that order. Challengers wanted to overthrow particular figures but not necessarily the offices they occupied. A third pattern combined these claims by suggesting that elements of the existing order were corrupting middling power holders and causing them to behave like petty despots. These approaches to conflict over middling authorities were not mutually exclusive, and the list is more illustrative than exhaustive.</p>
<p>In the first variant, the arbitrariness of the petty despot was posed as an affront both to subordinates and to imperial rule. Here the discourse of subjecthood and the claims that subject and sovereign were linked in a relationship of mutual obligation took on great political force. In the eighteenth-century Spanish empire, for example, creole elites wondered at the linked forces of Indian rebellion and Indian litigiousness. The same Andes Indian groups that brutalized crown-appointed tribute collectors sent delegations thousands of miles to colonial high courts to plead for royal protection from the abuse of those officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1743872111419583">35</xref></sup> To Indians, the combination of violence and litigation made perfect sense. They were positioning themselves as loyal rebels – subjects whose allegiance to the king caused them to overthrow local officials who were disturbing the pact between crown and subjects. Their strategy was not one of simple loyalism, however; embedded in their complaints was a critique of elements of imperial administration put in place by the Bourbon reforms. In other settings, the tactic of appealing to sovereign powers to restrict the prerogatives of officials was more obviously conservative. Attempts to curb systemically the power of petty despots often sought to bring them more securely under the purview of higher authorities. Forces for imperial consolidation drew strength from anti-authoritarian reformers.</p>
<p>Men who rebelled violently against a “despot” without wishing to overturn the order that sustained the despot’s power often had highly specific grievances about acts of individual power holders. These mutinous campaigns are difficult to interpret without taking the measure of peculiar cultural practices. One of the best explorations of this pattern of conflict is Greg Dening’s study of the mutiny by British sailors against Captain Bligh on <italic>The Bounty</italic>. Dening argued that mutinous crews railed against the cruelty and injustice of particular captains rather than the notion of a hierarchy of command – or even the prerogative of punishment in the hands of commanders. Bligh’s “bad language” – a term Dening uses to stand for Bligh’s inability to get right the nuances of command – caused trouble because “men could not read in it a right relationship to his authority.” Sailors were inured to the violence of captains, and Bligh was not exceptionally violent. What led an uneasy crew to rebellion was their perception of Bligh’s use of violence simply to proclaim his authority and his tendency to interpret mundane actions “as somehow impinging on his role as commander.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1743872111419583">36</xref></sup> In this example and in many other cases of rebellion prompted by the perceived misuse of the prerogatives of command, individual officials were pilloried for failing to understand their own right place within that order.</p>
<p>Attacks on patterns of unjust acts by petty despots could be combined with attempts to lay the groundwork for broader critiques of institutional ordering. This point seems obvious since arguments about injustice tend to call attention to abstract standards of just behavior as contrasted with unjust actions. Pointing to such standards implied the possibility that they could be met. Those accused of unjust excesses were sometimes seen as succumbing to the influence of imperfect political arrangements. This logic supported a long tradition of the defense of slavery, for example, that blamed its injustices on the institution because of its tendency to harbor aberrant, unusually cruel masters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1743872111419583">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not every jurisdictional conflict entailed a critique of unrestrained power. Nor were empires unique in producing political struggles that turned on accusations of petty despotism. But the importance of delineating the authority of a wide variety of imperial agents placed such questions at the heart of legal politics in empires. The repetition of such patterns nurtured a deep familiarity of many kinds of historical actors with what we might call micro-constitutionalism, conflicts over the way particular sets of rights and prerogatives were distributed and exercised within the imperial order. The political cultures of empires were shot through with lessons about how to recognize the subtlest signs of incipient overreaching.</p>
<p>If attacks on petty despotism invited wide participation, the label itself was also democratically applied. Anyone could attract it in the right circumstances. According to Edmund Burke, Warren Hastings acquired the trappings of a petty despot almost as soon as he stepped on Indian soil. Hastings’ regime featured “an oppressive, irregular, capricious, unsteady, rapacious, and peculating despotism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1743872111419583">38</xref></sup> The condition was not contagious, exactly, though certainly suspicions loomed that Europeans posted in the colonies rekindled despotic attitudes that had become obsolete in Europe. Despotism in Asia was “naturalized,” as Montesquieu had put it, while Europeans only acquired the habit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1743872111419583">39</xref></sup> An observer of Dutch East India Company rule in the Cape Colony invoked this logic in commenting that it was possible to “forgive the tyrannous despots of the east” but not “the rulers of Europe for tyrannizing those of their subjects who have … settled in remote countries, distant from their sovereignty.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1743872111419583">40</xref></sup> Petty despotism appeared to be spontaneously generated in the conditions of empire, where some men ruled others on behalf of an absent sovereign power, while facing daily the temptation of grasping the wrong measure of power, holding it badly, or sustaining it too long.</p>

<title>IV. Conclusion</title>
<p>At the core of imperial legal order lay the tension between the imperatives of rule and its unreliability. Rule over distant parts of empire required the recognition of multiple legal authorities with sufficient discretion to rule in the absence of the sovereign. At the same time, the ambiguities of defining the powers invested in intermediate authority unleashed instability. The holders of legal authority were positioned to defend and expand their prerogatives. And subjects under their sway were poised to claim that their ties to sovereigns formed a stronger and more important constitutional bond, one that required a closer definition of the limits on the legal prerogatives of their “masters” – imperial officials, garrison commanders, sea captains, colonial proprietors, and those who owned or controlled the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>Participants in this unsettled and fluid imperial order drew arguments from multiple legal traditions and sources, combining them in both well-established and novel ways. One result was a discourse about petty despotism that appeared in structurally very different sorts of imperial entities, from the semi-sovereign “states” of trading companies to tiny enclaves under military rule. This preoccupation played on preexisting jurisdictional tensions. It also generated new conflicts over the nature and scope of the power held by semi-sovereigns and about the implications of their actions for the rights of subjects under them.</p>
<p>Both generalizations and historical specificity aid in studying the phenomenon. Assertions about the degree to which constitutional questions took hold of imperial subjects’ imagination must be constructed with careful attention to historical context. This article has referred to figures such as Washington, Bentham, Artigas, and Bligh in part because the decades from the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century comprised a period in which revolutions and constitutions were constructs with apparent and immediate force. Advocates of particular arrangements of power and hierarchy understood that the stakes of conflicts over such questions were very high. Against this background, the rhetoric of debates about delegated legal authorities sharpened, as did the efforts of many such authorities to erect a more nearly complete control over subordinates. Sailors of the late-eighteenth century lived in a much more regimented world than seamen of the early and mid-eighteenth century, for example.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1743872111419583">41</xref></sup> Restrictions on vagrants and servants tightened.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1743872111419583">42</xref></sup> Debates about slavery swirled. In empires across the world, metropolitan officials imagined and planned a newly systematized imperial legal order. In contrast to earlier notions of jurisdictional webs, the new models featured hierarchies of authority with clearer lines of connection and control. This was also a world of intensified inter-imperial competition and intra-imperial consolidation in the service of that competition. Reining in the prerogatives of local rule became a prominent part of imperial politics everywhere.</p>
<p>At the same time, we would be mistaken to think of conflicts over the imperial constitution as peculiar to this period. It was in part precisely because constitutional discourse and politics stretched back in time that the rhetoric of subjecthood and controls on petty despotism became such potent resources for politics at the turn of the nineteenth century. Nor were such preoccupations peculiar to the Anglo-American or Atlantic worlds. European empires drew on Roman models, sources, and rhetoric, reinterpreting and even twisting them in new contexts. Deep-seated notions of sovereignty as divisible infused imperial legal cultures across Eurasia and Africa. Jurisdictional tensions in many places followed similar patterns, with the familiar result of conflicts concentrating at the level of petty imperial authorities of various kinds. Without losing sight of historical distinctions or of the highly nuanced cultural practices that always informed specific understandings of the practices seen as constituting intolerable injustice, we know that imperial subjects everywhere judged their judges. As an idea, petty despotism traveled well. It also emerged spontaneously in disparate, unconnected places.</p>
<p>The point brings us back to the question of arbitrary power. It is tempting to look to Carl Schmitt when thinking about the structural continuities of power and law. Schmitt’s definition of the sovereign as “he who decides on the exception” appears relevant to understanding the “arbitrary” rule of semi-sovereigns, who exercised power in the name of the sovereign and had the capacity to reproduce the sovereign’s claim to be the arbiter of exception – a form of exemption from the effects of the law. Schmitt’s formulation, though, is flawed precisely because it leads, as we see especially clearly in many applications, to the conclusion that the effect of the sovereign’s capacity is to open up spaces of exception. In the study of empires, it is easy to associate such spaces with the jurisdictional fields under the “arbitrary sway” of petty despots. Martial law, for example, as enforced by a garrison commander, is counted as an example of the suspension of law and the creation of exception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1743872111419583">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>What we learn from the close study of imperial legalities is that the layered sovereignty of empires creates multiple legal fields rather than gaps and holes in the application of law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1743872111419583">44</xref></sup> The “suspension” of law, in other words, always generated more law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1743872111419583">45</xref></sup> The accusation of “arbitrary” power assumed an audience firmly invested in the notion that no one was above the law. For their part, legal authorities rarely strayed from the story that they were behaving in ways formally approved and clearly permissible. The effect was less an epidemic of exceptionalism than a surfeit of legalism.</p>
<p>Imperial politics featured conflicts over power conducted in the medium of law. This was not a free-flowing legal culture but one of pools and eddies, of concentrated attention to defining the legal ties of subjects to sovereigns, the limits of the prerogatives of delegated legal authorities, and the boundaries of jurisdictions. Lawyers commented on imperial structure and practice at every level, but people with no legal training used the language and categories of law in developing their own critiques of the exercise of power, especially its local performance. Alternative arrangements of power vied for support, forming part of a repertoire of imperial constitutionalism. In this cluttered discourse, calls for order merged with the defense of rights, and appeals to justice combined with cries for censure because of the abuse of power. Constitutional critics focused their attention on controlling prerogatives while imagining an imperial order in which the acts of all petty despots would be just.</p>

<p>Armitage makes this point about the natural law language of the Declaration of Independence. Another example of this pattern surfaced in nineteenth-century British campaigns against piracy, when unilateral imperial actions against pirates in regions where the British navy dominated the seas depended little if at all on other polities’ recognition that the sea bandits were considered pirates under the law of nations. Acts of violence ordered and implemented by the British navy in ways mainly independent of imperial law and unfettered by international norms were described as authorized by universally regarded principles.
