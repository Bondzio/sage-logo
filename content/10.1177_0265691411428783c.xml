<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783c"><title>Efrat Ben-Ze’ev, Ruth Ginio and Jay Winter, eds, <italic>Shadows of War: A Social History of Silence in the Twentieth Century</italic>, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2010; ix + 223 pp., 1 b/w illus.; 9780521196581, £50.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This volume of essays aims, as the Preface puts it, ‘at a shift in emphasis in discussions of the general themes of memory and forgetting, by privileging a third element, that surrounding silence and silencing in the way individuals and groups reconfigure the past’. The first two pieces, by Jay Winter and Eviatar Zeruvabel respectively, set the scene for the book as a whole. Winter defines different kinds of silence – liturgical, political, essentialist – before investigating the relationship between silence and war, the functions of silence, and the puncturing of silence. Zeruvabel examines the ‘social sound of silence’, a term which by its very nature draws our attention to the fact that silence is not the absence of an opinion or a perspective, but often a form of maintaining, asserting and even enforcing a position.</p>
<p>The rest of the book consists of case studies, the first set of which focus on Europe. In her essay on the Spanish Civil War, Mary Vincent analyses the informal, unspoken but nevertheless binding <italic>pacto de silencio</italic>, or pact of silence, which surrounded this event during the period of transition from Franco’s rule to the Juan Carlos monarchy; this silence, useful at the time to patch over adversarial tensions, has certainly been shattered in recent years as Spain’s confrontation with the Civil War can be used to demonstrate, in turn, its democratic maturity. Jeffrey K. Olick then provides a fascinating discussion of the differences between the attitudes towards the Nazi past of Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger. Jaspers’s quadripartite typology of guilt – he identified a moral and criminal guilt at the individual level, and a metaphysical and political one at the collective level (74) – is set in contrast by Olick to Heidegger’s refusal, for his own person, to countenance acknowledgement and confession. Heidegger, very much like Martin Walser in his 1998 German Trade Book Prize speech, insists on the autonomy of conscience, the inner voice, thus legitimating silence. I am not sure whether Olick’s characterization of Heidegger’s position as corresponding more to a ‘shame’ rather than a ‘guilt’ culture works entirely, given that Heidegger is rejecting the persuasive power of external sanctions – even where he might, through an intellectual sleight of hand, identify his own conscience as that external power (82). The final piece in this section, by Svenja Goltermann, makes clear that it is necessary to distinguish between the constraints on what could be remembered publicly in West Germany, and the individual memory of the war, which she explores with reference to psychiatric files kept on returning German POWs.</p>
<p>In the third part of the book – on Africa – Raphaëlle Branche and Jim House examine the various silences imposed by both ‘victim’ and ‘perpetrator’ on the history of the torture endemic to the Algerian War of Independence, as well as on that of the police violence during the Algerian demonstrations of 17 October 1961. Ruth Ginio then discusses the African silences surrounding the participation of African soldiers – the tirailleurs sénégalais – in the French army during the colonial period; she makes clear that these silences were partial and selective, as Africans living in France and the state of Senegal, for instance, preferred to remember some aspects of that participation, but not others. And Louise Bethlehem reflects on whether the healing process triggered by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, which she assesses partly through the prism of J. M. Coetzee’s novel <italic>Disgrace</italic> (1999), might not have entailed a certain instrumentalization of the breaking of silence as a ritual act whereby the new state separated itself off from its past.</p>
<p>The final section concentrates on the Middle East. Taner Akçam – one of the first Turkish academics to confront the Armenian genocide – provides a fascinating diagnosis of the reasons for Turkey’s denial of this genocide. Akçam points to a deeply-rooted, historically conditioned Turkish neurosis associating issues of human rights with a threat to national sovereignty; this neurosis dates back to the territorial demands of the Armenians, Greeks and Kurds and the see-sawing post-1918 settlements of Sèvres and Lausanne. Efrat Ben-Ze’ev then explores the way soldiers who fought in Israel’s war of independence later drew a ‘veil of silence’ (181) over the more ugly aspects of their participation in this war, tending instead towards a more heroic narrative as expected by the state. Finally, Asher Kaufmann shows that, despite knowing of Ariel Sharon’s role in the massacres at the Lebanese refugee camps Sabra and Shatila in 1982, Israelis, until recently, by and large preferred to keep silent on this aspect of his biography, imagining Sharon rather as a patriotic figure.</p>
<p>The book tells us much about what was not talked about, and explains why. Silence, clearly, does not necessarily entail remembering one thing and forgetting another (though it might), so much as choosing not to recall something publicly, bottling it away, while perhaps articulating another memory. Public memory, then, is constructed as much through myriad privates silences as through what is openly articulated; equally, private memory does not necessarily correlate to public memory. <italic>Shadows of War</italic> assembles well-written essays of a consistently high standard. It goes a considerable way towards achieving its goal of shifting the focus away from the prevalent remembering-versus-forgetting binary towards an appreciation of what we might see as an intermediate position of silence. That is no mean feat.</p>
