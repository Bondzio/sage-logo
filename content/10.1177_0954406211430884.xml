<abstract>
<p>In laser forming, deformation of a plate is different when different mechanisms play dominant roles. A deformation field depends on a temperature field that is related to process parameters, material properties and plate size. Numerical investigations of temperature distribution with different process parameters were carried out when different mechanisms were active. A critical temperature for generating plastic deformation was investigated. Four temperature feature parameters were defined based on the temperature distribution characteristics of the high-temperature zone. The numerical results show that the temperature gradient is obviously different under different mechanism conditions. The temperature distribution features for the different mechanisms have a larger difference, which is helpful for the discrimination of different mechanisms according to the temperature field in real industrial applications.</p>

<p>Laser forming is a flexible and dieless forming process realised by introducing non-uniform thermal stresses into the surface of a work piece with a laser beam. As a hot accumulation forming method, in comparison with conventional metal forming processes, requires no dies or external forces, and it is particularly suitable for forming hard and brittle materials, which is a promising technology in manufacturing such as in the shipbuilding, automobile, microelectronics and aerospace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211430884">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211430884">3</xref></sup> industries, and in low volume production.</p>
<p>The majority of works to date have been based on four laser forming mechanisms, including the temperature-gradient mechanism (TGM), the buckling mechanism (BM), the upsetting mechanism (UM) and the coupling mechanism (CM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211430884">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211430884">6</xref></sup> The deformation behaviours of sheet metal are different under different mechanism conditions. In real industrial applications, in the formation of a complicated shape, the heating path and process parameters need to be ascertained according to the strain field of sheet metal heated by a laser beam. Therefore, it is necessary to know which mechanism is dominant for certain process parameters. The forming mechanisms are determined by the temperature field that is influenced by the process parameters, material properties and geometry of the work piece. In the past few years, the effects of different process parameters and cooling conditions of the temperature field have been extensively investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211430884">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211430884">9</xref></sup> However, the temperature distribution feature of different forming mechanisms has not been fully studied.</p>
<p>In this article, the temperature distribution was analysed by choosing different process parameters when the different forming mechanisms were active. The critical temperature for generating plastic deformation was also investigated. To quantitatively describe the temperature field, four temperature feature parameters are defined based on the temperature distribution characteristics of the high-temperature zone, which is helpful for judging which mechanism is dominant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211430884"><title>Numerical simulation and experiments</title>
<p>The numerical simulation of the laser forming process based on thermal-structure analysis was carried out with ANSYS software, through accounting for the temperature dependency of the thermal and mechanical properties of the material. No melting or external forces were involved, and the metal plate was flat and free of residual stresses. Further, heat generated by plastic deformation was negligible because it is small compared with heat input by the laser beam. The thermal load was given in the form of thermal flux density, which can be roughly expressed by a Gaussian function. The heat flux generated by the laser beam was only applied to the top surface of the metal plate. Free convection and radiation boundary conditions occur on all surfaces. Detailed finite element modelling in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211430884">10</xref></sup> is also reported.</p>
<p>The experiments were conducted with an HJ-3000 CO<sub>2</sub> laser system with a maximum output power of 3 kW, in a continuous wave mode. The power density distribution of the laser beam follows a Gaussian function. The irradiated surface of the specimen was coated with graphite to enhance the absorption of laser energy. The material investigated was st12 steel, and the specimen size was 50 × 50 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>. The laser parameters were 600 W for the power, 15 mm/s for the velocity and 6 mm for the spot diameter in the experimental study. The laser beam moves once along the heating line in the experiments. The temperature history of the specimen was measured using a thermocouple and temperature acquisition module, and the thermocouple distributions of the plate are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211430884">Figure 1</xref>. The measuring range of the thermocouple was −40°C to 1290°C after calibration.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211430884">Figure 2</xref> shows the comparisons of the experiments and numerical temperature history of a specimen. As seen from the figures, the experimental results are based in accordance with the numerical results. Measurement errors mainly resulted from the effect of the thermocouple response time, the sampling frequency and measuring position deviation.

<sec id="sec4-0954406211430884"><title>Temperature-gradient mechanism</title>
<p>A fast scan of the plate using the laser beams forms a steep thermal gradient along the thickness direction that produces differential thermal expansion. Compressive stresses at the heated zone arise because of the thermal expansion. Once the thermal stress reaches the temperature-dependent flow stress, the plastic strain occurs near the top surface because of the restriction of the surrounding cool material; but the plastic strain does not occur at the bottom surface due to low temperature. During cooling, the material of heated zone contracts and the plastic deformation of plate cannot recover; so, the plate bends towards the laser beam.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954406211430884"><title>Buckling mechanism</title>
<p>The spot diameter is greater than the plate thickness, and a slow scanning speed is used under the BM conditions. When the laser beam scans on the top surface, the heated zone begins to expand while the expansion is confined by the surrounding cool material. Once a buckling has developed, the convex deformation will grow further. Consequently, the plastic deformation of the top surface is greater than that of the bottom surface after cooling, which makes the plate metal bend away from the laser beam. When the buckling occurs in certain direction, the rest of the plate will bend in that direction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954406211430884"><title>Upsetting mechanism</title>
<p>The plastic deformation at the top surface is nearly equal to that at the bottom surface under the UM condition. The material of the heat zone is compressed with a nearly constant strain along the thickness direction by restriction on the thermal expansion from the surrounding cool material. That results in a shortening of material of heated zone and an increase in the thickness of the region in the cooling process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211430884"><title>Coupling mechanism</title>
<p>The CM is the combination of the TGM and the UM. The process parameter is between that of the TGM and that of the UM. Under the CM, the plastic deformation all occurs at the top and bottom surfaces, but the plastic deformation of the top surface is slightly greater than that of the bottom surface.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0954406211430884"><title>Analysis of temperature field</title>
<p>During the forming process, the sample was clamped at one side. A laser beam was moved along the <italic>X</italic>-axis with constant laser power and scanning speed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211430884">Figure 3</xref>.

<p>As a flexible forming process, the deformation field of the plate is dependent on the temperature distribution. To analyse the difference of temperature distribution under different forming mechanisms, numerical simulations were conducted with different process parameters, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211430884">Table 1</xref>. The various plate sizes and thicknesses are mainly used to acquire the different forming mechanisms, because these mechanisms correspond to the different laser parameters and plate size. Every group parameter corresponds to a different forming mechanism.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430884">Figure 4</xref> shows the numerical results of <italic>Y</italic>-axis plastic strain at the top and middle surfaces of the sample along the scanning path. The plastic strain in the middle is defined as in-plane strain that expands or contracts the middle surface. The difference of the <italic>Y</italic>-axis plastic strain between the top and middle surfaces is bending strain, which bends the plate. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430884">Figure 4</xref>(a), it can be seen that the bending strain is far more than the in-plane strain, and the in-plane strain is close to zero. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430884">Figure 4</xref>(b), it can be seen that the <italic>Y</italic>-axis plastic strain of the middle is more than that at the top surface; thus, the bending angle is away from the laser beam. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430884">Figure 4</xref>(c), it can be seen that the in-plane strain is far more than the bending strain, and the bending strain can be negligible. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430884">Figure 4</xref>(d), it can be seen that the bending strain and in-plane strain coexist, and neither of them can be ignored. Consequently, cases 1–4 correspond to TGM, BM, UM and CM, respectively.

<p>The contour plots of the temperature distribution of the top surface and the cross-section along the scanning path under the different mechanisms when the laser beam moves at the centre of the plate are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211430884">Figure 5</xref>. As seen from the figure, the temperature gradient of the top surface in a TGM-dominated forming process is maximal, while the temperature gradient of the top surface in a UM-dominated forming process is minimal. Furthermore, the temperature gradient along the thickness direction is obviously different when different mechanisms play a dominant role. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211430884">Figure 6</xref> shows the temperature distributions along <italic>X</italic>- and <italic>Y</italic>-directions and under the different mechanisms. From the figures, it can be seen that there is a large difference in the temperature distribution under the different mechanism conditions. For the high-temperature zone, the temperature differences between the top and bottom surfaces under the TGM and CM are larger, while those under the BM and UM are smaller. For the low-temperature zone, the temperature distributions of the top and bottom surfaces are almost the same. It is worth noting that there is a time difference between the top and bottom surfaces reaching the peak temperature.

<sec id="sec10-0954406211430884"><title>Critical conditions for generating plastic deformation</title>
<p>In practical heat forming, the elastic deformation is useless because the metal plate returns to its original shape after cooling. Therefore, we need to determine the conditions under which the plastic deformation can occur. The temperature of the top surface is the highest in the thickness direction, and as the flow stress of the material decreases very quickly as the temperature increases, the material of the top surface yields the easiest. If the maximal thermal stress at the top surface is greater than the flow stress, the plastic deformation of the metal plate is generated. However, it is difficult to determine an analytical solution of the amount of thermal stress because the material properties are dependent on the temperature. It is well known that the temperature field determines the deformation field; so, we assume that the plastic deformation can occur when the highest temperature of the top surface exceeds a certain critical temperature.</p>
<p>For a particular material, we determined the critical temperature using numerical simulation. In determining the critical temperature, nine cases with different scanning velocities were specified in order to obtain the different peak temperatures, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211430884">Table 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211430884">Figure 7</xref> shows simulated time histories of <italic>Y</italic>-direction plastic strains of the central point of the top surface under different scanning velocities. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211430884">Figure 7</xref>, it can be seen that the plastic strain is very small (about 2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) in case 8, and the plastic strain of case 9 is equal to zero. Therefore, we chose the highest temperature of the top surface under case 9, which is about 330°C, as the critical temperature. For certain heating conditions, if the highest temperature at the top surface exceeds the critical temperature, the plastic deformation is generated; otherwise only the elastic deformation is generated in the metal plate.

<sec id="sec11-0954406211430884"><title>Temperature feature parameters</title>
<p>The aim of temperature field investigations is to analyse the deformation field. The final deformation of a plate is determined by the high-temperature zone according to the above evaluation. Thus, the distribution characteristic of the temperature can be described by the peak temperature and the high-temperature region size.</p>
<p>Regarding line heating, Dong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211430884">11</xref></sup> proposed a descriptive method using four feature parameters, which include the peak temperature of the top surface, the peak temperature of the bottom surface and the heating width and heating length of the top surface. The heating length along the <italic>X</italic> direction has little effect on the plate deformation in a real laser forming process, while the heating length of the bottom surface has an important effect on the final deformation. To accurately describe the temperature distribution of the high-temperature zone, four feature parameters are defined, including the peak temperature of the top surface in a quasi-stable state <italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>max</sub>, the ratio of the peak temperature of the bottom surface to that of the top surface <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic>, the heating width over 200°C at the top surface <italic>B<sub>t</sub></italic> and the ratio of the heating width of top surface to that of bottom surface <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic>. <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic> is defined as <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic> = (<italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic><sub>max</sub>/<italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>max</sub>) × 100%, and <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> is defined as <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> = (<italic>B<sub>b</sub></italic>/<italic>B<sub>t</sub></italic>) × 100%, where <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> is the peak temperature of the bottom surface in the quasi-stable state and <italic>B<sub>b</sub></italic> is defined as the heating width over 200°C at the bottom surface.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211430884">Figure 8</xref> shows comparisons of temperature feature parameters under the four forming mechanisms, and the process parameters chosen are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211430884">Table 3</xref>. As seen, the peak temperatures of the top surface <italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> under the BM and the UM are higher than those under the TGM and the CM. For the ratio of the peak temperature of the bottom surface to that of the top surface <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic>, it is over 90% under the BM and the UM, which is greater than that under the TGM and the CM; so, <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic> is the smallest in the TGM-dominant condition. The heating width of the top surface <italic>B<sub>t</sub></italic> under the UM is larger than that under the other three mechanisms, and that of the BM is second. For the ratio <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> of the heating width of the top surface to that of the bottom surface, under the BM and UM, <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> is close to 100%, and that under the TGM, which is lower than 50%, is the smallest.

<p>In conclusion, the four temperature feature parameters under the TGM are all smaller. Under the BM, the four temperature feature parameters are all larger, and <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> is close to 100%. Under the UM, <italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic> are larger, and <italic>B<sub>t</sub></italic> is far larger than the other three mechanisms, while <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> is close to 100%. Under the CM, <italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>max</sub>, <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic> and <italic>B<sub>t</sub></italic> are all smaller, however, <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> is obviously larger than that under the TGM and obviously smaller than that under the BM and UM. Thus, it can be seen that the temperature feature parameters of the four mechanisms have large differences, which can be helpful for discrimination of the different mechanisms according to the temperature field in real industrial applications.</p>

<list-item><p>The temperature distributions of laser forming when choosing different process parameters that correspond to different forming mechanisms were analysed. The results show that under the different mechanisms, the temperature distribution characteristics of the high-temperature zone have larger differences, and the time differences to reach the peak temperature between the top and bottom surfaces are different.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The critical conditions for generating plastic deformation were obtained by numerical simulation with nine cases of process parameters. The results show that the critical temperature is about 330°C.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Four feature parameters, <italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>max</sub>, <italic>R<sub>T</sub></italic>, <italic>B<sub>t</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>W</sub></italic> were presented based on the temperature analysis in order to describe the high-temperature zone. The results show that the temperature feature parameters of the four mechanisms have a larger difference, which is helpful for the discrimination of different mechanisms according to the temperature field in real industrial applications.</p></list-item>
