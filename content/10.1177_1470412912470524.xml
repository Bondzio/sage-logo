<abstract>
<p>This experimental essay is a documentary–fiction account of two research trips undertaken in 2010 to Bhopal, India, and Bridgehampton, USA, by a photographer called Smith and an anthropologist called Willing. Their purpose was to investigate the social, cultural and environmental aftermath of the 1984 Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal, with a view to proposing ways in which the disaster might be exploited for commemorative, educational and entertainment purposes. Smith and Willing enumerate here on the ways in which photography and ethnography, as well as the disaster’s ‘materiality’ – its routes and objects – could be used to generate a disaster tourism event in both Bhopal and Bridgehampton, the home of Union Carbide’s former CEO, Warren Anderson. Part fantasy, part political and cultural critique, Bhopal to Bridgehampton also represents a meditation on authorship and the limits of the autobiographical gesture in ethnography. While their experiences are loosely based on some of the author’s own, Smith and Willing are emphatically fictional characters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Smith is a photographer. Willing is an anthropologist</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Since 2006 Smith has taken many photographs at places that are either already associated with the phenomenon known as ‘dark tourism’, or might in future come to be associated with it</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>To date, Smith has produced photographs in: (a) former Nazi death camps in eastern Europe including Auschwitz-Birkenau, Sobibor, Belzec and Majdanak; (b) favelas in Rio de Janeiro; (c) Palestine; (d) Bhopal, state capital of Madhyar Pradesh, India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470412912470524">1</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p><italic>As an anthropologist and ethnographer, Willing’s primary interest is in the way in which Smith behaves in challenging environments and difficult situations</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>What follows is what remains of a short story written by Willing from 12–30 November 2010. This story, which includes photographs by Smith, was almost entirely destroyed by Smith during a violent confrontation with Willing in spring 2011</italic>.</p>

<title>Disaster</title>
<p>On 3 December 1984 – hours before the release of Band Aid’s hit single <italic>Do they know it’s Christmas?</italic> – a lethal gas cloud containing 47 tonnes of Methyl Icocyanate (MIC) leaked from Tank E110 at Union Carbide’s UCIL plant in Bhopal. The leak resulted in what Judge John F Keenan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470412912470524">Baxi, 2010</xref>: 23) subsequently called the world’s ‘largest peacetime disaster’. It is estimated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bhopal.net">bhopal.net</ext-link>: 2012) that around 15,000–20,000 people died in the immediate aftermath of the gas leak at the UCIL plant. According to the Bhopal Medical Appeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470412912470524">2011</xref>), since then approximately 100,000 Bhopalis have experienced the effects of chronic gas damage. According to various sources (including Greenpeace, the Bhopal Medical Appeal, the Sambhavna Clinic and Chingari Trust), as a result of the failure of Union Carbide and Dow Chemical (which purchased Union Carbide in 2001) to accept responsibility for the pollution of the water supply for 16 communities in the immediate vicinity of the factory site, or to decontaminate those areas, ‘more than 30,000 people’ have suffered, and continue to suffer, the effects of lethally contaminated drinking water. This means that since 1984 at least 150,000 people have been negatively affected by Union Carbide’s commercial operations in Bhopal.</p>
<p>Grass-roots activists, including the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bhopal.net">bhopal.net</ext-link>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470412912470524">2011</xref>), presently continue to exert pressure on Dow Chemical, as well as the Indian state, with a view to: increasing levels of financial compensation for those affected by all aspects of the disaster; improving health care initiatives in Bhopal; the extradition of Union Carbide’s then CEO, Warren Anderson (currently a resident of Bridgehampton, USA); and the implementation of the ‘polluter must pay’ principle whereby, according to Principle 16 of the United Nations’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470412912470524">1992 <italic>Rio Declaration on Environment and Development</italic></xref>, the party responsible for producing pollution – in this case, Union Carbide – is held responsible for alleviating damage caused by pollution to the environment.</p>

<p>10 November 2009. Babular Gaur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912470524">Dinkar and Kaur, 2009</xref>), State Minister for Bhopal Gas Tragedy, Relief and Rehabilitation, announces a plan to open the UCIL (Union Carbide India Ltd) factory gates for sightseeing and disaster tourism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470412912470524">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Gaur states: ‘This is to help people get rid of the misconception that chemical waste is still harmful and that the chemicals are polluting the water in nearby localities’ (p. 29).</p>
<p>Gaur cites as evidence a letter from the Indian Ministry of Defence’s <italic>Defence Research and Development Organisation</italic> (DRDO) in Gwalior. The letter states that nothing alarming has been detected in samples that have been tested for toxicity in the DRDO lab.</p>
<p>Gaur states: ‘All samples – excavated waste, lime sludge, naphtol tar, reactor residue, semi-processed pesticide and Sevin tar – have low mammalian toxicity, according to experiments done on animals’ (p. 29).</p>
<p>According to DRDO director, R Vijayaraghavan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912470524">Dinkar and Kaur, 2009</xref>: 29): ‘A 70kg man will not die if he takes 200gm of the waste orally or eats 100gm of Sevin tar. In fact the toxicity is less than that of table salt.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470412912470524">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The winning design for the proposed Bhopal disaster memorial to be erected at the UCIL site in due course includes plans for:</p>

<p>According to SR Mohanty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912470524">Dinkar and Kaur, 2009</xref>: 29), Principal Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Government: ‘This will dispel the myth that there are toxins left at the site.’</p>

<title>Disaster Tourism Event: The Production of Routes and Objects</title>
<p>Although Smith and I believe that a disaster memorial is a persuasive idea, we believe that the scope of the winning proposal is limited and that this will eventually undermine the project’s commercial potential, which is enormous.</p>
<p>Choosing only to identify the disaster with a specific place – the UCIL plant in Bhopal – is a grave mistake. If the disaster were instead more broadly defined; that is, in terms of <italic>all</italic> of the spaces and places that it has continued to occupy since 12.05 am, 3 December 1984, then it will become clear that there are innumerable places and spaces in Bhopal, and beyond, that are ripe for exploitation by both the Indian and American commemoration and disaster tourism industries.</p>
<p>On the ‘night of the gas’, we know that few people died at the factory. Thus, there is no reason why memorialisations of the disaster in Bhopal should always be identified with – and situated at – the UCIL site itself. Note that, unlike visitors to Auschwitz-Birkenau, 44 years earlier, Bhopali gas victims did not travel many miles to meet <italic>their</italic> gas. Their gas travelled to them; and the path that their gas took was determined not by any complex administrative procedures (which is not to say that such things were entirely superfluous) but by the direction of the wind, which nudged, shoved and harassed the gas through the streets of Bhopal. Thus, it was in the streets and alleys that the disaster was – to begin with, at least – most visibly played out, and not at the site of the factory. That is to say, those streets and alleys in and around the various districts of, for example, Chola, Bafna Colony, Rasalda Colony and Railway Station No. 1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470412912470524">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>But let us not even restrict the disaster to the streets and alleys of Bhopal or, incidentally, to sentimental descriptions of the sudden deaths of small children. Because, clearly, it is in everyone’s cultural and commercial interests to identify and thereafter exploit each detail, every conceivable trace of the disaster, however tangential and banal they might at first appear.</p>
<p>So, for example, the arrest, release and subsequent drafting, re-drafting and revision of documents relating to the many charges (including culpable homicide) which, since 1984, have been brought against Union Carbide’s former Chief Executive Officer, Warren Anderson (as well as various applications that have been and continue to be filed for Mr.. Anderson’s extradition to India from Bridgehampton USA) – could not have been or continue to be enacted without a stellar cast of indifferent supporting objects, including cars, planes, cushions, ball point pens, restaurant receipts, door handles, golf caddies, telephones and fast food cartons.</p>
<p>Likewise, the notorious Bhopal Act – with which the Indian government enshrined in law the ‘judicial incompetence’ of those affected by the disaster, thus preventing them from acting autonomously against Union Carbide – remains steeped in materiality. And, while the Act itself is substantively immaterial, in that its legislative and social identity cannot seriously be reduced to, for example, the specific location at which it might have originated, or a tea cup that was nursed by a government appointed lawyer during one of many interminable conversations held about it, note that its materiality (including doodles) does at least allow us to objectify it in a multiplicity of economically and symbolically productive ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470412912470524">Figure 2</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912470524">Das, 2005</xref>: 51–59).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470412912470524">4</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>In short, seemingly intangible events like these may be transformed into discrete commodities by aggressively defining them in relation to those objects through which such events were, in part, originally constituted. Suffice to say that we are in no doubt that each one of our objects will supersede even the considerable seductive capacities of the original 1970s soft furnishings at the Stasi Museum’s memorable coffee bar in Ruschestrasse, Berlin.</p>
<p>Appreciate that the aim of <italic>this</italic> project is not simply to make available a set of already existing disaster objects and images – to reveal what is already apparently there – but to generate novel ‘evidence’ in innovative and sometimes euphemistic ways. And the base material for this ‘evidence’ could consist of anything: from gold bangles and oblong sun traps to the feelings of revulsion that Smith experienced at a UCIL solar pond on the perimeter of Blue Moon Colony, when Sidak – her guide, friend and fixer – stepped into a pile of excrement that Smith believed was animal but which was actually not.</p>
<p>The point is that everything can and must be reduced to the disaster; everything can and must be used to re-define and re-articulate it, from white tigers to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912470524">Georgio Agamben (1978</xref>: 16) suggestively calls ‘eternal moments of dumb promiscuity among strangers in lifts and buses’. Note, however, that although everything is subjugated to it, including ourselves, this does not then mean that each thing, each photographic and linguistic gesture, smell and space will scream ‘disaster’. On the contrary, much, if not most of what happens today in Bhopal, and certainly Bridgehampton, is not ostensibly related to the disaster at all: for example, two stray dogs on Hamidia Road, four blades of grass at Shimla Hills, one rocking boat on Upper Lake, three joggers on Ocean Road. It is simply the case that, for Smith and I, everything is a prop. Or, at least, everything is destined to be one. And our story – perhaps <italic>hallucination</italic> is a better word? – will be told through many different props: things in cases, sumptuous, evocative photographs, colourful ethnographies, and walking tours (to name but a few), all of which will of course bear traces of the Ur-event - that thing upon which <italic>our</italic> story will in future only appear to have been built, and in relation to which it will become simultaneously closer and more distant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470412912470524">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>But let us not forget the factory.</p>
<p>Realize, Messrs Gaur and Mohanty, that the old UCIL plant potentially offers the visitor something that Auschwitz never can: chemically motivated symptoms of physiological distress (coughing, a burning sensation on one’s upper lip, respiratory difficulties, etc). And whilst it’s true that one can peruse, with one’s eyes only, empty canisters of Zyklon B, the lethal gas pellets used at Auschwitz, it is regrettably the case that one cannot actually <italic>taste</italic> Zyklon B. One cannot ingest it, one cannot be properly consumed by it in the same way that one is physically consumed by the panoply of heavy metals that are not only still present in the soil at the UCIL plant but which continue to pollute the water shelf beneath it.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaur, Mr. Mohanty, pollution is not a liability. On the contrary, it is a commercial and educational opportunity and to churlishly deny its existence is to deny its economic and cultural potential, which is infinite. Whilst attractions of a similar nature might attempt to simulate experiences of physical and emotional distress – the Imperial War Museum’s execrable ‘Blitz Experience’ for example, where visitors can huddle together in a fiberglass ‘bomb shelter’ and experience a mock ‘air raid’ – Smith and I believe that the anodyne and infantile nature of such events will rarely, if ever, satisfy the visitor’s quest for authenticity. How different would be the visitor’s experience at the UCIL site, where the ingestion of chemicals will furnish the intrepid tourist not with an insipid pseudo-trace of the past, but with an authentic shadow agony: an indexical, embodied and gloriously toxic connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470412912470524">Figures 4</xref>

<title>Routes and Objects (1): Railway Station No.1 – DB City Mall <italic>via</italic> Ocean Road</title>
<p>Smith does not use a regular camera bag because, in her own words: ‘Proper camera bags are too conspicuous.’ Instead, she has, in the past, used plastic shopping bags produced by well-known brands including Tesco (1997), Lidl (2002), Debenhams (2004), Gap (2004), Wal-Mart (2008), Waitrose (2009) and Primark (2010).</p>
<p>Today she is using a smart blue American rucksack.</p>
<p>Smith has two detachable camera backs, each of which is loaded with colour film rated at 50 ASA. Once Smith has shot all of the film in the first back (12 frames) she will quickly replace it with the second without having to worry about re-loading ‘mid-mission’, as she calls it. She keeps the second, substitute, back in one of her American rucksack’s three zip-up pockets. (Sometimes Smith forgets which one of the three pockets contains the substitute back.)</p>
<p>Although shooting time will inevitably be wasted loading film, once all of the shots in the second back have been exhausted, Smith tries to make sure that re-loading takes place in between what she calls <italic>shooting chapters</italic>, although this is not always possible.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470412912470524">Smith (2010</xref>: 21) defines the term <italic>shooting chapter</italic> as follows: ‘A <italic>shooting chapter</italic> is a discrete photographic event, of which there may be several during any one mission.’ She defines the term <italic>mission</italic> as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>A <italic>mission</italic> might consist of a journey from, for example, Railway Station No.1 to DB City shopping mall in MP Nagar. Photographing the area around Station No.1 would constitute one <italic>shooting chapter</italic>. Another <italic>shooting chapter</italic> might, for example, involve the taking of photographs outside the Swastika Investment Management Company on Berasia Road. (p. 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A <italic>shooting chapter</italic> can usually be identified with a specific physical location, although this isn’t always the case. A <italic>mission</italic> can comprise any number of <italic>shooting chapters</italic>. According to Smith: ‘<italic>Shooting chapters</italic> consist of one or more <italic>shooting paragraphs</italic>’ (p. 22). Smith defines the term <italic>shooting paragraph</italic> as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>A <italic>shooting paragraph</italic> corresponds to the particular position that one might assume at any given point during a <italic>shooting chapter</italic>. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470412912470524">Figure 10</xref>, which was taken in the vicinity of Railway Station No.1 would constitute one <italic>shooting paragraph</italic> while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1470412912470524">Figure 11</xref>, which was taken approximately 12 meters to the right of the place where <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470412912470524">Figure 10</xref> was taken, would constitute a different <italic>shooting paragraph</italic>. However, two photographs taken from the same position and, possibly, of the same thing will necessarily belong to the same <italic>shooting paragraph</italic>.

<p>Each <italic>shooting paragraph</italic> consists of one or more <italic>shooting sentences. A shooting sentence</italic> might look exactly the same as a <italic>shooting paragraph</italic> but, as the above example illustrates, this is not always the case. Smith defines the term <italic>shooting sentence</italic> as follows: ‘A <italic>shooting sentence</italic> is equivalent to a particular photograph and is composed of <italic>shooting words</italic>’ (p. 24). Smith defines the term <italic>shooting words</italic> as follows: ‘<italic>Shooting words</italic> are the formal elements of which a particular photograph is comprised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470412912470524">Figures 13</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1470412912470524"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1470412912470524"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1470412912470524"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1470412912470524">17</xref>, p. 27).</p>
<p>Perhaps it is worth noting that the number of <italic>shooting sentences</italic> is, in the last instance, contingent on the amount of film available during any given <italic>mission</italic>. The same might also be true of <italic>shooting paragraphs</italic>, although not necessarily <italic>shooting words</italic>. Also, given that Smith is routinely compelled to mix flash with daylight, the number of <italic>shooting sentences</italic> that she is able to produce during any one <italic>mission</italic> is, likewise, contingent on the available power in each of the two battery packs that she takes with her on a <italic>mission</italic>. Although Smith has been told that each of her battery packs is good for two rolls of film, experience tells her that this is not necessarily the case. In fact she has actually shot up to five – perhaps even six – rolls of film using a single battery pack. There undoubtedly exists a formula for working out exactly how many rolls of film can be used per battery pack (something that would take into account such things as the relationship between focal length and shutter speed, etc.), but she has no idea what this is.</p>

<p>Outside the ethnographic museum at Shimla Hills a young man in a raggedy yellow jumper approaches me.</p>
<p> Rohal: ‘Is anyone speaking in English with you since you are being in Bhopal?’</p>
<p> Smith: ‘No, not many.’</p>
<p>He says he’s an English teacher but that doesn’t matter much because he’s ‘honoured’ to meet me.</p>
<p> Rohal: ‘I wanted to meet you for a very long time.’</p>
<p>We shake hands and I smile and am as charming as I can be, which is quite charming actually. Then he says that he’ll only be in a photograph if he can be in a photograph with me. He says that he doesn’t want me to take a photograph of him by himself. He says that maybe the auto-rickshaw driver could take a picture of me and him together?</p>
<p> Smith: ‘What about your girlfriend? Couldn’t she take it?’</p>
<p>Nisha’s spotty and has tattoos on her hands and wrists. She’s pretty and her sari is threadbare. But she holds the camera like it was a cement mixer.</p>
<p> Smith: ‘Step closer.’</p>
<p>Rohal gives me his hand. I think about putting my arm around his shoulders but we hold hands instead. Afterwards Rohal asks me what I’m going to do next. Have I been to the museum? Would I like to have tea with him at a restaurant? He doesn’t mention Nisha.</p>
<p> Smith: ‘I’ve got to get back. Things to do.’</p>
<p>I don’t want to talk to Rohal anymore, but if Nisha wanted to go then I would.</p>
<p>When I get back I’m surprised to find that the remains of the blue tea cup are still on the floor, by the bin, at the foot of my bed in room 72 at the Arch Manor Hotel, and that I’m still furious with him. The way that he picked up the dismembered jug, which had once been firmly attached to a flimsy black plastic arm, that suddenly came off in my hand, causing me to drop the cup as I skipped to avoid the jug that was falling in the direction of my foot. The way that he tried to re-attach the handle of the jug just by pushing it back on …</p>
<p> Ashok (telephone): ‘You come now?’</p>
<p>Although I say I’ll be down in five minutes I know it’ll be more like ten. But if I say that then I’m afraid he’ll go home and I’d like him to stay.</p>
<p>There are three men in the lobby: Ashok, Sanjay and someone I’ve never met before.</p>
<p> Anil: ‘I am Anil. I speak bad English but I am just like you.’</p>
<p>Incredibly, Anil hugs me, but he’s so much shorter than I am and his bald head compresses itself against my chest which is broad because I swim. Anil’s wearing a pink and orange striped linen shirt. He’s immaculate, pressed, refreshed, brown and well. And I am very happy to be driven away from here on the back of Ashok’s motorbike, through the streets of MP Nagar, past the dull dogs and empty metal billboard, then around DB City shopping mall which is built on an island in the middle of a road and which is impossible to reach either on foot or by car, bike or auto-rickshaw, but which is still teaming with scrubbed up people, each one holding an ice cream – I exaggerate – and parading cheerfully – I don’t see their faces – under a giant banner that says: ‘Here is the beginning of the rest of your life’. We drive by booming elephant shrines; in and out the smell of gasoline and shit; <italic>that</italic> smell, the image of which sticks to me and is worse than, although nowhere near as bad as the smell of the factory which clings to the back of my throat and burns my upper lip but which – I’m told – eventually washes off.</p>

<title>Routes and Objects (2): Sonali Regency Hotel – Hamidia Road <italic>via</italic> Radha Talkies Road</title>
<p>There are certain things that Smith typically does before embarking on a <italic>mission</italic>. This morning she did them after breakfast, in her room, at the Sonali Regency Hotel on Radha Talkies Road.</p>
<p>This is what she did:</p>
<list id="list2-1470412912470524" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) Cleaned lens with lens cloth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) Loaded film into camera backs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(c) Checked battery levels in light meter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(d) Transferred box – or boxes - of film from camera bag to rucksack. (Smith does use a ‘proper’ camera bag, purchased from a professional camera store, to carry her equipment between continents, but never uses it on a specific <italic>mission</italic>. When on a <italic>mission</italic> the camera bag always remains in Smith’s hotel room.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(e) Packed notebook and pen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(f) Put lens cloth in right hand trouser pocket.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(g) Put on brown Carhartt baseball cap.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>On its erection, the metal pop-up canopy makes a clacking sound which, despite making Smith a little nervous, invariably provides her with an imperceptibly slight sexual thrill. In the middle of the canopy – at the base of which is a square, ground glass viewing screen – there is an oval shaped pop-out, split-screen magnifier, designed to enable the photographer (Smith) to focus on a discrete and significantly enlarged section of the image. When the horizontal line that bisects the split-screen is no longer split, then the object across which the line runs should, depending on the reliability of the camera’s and Smith’s optical technologies, be in focus. On this occasion – during the production of this <italic>shooting sentence</italic> – Smith is not focusing on any object in particular: a dog, car, flower, person, etc. If she could, Smith <italic>would</italic> focus on one of hundreds of thousands of grains of dust that are in the immediate vicinity of the camera’s lens; but unfortunately, although this may be theoretically possible, Smith lacks the patience and ingenuity to do so. So Smith throws her baseball cap on the ground, half a meter in front of the lens, and focuses on that instead. When she is satisfied that the cap is in focus, Smith retrieves it and puts it back on her head. Finally, Smith re-examines the scene through the lens before eventually producing a <italic>shooting</italic> <italic>sentence</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1470412912470524">Figure 18</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>It is worth noting that each time this procedure occurs; that is, each time Smith puts the cap back on her head and then attempts to look through the viewfinder at the scene in question, the cap’s peak invariably collides with the camera, thus briefly preventing Smith from enjoying the uninterrupted view that she desires. Suffice to say that this spectacle – the performative and ritualistic aspects of this particular <italic>shooting chapter, paragraph</italic> and <italic>sentence</italic> – presents the typical passerby, of whom there are many on Hamidia Road – with an extremely curious and amusing picture, the impact of which, to repeat, Smith is, for the time being, entirely unaware of.</p>
<p>Having spent ten days walking the streets of Bhopal with Smith, I must say that here, in this city, the pursuit of amateur photography does not appear to be hugely popular. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that, if amateur photography is a popular pursuit amongst the many Bhopalis who make frequent use of the street – as a site of employment and/or leisure and/or travel and/or accommodation – then it is not something that is pursued in public. In fact, I cannot recall one occasion when I have seen anyone in Bhopal using any kind of camera, including one found in a mobile phone; something that would of course be very common in most Western cities.</p>
<p>That said, it may be the case, as I have hinted, that amateur photographic activities are pursued, behind closed doors. Regrettably, this is not something that I am in a position to verify, although the form that these activities might take is something that Smith and I have discussed.</p>
<p>I can, however, confirm the existence of a relatively small but thriving professional photographic portrait industry in Bhopal. On Hamidia Road, for example, Smith and I are pleased to report the presence of two commercial studios. Outside of each are posted examples of the types of images one might expect to be able to purchase – of oneself and/or one’s family – should one ever decide to enter either studio. It’s worth noting – and it should come as no surprise to learn – that out of 27 pictures, including beaming children with building bricks, ersatz Bollywood teen queens in red, yellow or blue leather twin sets and men in silk shirts on motorbikes, all but two of those on display would appear to have been taken indoors. That is, in a photographic studio, presumably one located at the back of each of the premises in question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470412912470524">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bearing these things in mind – the relative absence of a visible amateur photographic culture in Bhopal and the hegemony of the high street photographic aesthetic, one might argue that street photography in Bhopal – unlike London or New York – should most definitely be regarded as a most unusual activity. In addition, the performance of a street photography in Bhopal involving a medium format camera, a relatively large flash gun (the use value of which would probably not at first be immediately obvious to most people on Hamidia Road), a light meter and a brown baseball cap would, I suppose, in this context at least, constitute an extremely unusual – even unclassifiable – event.</p>

The shutter’s primed and the flash is ready to go. But he doesn’t know which bit to look through or what to press. So I slide my hand down his right wrist and say: ‘Press this’. Then I show him how to focus by turning the lens barrel to the left and then to the right and all the time I’m saying things about what this means. And I’m touching him and I think, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t’, so I let go, walk away, then turn around but, before I can speak, the flash goes off. Then three kids ask me to photograph them posing like gangsters. They don’t use the word ‘gangsters’. Or maybe they do, in Urdu or Hindi. I wouldn’t know; I don’t speak Urdu or Hindi.

<title>Routes and Objects (5): Oxford Street – 929 Ocean Road <italic>via</italic> Memory Motel</title>
<p>Smith spends three hours on – or in the immediate vicinity – of Ocean Road, Bridgehampton, during which time she meets three strangers. They are all wearing grey flannel track suits and appear to be in their mid to late sixties. Smith is wearing a pair of chinos, a mauve and grey stripy t-shirt that was purchased at Next in Oxford Street, London three weeks earlier, a pair of rubber-soled black Vans and a brown Carhartt baseball cap. The baseball cap is stained with anorexic fingers of sweat that are most prominent at the point where the peak meets the cap proper. Since Smith’s cap had neither been cleaned nor worn in London during the four days that she spent there en route to the USA, it is probable that all identifiable sweat stains were produced between September and October 2010 at locations in Bhopal, India and New York State, USA.</p>
<p>Most of the vehicular traffic on Ocean Road is commercial. Judging by the legends impressed upon the sides of lorries and trucks, much of it belongs to the local service industries: Alagran Waste Collection, Overhorst Landscaping, Bunny Wood Caterers, etc.</p>
<p>62% of all drivers of commercial vehicles are non-white. 0% of all drivers of commercial vehicles are black. 62% of all drivers of commercial vehicles on Ocean Road between the hours of 11 am –2 pm on 3 October 2010 are Hispanic.</p>
<p>While photographing one of the fairways at the Bridgehampton Club’s exquisitely located nine-hole golf course, Smith ponders the domestic arrangements of Bridgehampton’s many service workers.

Also, see Suketu Mehta’s ‘Bhopal lives: The night of the gas’ in the same publication. Although the disaster has motivated various responses in the fields of, for example, anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470412912470524">Mooney, 2002</xref>), law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470412912470524">Fortun, 2001</xref>) and medical and environmental science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470412912470524">Ranjan and Sarangi, 2003</xref>), the infrequency of references to the ongoing disaster in popular western culture is remarkable, particularly given Hollywood’s apparent predilection for genocide, political corruption and environmental disaster (see any number of Holocaust movies including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470412912470524"><italic>Sophie’s Choice</italic> (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470412912470524"><italic>Schindler’s List</italic> (1993)</xref>, etc. as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470412912470524"><italic>Hotel Rwanda</italic> (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470412912470524"><italic>The Killing Fields</italic> (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912470524"><italic>Erin Brockovich</italic> (2000)</xref>.

<p>As a result of the passing of the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act in March 1985, the Indian Supreme Court made a judicial order on 15 February 1989, instructing the Indian government and Union Carbide to agree on compensation amounting to $470m for the victims of the gas disaster; approximately $500 for each gas-affected person. As part of the settlement, Union Carbide and its subsidiaries were to be granted immunity against any criminal or civil liability (past, present and future) arising from the Bhopal disaster. The immunity clause was subsequently revoked by the Indian Supreme Court in 1991 (p. 53). In February 2001 Union Carbide was merged with the Dow Chemical Company and in 2002 Dow Chemical’s Chief Public Relations Officer, Kathy Hunt (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912470524">Banerjee, 2010</xref>: 7) announced that ‘five hundred dollars was plenty good for an Indian’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912470524">Das (2005</xref>: 53) writes:
<disp-quote><p>With (the Bhopal Act), the government of India, in accordance with its parens patriae function, took upon itself the responsibility of the conduct of the case and the welfare of the victims … In normal circumstances, parens patriae refers to the inherent power and authority of a legislature to provide protection to the person and property of persons non sui juris, such as minors, insane and incompetent persons.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to Das:
<disp-quote><p>The victims of the Bhopal disaster had been assimilated to the category of <italic>non sui juris</italic>, even when in the normal course of events they would not be considered judicially incompetent, because it was evident that they did not have the resources to pursue the case themselves. However, the Act was challenged on the grounds that by its enactment, the government had constituted itself as surrogate of the victims and taken away their right to be heard. (p. 56)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is ironic, writes Das, that ‘the people declared incompetent and irresponsible were neither the multinational nor the government, but … the sufferers themselves’ (p. 56).</p>
