<p>In his book <italic>Confronting Homelessness</italic>, David Wagner tackles the issue of today’s “new” homelessness by highlighting homelessness history in the United States and exploring the population’s perceptions of homeless individuals. Most important, he examines the social constructionist theory, which argues that an issue is only as pressing as society perceives it to be. In Chapters One and Two, Wagner delves into the rise and fall of the awareness of homelessness as a critical issue in society. Unfortunately, homelessness has been on the back burner for a while now. In fact, the presidential election of 1988 was the last campaign when the candidates mentioned homelessness as an important issue.</p>
<p>Wagner gives us a short history of homelessness in the United States dating back to the post-Civil War era in Chapter Three, and then dedicates the next four chapters to the most recent homelessness problem starting in 1979 to the present. Chapter Four covers the beginning of the new homelessness era (1979–1982), when the homeless population expanded beyond the stereotypical single male. Women and families were being added into this mix and this was a cause for public concern. Reagan’s Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was passed, resulting in deep cuts to social services taxes. Meanwhile, homelessness advocates were fighting for more shelters and services for the homeless. Chapter Five (1983–1988) explains the social constructionist theory further by describing several different “frames” or perspectives—both positive and negative—through which homelessness can be viewed. Wagner also mentions “Hands Across America,” a national charitable campaign that started in 1984, and the passing of the Stewart B. McKinney Homelessness Assistance Act in 1987, which provided aid to the homeless. But these were only minor victories for homelessness advocates.</p>
<p>In Chapter Six, Wagner describes the beginning of the criminalization of the homeless and the idea of compassion fatigue from 1989 to 1993. In an attempt to rid the community of the homeless population, cities started to enact laws against the homeless, prohibiting them from sleeping in the park, sitting with their belongings in public, and many others. Chapter Seven depicts the homelessness problem from 1994 to the present. Wagner illustrates the debate of acceptance versus social change. In the past 20 years, coverage of homelessness in the media and the news has been low on the radar and social movements are rare, leaving us to question if the United States is choosing to ignore the problem rather than to fix it.</p>
<p><italic>Confronting Homelessness</italic> not only does a thorough job of outlining the history of homelessness in the United States, but also brings attention to the minimal progress the United States has made in addressing this issue, and raises essential questions about where we go from here. This book would be a great addition to an undergraduate or graduate class dealing with issues of homelessness.</p>
