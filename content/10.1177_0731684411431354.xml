<abstract>
<p>In the present work, the mechanical performance of novel sandwich composite panels based on 3D-knitted spacer fabrics has been investigated. Composite panels were produced using three different types of spacer fabrics having different structural parameters. The sandwich panels were fabricated based on an unsaturated polyester resin using a modified vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process which allowed the formation of low-density core structures. The produced sandwich composite panels were characterized for flexural, compressive, and impact properties. The effect of different fabric structural parameters (such as cross-thread density, linear density of yarn used in face and core, and structure of face) on the processability and mechanical behavior of composite panels has been thoroughly investigated. The results showed that the composite panels based on spacer fabrics having lesser cross-thread density and made of coarser yarns performed better with respect to compressive and impact properties, whereas the best flexural properties were obtained in case of spacer fabrics with high cross-thread density and made of finer yarns.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684411431354" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sandwich structures are being used increasingly in applications where lightweight, durable, and cost-effective structures are desired. A sandwich structure consists of three main parts: two faces separated by a core. The faces are usually made from metal or fibrous composites, while the core is often made from cellular polymers, balsa wood, or honeycomb materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411431354">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684411431354">2</xref></sup> Sandwich composites are commonly used for marine, aerospace, an other structural applications due to their low weight, high specific strength, and bending stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684411431354">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Textile structures are commonly used for the reinforcement of composite materials. The growing high-tech applications are demanding complex-shaped textile structures to meet the requirements of such domains. Spacer fabrics are one of the complex-shaped 3D constructions composed of two separate fabric layers connected vertically using piles yarns, cross-threads, or fabric layers. Composites made from spacer fabrics offer the great potential to be used in lightweight applications replacing conventional structures due to their high tensile, flexural, impact, and crash-resistance properties.<sup>4-8</sup> However, conventional spacer fabrics connected with pile yarns, produced by weaving and knitting technologies, are elastic in nature and they allow only a limited distance between the surface layers. These spacer fabrics do not meet the 3D structural requirements for high-performance applications. These problems can be overcome in spacer fabrics with cross-threads or fabric layers produced by modern flat knitting technology, which also leads to waste reduction and faster production rate. Moreover, knitted fabric composites exhibit greater drapability and impact resistance as compared to other textile-based composites. Another advantage of 3D knitted spacer fabric is that the mechanical performance can be significantly improved using multilayer reinforcement inlays in to the fabric structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684411431354">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684411431354">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) has grown significantly in popularity over the past decades in part due to advantages of significantly reduced environmental footprint and lower manufacturing cost. Considerable research has been conducted till date on the single skin composites manufactured by VARTM technique. However, only a few efforts have been directed toward manufacturing of sandwich composite structures using VARTM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684411431354">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, a few researchers have investigated the mechanical performance of sandwich composites based on 3D weft-knitted textile structures. In some of these studies, mechanical behavior (under compressive and impact loading) of 3D biaxial weft-knitted spacer fabric composites has been investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684411431354">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684411431354">18</xref></sup> The researchers have developed a unit-cell model and performed Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations of the impact responses of these novel composites. Thermoplastic composites based on flat-knitted 3D multilayer spacer fabrics have been investigated recently by Md. Abounaim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684411431354">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684411431354">12</xref></sup> These 3D-knitted preforms were developed using glass/polypropylene hybrid yarns. It was observed in their study that the mechanical performance of these composites was greatly influenced by the different arrangement of reinforcement yarns and the integration of reinforcement yarns as biaxial inlays was found to be the most cost-effective method.</p>
<p>The present work reports the mechanical behavior of a new type of sandwich composite panel manufactured based on 3D warp-knitted spacer fabrics using a modified VARTM process. The influence of various structural parameters of spacer fabrics such as yarn linear density, density of cross-threads, and structure of face on the processing and mechanical properties (flexural, compressive and impact) of sandwich composite panels has been thoroughly investigated and discussed.</p></sec>

<p>Three types of 3D-knitted spacer fabrics used in this work were purchased from E. cima (Spain). These fabrics have different thickness (8, 15, and 22 mm) and construction parameters. The basic structure of these spacer fabrics is, however, similar and has been illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684411431354">Figure 1</xref>. The spacer fabric consists of three main parts: two faces separated by a core. The core is made of cross-threads that connect the two faces together. The structural parameters of these fabrics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684411431354">Table 1</xref> and the properties of polyester yarns are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684411431354">Table 2</xref>. The thickness of face in all three fabrics is same. Sandwich composite panels were produced by impregnating these spacer fabrics with an unsaturated polyester resin (Poliplast R96.02 D). The important properties of this resin are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684411431354">Table 3</xref>.

<p>A modified VARTM technique (developed by authors and applied for patent) was used in this study in order to impregnate only the faces and cross-threads of the spacer fabrics without filling the free spaces in the core. The main idea of using this technique is to obtain a considerably lightweight core in order to reduce the overall weight of the sandwich panels. The resin was infused through the core of the spacer fabrics in the warp direction. The vacuum used for the purpose of resin infusion was 80 kPa. The temperature was maintained at 30°C during resin infusion which was carried out for 6, 8, and 13 min for composite panel 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in order to maintain the weight ratio of resin and fiber at similar level. The pictures of sandwich composites are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684411431354">Figure 2</xref> and their core structures have been presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684411431354">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen (more clearly from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684411431354">Figure 3(c)</xref>) that only cross-threads are impregnated with resin, leading to lots of free spaces within the core structure. The polyester resin used in the current study was curable at room temperature. Hence, curing was done for 24 h at room temperature. The three types of sandwich composite panels produced have been listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684411431354">Table 4</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-0731684411431354"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>The 3D spacer fabrics were characterized for air permeability according to ISO 9237:1995 standard using TEXTEST FX 3300 Air Permeability Tester III. All samples were kept under a standard atmosphere (22 ± 2°C, RH 70 ± 2%) for 24 h before testing. The air permeability measurement of spacer fabrics was performed in order to study their resin impregnation behavior during composite fabrication using VARTM.</p>
<p>The void content in the sandwich composites were calculated from the density measurements. The sandwich composite panels were tested for flatwise compression and flexural properties in a HOUNSFIELD H10KS universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min. In the compression test, the specimens were cylindrical shaped with 25.4 mm diameter (ASTM C 365 – 03). The sample dimensions for flexural test were according to ASTM C 393-00 standard. For the determination of flexural properties, the composite panels were tested in two different directions: (1) in the direction of infusion (LD) and (2) in the perpendicular direction of infusion (WD). Load-deflection curves were taken for the calculation of facing bending stress (σ) and core shear stress (τ) using the following equations:

<p>Impact properties of the sandwich panels were evaluated using an Instrumented Drop Weight Impact Tester (Ceast DAS 16000) according to ISO 6603 and ISO 7765 test standards. An impactor having diameter of 20 mm with a hemispherical tip was used to hit against the face of specimens (100 mm × 100 mm). Three different dropping speeds (3.13, 3.38, and 4.43 m/s) were used by adjusting the impactor position to 500, 750, and 1000 mm heights from the samples.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec7-0731684411431354"><title>Air permeability of spacer fabrics</title>
<p>The air permeability of the spacer fabrics is an indirect measurement of their resin impregnation behavior during composite fabrication. This is due to the fact that a fabric that is permeable to air is expected to allow better resin infusion through its structure and the opposite is the case with a fabric having less air permeability. There are several factors that can influence the air permeability of fabric such as fabric structure, thickness, surface characteristics, and so on.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684411431354">Figure 4</xref> presents the air resistance values of three types of spacer fabrics. It can be seen that fabric type 1 presents an air resistance of 6166 L/s/m<sup>2</sup>, which is much higher than the other fabric types (types 2 and 3). As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684411431354">Table 1</xref>, type 1 fabric was constructed using finer yarns having lesser linear density (15 and 22 tex for face and cross-threads, respectively). Due to the higher surface area of finer yarns, they presented more resistance to the air flow. Moreover, the density of cross-threads is also higher (107 threads/cm<sup>2</sup>) in this fabric structure and as a result this fabric type led to more hindrance to the passage of air through its structure. Fabric type 2 shows the lowest air resistance among the three fabric types probably because of its considerably porous face structure as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684411431354">Figure 5</xref>. Therefore, it can be concluded that the fabric type 1 is expected to present greater difficulty in resin infusion during composite fabrication as compared to other two types of fabric.

<sec id="sec8-0731684411431354"><title>Structure of face and core of sandwich composite panels</title>
<p>It is interesting to note from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684411431354">Table 4</xref> that although the composite panels were prepared under the same conditions of VARTM, they have different face thickness. The face thickness of composite panel 3 (3.17 mm) is significantly higher than the other two panels. It may be because of better resin infusion though the structure of fabric type 3 as well as more retention of resin by the coarser yarns used in the face. On the contrary, since the resin infusion is quite difficult through the structure of fabric type 1 and moreover due to a considerably compact face made of finer yarns, composite panel 1 has the lowest face thickness. As a result, a relatively thinner face with high fiber volume fraction was obtained in case of composite panel 1, whereas the face of composite panel 3 was much thicker with less fiber volume fraction. Moreover, since composite panel 1 presents a high resistance to the resin flow through its core, it is obvious that as compared to the other two composite panels, the core of this sandwich composite retains more resin which will fill up the open spaces within the core structure. As a result, composite panel 1 produces a denser core than the other two types, which can be clearly observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684411431354">Figure 3</xref>. It can also be observed from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684411431354">Table 4</xref> that all the three types of sandwich composites contain lots of air spaces (voids) in their structure.</p></sec>

The pictures of sandwich composites after failure in three-point bending test are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684411431354">Figure 9</xref>. It can be clearly observed that the cross-threads are not broken and the failure is mainly due to breakage of faces, which has been indicated by arrows in the figure. Therefore, the flexural properties are primarily dependant on the faces of these sandwich composites.

<p>If the performance of three panels under bending loads is compared, it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684411431354">Figure 7</xref> that composite panel 1, shows the highest facing bending stress among the three composite panels. It was mentioned earlier that composite panel 1 has faces with compact structures and high fiber volume fraction. This resulted in a stronger face and highest facing bending stress. On the contrary, composite panel 2 produced the weakest face because of its porous face structure, leading to considerably low fiber volume fraction. Therefore, the lowest facing bending stress was obtained in case of composite panel 2.</p>
<p>Similar to facing bending stress, the highest core shear stress was obtained with composite panel 1. This may be attributed to the higher density of cross-threads, which can withstand higher shear stresses. Moreover, the amount of resin inside core was also relatively higher in case of composite panel 1, resulting in higher core shear strength.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684411431354"><title>Compressive properties of sandwich composite panels</title>
<p>The force-extension curves of composite panels under compression are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684411431354">Figure 10</xref>. The sandwich composites failed under compressive loading mainly due to the breakage of core, that is, resin-impregnated cross-threads, which can be clearly observed from the structure of core after compression test as provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684411431354">Figure 11</xref>. The broken cross-threads are indicated by arrows. Therefore, the flatwise compressive properties of sandwich panels mainly depend on the resistance of cross-threads toward buckling which can be expressed by the Euler formula about critical load (<italic>F</italic>) considering the cross-threads as slender compressive rods having length of <italic>L</italic>, Young’s modulus <italic>E</italic>, and area moment of inertia <italic>I</italic>:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0731684411431354"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411431354-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
<fig id="fig10-0731684411431354" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Force-extension curves of sandwich composite panels under compressive loading.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411431354-fig10.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig11-0731684411431354" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Picture of core of sandwich panel 2 after flatwise compression test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411431354-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><italic>K</italic> is a coefficient depending on the cross-thread’s constraint conditions.</p>
<p>Considering the circular cross section of the cross-threads with diameter <italic>d</italic>, the area moment of inertia <italic>I</italic> can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0731684411431354"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411431354-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Hence, the critical load <italic>F</italic> can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0731684411431354"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411431354-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>From the above equation, it is clear that the resistance to buckling of the cross-threads depends on the fourth power of their diameters and second power of their lengths. As a result, the coarser cross-threads used in case of composite panel 3 have higher load carrying capability than much finer cross-threads of composite panel 1 in spite of their longer lengths. This results in the best compressive properties in case of composite panel 3. The values of compressive modulus (<italic>E</italic>), strength (σ<sub>max</sub>), and energy (<italic>U</italic>) calculated from the area under stress–strain curve are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0731684411431354">Table 5</xref>.

<sec id="sec12-0731684411431354"><title>Impact properties of sandwich composite panels</title>
<p>The load-displacement curves for the three kinds of composite samples tested with three different impact speeds (v<sub>1</sub>: 3.13 m/s, v<sub>2</sub>: 3.38 m/s, and v<sub>3</sub>: 4.43 m/s) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684411431354">Figure 12(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684411431354">c</xref>). It can be observed that the composite panel 3 showed the best impact performance among the sandwich panels at all impact speeds.
<fig id="fig12-0731684411431354" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Load-displacement curves of composite panels at different impact speeds: (a) v1: 3.13 m/s, (b) v2:3.38 m/s, and (c) v3: 4.43 m/s.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411431354-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684411431354">Figure 13</xref> compares the various impact properties of sandwich panels such as peak force, peak energy, break force, and break energy. It is clear that composite panel 3 shows higher peak and break forces as well as energy than the other composite panels. The damage area of the samples on the impacting side is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684411431354">Figure 14</xref>. It can be seen that the stress fields are more spread in composite panel 3 leading to much larger damage area, whereas the damage is more concentrated in panel 1, in which the impactor was perforated through the sample. In contrast to that, the impactor penetrated through the front face of panel 3 and the back face was only slightly damaged. The better impact properties of composite panel 3 were due to much thicker face which absorbed more energy during impact. The impact energy absorption is lower in case of composite panel 1 due to much thinner and stiffer face leading to poor impact properties.

<p>In the present work, new types of sandwich composite panels with considerably light core were successfully manufactured based on 3D warp knitted spacer fabrics and polyester resin using a modified VARTM process. The following conclusions were established through this work:
<list id="list1-0731684411431354" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Structural parameters of spacer fabric have strong influence on the processability and mechanical performance of sandwich composite panels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Spacer fabrics having higher cross-thread density and constructed of finer yarns are difficult to impregnate with resin during composite fabrication using VARTM technique.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sandwich composite panels showed highest facing bending stress and core shear stiffness when constructed with spacer fabrics having higher cross-thread density and finer yarns.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compressive properties of sandwich panels were mainly influenced by the type of cross-threads used in the spacer fabrics. Coarser cross-threads used in the core results in better compressive properties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thicker and less stiff face obtained in case of spacer fabrics having coarser yarns and less cross-thread density was found better with respect to impact properties due to better energy absorption capability.</p></list-item>
</list>Therefore, the mechanical properties of this new type of sandwich composites can be easily tailored depending on the applications by altering various structural parameters of 3D-knitted spacer fabrics.</p></sec>
