<body>
<p>Professor Manikutty’s book <italic>Being Ethical</italic> is another gem in the priceless collection of business books from IIM Ahmedabad published by Random House. Written in a de-jargonized and lucid fashion, it makes for easy reading. Yet the book would be an important addition for academics and professionals alike. Annotating with numerous small caselets from the world of Indian business, and highlighting numerous situations that are likely to be encountered in business, the author presents the concepts of business ethics with appropriate frameworks such that the book could serve as a handbook, but avoids the trap of appearing prescriptive.</p>
<p>The book highlights the importance of being ethical in business, and the practical advantages arising therefrom. Drawing on Jack Welch’s leadership model, managers are classified into four distinct categories according to their levels of competence as also their ethical orientation. The role of management in building an ethical culture is analyzed in detail, as also issues of personal versus organizational ethics. Some ethical dilemmas are discussed and ethical frameworks that might help the manager negotiate and reason through them suggested.</p>
<p>Next, the book discusses how to resolve issues where interests of different stakeholders are not identical, which is often the case. Ethical issues in marketing are analyzed, including issues of product quality, pricing, advertising and after-sales. Also up for analysis are ethical issues in employee-handling, whistle-blowing, outsourcing, facing up to competition and international business. Issues of pollution and sustainability are highlighted, and land acquisition which is a major threat to industrial development in India is discussed, with the Singur agitation as a case in point.</p>
<p>How to create an ethical culture and climate in the company is discussed in detail and so is the role of leadership in institutionalizing ethics in business organizations. The Values Development Cycle is developed as a model and the process of making a modern ethical manager is studied step by step. The importance of including ethics in a management school curriculum is strongly put forth.</p>
<p>Each chapter is carefully delineated, references are detailed, conclusions painstakingly drawn up and key takeaways clearly mentioned. It is an important addition to ethics literature and offers a practical issue-based understanding of ethical issues that increasingly confront managers in India and elsewhere.</p>
