<p>Botanical gardens have not been short of attention from historians and geographers in recent years, but Nuala Johnson’s claim is that despite this ‘much work has still to be done’ (p. 6). Her specific contribution is to examine closely three contrasting sites, the Cambridge University Botanical Garden, the Glasnevin Botanic Gardens in Dublin, and the Royal Botanical Gardens in Belfast, with a focus mainly on the 19th century. She constructs well-defined and often stimulating accounts of the development, management and consumption of these sites, reflecting a nuanced geographical imagination employed at a variety of levels.</p>
<p>As the book’s title indicates, the key theme is the way in which these botanic gardens exemplified both the search for, and the tensions between, ways of ordering understandings of nature alongside ways of seeing nature aesthetically. These tensions were expressed in the internal construction of garden spaces and, at another level, are shown very clearly to reflect the different institutional settings and contrasting locational and cultural contexts of each garden. At a third level, there are the networks of connections between these gardens and others, and other institutions. Here the links with earlier work on botanic gardens – as centres of calculation, as points within networks for exchange of knowledge about economic botany, and potentially as sites where (to follow an emerging theme in imperial and cultural histories, and historical geography) core-periphery relationships were challenged – are acknowledged, but not really developed.</p>
<p>The differences between the three gardens are instructive and more than demonstrate a key theme of the book that they ‘domesticated the universalizing vocabulary of scientific order in particular ways’ (p. 12). The Cambridge garden has a long history, having been established on its first site in 1762 for purposes of supporting teaching about botany. Initiatives in Dublin had even earlier links with Trinity College, but the Glasnevin site was not acquired until 1795 with the support of the Irish Parliament. Here there was a strong element of encouraging not only botanical expertise but also agricultural improvement. The third garden, in contrast, was set up by the Belfast Botanical and Horticultural Society in the late 1820s, to promote the study and enjoyment of natural history among its members. The author’s approach places her analysis firmly within the emerging literature on geographies of scientific knowledge and her argument that the inauguration of these three gardens ‘illustrates a communality of vision that transcends the provincial on the one hand, while also demonstrating the localizing effect of the cultural and intellectual milieux on the other’ (p. 36) is well made.</p>
<p>The four chapters that follow discuss, respectively: order and display at each site; ‘cultivating the exotic’ with the construction of hothouses for plants of tropical origin; exchanges of knowledge, which focuses largely on Cambridge and Glasnevin, Belfast lacking much in the way of networking; and use of the gardens for popular education and entertainment. This last chapter details the debates around creating access for a wider public, a long-standing issue in Belfast until the gardens were taken over by the city corporation in 1895. Each of these chapters is well documented. Nonetheless, there is often a suspicion that maybe too much emphasis is being placed on intentionality. Were these botanic gardens really such powerful sites of agency as is implied? Elsewhere, the author has written that ‘Geographers are only beginning to grapple with the ways in which these gardens acted as hubs of popular scientific education as they developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512448725">Johnson, 2011</xref>: 104). On the basis of the evidence presented here, that seems a fair assessment.</p>
<p>We learn, for instance, that the Cambridge botanic garden was used to provide specimens for lectures given by the Professor of Botany, but it is not entirely clear how else the space was used to perform the acquisition of knowledge. The text places some emphasis on the role of Glasnevin in agricultural improvement, but in what ways were the plots of grasses and other crops used and who, and how many people, benefited from any instruction? It is noted that the ‘desire to nurture commercial botany was experienced more intensely in Dublin than the other two gardens’ (p. 151). The point is made by reference to experiments with silk production (a not uncommon activity in botanical gardens elsewhere, although this is not acknowledged), and on some work done on potato blight in the 1840s which it is said ‘underscores the importance of the agricultural dimension of the gardens as first laid out in the initial charter’ (p. 160). Perhaps more disappointing is the limited discussion of the contribution of these gardens to flows of biotic materials. Did they grow large quantities of trees for use by landholders in their regions, as did New Zealand botanic gardens? Did they act as conduits for dispersal of particular plants, like, for example, Mueller’s Melbourne botanic garden with the global distribution of eucalyptus species?</p>
<p>The book is well written and illustrated, and the author deftly uses theoretical insights to frame much of her argument. But questions like the ones raised above could position these three gardens, potentially both analytically and empirically, in the wider webs of 19th-century botanical gardens. In turn, that would inevitably generate more questions. If glasshouses were so important for displays of tropicality in the British Isles of the time, how were such structures adapted in tropical botanical gardens (as they were at Bangalore, for instance)? Why are the Scots so important in the story of these three gardens? Did the gardens maintain herbaria? This book contributes a great deal. It will also enable further geographies of botanical gardens to be explored.</p>
