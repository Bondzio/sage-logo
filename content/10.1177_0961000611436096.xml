<abstract>
<p>The study is an evaluation of an employability training programme provided by Inverclyde Libraries in West Central Scotland and the role of information literacy within the training programme. Inverclyde is an area with high unemployment and pockets of multiple deprivation. Modern, applicable skills are also lacking. The findings are based on interviews with five learners and also one with an adult literacies tutor. The interviews were conducted in August 2009 and a Learning Life Histories methodology was used. Interviewees had mainly previously worked in the service industries and none had post-school qualifications, despite which all the interviewees were highly motivated. Information literacy was found to between 30% and 60% of course content depending on learner needs. Family influence was found to be the main motivation to enrol on the course and the learners sought personal social development as well as employability skills. There was found to be a lack of appropriate, relevant training materials and a lack of collaboration between the LIS sector and Community Learning and Development in developing them. The article concludes with a number of recommendations including the need to improve recruitment and course scheduling and planning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This study of information literacy within an employability training course run by a public library service in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation was inspired by previous work and developments flowing from it. In late 2007 to early 2008 the Scottish Information Literacy Project undertook an interview-based study of the role of information in decision making in the work situation. The interviews included people from a wide range of levels including care assistants, many of whom had undertaken a wide range of work during their lives and their interviews, in particular, raised employability and training issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611436096">Crawford and Irving, 2009</xref>). Most of the interviewees considered the public library service to be irrelevant to their training and information needs and viewed it as a purely recreational service. As some public library services provide employability training skills courses including IT skills, this could be viewed as disturbing news. Although IT skills training often include ‘a bit on the Internet’, information literacy training did not seem to be viewed as a discrete and important component. In the course of the study and previous work we noticed that adult literacies tutors tend to adopt a similar approach. We therefore set about identifying public library services who might be interested in pursuing this issue with us and supporting information literacy training. Although initial contacts were made with three public library services (Dumfries and Galloway, City of Glasgow, Inverclyde) Inverclyde Libraries provided the most scope for a possible collaboration/research study and this led to a meeting in late 2008 with Sandra MacDougall, the Chief Librarian and Sean McNamara, the then recently appointed People’s Network librarian.</p>
<sec id="section2-0961000611436096">
<title>Inverclyde Libraries and its training programmes</title>
<p>Inverclyde Council has existed since 1996 and is co- terminous with the previously existing second tier (library) authority which had been created in 1975 and it has therefore been a more stable administrative environment than some other Scottish local authorities. It is the third smallest council in Scotland and although much of the population is urban, two-thirds of the land area is composed of agricultural land and contains pockets of considerable prosperity. Much of the population of about 80,000 is concentrated in one urban area containing three historic communities, Port Glasgow, Greenock (the largest) and Gourock. The urban area was historically a centre for heavy industry but now depends more on electronics and computing industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611436096">General Register Office for Scotland, 2009</xref>). The <italic>Inverclyde Workforce Plus Quarterly Performance Bulletin January 2008</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009c</xref>) notes that the total number of unemployed in Inverclyde in March 2007 was 3000: a rate of 8%. This was above the rate of 5% for Scotland. There is also a youth employment and skills agenda. Although this situation is improving, Inverclyde still has an above average proportion of 16–19 year olds not in employment, education or training (NEETs) (9.7%), when compared to Scotland as a whole (8.9%).</p>
<p>The areas of Inverclyde which are historically the most deprived are South West Greenock, Greenock East Central and Port Glasgow; these are also the areas where most of the training described below takes place. The report offers the following forecast:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The overall number of jobs in Inverclyde is expected to fall by 600 (-2%) by 2017, in contrast to growth of 4% in Scotland as a whole</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The only sectors forecast to grow are <italic>financial &amp; business services</italic> and <italic>health &amp; education</italic>, while the largest decline will be in <italic>manufacturing</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People will be required across all occupations to replace those that leave through retirement or occupational mobility. This means that, over the next 10 years, there will be more than 20,000 job opportunities to be filled in Inverclyde</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Large numbers of jobs will be created in <italic>administration, customer services</italic> and <italic>sales</italic>, occupations associated with services</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nine in ten of these replacement jobs will require at least basic qualifications; while a quarter will require degree level qualifications. This means that there will be fewer jobs available for those with no formal skills or training (those often at the edges of the labour market). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009c</xref>: 8)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The report also notes that there will be lots of job opportunities in the coming years for Inverclyde residents, both locally and across the wider Glasgow city region, but the majority will require at least basic level qualifications. Therefore, improvement in the skills and qualifications of those targeted by the Partnership (one of a number of Scottish Government led employability networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611436096">Employability in Scotland, 2010</xref>) will increase their chances of success in the labour market considerably. There is clearly an employability skills agenda here with a service industry emphasis and a youth up-skilling issue.</p>
<p>The library service which provides the training courses has seven libraries: three including the main (central) library in Greenock and one each in Port Glasgow and Gourock. The service is committed to supporting lifelong learning in the community both in the form of computing and other classes and learning takes place at six learning centres located in the libraries. Computer-based classes are run in partnership with James Watt College, the local college, the University of the West of Scotland, Community Learning or by the libraries themselves. Many of the classes are free or have a variety of funding options so most people learn at no cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0961000611436096">
<title>The course and its evaluation</title>
<p>At a meeting held in late 2008 it emerged that Inverclyde Libraries planned to run two identical employability training courses in late spring to early summer of 2009 which would be funded by the Fairer Scotland Fund, one of a range of course being made available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009b</xref>: 15–16). The courses would be aimed at people with poor employability and ICT skills. Basic computing skills would be taught and, after discussion, it was agreed to include an identifiable Internet skills component to help learners to meet their health, finance and employability needs. The course content was designed by the tutors and Community Learning and Development Team and is based round a relatively brief document which, after introducing the learners to the essentials of Windows and Microsoft Word and email, offers an introduction to the Internet which then leads onto health literacy and financial literacy with a list of useful websites. The courses duly took place, learners being recruited through advertisements in the local paper, outreach activities and an open day in January 2009. Some learners also heard about the course through Job Centre Plus. The courses lasted 10 weeks (two hours a week) and between eight and 12 people attended each course. The majority of attendees were women and ages of all participants ranged from early 20s to 80s. The courses were aimed at working age people (aged 20–65) but a number of older people joined the first course. Working age people were more specifically targeted in the second course by contacting organizations such as the Scottish Association for Mental Health, Job Centre Plus and community learning contacts in order to get referrals. Relevant people were also contacted who were on the library’s database and who were enrolled on future courses and asked if they would like to take the course. People were also turned down (or placed on a more suitable course) if they were not suitable (for example not actively seeking employment). This was not done with the initial courses but introduced subsequently.</p>
<p>The courses took place in the libraries in Port Glasgow, Greenock (main library), Greenock South West branch library (also known as Barr’s Cottage) and Gourock. An evaluation of the courses was subsequently carried out by the authors of this article, the findings of which will be used by the library to inform future courses. The findings have also been used as a basis for this article.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-0961000611436096">
<title>Learning life histories</title>
<p>The methodology adopted can be described as the ‘learning life histories’ approach. This approach is not in itself new as the methods can be found in other work although the exact terminology does not appear to be common. It aims to situate and understand people’s learning in their life experiences, including personal motivation and ambition, family life, work experience, the environment in which they live and their previous education. It takes the view that learning issues cannot be properly understood and addressed unless these factors are known. It is particularly appropriate to adult learners.</p>
<p>As an approach it is extremely old and can be traced back to the utilitarian educational theorists of the mid-19th century who sought to link vocational education with personal betterment, greatly enhanced job opportunity and considerable enhancement of social status. Narrative often took the form of short biographies, emphasizing the difficult personal circumstances of the subject, his limited learning opportunities and how he overcame them, an early articulation of lifelong learning, in fact. Particular advocates were Samuel Smiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611436096">Briggs, 1980</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611436096">George L Craik (1882)</xref> whose ‘success stories’ included Captain Cook and Thomas Telford. Their work emphasizes the need for objectivity and direct evidence of impact.</p>
<p>The Centre for Community Engagement at the University of Sussex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611436096">University of Sussex, Centre for Community Engagement, 2005</xref>) undertook a project which used life history approaches in working with adults to explore the ways in which different concepts of citizenship impact upon the social and economic lives of adults from a range of ‘disadvantaged’ groups in countries across Europe. The countries were Finland, Ireland and the UK. Each partner in the project focused on working with a particular social group who are disadvantaged for socio-economic reasons, who have special educational needs or who do not generally take part in lifelong learning activities, and sought to explore issues of national identity, inclusion and lifelong learning. More recently the approach is visible in the West of Scotland Wider Access Forum funded research into older adults’ learning in the West of Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611436096">University of Glasgow, 2008</xref>) which is a rigorous, interview-based study, in which each interviewee was interviewed three times. The first interview schedule contains questions on work experience and history, learning history and medical difficulties. Family and personal influences are also included.</p>
<p>Earlier in the decade the Centre for Research in Library and Information Management (CERLIM) at Manchester Metropolitan University undertook the Longitude 2 Project. The Project designed, developed and tested a toolkit of longitudinal survey methodologies which aimed to contribute to an understanding of user needs and behaviour, with a particular focus on public libraries and the People’s Network. The emphasis was on qualitative approaches which illuminated the quantitative data more readily available. The toolkit pinpointed the importance of developing a research and evaluation plan to demonstrate the impact made by public library services in order to develop their vital role in the provision of information and learning. The Project showed how such tools can be used to evaluate the impact of IT-based services in public libraries on individuals and groups over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611436096">Craven and Brophy, 2004</xref>). Qualitative data collected took the form of examples relating to specific headings identified for the Project which included: learning a new skill; helping to find work; and shopping and finance. An example of impact measurement might be:</p>
<list id="list2-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">

<list-item><p>evidence of <italic>impact</italic> of taking an ICT course: helping in a career search.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While this structured approach makes data analysis easier, it tends to be inflexible and we decided on a more flexible semi-structured interview approach based round a number of key questions which would give the interviewees plenty of scope to raise their own agendas, which is what happened. The questions were derived from information gathered from the previous information literacy in the workplace study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611436096">Crawford and Irving, 2009</xref>) and discussions with Inverclyde Libraries staff. The questions asked are presented in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0961000611436096">Appendix</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The interviews took place in late August 2009. Five learners and one tutor were interviewed and the interviews took 45 minutes each approximately. Inverclyde Libraries staff invited existing learners to participate in the study and five duly came forward. As indicated elsewhere the majority of the learners were female and this is reflected in interviewee gender. The issue of identifying interviewees for Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS) studies appears to be a complex one and women seem more likely to offer themselves for interview than men. A detailed study of the use of information by parents of young children in Leeds encountered considerable difficulty in recruiting male interviewees despite using a range of methods to contact suitable potential interviewees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611436096">Walker, 2009</xref>). There would appear to be a research issue to pursue here. The interview summaries follow.</p>
<sec id="section7-0961000611436096">
<title>Interviewee One</title>
<p>Was in her early 50s and had a wide range of working experience including working for a local computer company but her work had been mainly of a service industry nature. She suffered a stroke about 2006 and although almost completely recovered she still had some slowness in hand to eye coordination. She had done only temporary work since. She hoped to work for another 10–15 years in a job that she enjoyed as she attached a great deal of importance to job satisfaction. She liked working with people and found technical support factory work ‘very difficult’. She left school at 15 and had no qualifications except a school certificate certifying competence in basic skills.</p>
<p>Asked why she decided to do the course she explained that, although she had worked for a computer company, her IT skills were largely self-taught. She learned about the course at the job centre. Although she had enjoyed it and commented on positive feedback from all learners she found it too easy and found that she knew more than she previously realized. She was also doing another course on supporting families with members with learning and physical disabilities. She would like to find work in this area.</p>
<p>Asked what she expected to learn she explained that she had higher expectations of the course than provided and has signed up to do the next level (Intermediate). Although she found the course to be at too low a level everybody else had loved it and feedback was good. She found that the course had improved her self-esteem which had suffered as a result of the stroke. She found that other learners asked her advice, for example ‘Should I buy a Shetland pony for my granddaughter on the Internet?’ She advised that while it was appropriate to locate purchase opportunities on the Internet, site visits to the seller would be necessary to inspect the ponies and form an opinion about the suitability of the seller and his/her standards of animal care.</p>
<p>There was considerable discussion about Internet training and usage. She found that Internet usage pervaded the whole course with an exercise being set every week, for example buying an outfit for a man going to a wedding. She was familiar with Google and Ask Jeeves [sic] search engines and referred to such websites as Department of Work and Pensions, Job Centre Plus and SI Jobs. She was offered searching tips by the tutor but would still like to know more about finding information and also about Word and Excel. Her only learning problems were stroke related and her long-term aim was to find satisfying employment because ‘It’s so easy to become Jeremy Kyle’s friend’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0961000611436096">
<title>Interviewee Two</title>
<p>Was in her early 60s and retired. During her working life she worked mostly in the service industries including the local Co-operative Society, as a bus conductress, in various forms of shop work and as a waitress. She also worked in a factory but did not like it as she preferred working with people. She had no formal education since leaving school except for a six-week course in cake design.</p>
<p>She decided to do the course because she did not like being inactive and also because of motivation from her family including her son who worked for a computer firm and her grandson who she looked after several days a week (‘grandson getting on to me’). However he only showed her what he was interested in. She found out about the course as a result of coming into the library to borrow a CD and then attending a publicity event. She was not doing any other courses.</p>
<p>Her expectations of the course were fulfilled (she ‘did not have a clue’ before starting). She learned keyboarding skills (the layout and use of a keyboard) and how to send and receive emails. She was aware of other applications. She played games such as Solitaire. Her sister stored knitting patterns on her computer. She was aware of social networking because the ‘wee fella’ showed her Facebook but she was concerned about the Internet safety issues it raised. She was also aware of the relationship between the Internet and mobile technology.</p>
<p>In discussing Internet use she explained that she had been shown Google and Yahoo and mentioned comparing the prices of washing machines on Amazon and EBay as a learning exercise. As a practical example of Internet searching she mentioned buying trainers on the Internet which can be done more cheaply than going to a shop. Shopping on the Internet made life a lot easier. She also mentioned finding information about holiday destinations (going on a cruise) which she linked with learning foreign languages.</p>
<p>She did not have problems learning because the ‘girls’ (tutors) are lovely to work with and made her feel welcome although she referred to a history of heart problems</p>
<p>She also expressed interest in downloading music from the Internet and showed that she understood the basic principles of copyright and referred to the practice of buying illegal copies of CDs and DVDs at markets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0961000611436096">
<title>Interviewee Three</title>
<p>Was in her middle 40s and currently not in paid employment but did have an interview that afternoon for a position as a kitchen assistant (16 hours a week) at a local home where her partner works. Previous work had been in the catering and hospitality industry (kitchen work and waitressing), laundry work as well as shop work. She used to be more healthy and outgoing but about 14/15 years ago she was knocked down by a car causing damage to her shoulder. She left school at 15 to do a course at College (Retail and Distribution – Hairdressing and Make Up, Customer Care) but ‘failed at that’. She wanted to go back to school but was not allowed to and left full-time education without any qualifications. She believed that whilst at school there was ‘too much antics’ and she was ‘not able to concentrate’ and that she has ‘learnt more since she came out of school’. She was ‘not good at writing things down’ and saw herself as having no confidence but said that the Army Cadets where she was a Sergeant had boosted her confidence.</p>
<p>Asked why she decided to do the course she explained that the other Army Cadet Sergeant had suggested it so that she could ‘put stuff onto a computer disk’. Her partner also put her onto the classes as he was taking classes run by the library. She did not know what to expect from the classes as she ‘knows nothing about computers’. The course (basic course) was for two hours a week for 10 weeks and had about eight people in the class of different ages. The course covered: How to switch on a computer; Use a keyboard; Create a Word document – with somebody’s details (name, interests, etc.) ‘to give us an idea how to do it’; Email – ‘went into email thing’ when asked if she had emailed anyone she said she did not know anyone with an email; Websites – looking up Tesco, Curry’s www and ‘getting an idea how to look them up and get it’, ‘how they looked’. Task involved looking up prices for a vacuum cleaner from different websites and taking a note of their prices so they could compare prices. Her main learning problem was her lack of confidence and she found the double clicking of the mouse difficult.</p>
<p>Although she ‘used not to be interested in things like that’ she found that the course had made her ‘more confident about finding information’ and that ‘she could come into the library and do it herself’. She felt ‘better in myself, in my skills, stuff I’ve missed out over the years – prove to myself that I can do things’. She now wanted to learn more skills and was starting the new course ‘next step up’ (intermediate) on the 30 August 2009 as she wanted to ‘gain more confidence’, ‘learn more about IT’. She also thought the course/s would come in handy if she went for an interview for another job (other than kitchen assistant). She did not have a computer at home but hoped that ‘they can get one, when the finances are sorted’ so that it would give her more chance to use a computer. She would like to look at EBay out of curiosity as her brother-in-law used it. She did try looking up the side effects of the medicine she was on by putting the word medicine ‘in the box’ but did not manage to find what she was looking for. At the Army Cadets she had sat a test that the cadets were sitting and scored 89% which she was really pleased with.</p>
<p>On seeing the image of ‘Oor Wullie’ on the Scottish Information Literacy project leaflet she said that the Army Cadets also used the image and, when informed of the permission gained by the project for using the image and asked whether they had permission, she said that they had been using it for a long time. This seemed to imply that as they were a reputable body and had been using it for a long time it would be okay.</p>
<p>Her mother was a domestic in a hospital and had recently retired. She was one of four children (third oldest), her sister was a prison governor in England, one of her brothers worked in Clyde Port as an electrician and the other was something to do with shipping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0961000611436096">
<title>Interviewee Four</title>
<p>Was in her late 50s, was made redundant from a local factory eight years ago and had not worked since but looked after her grandchildren while her daughter who was 30 worked for a mobile phone company as a personal advisor (helped people with phone bill queries etc.). She also had a 35-year-old son who was not employed at the moment, who used to work at gardening but had not worked for a while. Before she left school she worked in a café waitressing. She got married, had children and had worked in laundries.</p>
<p>Her reasons for doing the courses were her grandchildren so that she was ‘able to do things like them’ and ‘now she does’ impressing her grandson with what she can do/has learnt. She enjoyed the courses, enjoyed the company and ‘felt dead at ease, not stressed out’. She did not have a clue before but was ‘now more knowledgeable’ plus found that it ‘gives you a bit of confidence’. She learned how to start a computer; send emails; ‘do a card’ (create a card) using patterns, colours, etc.; the Internet – looking up things, going shopping for washing machines from different stores. She now felt ‘more confident about finding information’. Her daughter had a laptop up in the loft that she could use but she was not confident about using it as it was different to the computers used on the courses. If she needed information she would come into the library and use the computers there and, if she got stuck, she would ask the librarian. She had done both the basic six-week course at Greenock with Sally (the tutor) and got a certificate which she felt good about, then she did the 10-week intermediate course with Barry (the tutor) at Barr’s Cottage (branch library). When asked what the intermediate course consisted of she replied ‘more or less the same’ as the basic course. When pressed for more information she mentioned Google and typing in words plus typing in the www address and that ‘you worked by yourself’ and ‘had to look for information on different pages’. Evaluation of information did not seem to be included in the course but in general discussion she did mention her concern about her grandchildren and Internet safety such as people being who they say they are.</p>
<p>She did not have problems learning, the ‘tutors were great, let you go at your own pace’. She expressed interest in doing other courses but she would need to work round her daughter’s shifts. She also mentioned that her daughter had looked at prices and availability of clothes for school for the new term from local suppliers on the Internet, and had then contacted them by phone to lay aside the items so that she could come into the store and buy them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0961000611436096">
<title>Interviewee Five</title>
<p>Was in her late 30s, had worked in catering, hotel work (kitchen and waitressing), as a factory production operator and shop work ‘so has some sales experience’. She talked about her lack of confidence and the course she was doing to improve her confidence. The reason for doing the basic course was personal interest. She had never been on a computer before but her son wanted her to buy him a laptop and she thought that ‘it would be lying there so she could use it’ when he was at work. She bought one and they had Internet connection through ‘Virgin cable supplies’. She also mentioned Google and that her son who worked at Tesco and had done PC Passport ‘buys and sells things on EBay’. She also mentioned that she had been worried about this but found that it worked and mentioned PayPal with regard to making payments.</p>
<p>She enjoyed the course but said that the only thing was that the other people on the course were over 50 and interested in Internet banking which she was not. She had a folder with her which contained the information sheets from the course and examples of the work she had done (the only interviewee to do so). The tasks they did included writing a letter to a financial organization, using a Word document and a sample letter experimenting with upper and lower case lettering. Using Google to find a website – when asked for further information she explained that ‘Barry said which words to use in the search box’ and that ‘that guy had the patience of saint’.</p>
<p>Regarding school which she left in 1986 without qualifications she said that she ‘didn’t think she was very clever’ but said that the school concentrated ‘mostly on religion rather than about learning’. She said that if she had the chance she ‘would love to go back to school’ and this time she ‘would ask questions’ saying that it was ‘the way to find out about things’.</p>
<p>She found information about the course through the local newspaper and also a friend who was doing PC Passport told her about the course. Since doing the course she had ‘advised a man around the corner about the course but it was fully booked when he enquired’. Given her lack of confidence in herself she was asked if she would have done the course if she had not been on the confidence course first. She replied that she would not have. With regard to her long-term aims she was ‘looking at higher education as she would like to do a nails/beauticians course’. In the meantime she was going to go back and do the intermediate course.</p>
<p>She had a mobile phone and had learnt how to text but had difficulty with spelling. When asked whether being able to use the phone to text had helped with her learning to use the computer she thought about it and said yes.</p>

<title>Interview with tutor</title>
<p>He had been doing this work for nearly two-and-a-half years, having previously worked as an assistant to adult literacies tutors. He worked mainly in libraries in the Greenock area. Classes have been run in Greenock, Gourock and Port Glasgow and one was run for a time in Kilmacolm.</p>
<p>More women than men attended the courses. Men were more likely to attend for short periods as they had work commitments or had ‘bite-sized’ learning needs for specific work or job seeking commitments. Retired people showed more commitment. Attendees tended to be people orientated and there were a lot of referrals from Job Centre Plus and similar agencies.</p>
<p>The course content was a ‘cooperative effort’. While there was a set course descriptor the tutors had the opportunity to ‘flesh out certain angles’ and respond to the interests of learners. Internet retailing was an example. Although the intention was to focus on employability, retired people turned up with no specific intentions. Because of this he tended to focus on topics like how to find reliable information on health awareness and personal financial management. There was an interest in Internet banking because learners were concerned about possible security breaches. This tended to reduce the focus on employability. People with employability needs tended to need skills and information ‘right away’.</p>
<p>He offered Internet training on generic searching and describes Yahoo as well as Google. He also set tasks for learners but the training was at a fairly basic level as there was more Internet training at the second level course. If learners reported problems he was happy to help them on a one-to-one basis and focus training on their particular interests. He estimated the information literacy content of the course to be between 30% and 60%, depending on learner needs and interests, and felt that the emphasis was moving more towards information literacy.</p>
<p>The main difference the course had made to learners was to make them feel more confident. They had acquired a taste for learning and showed a willingness to do more. He administered evaluations at week 1, weeks 4–5 and week 9 (3 in all).</p>
<p>Although the course was extremely successful the tutor recognized a need to enhance his own skills and admitted he was still learning. Areas of possible enhancement mentioned included intellectual property issues and Internet safety.</p>

<title>Discussion/evaluation</title>
<sec id="section14-0961000611436096">
<title>Analysing the data</title>
<p>Clearly the above is a snapshot and needs to be backed by quantitative data but nevertheless a consistent picture emerged over the five interviews and the findings were checked and validated with the tutor. All the interviewees and the tutor were very committed to the evaluation exercise and all requested a copy of the final report.</p>
<p>All the interviewees were women and there were no young people of either sex available for interview. Discussions with the tutor confirmed that the course appealed more to older women and when asked about this he suggested that men have very precise employability needs which may have to be addressed at short notice and they are less interested in structured relatively long courses. Given the higher than average proportion of NEETs in Inverclyde, the attendance of younger people is clearly an issue.</p>
<p>Generally previous work experience showed a strong focus on services industries – catering, hospitality, laundries but with some references to local factory and industrial employment although experience of this kind of work was perceived to be poor. The learners interviewed were clearly ‘people people’ who benefited from social interaction. The fact that all the interviewees were women may explain the strong focus on the service sector as this has traditionally attracted a female workforce. The strong service sector previous work experience may be a course development issue to address here especially as the <italic>Inverclyde Workforce Plus Quarterly Performance Bulletin January 2008</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009c</xref>) forecast that the only employment sectors likely to grow are financial and business services and health and education. In targeting potential learners for the future it is useful to note the Employability Review’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009b</xref>: 20) identification of local needs: new unemployed; people facing redundancy; and young people and apprentices.</p>
<p>Learners found out about the course from a variety of sources: personal contact, the library itself, newspaper advertisements, promotional events and the Job Centre which seemed to be the most ‘official’ source and this seems to be a key issue in future structuring of the course. Family and friends were the main motivation for joining the course. This ranged from partners to grandchildren who reported positively on the skills that could be learned and were able also to offer a perspective on such issues as social networking and Internet safety. Personal social development is another factor which is closely linked to employability aspirations so the two are not easy to separate out. Recreational activities such as holiday planning and Internet shopping also figure and must be considered as important as more utilitarian activities as they require information literacy skills too. Positive encouragement from loved ones also counterbalances negative school education experiences.</p>
<p>All the interviewees had left school with only basic skills, none had post-school qualifications and motivation to further educational experiences had been weak. Motivation for completing the course and proceeding to the next (Intermediate) level was influenced by the above factors but also by the quality of the tutors who received universal and unstinted praise. It was generally felt that they created a relaxed non-threatening environment which allowed the learners to work at their own pace and not be pushed into anything they did not want to do.</p>
<p>Time management appeared as an issue with two interviewees having to structure their learning around family commitments, for example looking after grandchildren.</p>
<p>Although no disability issues were raised in the strict terms of long-term and disabling conditions, health issues were mentioned by three interviewees. This has an impact on their self-confidence and therefore their employability and so the ability to manage health conditions through use of accurate information is a factor and one which the course already recognizes. Health is an important issue for Inverclyde generally and findings by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Health Working Group (2006)</xref> highlight the need for a health literacy strategy which the courses could address. Healthy living issues such as healthy eating and alcohol awareness are being successfully pursued but they need to be supported by an understanding of health literacy issues and how to address them. Health as an employability issue was also highlighted in the <italic>Employability Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611436096">Inverclyde Council, 2009b</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>The course content (which was written and provided by the tutor) and the role of information literacy within it were reviewed with both the tutor and the learners. Within the basic IT skills training agenda the tutor felt that the information literacy content of the course was between 30% and 60%, depending on learner needs and interests and he felt that the emphasis was moving more towards information literacy. This seemed to be the view of the learners, one of whom found that Internet usage pervaded the whole course and the others repeatedly referred to information literacy exercises and tasks taking place throughout the course. The value of information literacy was readily appreciated for both occupational and recreational purposes and there was less emphasis on basic literacy skills and basic computer skills (like layout and use of a keyboard) than might have been expected. The emphasis on health awareness and personal financial management is clearly worthwhile, especially the former, and there seems to be developmental potential here especially if undertaken in conjunction with healthy living activities. Content of the course seems to be quite comprehensive although there is a need for a basic understanding of IPR issues (copyright). This is viewed by learners mainly in terms of downloads from the Internet and buying illegal copies of CDs and DVDs and could probably be taught largely in these terms. Internet safety was another recurring issue but the tutor was aware of this.</p>
<p>In terms of impact (making a change), the most obvious benefit is the one which might have appeared to be the most difficult to quantify: confidence. All the learners and the tutor, who based his conclusion on observing the students over the period of the course, were emphatic that their self-confidence had been greatly boosted by taking part in the course which is, in itself, an important factor in employability. All were/are keen to progress to Intermediate level which shows initial success and an awareness of something on which to build. All interviewees demonstrated an understanding of information literacy and some understanding of how to use the skills appropriately although there is considerable scope for development here. They commented spontaneously on the information literacy component and required no prompting. No mention was made of the Advanced search facility offered by search engines which could have assisted the learners’ understanding of how a search strategy can be conducted but perhaps it is addressed in the Intermediate course. It is still too early to comment directly on progress into work due to the newness of the course and the variable age profile of the interviewees. This will depend at least to some extent on improving and structuring recruitment in the first place.</p>

<title>Comparative analysis</title>
<p>For comparative analysis we can look to education and public library quality assessment frameworks in Scotland. The <italic>Improving Scottish Education</italic> report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611436096">HM Inspectorate of Education, 2009</xref>: 73–78) offers some useful points in its review of community learning and development (CLD). It indicates the following strengths and weaknesses identified Scotland wide:</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<list id="list3-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Strong commitment to inclusion, equality and fairness with example of innovative and effective work with disadvantaged individuals and groups</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learning programmes that are flexible and tailored to meet the needs of learners</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Good quality of youth work and the relationships with young people</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The high degree of responsiveness to the needs of adult learners</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The improvements made in community capacity building</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Partnership working remains a strength in the sector</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aspects for improvement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Demonstrating the outcomes of CLD provision and tracking improvements over time</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensuring that planning is needs-led and outcomes focuses</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There are good model points to follow here and the teaching and evaluation of the course show that it meets most of these criteria. The report also makes points which characterize the course:</p>
<list id="list4-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>learning programmes are developed through negotiation and dialogue between staff and participants;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the sector is demand-led and therefore focused on the participants own expectations; CLD experiences typically engender great enthusiasm and motivation for learning amongst adult learners. Staff are particularly effective in developing confidence and self esteem in the majority of learners.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>From the information world <italic>Building on Success: A Public Library Quality Improvement Matrix for Scotland</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611436096">Scottish Library and Information Council, 2007</xref>) is part of the Strategic Quality Assurance Framework which has been developed for local authorities to use in monitoring and assessing the performance of their cultural services. Although Scottish public libraries are required to provide an ‘adequate’ service, adequate is not defined and this approach intends to provide a clear definition of adequate service provision. It has seven quality indicators which can be measured on a scale of 6–1 (Excellent to Unsatisfactory – this is the scale used by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education). This is an appropriate process as many public library services are involved in HMIE inspections through community learning and development and other performance review processes. The relevant indicator is the fourth – Learners’ experiences. A variety of methods are identified for finding evidence although this does not extend to a detailed review of survey and evaluation methods.</p>
<p>Quality indicator 4 – Learners’ experiences recommends inter alia…</p>
<list id="list5-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Public library services should promote and deliver learning in their communities…</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The services to learners should be widely publicised and regular introductory sessions should be arranged.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Entitlements to the public should include:</p>
<list id="list6-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Support for the development of information literacy and digital literacy to enable access and use of information services</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Community learning and literacy classes, including taster sessions and progression through learning partnerships</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Questions to ask are:</p>
<list id="list7-0961000611436096" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In what ways does the library environment promote learning?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent do staff encourage learning?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In what ways are the needs of various learners addressed?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What opportunities are there for progression through partnerships?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Clearly Inverclyde performs well against all the components of this indicator.</p>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>In general terms the need for this kind of training with an emphasis on information literacy is not in doubt. The <italic>Digital Britain</italic> interim report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611436096">Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 2009</xref>: 63–64) states that digital life skills are needed by all; digital work skills are needed by most and digital economy skills are needed by some: ‘education and training for digital technologies … underpins everything we do in the 21st Century’.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<list id="list8-0961000611436096" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The introduction of information training has clearly been a success and should be developed further to endow learners with the expertise to develop employability and workplace decision-making skills. However, it is clear from reviewing the literature of community learning that adult literacies trainers are largely ignorant of the learning materials developed by librarians while librarians are equally ignorant of the valuable work and highly relevant which adult literacies trainers undertake. Most learning materials produced by librarians are traditionally aimed at undergraduates and can be found in such sources as Intute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/">http://www.intute.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and JORUM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk/">http://www.jorum.ac.uk/</ext-link>). However, some of the material may be adaptable. The developers of SMILE (Study Methods and Information Literacy Exemplars) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smileproject.wordpress.com/">http://smileproject.wordpress.com/</ext-link>), currently aimed at undergraduates are keen to develop it for workplace and employability information skills training. Other universities have already developed bite-sized learning material for the workplace including The University of Northampton’s BITE project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bite.northampton.ac.uk/Index/Additions/ExternalNav/DesigningOA/DesigningOA_Nav.php">http://bite.northampton.ac.uk/Index/Additions/ExternalNav/DesigningOA/DesigningOA_Nav.php</ext-link>) and The Open Universities iKnow Information and Knowledge at work bite-sized learning materials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.open.ac.uk/iknow">www.open.ac.uk/iknow</ext-link>). For public library staff there is POPi <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bradlibs.com/intranet/POPi_testOneRO/ProjectWelcomePage.htm">http://www.bradlibs.com/intranet/POPi_testOneRO/ProjectWelcomePage.htm</ext-link>. It would be useful to review with adult literacies tutors how these materials can be adapted to suit their needs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A key factor is a strong focus on appropriate recruitment and while this issue is being tackled, more regularized procedures perhaps with a greater role for Job Centres are needed. This is especially relevant because of the trialling of the Integrated Employment Skills (IES) programme in Greenock, Port Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland. This is a joint initiative between Skills Development Scotland (SDS) and Job Centre Plus whereby staff from both organizations work in Job Centres as they have overlapping clienteles. As job finding and employability are closely linked in the courses, this seems an obvious area where SDS and Job Centre Plus staff should be working together. Furthermore it is a responsibility of Job Centre Plus to proactively identify people suitable for particular training programmes and refer them on. Currently there are few referrals from Job Centre Plus and a more proactive approach is needed. The other question is – Do Job Centre Plus staff have a different view of learners who have successfully completed the course?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Too much should not be inferred from such a small sample but it is quite clear that the learners interviewed do not really separate out vocational learning from personal social development and there is still a need for more lifestyle-orientated training with a focus on health and financial literacies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Training should be targeted on potential employment – whilst the <italic>Inverclyde Workforce Plus Quarterly Performance Bulletin January 2008</italic> (Local Labour Market Information, 2009) forecast identified employment in financial and business services and health and education this may no longer be the case due to problems with the banking sector, a change in the UK Government in May 2010 and impending cuts in public sector jobs. A fresh look will need to be taken at new areas of potential employment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Health information training is very important for both employability and lifestyle training and should be promoted in conjunction with community hubs, regeneration projects etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Course scheduling and planning is also an issue. Somewhat surprisingly some interviewees found it difficult to fit in course attendance with other commitments and some market research on timings might be appropriate. The course tutor also, when discussing the lack of male attendees, expressed the view that ’bite-sized’ short more targeted courses might be more suitable for men with specific employability needs. These could be trialled perhaps on a drop-in basis and materials/lessons learnt by other projects such as POPi and the Open University iKnow could inform the basis of these courses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The course should include information on copyright and Internet safety issues. Copyright training should instil a basic awareness of the concept of copyright as a form of property and should concentrate on illegal Internet downloading, network file sharing and the sale of illegal videos and CDs. Internet safety issues have been reported on by Professor Byron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611436096">Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 2009</xref>: 67) but for adults the solution must lie with education, training and evaluation skills. It is interesting that IPR issues have emerged as a recognizable component of Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS) and clearly need more attention in the design of information literacy training programmes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This study has been based on a small sample and major overview conclusions cannot be drawn but the interviewees have clearly become more confident learners as a result of attending these courses. While the desire to work is a powerful motivation, personal development is still an important factor and should not be ignored. The information literacy component is strong and can be expanded. There is some scope for improvement in course planning and content planning and especially in improving recruitment but there is a model here which can be applied much more widely. Training needs to be targeted on employment opportunities in the local service sector which is where future employment opportunities appear to be located. As with all community learning activities the key is partnerships. The course content and presentation has been tested against two policy documents: <italic>Improving Scottish Education</italic> report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611436096">HM Inspectorate of Education, 2009</xref>) and <italic>Building on Success: A Public Library Quality Improvement Matrix for Scotland</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611436096">Scottish Library and Information Council, 2007</xref>) and has been found to meet their criteria.</p>
<p>Some comparative data comes from Caerphilly County Borough Council library services which played a leading part in a ‘Gateways to Learning’ project involving 56 libraries from both public and educational sectors. Two thousand people took part in information literacy training sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611436096">Evans, 2009</xref>). The lessons learned are similar to the Inverclyde experience: frame courses round subjects of genuine interest; collaborate with adult education partners and with further and higher education; information literacy gives public libraries a role in supporting lifelong learning; collaboration is essential and information literacy training skills must be embedded in staff development.</p>
<p>Finally it should be noted that the literature of information usage of information seeking in non-academic contexts is not extensive in the UK and much more research is needed.</p>
