<p>Despite decades of work on friendships across the lifespan, only a limited body of work is focused on friendships among people with dementia, especially in advanced stages and in long-term care settings. The research and experiences presented in this Special Issue address this gap in the literature and comprise a collection of empirical and theoretical papers which focus on various elements of social interaction, friendships, and the social environments of people with dementia.</p>
<p>The benefits of friendships and social contacts, including improved overall health and wellbeing, have been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421062">Antonucci, Akiyama, &amp; Adelmann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421062">Berkman, Glass, Brissette, &amp; Seeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421062">Berkman &amp; Syme, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421062">Crohan &amp; Antonnuci, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421062">Giles, Glonek, Luszcz, &amp; Andrews, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421062">Kutner, Brown, Stavisky, Clark, &amp; Green, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421062">Williams &amp; Roberts, 1995</xref>) as have the consequences of social isolation, such as anxiety, depression, and anger and poorer physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421062">Hawthorne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421062">House, Robbins, &amp; Metzner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421062">Metzner &amp; Fellner, 2010</xref>). Such compelling support for the importance of friendship leads to the question: Why have friendships among people with dementia been so understudied?</p>
<p>Friendships, like many other aspects of dementia-related care and research, are not easily linked to long-term measurable cognitive, physical or psychological improvement. As Hopper (2003) argued in her paper advocating for language rehabilitation therapy for dementia residents in long-term care, the response is often, ‘They’re just going to get worse anyway’. The continuation of cognitive and physical decline associated with most types of dementia leads to an underlying assumption that pursuing personally enriching experiences are simply not worth the resources. Hopper found that contrary to this common misconception, residents in advanced stages of dementia improved their communicative ability and subsequent social interactions. Certainly, most people (with or without dementia) would, if given a choice, want to have the most engaging experiences possible even if they knew it was for a short time. Indeed, given that none of us knows how long we have to live, each of us may actually have ‘only a short time left’. In the face of this certain uncertainty, we still choose to pursue the most engaging experiences we can while we can, for making good moments is important to us no matter how much longer we may live. The same reality holds for people with dementia and the same choices must be made possible for them as well.</p>
<p>The eight papers in this Special Issue address a variety of perspectives (subject and researcher), settings (institutional versus personal household), and methods (ethnography, focus groups, face-to-face interviews, participant observation) related to friendship in people with dementia. In addition, this Special Issue introduces several new constructs through which to view and study friendships and social interaction, including facilitated friendships, social relatedness, embodied selfhood, conversational objects, and nested social groups.</p>
<p>The first two papers (by Ward et al. and Harris) examine how individuals in the early stages of dementia define friendship for themselves, in their own voice, using face-to-face interviews and focus groups. The next paper (by Sabat &amp; Lee) examines social relatedness in an adult day center, while the following paper (by Kontos) explores embodiment as a component of sociability. The following three papers (by de Medeiros et al., Saunders et al., and Doyle et al.) examine data gathered from ‘The Friendship Study’, which is a mixed methods project supported by the Alzheimer’s Association. These papers analyze different aspects of social interactions among persons with moderate-to-severe dementia. The final paper (by Campos &amp; Chaudhury) also examines an institutional setting. These authors, however, provide a careful analysis of the physical environment. The following is a brief summary of each paper.</p>
<p>In their paper, Richard Ward, Mike Howarth, Heather Wilkinson, Sarah Campbell, and John Keady take a unique look at friendships and dementia from two perspectives. The first is a personal account by one of the authors (MH), who is employed as a network coordinator for a nationally sponsored support network for people with dementia in the UK and who lives with Alzheimer’s disease. The second features insight from a support group in the ‘Friends for Life’ project, where people with dementia meet weekly to socialize and discuss their experiences. The paper offers both an insider’s perspective on the meaning of friendship for someone with dementia, but also on the possibilities of ‘facilitated friendships’, which describes how friendships are established and maintained through a peer support model. It is interesting to note that through this national model, ‘facilitated friendships’ is part of the UK’s policy agenda, and has the potential to improve the lives of people with dementia greatly by bringing them together in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Phyllis Braudy Harris’ paper explores how eight people in the early stages of dementia have been able to maintain strong friendships while coping with cognitive change. Using in-depth interviews to gain understanding of these individuals’ subjective experience and their relationships with long-time friends, Harris found themes indicating the importance of maintaining these friendships because of the trust and ability to confide in long-time friends. Another theme was that it was important to distinguish ‘memory’ from ‘understanding’ in friendships. Since memory would inevitably falter, the participants felt that their friends valued and respected them for who they were, not for what they remember. In addition, Harris suggests that other aspects of friendships such as activities and recognizing strengths and limits also contribute to long-lasting relationships despite a dementia diagnosis.</p>
<p>Steven Sabat and Joanna Lee take up ‘social relatedness’ among people with moderate dementia in an adult day center. Social relatedness describes the way in which one person can connect meaningfully to another and can include how one interprets the environment, the actions of others, and other elements. The article points out that staff in care facilities often rely on results of standardized assessments to frame their understanding of residents’ behaviors, potentials and limits. Given that many assessments measure performance on decontextualized tasks (e.g. being required to remember a list of unrelated nouns versus remembering important objects from one’s past), they provide a distorted and potentially inaccurate context from which staff form expectations about the abilities of people with dementia. Social relatedness among people diagnosed reveals the presence of cognitive abilities that are either not assessed by standard tests or that exist even though they appear on the basis of tests to be dysfunctional or non-existent. Staff must therefore not form expectations based on tests but rather seek to know and understand participants or residents for the people they are in the social world, rather than who their charts and test scores say they are.</p>
<p>Pia Kontos looks at an embodied dimension of sociability in residents with dementia in long-term care: embodied self-expression. Drawing from the literature on ‘embodied selfhood’, which suggests that a pre-reflexive self is revealed through the body, Kontos argues embodiment has been missing in much of the work on sociability in dementia. Non-verbal communication, which can include etiquette practices, gestures, facial expressions, and other forms of expression, can convey hostility, humor, affection, empathy, and others to create meaningful communication between residents. Understanding communication through embodied self-expression can lead to better understanding of residents’ interactions and expressions, and have positive implications for practice, potentially improving quality of life while reducing negative encounters.</p>
<p>Kate de Medeiros and colleagues explore how friendship is defined and experienced in a long-term care setting for people with moderate to advanced dementia. Using data from a mixed-methods study, de Medeiros et al. use a combination of staff and resident interviews, standardized tests of cognitive performance and communicative functional abilities, and direct observations to understand better how friendship is experienced by residents and how friendships are defined and perceived by staff. The authors ultimately found that friendships, characterized by voluntary choice to engage with the other, recognition of uniqueness in the other, and accommodation in behaviors and/or conversation were key hallmarks in the residents’ friendships they observed. One compelling finding is the mismatch between staff’s perceptions and residents’ behaviors in terms of friendships. Staff identified the men to be friends with each other while the residents were observed in social interactions with both women and men. Findings point to the importance of interviews with residents and observation rather than relying on staff reports to understand friendships in this setting.</p>
<p>Pamela Saunders and colleagues investigated how social relationships are constructed through language as part of the Friendship Study. Language abilities are known to change with the progression of dementia, possibly hindering friendships, which may rely on verbal exchanges. Using video- and audio-taped footage obtained during an ethnographic study in a dementia unit, Saunders et al. examine the construct of conversational objects which stimulate residents to talk with one another in addition to using pronomial references to create cohesion and coherence. Overall, the paper explores the ways in which language is used to create and maintain relationships among residents.</p>
<p>In the third paper from the Friendship Study, Patrick Doyle and colleagues introduce the idea of ‘nested social groups’ to describe the ways in which connectedness is helped and hindered in long-term care by physical and social barriers. The idea of ‘nested groups’ comes from the larger literature on social groups and networks to describe the ways in which social structures are established and used. Using ethnographic observations, Doyle and colleagues identified multiple levels of ‘nested groups’ that in turn affected individual residents’ abilities to socialize. The outermost ‘nested unit’ is the long-term care facility itself; within that, is a 20-bed assisted living wing within which is a group of residents who like to socialize; and finally within that, an individual resident. One’s ability to participate in various nested groups depends on mobility, proximity, cognitive status (e.g. knowing how to navigate the groups), and other factors. The paper’s theoretical construct provides an important way for rethinking social opportunities in long-term care.</p>
<p>Finally, Michael Campo and Habib Chaudhury focus on the relationship between the environment and casual social interactions in long-term care. The authors use Lawton and Nahemow’s competence-environmental press model to consider how organizational policies (e.g. the organization’s philosophy of care, staffing patterns, and activities) and the physical environment (dining room, hallways, activities rooms, and other community spaces) influence interactions in two specialized care units in Canada. Formal assessments of the physical environment using two environmental assessment tools (the Therapeutic Environment Screening Scale for Nursing Homes [TESS-NH] and the Professional Environmental Assessment Protocol [PEAP], observations of residents, and key informant interviews were conducted to enhance our understanding of how and why space was used and what interactions occurred. Based on their findings, the authors provide recommendations for maximizing social interactions in long-term care living units.</p>
<p>It is our hope that this body of work can provide a much needed rationale for <italic>why</italic> this type of research should be continued, as well as theoretical and practical considerations for thinking about the topic in general.</p>
