<abstract>
<p>We tested the hypothesis that the relationship between social class measured according to employment relations and conditions and quality of life in older people was due to the influence of social class on the perception individuals had about their place in a social hierarchy. We used the data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) in which both an occupation-based measure, the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and a subjective measure of social status (SSS) were included. Quality of life was measured using a 19-item Likert-scaled questionnaire (CASP-19). We found that even in the employed, SSS explained quality of life better than NS-SEC. The path analysis revealed that the effects of most NS-SEC categories on quality of life were fully mediated by SSS. The effect of SSS on quality of life was independent of advantageous occupational conditions, favourable life circumstances or mental health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is controversy about the relative importance for health inequality of ‘objectively’ measured social position versus the individual’s perception of their own social status. In this article, we use measures that could plausibly be regarded as reflecting these two types of causal process: the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and the Subjective Social Status Scale (SSS) developed by Adler and colleagues.</p>
<p>The National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512455963">Rose and Pevalin, 2003</xref>) is a theoretically based, validated measure of social class based on employment relations and conditions. Six criteria are used to allocate occupations to the NS-SEC: the timing of payment for work (monthly, weekly, daily, hourly); the presence or absence of regular pay increments; whether the worker can decide when they start and leave work; promotion opportunities; degree of influence over the planning of work; and level of influence over designing their own work tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038512455963">Coxon and Fisher, 2003</xref>). Extensive work has demonstrated the construct validity of the NS-SEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512455963">Evans and Mills, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512455963">Mills and Evans, 2003</xref>). The measure is not hierarchical and is explicitly not intended to be an indicator of prestige or social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512455963">Rose, 1999</xref>). The Subjective Social Status (SSS) scale was developed to capture the multiple dimensions of socio-economic status and social position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512455963">Adler et al., 2007</xref>) by asking respondents to place themselves on a rung of a ladder according to whether they regarded themselves as ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ than other people. The measure is positively correlated with income and education, and has acceptable test-re-test reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512455963">Adler et al., 2000</xref>) It has been extensively correlated to different health outcomes in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512455963">Adler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512455963">Demakakos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512455963">Franzini and Fernandez-Esquer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512455963">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512455963">Ostrove et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512455963">Singh-Manoux et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512455963">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There is as yet no research relating the MacArthur SSS to quality of life in older people. However, the measure was developed in part to overcome the problems that arise when using occupation-based measures of social position in older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512455963">Hu et al., 2005</xref>) and younger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512455963">Goodman et al., 2001</xref>) people. The NS-SEC has been shown to be related to quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512455963">Blane et al., 2007</xref>). Those whose present or last-held occupation placed them in managerial and intermediate social classes had better quality of life in comparison to those in lower supervisory and routine social classes. For the salience of the NS-SEC, based on employment relationships, in predicting quality of life in those no longer in paid employment, the authors offered as an explanation the command over higher material resources due to larger occupational pensions or accumulation of advantages over the employment life course. An alternative interpretation of these results, however, would be that it is SSS influenced by the NS-SEC while employed which mediates the relationship with quality of life. This interpretation is tested in the following analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0038038512455963" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data were obtained from 7377 participants aged 50 to 74 years in the core sample of the Wave 1 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512455963">Marmot et al., 2003</xref>) who had complete information on quality of life (CASP-19), NS-SEC, SSS, depression, age and gender.</p>
<p>The theoretical underpinnings, validation and properties of CASP-19, our measure of quality of life, are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512455963">Hyde et al., 2003</xref>). The CASP-19 scores range from 0 to 57 and in ELSA Wave 1 data the mean was 42.8. We used the version of NS-SEC with seven classes.</p>
<p>In the ELSA self-completion questionnaire participants were instructed to place a cross on the rung on the ladder where they would place themselves. The responses were coded as 10, 20, and so on until 100 if the cross was placed on the rung and 5, 15 and so on until 95 if it was placed in the space below the rung. We divided this score by 10 so that a unit change in the score represented going up or down the ladder by one rung. To make valid comparisons with the NS-SEC, we also created a variable where the ladder scores were categorised into one-sevenths.</p>
<p>To adjust for confounding by depression, we used the 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512455963">Steffick, 2000</xref>), dichotomised so that a score of 4 or more denotes depression.</p>
<sec id="section3-0038038512455963">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To test the relative strength of the relationship of the NS-SEC and the SSS to CASP-19 scores we used multiple regression models. NS-SEC was a categorical variable and SSS was continuous and their scales of measurement were different so that the sizes of their regression coefficients were not comparable. Therefore we used a model selection approach using adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038512455963">Akaike, 1973</xref>) to test whether NS-SEC or SSS yields the best model given the data. When comparing the two measures of socio-economic status head to head we used the categorised SSS score. We did a path analysis to test whether subjective social status was related to the occupational measure as a mediator.</p>
<p>We tested the direction of dependency between SSS and CASP-19 using the inequality</p>

<p>Model 1 showed that there was a gradient in CASP-19 score with NS-SEC categories, with the exception of the self-employed. With the SSS (Model 2), the gradient was steeper with every rung climbed on the ladder adding almost two points to the CASP-19 score. When NS-SEC and SSS were entered together in Model 3, only the lower supervisory and routine occupations had significantly lower quality of life than managers and professionals. The coefficient for SSS showed only a very small attenuation. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup>, interpreted as the amount of variance in CASP-19 scores explained by the models, revealed that about a quarter of variance in CASP-19 scores was explained by gender and depression. NS-SEC explained another 2 per cent of the variance while SSS explained around 13 per cent, over six times more than NS-SEC. Including NS-SEC into the model with SSS improved the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> only by 0.1 per cent. AIC also confirmed these findings with Model 2 with the lowest AIC being selected as the ‘best model’ given the data.</p>
<p>We tested Model 1 and Model 2 on different sub-groups, namely all employed, all retired, 50 years to retirement, retirement to 74 years, unemployed and permanently sick, and domestic work. We used SSC categories instead of the continuous score to make the number of parameters in the models comparable. The models yielded similar results as the main model described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038512455963">Table 1</xref>. The differences in AIC between Model 1 with NS-SEC and Model 2 with SSC for various sub-groups were: –0.115 for the employed, –0.105 for the retired, –0.129 for those up to retirement age, –0.105 for those from retirement up to 74, –0.124 for the unemployed and permanently sick, and −0.130 for those looking after home and family. The negative sign signifies that the model with SSC had the smaller AIC, indicating better model fit. Thus, if this criterion is used, SSC will be preferred over NS-SEC to account for socio-economic differences in quality of life. The rank order of AIC values from the smallest to the largest was the same for NS-SEC and SSS. From the smallest to the largest, the order was employed, up to retirement, retired and retirement to 74, looking after family and home, and unemployed and permanently sick. This suggested that the influence of socio-economic status on quality of life, objective or subjective, is best understood in the context of work. However, subjective social status may give a better insight into this influence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038512455963">Figure 1</xref> presents the mean CASP-19 scores for SSS categories within each of the NS-SEC classes. The mean CASP-19 score ranged from 45.9 for the high managerial group to 40.6 for the routine occupations. Within each class, there were members from all the categories of SSS. In non-routine occupational classes the proportions of categories with lower SSS scores were smaller. The gradient in CASP-19 scores with SSS categories was preserved irrespective of the NS-SEC class.</p>

<p>Guided by the above results, we hypothesised that the relationship between one’s objective social class and quality of life may be mediated through the perception of one’s own position in the social hierarchy and tested it using a path analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038512455963">Figure 2</xref>). For the six dummy variables representing six classes in NS-SEC (higher managerial class was the reference and excluded) there are six paths leading indirectly through SSS and two paths (for lower supervisory, and routine occupations) leading directly to CASP-19. Membership of more advantaged classes in NS-SEC had its effect on quality of life only indirectly through the participants’ perception of their position in the social hierarchy, while the less advantaged classes, with the exception of semi-routine class, had a direct effect also on quality of life.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we have shown that the social gradient in quality of life in older persons observed with NS-SEC, was also observed with SSS. In fact, SSS was a stronger predictor of quality of life and showed a steeper gradient than NS-SEC. Our findings are similar to the considerable amount of evidence linking subjective social status with health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512455963">Adler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512455963">Demakakos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512455963">Franzini and Fernandez-Esquer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512455963">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512455963">Ostrove et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512455963">Singh-Manoux et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512455963">2005</xref>). Our results may not be generalisable outside the age range of the sample (50 to 90+ years) and for measures of quality of life other than CASP-19, such as objectively determined well-being and subjective reports of life satisfaction and happiness.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512455963">Blane et al. (2007)</xref> were the first to show the social gradient in quality of life using NS-SEC. As yet there are few similar studies using a measure of subjective social status and, as far as we know, this is the first study to show that SSS partially mediates the effect of objective social class on quality of life. We have thus changed the focus of discussion from whether the subjective or the objective measure of socio-economic position is superior, to the meaning of the relationship between socio-economic position and quality of life and of that between objective and subjective socio-economic positions. Objective measures of social status can predict subjective social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512455963">Jackman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512455963">Singh-Manoux et al., 2005</xref>). In our path diagram, all paths leading from NS-SEC to SSS had relatively small, albeit significant, effects, so that the relationship between SSS and CASP-19 cannot be explained solely in terms of a shared relationship with NS-SEC. By placing SSS in the path between NS-SEC and CASP-19, we are acknowledging that SSS encompasses the objective social position and the consequences due to it. However, SSS may have an additional advantage of incorporating a greater amount of relational information. SSS might include more proximal experiences of acceptance and domination by others, which become more important in the later years.</p>
<p>By showing that the direction of dependence was from SSS to CASP-19, we ruled out reverse causality which was suggested as an explanation for the relationship between SSS and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512455963">Singh-Manoux et al., 2005</xref>). We considered a similar relationship possible between SSS and CASP-19 because subjective well-being measured as life satisfaction had been shown to predict SSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512455963">Lundberg and Kristensson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another theoretical perspective that could be brought into this discussion is Prospect Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038512455963">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>). One of the tenets of Prospect Theory is the presence of a point of reference when judgements are made. The gradient in CASP-19 scores according to SSS seen within each NS-SEC class suggests the presence of such a reference point. We hypothesise that the references involved in SSS are pluripotent and multidimensional and future work will test this hypothesis.</p>
