<abstract>
<p>How we listen to the potential space of online relations is rapidly becoming part of our daily work. Two treatments are examined where themes of sexual shame, repression, and relational difficulties were found and refound through online relating and hooking-up. Consideration is given to the ways in which online exploration opens a potential space that affords sexual practice and the reach of relationality. Moving with these patients into this potential space opened onto an intriguing and productive relational field. These cases help illuminate a shift in our modern social order, and how that shift has followed on a reconsideration of our psychoanalytic ideals about sexual well-being. We are now positioned to reflect not only on the evolution and revolution of our shifting sexual cultures, including the increasing role of technology in our modern relational world, but on how this new world finds its way into our consulting rooms.</p>

<body>
<p>When sex brings someone to an analyst, it is most often due to a lack or an abundance of desire. It then becomes the analyst’s job to accompany the patient in acts of recollection, reverie, and repair as we seek what has gone missing and/or what feels to be out of control. In the course of such treatments, patients now routinely bring in stories of their sexual lives and practices that include accounts of online cruising and hooking-up. According to the online dating site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Match.com">Match.com</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003065112470562">2010</xref>), one in five relationships, of whatever duration, now begins online. How we listen to the potential space of these online relations is rapidly becoming part of our daily work.</p>
<p>In my experience, patients most often seek help with repression and lack in their sexual lives. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065112470562">Leo Bersani (1989)</xref> famously quipped, “There is a big secret about sex: most people don’t like it” (p. 197). Be that as it may, one occasionally meets the patient who feels he has lost hold of his sexual life. Frankly, I am often skeptical of such claims, and my skepticism is often borne out, as together the patient and I come to understand that this feeling of loss of control is an expression of shame, or the breakdown of repression. Such was the case with twenty- three-year-old Joseph, a young man who struggled to overcome repressed desires, and to let them emerge without immediately countering his experience with shame; in that quest he interacted with imagery he found online, and with men he met through an online cruising site. Matters of sexual shame, nonnormative sexual desires, and the necessity of sexual practice were important to consider in relation to this young man.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, a patient’s report of a loss of control can have other meanings. For example, fifty-six-year-old Arthur came to treatment troubled by his experience of repetitive online cruising, which occasionally led to hooking-up but more often left him in a “deadened” state. Arthur’s cruising pattern also included what he described as “a lot of time lost” viewing internet pornography. Analysis of this perseverative pattern opened onto considerations of this patient’s incapacity to be alone, as well as the difficulties he experienced in bringing his subjectivity and desire into intimate relations with others.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003065112470562">
<title>Analytic Listening and Online Potential Space</title>
<p>Listening analytically to how our patients present what motivates them to seek sex and/or sexual fantasy online can open onto a remarkably usable potential space. This online potential space often affords practice of a sexual and relational life that has yet to be fully found or formed. In turn, the analyst is offered a new relational field and potential space in which to practice. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003065112470562">Steven Hartman [2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003065112470562">2012]</xref>, who considers not only cyber potential space, but also contemplates the impact and import of cyberreality as it fashions cyber collective space.)</p>
<p>The very quality that may draw us into cyberspace—the felt anonymity, the room to flex fantastically, the ease of access—also draws us into an intriguing analytic listening experience. Standing with the patient in this space and listening, one has the opportunity to learn about the internal objects that have found their way into the scene. One gets to watch as defenses elbow their way in, or as desires ignite and color the exchange. There is opportunity to observe the work of psychic equivalence as a patient’s psychic reality meets up with the psychic reality of a cyber-partner, often leaving the pair to struggle with material reality if and when it makes its way into the exchange. The analyst, through the time-honored tradition of hovering attention, has the opportunity to hover over the scene, taking note of the excess and the enigma. As we should expect, shame nips at the enigma of sexual fantasy in cyberspace as it does in any sexual scene. Of interest, though, the potential space of cyberspace often affords people the room to challenge sexual shame and even court excess. There is what I think of as the threshold phenomenon: the “send” button. It is relatively easy to push. Here the analyst has the chance to observe the important work of impulse as it sparks desire, or as it may recoil in the face of shame.</p>
<p>As potential space opens online, it opens within the relational field between patient and analyst. Listening within this space at times brings any analytic pair into states that stimulate shame. Or open onto erotic transferences and countertransferences. As with any material, the analyst is left to track, consider, and lean into the congress of transference and countertransference to understand the function of the shame, or the opening created through the desire. Thoughts like these about shame and erotic states are hardly new. In fact, they are commonplace. But shame is often quick to rush into new spaces. This point seems important to consider as more and more often the lives to which we are listening are lived online.</p>

<title>Sex: The Socio-Somato-Psychic Field</title>
<p>It also seems important to pause and ponder our psychoanalytic ideals about sexual well-being and human development—ideas that are in part being formed apace with our new online relational world. Feminists, cultural theorists, and queer theorists have for some time now been detailing a menu of durable intimacies, sexual cultures, and sexual practices that move beyond the picket fence of heterosexual coitus as it was seen to reinforce and reinstate the necessary recognition of sexual difference.</p>
<p>This turn in our ways of knowing began as second-wave feminists started to knock on the psychoanalytic door in the mid 1960s, and continues today as transgendered candidates apply to our institutes. It is important to note here that this shift is still shifting, and we operate now with two predominant epistemologies as we consider gender and sexuality: the first theory is generally referenced as drive theory, while the other has come to be known as relational theory.</p>
<p>Drive theory holds that the gendered and sexed human hinges on a single decisive division (an Archimedean choice-point)—a division that rests on the recognition of sexual difference. The determining recognition of sexual difference is linked with claims regarding psychic origins and well-being: to step outside the division of sexual difference is to step into psychosis. (Consider, for example, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003065112470562">Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel [1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065112470562">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003065112470562">1991]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003065112470562">André Green [1995]</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003065112470562">Juliet Mitchell [1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003065112470562">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003065112470562">2003]</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112470562">Emanuel Berman’s 1998</xref> review of an IPA panel on homosexuality, focusing on the theorizing of Jean Bergeret, Cesar Botella, and Alain Azoubel. In addition, see Judith Butler’s “The End of Sexual Difference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065112470562">2004a</xref>), in which she examines the current debate in France over the parity movement.)</p>
<p>Relational theory, by contrast, posits that the gendered human is constituted within the excess and enigma that is early life. Early biological (including anatomical) and psychological life is lived within a social order that is directed by a persistent binary (based on long-held ideas about sexual difference). Early life, however, is constructed (and deconstructed) through multiple attachments and identifications that unfurl through enigmatic unconscious processes; genders and sexualities develop, therefore, in variable ways (consider here the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112470562">Jessica Benjamin [1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112470562">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112470562">1998]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003065112470562">Nancy Chodorow [1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003065112470562">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065112470562">1994]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065112470562">Muriel Dimen [2003]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003065112470562">Virginia Goldner [2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003065112470562">2011]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003065112470562">Adrienne Harris [2005]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003065112470562">Stephen Mitchell [2003b]</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003065112470562">Ruth Stein [1998a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003065112470562">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003065112470562">2008]</xref>, as well as my own work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003065112470562">Corbett 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065112470562">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065112470562">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065112470562">2011</xref>]).</p>
<p>I believe I am correct in pointing to this drive/relational divide (especially outside of Anglo-American theory and practice), and pointing as well to the fact that the elaboration of the relational model of mind has principally been articulated in a relatively small quarter of psychoanalysis, a guild of small sectors (regarding relational theorizing of sexuality see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112470562">Aron 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112470562">Aron and Starr 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112470562">Benjamin 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112470562">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065112470562">Corbett 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065112470562">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065112470562">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112470562">Davies 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003065112470562">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065112470562">Dimen 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003065112470562">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003065112470562">Dimen and Goldner 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003065112470562">Fairfield 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003065112470562">Goldner 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003065112470562">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003065112470562">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003065112470562">Harris 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003065112470562">Layton 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003065112470562">Mitchell 2003a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003065112470562">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003065112470562">Rozmarin 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003065112470562">Saketopoulou 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003065112470562">Stein 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003065112470562">Suchet 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet I believe also that it is correct to note and emphasize that these ideas now reach into virtually every quarter of psychoanalytic theory and practice. See, for example, how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003065112470562">Françoise Davoine and Jean-Max Gaudillière (2004)</xref> incorporate social theory into their Lacanian-inflected considerations of trauma and history, and in so doing argue for modes of psychotherapeutic care that are outside the dictates of classical technique. Or consider how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003065112470562">Peter Fonagy (2001)</xref> approaches the press of a social world in his theorizing about attachment and sexuality—a theory that is, however, troubled by the failure to problematize the imagination through the social. Or look at Nancy Kulish’s effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003065112470562">2010</xref>) to integrate social and relational concepts into the frame of modern ego psychology as she reviews modern theories of gender. Or consider how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003065112470562">Gillian Straker (2006)</xref> integrates social theory into her contemplation of race and hatred, specifically hate within the transference and countertransference— theorizing that rests mainly on Freudian propositions. Or bear in mind Ed Tronick’s efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003065112470562">2007</xref>) to reflect on parent-child attachments as they are interimplicated with cultural orders. Or how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003065112470562">Daniel Widlöcher (2001)</xref>, in conversation with Jean Laplanche, contemplates the world beyond the parent and infant, and how that world and the history it carries infects every parent, and is in turn enigmatically transferred between every parent and child.</p>
<p>In other words, this drive/relational division, while still important in some schools of psychoanalysis, holds far less traction than it once did. Psychoanalysts, no matter their stripe, have begun to rethink (or, perhaps more correctly, to speak about how they have always thought of) life as a complex socio-somato-psychic field, open to multiple points of reference, normative expectation, and inimitable relational bonds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0003065112470562">
<title>The Perpetual Dynamism That is the Human</title>
<p>The social critique of the normal is now developing developmental theories. Twenty-first-century clinical psychoanalysis arguably has as much to do with feminism, queer theory, and social philosophy as it does with Freudian tenets, postwar British object relations theory, American ego psychology, or even modern attachment models.</p>
<p>Theorists now place the evolving human in an evolving relational world. They do so by leaning into bedrock psychoanalytic presuppositions regarding how fantasy is interimplicated with embodiment and mind. Bodies and minds are seen as open to a range of fantastic expressions and relational dynamics, including traumatic intromissions, as well as nonnormative openings. If one accepts that relational dynamics create varying intersubjective spaces, spaces from and through which humans emerge, and if one accepts further that early parent-child relations are more or less coherent and more or less organizing and loving, then one is left to consider how these relations inflect the manner of the enigmatic transfer of fantasies and attributes between parent and child. Moreover, one must also be open to considering that the evolution of the human is open to a range of relational organizations and coherence.</p>
<p>Further, if one also accepts that the human is never outside social regulation (even before birth, even in resistance), and if it is additionally accepted that humans are formed and constituted by cultural norms, then one is left to question the attribution of what is called “orginary.” There is no pure psychology of the protagonists (mother and child). There is no pure authority of the past. Intromissions, both traumatic and nurturing, are always and already socially and historically constituted, and thereby open to a variety of nuance and complication (even contradiction).</p>
<p>Without a theory that locates such perception and assessment within the constituting frame of the social, we are left with no social demarcation for the clinical scene of address. We are left with a “neutral” analyst who appears as if he magically lives outside the inside, as if he is not regulated by cultural orders and twisted by the drill of the normative. The ethical insufficiency that issues from this lack is that it leaves the therapist inadequately prepared to address countertransference, and to recognize if counterresistance or counteranxiety is being repeated through normative presumption and reactive pathologizing.</p>
<p>At stake here is nothing less than how we measure the well-being of our fellow citizens, up to and including the ways we assess the well-being of their social worlds, including their online social worlds. For example, our modern psychoanalytic and cultural reappraisal of gay life has led us to question the ways we have tethered well-being to the reproduction of matrimonial relations (people should be monogamous husbands or wives, or nonsexual friends). We know (over and over again) that these categories do not capture the ways many people live, and live well enough. To be sure, gay people have more often been the object of sexual scrutiny, and have repeatedly been diagnosed as excessive, enigmatic, and out of step with the guiding symbolic. This prescriptive ethic, however, has failed us repeatedly. It fails us not only as it hinders how we grasp our patients’ desires and subjectivities, but also as it constrains genuine psychoanalytic listening and therapeutic action.</p>
<p>In recognition of that failure, we are beginning to assemble something akin to an archive (as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003065112470562">Foucault [1978]</xref> might have it) that allows us to see how normative regulatory anxiety and paranoia repress not only gay people, but all people. We all benefit from the liberation that follows on countering regulatory anxiety and caustic paranoia. In keeping with our recognition of the excess and enigma that an archive symbolizes, we acknowledge that sexualities unfold in variable ways—the kind of variety that might make life worth living.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003065112470562">
<title>Online Relations: Listen or Diagnose?</title>
<p>Courtly efforts to chaperone the push and pull of desire have failed as often as our efforts to corral sex through prescriptive ethics. Romeo scaled the wall to Juliet’s chamber. Today he might friend her on Facebook. We know that we don’t necessarily meet only in person, at dinners arranged by friends, at social events, or even in bars. We meet now, and often, online. Here too we are confronted with a new social order. Our lives are inextricably woven by modern technologies: mobile phones, computers, the internet, tweets, virtual environs, and robots, to name but a few. Building picket fences these days may have less to do with wood and nails, and more to do with a series of binary codes, a set of simple information-processing moves, that any nine-year-old can set in play to build her house in the virtual world of Second Life.</p>
<p>Confronted with these changes, changes that are happening daily, our approach has often been diagnostic. Consider here the debate now under way as to whether to include excessive use of the internet as an addiction in the DSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003065112470562">Urbina 2012</xref>). In my view, though, it is perhaps too easy to speak in diagnostic/normative tones of addictions, instant connections, cyberdissociation, and identity diffusion. We are all of us more complex than the diagnostic vocabulary employed in our efforts to understand our patients as they live various lives variously, and live those lives now with and through modern technologies. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the frequent employment of this diagnostic discourse in speaking about our patients’ online lives is a mark of regulatory anxiety, an anxiety that promotes and perpetuates shame and fear in the face of our rapidly changing social world.</p>
<p>Static norms are frequently given voice through diagnostic discourse. Such a discourse impedes our capacity to appreciate variance, to reflect justly, and to respond with empathy, even pleasure. We are called on daily to better appreciate the perpetual dynamism that is the human. We are called on daily to better appreciate the perpetual dynamism that is our wired world. It is not difficult to appreciate the need for constancy in the midst of so much change. At the same time, one might argue that a more robust constancy is found in theorizing that affords complexity, even contradiction.</p>
<p>For example, do we move too quickly to defend the “real” of interpersonal exchange as opposed to what is most often called the “virtual” that occurs in technological exchange? And if we move too quickly to separate the interpersonal and the virtual might we also lose hold of the fantastic potential of psychic equivalence—the potential of psychic reality as it blends and bends material reality? Or do we privilege the so-called real in such a way as to overlook and devalue the relationality our patients are constructing with and through modern technologies?</p>
<p>As I see it, we need to craft deeper understandings of relations, identities, fantasies, and self-states that live in the potential spaces that open within cyberspace. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003065112470562">Sherry Turkle (2011)</xref>—arguably the doyenne of psychology and digital culture—has recently suggested, “I once described the computer as a second self, a mirror of the mind. Now that metaphor no longer goes far enough. Our new devices provide space for the emergence of a new state of the self, itself split between screen and the psychical real, wired through technology” (p. 16). Turkle’s proposition bears a striking resemblance to theories that seek to account for the fluid and varied constitution of human subjectivities and embodiments. One is mindful here of Philip Bromberg’s charge to “stand between the spaces” of self states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065112470562">2001</xref>) or Judith Butler’s challenge (2004, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065112470562">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003065112470562">2006</xref>) to consider the ways in which human life, and the very definition of life, is dependent on a variety of social forces, epistemological frames, and hierarchies. How do these self-states circulate? How do these normative hierarchies instantiate? How do we now chart such movement within the potential spaces that open online?</p>
<p>So it is with these thoughts that I turn to my two patients in an effort to think about the worlds they inhabit, the desires that constitute their worlds, and the ways in which desire is always knit with the complicated congress of fantasy, attachment, relationality, and normative regulation.</p>

<title>Arthur</title>
<p>I begin with Arthur, who initially called seeking treatment for what he believed was depression. He was concerned about the trouble he was experiencing at work (sustaining his attention and his desire to work). This concern was coupled with his fear that he was becoming increasingly isolated socially. Very soon into our first consult, Arthur told me that about a year before our meeting, his lover of the past nine years had died suddenly. Arthur explained that Jim, his lover, had died while on a business trip. He suffered a brain aneurysm, collapsed in a parking garage, and was found dead two hours later. Arthur said he “had to fight the feeling that Jim’s death was a violent explosion.” He went on to say that the thought of Jim “falling onto and bleeding-out on cold concrete” was more than he could bear. He began to weep and soon was sobbing, an anguished state that would return over and over again in the first year of our work. At a point of relative calm in that first hour, I found myself reflecting on how Arthur had spoken about “explosion[s]” and “bleeding-out,” and how the consult bore the feeling of a torrent or flood.</p>
<p>Jim’s death was further complicated for Arthur in two ways. First, he inherited a considerable amount of money, which, as we were to learn, echoed his experience of his mother’s death about a decade before Jim’s. Second, once again echoing his relationship with his mother, Arthur had begun to have increasing doubts about his relationship with Jim; the passion of their early years had waned, and Arthur grew increasingly anxious that the relationship would “die.” At the time of Jim’s death, Arthur thought Jim might have been considering a separation. There is much I could say about the web of melancholia that gripped Arthur, and the ways in which it hindered his ability to mourn. But here I focus on one dimension.</p>
<p>Very soon into the treatment, Arthur told me he had been spending a lot of time online, cruising pornography sites and sex websites where he would occasionally hook up with men he met there. He spoke of this behavior as “compulsive” and further indicated that it was frequently accompanied by smoking marijuana, which he also believed to be compulsive. With time he was better able to speak about these experiences, and how they ranged from what he described as “mundane getting off” to the occasional encounter in which he felt alive, desired, and desirable. At first I heard these stories, or what we might think of as relational bids (however fleeting, however impersonal) as Arthur’s effort to get out from under the shadow of melancholia. I worked with him toward examining both the darker pull of his guilt and sorrow over Jim’s death, but also the sensual and generative desire for another, what we might think of as the generative push of melancholia. We employed his descriptions of these encounters toward a deeper encounter with innerness—an innerness that spoke of possibility, not only of guilt and abjection.</p>
<p>But as we moved toward a deeper understanding of Arthur’s desire and wish to be desired by others, we began as well to grasp what was “compulsive” about these relations. Key here was how we were able to link the compulsive grip of his cruising with his incapacity to be alone. Paradoxically, while he initially reported his concern about social isolation, as I listened to his account of his life, it was indeed rare that he was alone or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003065112470562">Winnicott (1958)</xref> might have it, alone in the presence of another. Similarly, our sessions were packed full with affect and narration. There could be no silence without considerable agitation. As I was to learn over time, this tension mimicked Arthur’s early bond with his mother, an anxious young woman who could not tolerate being alone, and moved repeatedly to hasty and repetitive acts of instinctual gratification that often involved Arthur: cookies, candies, cuddling, caressing, clutching.</p>
<p>Arthur had never had the opportunity to build or come to believe in a benign quiet environment (one that could be as much ego as it was id—one that could be as much quiet as it was candy). Moreover, he had been hindered in his capacity to grapple with a relational and erotic life that could bear the waning of passion. Or to bear the slippage of love, as it inevitably suffers injury and neglect—injury and neglect that can attenuate and devastate dependency and passion. Yes, his melancholia was specific to the loss of Jim, but it also ran deep, keeping him from the possibilities born of renewal and ego-relatedness as one builds and rebuilds lasting passionate relationships.</p>
<p>His largely anonymous and impersonal online hook-ups did not test this relational complication. Arthur did, however, meet a young man online whom he began to date. Rather quickly, though, we could see the repetition of his anxious reach, and how he behaved toward this young man in a manner similar to the way he had behaved with Jim. Arthur assumed a position similar to that of his mother via anxious attachment, on red alert for any ambivalence, for any complex or contradictory moment that had to be quickly filled and solved through compulsive acts of repair that in turn came to feel burdensome and deadening. This relationship soon came undone, and was referred to by Arthur as his “rebound.”</p>
<p>That rebound rebounded as well in the transference, and it helped shed greater light on Arthur’s anxious attachment to me, which proved in my view to be a pivotal moment in this multifaceted treatment. Arthur’s short-lived relationship unfolded during a time when I was frequently away from my office. I noted how Arthur was generally eager to smooth over the disruption of my schedule. It was “no problem”—a sentiment that repeated the tenor of compulsive repair. My efforts to comment on this dynamic did not get us very far. But we were able to double-back around to Arthur’s efforts to reassure me as he sought to understand his increasing feeling of being “tired” in our sessions. In a manner that intrigued me, I did not join Arthur in his fatigue, as is sometimes the case with a sleepy patient; instead I grew somewhat agitated, perhaps even anxious. In setting about to examine this dynamic of fatigue and agitation, we were able to see how frightened Arthur was to feel any ambivalence, let alone anger, where I was concerned. We were able to see how anxious he was about the elasticity of our bond. And we were also able to work through the ways in which the very elasticity and durability of our bond was dependent on the expression and analysis of a wide range of feelings, a wide range of self-states, a wide range of desires.</p>
<p>We moved toward examining how such durability is necessary in order to trust being alone in the presence of another. One day during this phase of our work, I noted to my surprise that I had slipped into a reverie, one that was brief and, frankly, not especially enlightening. But it was the simple fact of that reverie, and the way I could enter what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003065112470562">Ferro (1992)</xref> speaks of as the “analyst’s private space” within the bi-personal field, that drew my attention to the fact I was not so dominated by the anxious need to monitor Arthur. I did not bring this reflection forward; rather I leaned into it in an effort to see if perhaps the tenor and pace of our exchange had changed. Such shifts in an analysis are rarely dramatic. But I did note that Arthur had begun to express himself in a less halting manner; he seemed to be looking for fewer cues from me as to what he might say or feel, and there also seemed to be greater freedom in the flow of his associations. Perhaps most significant, there could now be periods of quiet reflection that did not crackle with the push to narrate.</p>
<p>I noted something similar regarding how Arthur began to report his online life. He spoke of online cruising less often. When I questioned him about this apparent shift, he reported that he still checked in with the sites now and again, that he chatted with friends he had met in the virtual commons or collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003065112470562">Hartman 2012</xref>). Arthur even met some here and there, but he explained that “the press,” as he put it, was “less pressing.” He seemed almost surprised to describe this shift, as though it had happened outside his awareness. He came back to my question about his cruising pattern almost a month later, indicating that he had been pondering this apparent shift, and reporting as well that he had not bought any marijuana in some time. He said nothing more about it at that point, and I thought it best to let him lead.</p>
<p>In the enigmatic and intriguing ways in which analyses move forward, Arthur did not soon return to this theme per se, but we did then enter into a long period in the treatment in which he reported and lived out states of depression and anguish, states and thoughts that often began with reflections on his relationship with Jim but moved to broader themes of loss and lost opportunities that followed on Arthur’s manner of anxious attachment.</p>
<p>During this phase I was away for a few days, and Arthur, who presumed I was on beach vacation (in fact, I was <italic>freezing</italic> teaching at the University of Michigan), expressed his anger and jealousy, saying that he questioned whether I could understand his grief and loneliness. I took that as a good sign, and said so, indicating that perhaps his anger was an effective way to help me understand.</p>
<p>Indeed, our work moved toward its final phase as we sought to better understand the thread of melancholia as it knit with his pattern of insecure attachment. But of interest to me, in the final year of our work together, and perhaps illustrating how just about anything can be found online, from repetition to renewal, Arthur formed a relationship with a man he met online, a mature fellow, and together they forged what seems to be a promising bond, one that has lived beyond the heat of what Arthur jokingly called “introductory hook-up passion,” and offered the promise of a more complex and less anxious network of attachment.</p>

<sec id="section6-0003065112470562">
<title>Joseph</title>
<p>In contrast with Arthur, twenty-three-year-old Joseph came into treatment at a very different point in his life. A colossally bright graduate student, Joseph complained in the first hour that he was “all brain, no body.” He lamented his lack of sexual experience and painfully questioned his desirability. He was the middle child of three brothers, the oldest of whom was held forward as stolid and handsome, married, and the father of an “adorable” young daughter (as Joseph sardonically intoned, “Can you believe they call her Sunshine? And then can you believe that I understand why?”). The younger brother was seen as less bright than either Joseph or his older brother, but more lovable, and was at that time living with his college boyfriend. Joseph stood alone, out of the sun, “testy” and unwanted.</p>
<p>Yet right from the start I found him rather charming and funny, and I venture it is that countertransference response that held us as we began what was a very painful early period of analysis. In this difficult opening phase, Joseph was left to contemplate the way he set himself up to be unwanted, and how his “testy” position served as a defense against his doubts regarding his desirability, his capacity to love another, and his ability to provide another with sexual satisfaction.</p>
<p>One day, well over a year into our work, Joseph indicated that he had a “confession” to make; he had joined an online cruising site. He spoke of how intrigued and disgusted he was by how the men on the site so openly advertised their sexual wishes. He contemptuously spoke of how “these dudes provide a laundry list of sexual practices and explicit pictures of their bodies and body parts.” I did not say much at this point, aware of how difficult it was for him to speak of sex at all. I wondered about his use of the word “confession,” to which he replied, “Yeah, I know, I know.” I asked in return, “You know?” After a pause, he said in a tone of abjection and disgust, “I know I am fucked up, and I know that you know I am fucked up.” I replied by speaking to what seemed to be his experience of injury, and how quickly that injury got linked with hierarchy, adding how shaming that might feel (aiming at this point in the treatment to reflect on his transference to me as the older brother). He remained silent for much of the rest of the hour.</p>
<p>It was some time before he came back to talking about his experience on this website. When he spoke of desire, it was often about his longing for this or that young man who he thought was out of his reach. Or this or that young man who expressed some desire for Joseph, but for whom he felt no interest. Once again he was reflecting his position of standing alone, wanting and unwanted. To this point, I offered interpretations as gently as I could, but they were most often met with a paradoxically confirming yet quick dismissal. In other words, they were unwanted.</p>
<p>Several months later, Joseph returned to talking about his experience on the sex website. The hour began with his entering my office, and as he walked in I noted a wry grin emerge on his face. As he settled his lanky self on the couch, I asked, “The grin?” He laughed, and there was a pause. He said, “Oh, no, are you actually going to make me say it?” I did not respond, because frankly I was confused. Eventually he said, “Dude, those shoes are sick!” I laughed, and a long silence followed. Eventually Joseph, again in confession mode, told me that when he first came to see me, he Googled me in an effort to find out how old I was. I pondered this effort, and finally said, “Hmm. Do you think you were trying to figure out if I was young enough to know that ‘Dude, those shoes are sick!’ is a compliment?” Joseph laughed, and said he supposed that was right. Then he said, “I mostly try to not look at you, or see you.” To which I replied, “Some constraint—yes?—about looking, being seen, maybe wanting to look.” This comment was met by silence, and Joseph then forged ahead to discuss some difficulty he was having writing a paper for one of his courses. At one point something he said led me to say, “Holding back, holding back on seeing, corralling your perceptions and feelings” (which I knew to be quite keen).</p>
<p>Joseph said, “Yeah, yeah.” And it was at this moment that he turned again to his experience on sex websites. He had a long history of playing computer games, and even worked on a team that designed a game while he was in college. It was a world in which he excelled, and a world, much to his anger and chagrin, that his parents had often forbade him to enter during his early adolescence. He described finding a pornography website that depicted computer animated characters having sex. He also described feeling turned on by the videos, and simultaneously feeling ashamed of his response. I encouraged him to say more, and eventually he described the ways in which he identified with the animated characters: “They are oddly coordinated, or uncoordinated—jerky, almost. The technology is not very sophisticated.” He was quick to add that he did not identify with the characters: “They are buff beyond buff, gruff beyond gruff, and hard beyond hard.” He went on: “I guess, though, I can somehow put myself in their place.” He spoke about himself as uncoordinated, a sense of himself that during his adolescence had been particularly hurtful. He also went ahead to elaborate on his feeling that he was so often preoccupied with his ability to perform sexually that he lost sight of the other: “I can’t see them because I can only think that I am failing.”</p>
<p>The following day he entered the room and immediately said he was pleased to see I was wearing “normal” shoes. We both laughed. But then he fell silent for some time. When I inquired about the shift in our exchange, he eventually said he felt humiliated “by” me. I replied “Humiliated?” intoning my unmediated injury. He said, “Not by you—you know, the good you. But dude, yesterday I saw this poster for an upcoming lecture you’re giving at [his university]; the title was “Fantastic Phallicism,” and there is this blond kid in a Superman costume. Great, there is my shrink, the brain dick!” There was a pause. For one thing, I was unaware of the poster; for another, I was aware of how often I felt inadequate in relation to Joseph’s remarkable mind. And yet I thought this “accusation” was likely a good move, and it seemed best not to disturb it. Joseph, though, became immediately self-conscious and apologetic—in a way undoing his spontaneous aggression. When I pointed that out, he began, to my surprise, to speak for the first time about a series of recent anonymous sexual encounters. He indicated that he would meet men online, “fuck them, and then leave them.” Joseph took pains to clarify that he did not think of these sexual encounters as necessarily intimate. Rather, these trysts were marked by a kind of sensualist luxury and conquest; he could feel, he could act, he could exhibit himself with little to no knowledge of the other. He was not beholden to their needs, or to their desires. He was not labored by any intimate knowledge. He said, “I’m a total dick, and I’m way into it.”</p>
<p>He then indicated that he was worried about what I would think of him. Yet he also harbored the idea that I would be proud of him. I found myself pondering the ways in which Joseph seemed to be looking to me to join him through pride. Was I to be proud of his willful ignorance of the other, of the other’s desires and personhood? Was I to be proud of him as the “<italic>no</italic> brain dick”? Or was I to feel pride at his capacity to find men who wished to surrender to his desire, perhaps even express their own desire through the passion of veneration? Was I to be proud of the manner in which he was expressing and practicing his desire to penetrate others, enter them, and expand into them? Was I to be proud of his animated robotic hardness? No matter, I was to find my way to this pride consequent on my joy in the face of his narcissistic expansion.</p>
<p>I thought about the role of his anxiety as it may impede his capacity to bring such passion into more intimate relationships. Was he describing how he could not see the other, because if he did he could only see himself as failing, in line with what he had said just the day before? What had become of the humiliation of which he spoke at the beginning of the hour? Was this shift a kind of defensive phallic posturing? (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065112470562">Corbett 2009</xref>). I wondered, however, whether these questions were something of a dodge; wasn’t he bringing this passion into our relationship, asking me to watch, to take it, even if he was not yet ready to see me?</p>
<p>I thought about how easily one can get pulled toward policing patients’ sexual lives, and what we might think of as the sex-panic counter-transference conundrum—how the analyst reflexively and anxiously moves toward the instantiation of regulatory norms that speak the analyst’s moral authority, which in turn serves to control erotic and aggressive impulses, both the patient’s and one’s own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065112470562">Corbett 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065112470562">Dimen 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>I thought as well about how little opportunity Joseph had had to elaborate, enact, and practice fantastic phallic states (to be a boy in a Superman costume), and to learn what is gained and what is lost through these dynamics. Psychoanalysts have not managed to create much in the way of potential space to imagine the fantastic phallic body, including the penis. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere (2009), the penis is always a materialization that is dictated by fantastic readings and measurements. But we have not advanced very far in understanding the dynamics of phallic aggression and sexual arousal.</p>
<p>Instead we are currently dominated by a kind of phallophobia that casts men and boys as aggressive, nonmutual, bad, dominating, failed social beings. There are plentiful reasons to be concerned about men and their failed attachments, their egregious narcissism, their trigger-happy violence. But might there also be a positive valence to the aggression we so quickly condemn? For example, how might we consider the pleasures of phallic narcissism for subject and object alike, including the paradoxical manner in which as narcissism opens out it both expands and excludes the other? What about the hope and dread of the erection, phallic endurance, and the theater of ejaculation? How might we think about the expansion (the erection) of phallic activity and the penetration of another? Is such penetrating activity the temporary losing hold of the self as one folds into another, or is such activity a matter of losing hold of the other as one expands into and through the other (shatters in the other), or is such activity held in tension by mutual recognition, or is such activity a welcome retreat from mutuality, or is such activity an ever shifting series of experiences and states, perhaps an ever shifting series of dissociated flashes flickering through the heat of sexual passion?</p>
<p>I did not, however, at this juncture with Joseph bring any of these thoughts forward. It seemed premature. It seemed best to trust that such thoughts and feeling states would find their way into our work with time (as in fact they did). I thought it best at this point to listen to his experience, however confusing, however narcissistic, however clumsily aggressive.</p>
<p>I thought it best to sit for a while with Joseph’s experience of practice, and to contemplate as I have with both Arthur and Joseph how online hook-ups afford many things, but one might be a potential space for practice of a sexual and relational life that has yet to be fully found or formed. And to consider, as well, that unless and until we open our ears to the range of subject positions found online, along with the variegated culture and the virtual commons within which our twenty-first-century patients live, that new world, that new patient, will not enter our consulting rooms.</p>
