<p>Sometimes, the greatest innovations in knowledge take place at the margins rather than the center of disciplines. The center may have come into being precisely because some earlier innovation has established it as such, but not necessarily because great innovations are taking place there still. But it serves as a center of gravity in a discipline, and conveys to a broad audience the sense that it should be regarded as important. When it functions <italic>only</italic> as such, namely as pure performance, more intended to legitimize ritual reiteration of long-known ideas than to encourage transcending them, the center becomes an obstacle rather than an aid to new knowledge.</p>
<p>Sociology is one of those disciplines that may be said to no longer have a clear center of gravity as a whole, even though the sub-disciplines have their own central paradigms in place, and those are expected to be duly referenced by all young apprentices seeking admission to the guild. In some sense that seems almost unavoidable in normal educational processes, although it is also clear that ritualism and conservatism are likely outcomes of this kind of education. On the other hand, innovation itself sometimes requires that conservative grounding. After all, one usual prerequisite for changing a paradigm is familiarity with how it works, what it does, and what it claims to explain.</p>
<p>But there is another source of innovation that sociologists have in abundance: a virtually endless supply of the objects of their science, usually all around them. The social world itself provides an unceasing supply of events, transformations, surprises, complex encounters, and ‘crises’ that constantly generate opportunities for innovation. The extent to which we make use of these opportunities may be inversely related to the extent to which we are beholden to customary habits, ready theoretical recipes, and familiar terminologies.</p>
<p>For example, the series of spectacular revolutions in the Arab World, whose dynamics are still unfolding, have not yet generated any substantively new sociological knowledge, even though they have brought down some tyrannies and introduced in their place fascinating dynamic and fluid environments, whose exact nature is not yet clearly understood. Unfortunately, I often observe that instead of seeing this great historical transformation as an invitation to new knowledge, many sociologists prefer to substitute for this potential knowledge something they already know – which may of course be valuable, though not very relevant to the situation at hand. For example, some sociologists, totally fixated on ‘neoliberalism’ – increasingly used as little more than an obligatory ritual reference to all evil – do not see it to not having been effectively challenged in the Arab Spring, and <italic>therefore</italic> they see nothing new in some of the greatest events in modern history.</p>
<p>Ways of thinking as these may appear as meaningful ‘judgments’, even as sufficient ‘explanations’, even though they do no more than superimpose on a social reality a terminology that few inhabitants of that reality actually use. But significant breakthroughs in sociological knowledge have never emerged out of such ritualism. Rather, one common venue of innovation, or at least new ideas, has been associated with a sociologist somewhere actually listening to some ordinary people, and then tried to see how the way they themselves understood their world had something to say to sociology itself.</p>
<p>Along these lines I would like to highlight two particular reviews in this issue, not necessarily because I agree with them, but because they seem to describe projects that are attentive to this often ignored dialectic of sociological knowledge. Carsten Hermann-Pillath’s review of Xiangqun Chang’s work on reciprocity and social creativity in a Chinese village, and Vedad Muharemović’s review of Ivo Komšić’s theoretical work that has apparently been informed by the war in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995. Whatever might be the merits of these contributions, they seem to signify rooted theoretical experimentation, where encountered social reality suggests <italic>in its way</italic> the need to develop or amend our terms, at least for the time being and until the next event or encounter. It is my hope that we see more of these rooted theoretical experimentations in future issues. After all, such experiments, both in thought and in practice, are how a science lives on as a science <italic>of</italic> the world, rather than as a set of ritualistic (though for their practitioners self-sufficient) terminological practices.</p>
