<p>We would like to thank the Journal of Applied Gerontology for the opportunity and space to respond to the interesting points raised by Cosco, Blossom, and Brayne in response to our article “Aging Populations’ Everyday Life Perspectives on Healthy Aging: New Insights for Policy and Strategies at the Local Level.” This article reports on a study that investigated how aging individuals experience healthy aging in their locality to strengthen interventions on healthy aging. One of the main conclusions of this study was that there is a mismatch between the way older individuals perceive healthy aging and the way healthy aging interventions are designed. Older people perceive health within the context of everyday life whereas health professionals address health themes as isolated topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464813481561">Naaldenberg, Vaandrager Koelen, &amp; Leeuwis, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The commentary by Cosco et al. raises important issues with regard to the ambiguity and lack of consensus in the labeling of positive states of aging and, consequently, the impeded ability to compare cross-study results.</p>
<p>First, we would like to offer our views on the ambiguity of definitions of healthy aging. Cosco et al. correctly state that the ease of labeling the presence of disease stands in stark contrast with the ambiguity in labeling positive states of aging. This very issue can also be found in the definition of health in general. In 1948, the WHO defined health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, more than the absence of disease alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464813481561">WHO, 2006</xref>). However, criticism of this definition is intensifying, especially in the context of aging since a state of complete well-being would declare people with chronic diseases or disabilities ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464813481561">Huber et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464813481561">Huber et al. (2011)</xref> voice the need for reformulation of the definition of health and also stress the fact that the definition of health determines the outcome measures used in prevention and health care. In our opinion, this last point is essential when defining positive states of aging in the field of applied gerontology. Defining positive states of aging within the currently dominant biomedical model, similar to the labeling of diseases, decreases the voice of older people themselves in health and care issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464813481561">Powell, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464813481561">Bowling and Diepe (2005)</xref> stress in their paper on the definition of successful aging, lay perspectives are important for assessing the validity of existing models and measures since there is little point in utilizing current models or developing new ones if older people do not regard them as relevant. Moreover, as our study has shown, the views of older people in many aspects deviate from the views of researchers, policymakers and other professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464813481561">Naaldenberg et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, we strongly agree with Cosco in that a more parsimonious definition of positive states of aging is required and that such a definition will benefit scientific progress in the field. However, in line with recent discussions on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464813481561">Huber et al., 2011</xref>) and discussions by Bowling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464813481561">Bowling &amp; Dieppe, 2005</xref>), we would urge a definition that includes (bio)medical aspects as well as social, psychological, ecological and lay perspectives. The discussion by Huber (2011) concludes that a new definition of health requires much effort, with their preferred view on health being <italic>the ability to adapt and to self manage in the physical, mental and social domain</italic>. This view as well as their call for a more <italic>dynamic formulation</italic> could be a great inspiration to reach a better definition in the field of aging as well (p. 3).</p>
<p>Second, we would like to address the point Cosco et al. make with regard to producing results only relevant within the context of the original study. They state that this is a waste of resources and is impeding collaboration. We are not sure whether Cosco et al. at this point refer to niche definitions for positive states of aging used across studies or to the fact that some studies (as our paper they responded to was) apply qualitative methods. Qualitative methods are often seen as nongeneralizable and specific to a particular context. We would like to address both issues briefly.</p>
<p>Lay perspectives on aging inevitably encompass experiences within the context of older peoples’ everyday lives. Such perspectives are hard to capture using quantitative methods alone and require a broader methodological base. Qualitative studies are one way to capture older people’s everyday contexts, but recent developments offer researchers many more comprehensive and rigorous approaches as well. Examples include mixed methods approaches in which the strengths of both qualitative (words) and quantitative (numbers) methods are combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464813481561">Creswell &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, quantitative findings can be compared using systematic reviews or meta analyses. For qualitative studies, similar methods are being developed that allow investigators to compare findings across cultures, generations and contexts. The paper on thematic synthesis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464813481561">Thomas and Harden (2008)</xref> offers an elaborate discussion and example of this approach. Such thematic analyses could also be used to gain better insight in the many operationalizations of healthy aging currently used, as well as improved empirical measurement. Such a study would be a major contribution to the goal of a more parsimonious definition of positive aging as discussed by Cosco et al.</p>
