<italic>Brazilian Immigration and the Quest for Identity</italic> analyzes the process of adaptation and integration of young Brazilian immigrants to American society. The book begins with a brief overview of the emigration patterns from Brazil, which had historically been a destination for migrants from all over the world. However, from the 1980s this trend reversed, and now the country that has received the largest number of Brazilians is the United States. One of the most popular destinations has been New England, where many Brazilian communities have developed. This book focuses on young immigrants, either born in the United States, or emigrated before the age of 11, living in the Boston area, as it hosts the largest of these communities.</p>
<p>The first main research topic that Catarina Fritz investigates is how the lack of documentation affects the life chances, in terms of higher education and work perspectives, of the respondents. The second topic concerns the process of adaptation from a racially fluid society to a society with rigid racial categorization, and how this adaptation influences their assimilation in the United States.</p>
<p>A total of fifty-three second-generation Brazilians from the Boston area, recruited through a snow-ball purposive sample, participated in the study. Through detailed semi-structured in-depth interviews, Fritz gives the reader the possibility to enter the lives of the respondents, with a particular focus on their personal experiences and expectations regarding race, ethnic identification, education, and work. The case studies have different characteristics, in terms of legal status, SES, area of residence, race, and ethnicity, thus representing a very diverse group.</p>
<p>The importance of the topic, the well-structured research design, and the pleasant narrative style make this book useful and interesting for all social science scholars, policy makers, social science students at both graduate and undergraduate level, as well as for the lay public.</p>
