<p>Representation of social life is an art and a science, both inevitably involving politics in every sense of the word. Anthropology’s anxiety for objectivity is thus fraught with contradiction where the words of the object (respondent) are contextualised in its social location while the words of the subject (anthropologist) remain unproblematised, unless one takes a clear standpoint approach where location of knowledge-production is explicitly acknowledged.</p>
<p>This collection of essays by ‘Western’ scholars takes self-representations of Himalayan society by people of the region as its object of study. The editors centralise the importance of distanciation drawing from Levi-Strauss, Durkheim and Weber in support of an ‘etic’ representation. The introduction highlights the ‘political’ nature of knowledge about Himalayan society produced by Nepali elite which, in recent decades, is claiming the right to represent ‘itself’. They rightly criticise the emergence in Nepal of an ‘ethnic “dictatorship” (that) gives rise to a new type of scholar, whose task is not to understand reality but to judge it’ (p. 9). Unfortunately, this critical review of ‘political’ insider narratives is completely silent on politics of the ‘other’ that it creates—the Western/outsider academic. Recognition of colonial power relations in Himalayan anthropology and neo-colonial relations within knowledge circuits is absent. Writing in English, recognition from ‘Western’ academic institutions, publishing in journals with a clear and narrow Western audience, the politics of citation which allows circulation among a small networked academic community are all well recognised aspects of our academic world. The response of the editors to Nepali critiques belies recognition of this standpoint.</p>
<p>This book is about identities and representations <italic>in</italic> the Himalaya as well as a commentary on representations <italic>of</italic> the Himalaya. Nepal (focus of all except three essays) is a particularly appropriate case since it did not, till recently, have an indigenous intelligentsia who could compete with ‘outside’ anthropologists for representing the society of Nepal. In responding to this competing representation, many essays point out the politicised nature of representation by local auteurs and their elite composition, which denies the layperson the right to represent himself/herself. They also suggest that non-elite sections may actually prefer the occidental anthropologists’ representation to a more proximate elite who now seek to represent them. While this is a useful critique of native representations, it would have had added value if the same lens was used to compare it to academic representations. Lack of self-reflexivity is particularly unfortunate in the case of Nepal, since the plethora of anthropological work from 1950s to 1990s completely failed to see the tremendous social churning that led to revolution and transformation of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one of the authors, Pfaff-Czarnecka, highlights how harmony rather than conflict predominate both official and (foreign) scholarly discourse on Nepal before 1990. While recognising this bias in anthropological representation, she seems satisfied in laying the blame on authorities who actively discouraged scholarly hints at potential social conflicts (p. 139) or on mere oversight of researchers (p. 148). Ideological gazes, the politics of foreign aid, geopolitical interests of research, the attractive ‘virgin’ ground that Nepal provided to anthropologists with little contestation from native representations are perhaps worth discussing in this context.</p>
<p>Moving beyond this framing, this book is an informative collection of essays on emerging debates on ethnicity and indigenous nationalities in modern Nepal. Four chapters in this book provide nuanced theoretical frameworks to understand ethnic discourse and identity, drawing from debates in the broader South Asia literature. Unfortunately, chapters within the book do not engage with each other. Lack of clear boundaries in defining ethnic groups, construction of new identities and multiplicity of identities appear surprising to some authors in this collection while they are anticipated and analysed by others.</p>
<p>In understanding ethnic and indigenous assertion, the ‘constructivist’ approach has emerged as the dominant one in anthropology. But all too often:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the ‘invention of tradition’ social constructionist approach produces elaborate historical analyses of how a certain ‘identity’ is created, maintained, or transformed without ever questioning the very concept, the meaning of ‘identity’… Too often, all we are offered is yet another discussion of elite manipulations in resource competition between groups who apparently have miraculously emerged out of nowhere (but have always existed)… (p. 285)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote by Martjin Van Beek could well apply to many earlier essays in this collection. His essay focuses on the ‘art’ of representation and shows how identity (‘Ladhakiness’) does not exist as a stable or uniform set of characteristics, forms, idioms or practices. This fluidity and multiplicity of identities may nevertheless coalesce into specific forms in specific contexts.</p>
<p>Gil Daryn traces the complexity of defining <italic>Bahuns</italic> as an ethnic group in spite of strong ethnicity-like processes at play and recommends abandoning the idea of a bounded and clearly marked ‘ethnic group’, and instead focusing on ethnic processes. Ben Campbell’s ethno-ecological approach moves the focus away from identities formed in contrast to other social groups, to conflicts generated through different understandings of the nature/society dichotomy. Campbell argues that Tamang notions of human selfhood are not radically separated off from those of other species. The set of discourses he uses as substantiation, however, is open to alternate interpretation and does not substantiate the authors’ claims. Nonetheless, the essay brings out the relationship between the perceptual and the effective environment and the rupture caused by conservation policies that fail to account for environmental selfhoods. Martin Sokefeld discusses identities in Gilgit, Pakistan through ideas of difference, multiplicity and intersectionality. He emphasises that multiplicity of identities is not unique to the South Asian context and that identities are often employed as strategies. Even essentialism, while unacceptable in anthropological discourse, remains a powerful topos in the discourse of difference. The other chapters would have benefited from an engagement with the discussions in these four chapters.</p>
<p>David Gellner provides a detailed discussion of the paradoxes of Newar identity, the internal contradictions of Newari activism and the engagement between caste and Newarness. He evaluates Nepal against an ideal-typical definition of multiculturalism and concludes that Nepal is a hierarchical society where this idea may not fit well. Perhaps engaging with discourse and practice of multiculturalism that has come under much stress post 9/11 in Europe, may be more productive in understanding Nepal as well as multiculturalism. He also claims that activists’ definitions and constructions of identity are imposed on others, denying the latter the same choice the activists had. One wonders if this is really a unique case. Is every ‘imagined community’ not created through a degree of homogenisation engendered by elite who always have a greater role in imagining community?</p>
<p>Shile’s comments on Berg’s essay on religious celebration suggest that collective ritual participation may be more significant for community membership rather than identity, the two being related but not the same. Joanne Moller’s insider/outsider binary to understand how Uttarakhandis construct their social world is simplistic as noted by the commentator. Moreover, it ignores the considerable literature on the region, <italic>pahari</italic>/non-<italic>pahari</italic> interaction and struggles for state formation. Michael Hutt’s ‘Reading Sumnima’ reads the novel as evidence of construction of indigenous ‘other’ by a Nepali Brahmin politician as an inversion of the ‘self’.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a useful book to understand contemporary Nepali society as well as the politics of representation in Anthropology. On the former, it provides ethnographic detail that is new and fascinating as it captures a society that is rapidly transforming. On the latter, there is enough divergence of perspective among the chapters within the book to make for an engaging debate.</p>
