<p>While solidifying class inequalities on a transnational basis, corporate globalization often disrupts power regimes locally. Such disruptions can generate site-specific contention across social differences that solidify the physical marginalization or exclusion of less powerful groups at the local level. In the United States one form of local contention that results from corporate globalization is strong, organized opposition to the presence of marginalized and vulnerable immigrant populations. This article focuses upon NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard) encountered in two cases where community organizations sought to create spaces and services for immigrants. The first section provides a multidimensional analytical framework centered around the concept of boundary contention.

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>La mondialisation des entreprises ne fait pas que renforcer les inégalités sociales: elle perturbe souvent aussi les rapports de force au niveau local. De telles perturbations peuvent engendrer des conflits spécifiques à un lieu autour des écarts sociaux, renforçant la marginalisation physique, voire l’exclusion des groupes les plus faibles au niveau local. Aux Etats-Unis, les conflits locaux engendrés par la mondialisation des entreprises prennent, entre autres, la forme d’une opposition vigoureuse et organisée à la présence de populations immigrées vulnérables et marginalisées. Cette communication se concentre sur deux cas de NIMBYisme (Not In My Back Yard, autrement dit Pas Dans Mon Jardin) auquel se sont heurté des organisations communautaires qui tentaient de créer des espaces et des services pour les immigrés. La première partie offre un cadre analytique multi-dimensionnel centré autour du concept de conflit frontalier. La deuxième partie présente l’approche méthodologique vis-à-vis de l’effort collaboratif. La troisième partie tire les leçons du développement de pratiques stratégiques permettant d’aider les organisations à renverser la dynamique débilitante de la mondialisation des entreprises, soit en supprimant, soit en élargissant les frontières symboliques, relationnelles et physiques dans le contexte local.</p>

<p>While solidifying class inequalities on a transnational basis, corporate globalization often disrupts power regimes locally. Such disruptions can generate site-specific contention across difference that includes gender, ethnic, race, nationality, and class-infused discourses, social relations, and policies that solidify the physical marginalization or exclusion of less powerful groups at the local level. At the same time, individuals and groups increasingly challenge, contest, and reconfigure social boundaries in efforts to create more inclusive, equitable, and welcoming places. The resulting contention can either reinforce or transform the symbolic, relational, and physical landscape.</p>
<p>In the United States one form of local contention that results from corporate globalization is strong, organized opposition to the presence of marginalized and vulnerable immigrant populations. This opposition is popularly known as NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard). NIMBYism is ‘the protectionist attitudes and exclusionary/opposition tactics adopted by community groups facing an unwelcome development in their neighborhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429220">Dear, 1992</xref>: 288). When taken together, studies of NIMBYism reveal its dualities and contradictory dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429220">White and Ashton, 1992</xref>). Community groups can be motivated by values such as environmental sustainability, democratic accountability, and social equality. Prejudice and stereotypes of less powerful social groups can also motivate opposition.</p>
<p>NIMBYs often view themselves as the custodians or guardians of place. Initiatives to share space in new ways that support marginalized and vulnerable groups can be actively resisted by NIMBYs as unwelcome and undesirable changes in their neighborhoods. Responses to NIMBY movements require the attention of those interested in effectively addressing social problems and promoting social justice. Although the impact of NIMBY campaigns varies according to construction of the issue, the neighborhood contexts, the stakeholders and power holders involved, and the nature of resistance, NIMBY opposition can have serious consequences for immigrant populations. It can lead to increased financial costs, delays in, and even the denial of affordable housing, safe public spaces, and services for those in need. It exacerbates tensions and hostilities among groups and communities in neighborhoods. It can reinforce common myths and stereotypes that contribute to oppressive and exclusive public policies and resident practices.</p>
<p>Community-based organizations that support ethnic minority immigrant victims/survivors of domestic violence and workers participating in day labor markets frequently encounter NIMBYism. Public statements portraying immigrants as criminal, dangerous, and undeserving of sympathy or services rationalize and reinforce concerns over declining property values, increased taxes, rising unemployment, higher crime rates, and diminished quality of life. Racial and class segregation, the transient nature of shelter residence and temporary employment, and the use of public spaces by day laborers in unexpected ways – all fuel mistrust and misunderstandings of those perceived as outsiders belonging to unfamiliar cultures. These structural and cultural obstacles impede the efforts of community-based organizations to provide neighborhood-friendly housing and official hiring sites that promote the human security of shelter residents and day laborers respectively.</p>
<p>Sociologists committed to promoting social justice should consider conducting collaborative research on these instances of contention, as they constitute the ultimate arbiters of the consequences of globalization in a given location. Such research can facilitate the identification of strategic practices that begin to reverse the disempowering dynamics of glocal linkages for migrants by promoting, at the local level of destination, belonging through the expansion or removal of social boundaries. In this article, we focus on NIMBYism encountered in two cases where community organizations – the New York Asian Women’s Center and the Workplace Project – sought to create spaces and services for immigrants. The first section provides a multidimensional analytical framework centered around the concept of boundary contention. The second section lays out the methodological approach to the collaborative endeavor, emphasizing the advantages of a comparative case study design. The third section provides lessons learned for developing better practices that can assist organizations in pre-empting and responding to efforts to exclude immigrant populations.</p>

<title>Theory and practice</title>
<sec id="section2-0011392111429220">
<title>Boundary contention as strategic practice</title>
<p>One of the strengths of community-based participatory action research is its emphasis upon the interplay of theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429220">Bargal, 2008</xref>). The synthesis of multiple forms of knowledge possessed by academic researchers and community-based organizations facilitates the development of useable interpretive frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392111429220">Heron and Reason, 2001</xref>);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392111429220">1</xref></sup> in turn, applying these frameworks in practice enables assessments of both their analytical utility and transformative potential. Better practices assist in the production of better theories and vice versa.</p>
<p>The staff of the community-based organizations and the two academic participants discussed what organizational experiences coupled with the existing research literature suggest effective practices that either exclude or include immigrants in local communities. From these discussions emerged a multidimensional analytical framework centered around the concept of boundary contention. We conceptualize place as regulated but contested spaces of domination with social boundaries delimited by multiple markers such as ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, class, and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429220">Abraham, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392111429220">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429220">Barth, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429220">Olzak, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429220">Reskin, 1988</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392111429220">2</xref></sup> Who enters (and who does not), what can be done (and what cannot be done), and what services are provided (and are not provided) reflect the discourses, relationships, and infrastructures produced by the most powerful social groups.</p>
<sec id="section3-0011392111429220">
<title>Boundary policing</title>
<p>Campaigns against the establishment of social services for immigrants typically involve the policing of three types of social boundaries: (1) symbolic boundaries; (2) relational boundaries; and (3) physical boundaries. The policing of symbolic boundaries entails creating symbolic distinctions between social groups. Who ‘we’ are is defined in contradistinction to one or more negatively represented others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429220">Taylor and Whittier, 1992</xref>). For example, in a content analysis of focus group discussions about immigrants in Rotterdam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429220">Verkuyten et al. (1995)</xref> identify four forms of symbolic boundary making: labeling, metaphors, concretization, and commonplaces. Through these forms, residents created representations of authorities as discriminating against them by providing special and unfair treatment to undeserving ‘foreigners.’ These representations categorized residents as sympathy-worthy victims in juxtaposition to immigrants and the state, who were categorized condemnation-worthy victimizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429220">Losecke, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Academic research and organizational experience suggest that exclusive discourses are more likely to thrive in contexts of social segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429220">McVeigh, 2004</xref>). The converse implication is that high levels of interaction across social groups reduce the resonance of exclusive discourses. Thus, effective practices of exclusion frequently involve preventing relationships from forming across groups. The policing of relational boundaries can involve segregation laws (e.g. Jim Crow laws), social ostracizing, and physical attacks against those establishing strong ties with stigmatized groups.</p>
<p>Physical distance facilitates the policing of both symbolic and relational boundaries. The recent effects of cyberspace aside, physical distance limits opportunities to challenge entrenched discourses or form exogenous relationships. In contexts where there is a degree of dependence upon the labor of less powerful groups, maintaining physically separate residential neighborhoods, leisure centers, schools, and places of worship are essential to policing relational boundaries. Physically boundaries are often policed in one of three ways. First, governments are pressured or encouraged to enact and enforce zoning laws that restrict migrant uses of spaces both public and private. Second and related, governments and developers are pressured or encouraged to create both natural and built barriers that discourage interaction between socially segregated areas. Third, members of NIMBY movements engage, both individually and collectively, in threats, intimidation, isolation, marginalization, property destruction, and violence against immigrants inhabiting spaces, again both public and private.</p>
<p>When taken together, boundary policing creates and maintains regimes of exclusion that prevent immigrants from belonging to local communities. These regimes are strongest when policing is effective along all three dimensions. Stigmatizing discourses, a low degree of exogenous relationships, and few shared spaces constitute an interlocking, mutually reinforcing system.</p>
<p>Those seeking to exclude immigrants can police not only ethnic, racial, and national boundaries, but also boundaries defined by ability, age, class, gender, religion, sexuality, and other markers that serve as primary bases of group formation and differentiation. Markers may be more salient in the policing of one particular type of social boundary and less salient in policing others. For example, opponents might produce discourses that emphasize the nationality of immigrants while, at the same time, focus upon preventing relationships and shared spaces from developing among those from different class backgrounds. Moreover, for any given type of boundary, the type of marker used by opponents may differ, reflecting historical, social, political, economic, and cultural variations in local contexts. For example, opponents in one case might focus upon gender and class in their representations of immigrants while opponents in another case might emphasize race and ethnicity in their portrayals. These variations underscore the need for highly contextualized strategic practices by immigrant advocates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011392111429220">
<title>Boundary alteration</title>
<p>Pinpointing various barriers to immigrant belonging enhances our awareness that just as social boundaries can be deliberately erected and contracted, they can also be concertedly deconstructed and even expanded. Whereas boundary policing constitutes a strategy for exclusion, boundary alteration constitutes a strategy for inclusion. We can begin to reverse dominant processes of globalization by altering symbolic, relational, and physical boundaries in local spaces increasingly inhabited by persons displaced from communities based in other societies.</p>
<p>Altering symbolic boundaries involves the construction of inclusive discourses. Inclusive discourses embrace difference and change as strengthening rather than weakening communities. Inclusive labels and metaphors define immigrants as valued members of the community. Commonplaces are enlisted in support of the presence of immigrants. Personalized and melodramatic narratives concretize hardships and injustices faced by immigrants as well as their talents and triumphs in the face of adversity. Inclusive discourses portray immigrants as worthy of sympathy rather than condemnation worthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429220">Losecke, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive interactions across social divides reduce the resonance of stigmatizing discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429220">Levin and Nolan, 2010</xref>). Altering relational boundaries entails the formation of ties between members of social groups that have rarely interacted, particularly in informal settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429220">Reese (2001)</xref> calls for a proactive-interactive approach, using a small degree of familiarity with another language, history, and culture to initiate positive interpersonal relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392111429220">Sanjek (2000)</xref> highlights rituals of inclusion – events that celebrate diversity as a defining value and asset of the community. In their review of the literature on hate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429220">Levin and Nolan (2010)</xref> conclude that informal settings as well as the equal status pursuit of superordinate objectives contribute to the erosion of prejudice as well as the development of long-term friendships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392111429220">Putnam (2009)</xref> observes that we have underinvested in understanding and replicating the use of ‘bonding social capital’ in ethnic associations as a foundation from which to connect other ethnic groups with one another.</p>
<p>The identification and utilization of spaces that are available for immigrants facilitate the crossing of relational boundaries. Reflective of power disparities within the community, organizational experiences suggest that available spaces tend to be located at either the geographic, socioeconomic, and residential periphery of a municipality or, conversely, in highly affluent areas. Symbolically, meeting in peripheral locations reinforces the credibility of portrayals of migrants as not being fully part of the community. Meeting in affluent locations, however, may result in lopsided dynamics of social interaction characterized by dependency and paternalism. Removing physical barriers that impede interaction, redrawing political and zoning districts to cut across ethnic, racial, and class divides, and sharing facilities like beaches, hospitals, parks, places of worship, restaurants, schools, supermarkets, and community centers – all contribute to the decolonization of local space.</p>
<p>The alteration of physical boundaries involves not only the expansion of shared spaces, but also the expansion of safe spaces controlled by immigrants. Such spaces not only provide greater security, but also serve as contexts for consciousness-raising, identity construction, and organizing. Similar to shared spaces, safe spaces are most likely to be available in either fringe or highly affluent areas. As will be seen later, efforts to move into the geographic and socioeconomic center of a municipality can result in intense boundary contention.</p>
<p>The ability of opponents to use different markers to reinforce social boundaries that exclude immigrants presents immigrant advocates with both strategic dilemmas and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429220">Jasper, 2004</xref>). Advocates have the choice to either focus upon trying to remove the marker-specific boundaries policed by opponents and/or focus upon seeking to expand boundaries in reference to markers not emphasized by opponents. For instance, advocates can devote their energies to challenging a racialized discourse used by opponents, or, alternatively, they can promote a discourse that emphasizes class commonalties across racialized differences. Advocates also have the choice of either consistently emphasizing the same marker(s) in efforts to alter all forms of social boundaries (i.e. symbolic, relational, and physical) or to emphasize different markers for different boundaries. Given that advocates often find themselves reacting to NIMBY campaigns and, therefore, contesting the specific boundaries created by opponents, the recognition of choices in response to boundary policing highlights the range of strategic options available. We now discuss our methods, underscoring the importance of equal partnership with community organizations, strategic thinking through the process of data collection, and a comparative research design.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-0011392111429220">
<title>Partners and processes</title>
<p>By encouraging systematic reflection upon the reproduction and alteration of social boundaries, community-based action research can assist in the development of more inclusive community practices and public policies. The co-authors of this article have a long history of working with community-based organizations in addressing social justice issues, especially in the context of immigrant communities in the United States. Margaret had previously collaborated with the New York Asian Women’s Center (NYAWC) and other South Asian women’s organizations in shifting domestic violence from a private problem to a public issue to promote changes in policy and practice. Greg had previously collaborated with the Workplace Project/Centro de Derechos Laborales on a survey of day laborers on Long Island that has been used to highlight the problems encountered by immigrants seeking contingent work in informal labor markets as well as the need for progressive change in employment and immigrant rights policies. The longstanding relationships between the academic researchers and the community-based organizations ensured the trust necessary for candid assessments of both the NYAWC’s and the Workplace Project’s responses to NIMBYism.</p>
<p>Founded in 1982, the New York Asian Women’s Center (NYAWC) was the first domestic violence organization on the East Coast to serve the Asian communities. Helping battered women overcome violence and live lives free of abuse, the NYAWC also raises awareness about domestic violence, advocates for the rights of battered women, and creates an agenda for social change.</p>
<p>The Workplace Project/Centro de Derechos Laborales is a non-profit membership organization that organizes Latino and Latina immigrant workers on Long Island and works to achieve social justice by promoting the full political, economic, and cultural participation of these workers in the communities in which they live. The organization has used a variety of tactics to challenge instances of exploitation, discrimination, exclusion, and violence against immigrant workers, including protests, legal action, and media campaigns. Both organizations focus on marginalized immigrant communities and some of the most vulnerable members of these communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392111429220">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>NIMBYism is a community-identified issue and concern given the experiences of both victims/survivors of domestic violence seeking support and safe spaces for shelter and day laborers seeking safe, accessible public spaces for organizing and searching for employment. Nonetheless, the staff at both organizations admitted that they had not spent much time developing ways to prevent or respond to NIMBYism. As is typical in the non-profit world, a lack of resources and personnel combined with a high volume of needs among the serviced population makes sustained strategic planning difficult. For the NYAWC, an important objective was to consider ways to provide safe spaces, including shelters for abused women and their children. For the Workplace Project, an important goal of their members was to promote official hiring shelters. In this context, the community-based organizations voiced to the academic partners a strong desire to learn lessons from past campaigns, including those that did not fully achieve their goals to improve future practices. The general intent was to identify lessons from specific case studies to develop a set of promising practices for future campaigns; practices that will enable persons marginalized and displaced by corporate globalization to achieve human security and belonging in local communities in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0011392111429220">
<title>Shared goals of the project</title>
<p>As this was a collaborative endeavor, all four partners developed the research goals and design in close consultation with one another. Our research team expected to learn ways to address NIMBYism and help shift public policy away from laissez-faire or prohibitive responses to immigrants toward more proactive, inclusive responses such as shelters for battered women and official hiring sites for day laborers by answering the following five questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0011392111429220" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What were the main strategies used by community-based organizations to respond to NIMBYism? In particular, did immigrant advocates respond to specific boundary policing practices by opponents? If so, how did they respond?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which strategies helped to secure desired policy changes, which did not, and why?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the major recurring dilemmas and opportunities in responding to NIMBYism?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What strategies most effectively transcended dilemmas and seized upon opportunities to achieve the respective objectives of the community-based organizations?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does conceptualizing advocates’ encounters with NIMBY campaigns as boundary contestation facilitate the development of effective strategic practices?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An important aspect of the research is to facilitate critical and constructive self-evaluation, highlighting organizational strengths and efficacious collective action. We hope that heightened awareness of strengths and better practices assists the NYAWC and the Workplace Project in pre-empting and responding to efforts to exclude immigrant populations that both groups support and organize. Comparing similarities and differences between two cases with contrasting outcomes highlights the case-specific obstacles and opportunities as well as practices that may prove effective across cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011392111429220">
<title>Cases and contexts</title>
<p>In an effort to better answer the five questions raised above, we asked the community-based organizations to select cases that differed in terms of the degree of the success of their efforts to locate service facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392111429220">4</xref></sup> We were also interested in seeing whether and how differences in ethnicity, class, and gender in the two cases contributed to variations in the strategies of both opponents and supporters of services as well as the outcomes of contention. Based upon academic research and the experiences of the community partners, we believed that each of these factors could have a significant influence upon contention over the three types of boundaries (symbolic, relational, physical). The two cases selected are: (1) the NYAWC’s establishment of a specific domestic violence shelter, and (2) the Workplace Project’s proposed creation of an official hiring site for day laborers. Although both organizations work with marginalized and vulnerable populations and a common goal is the provision of safe spaces, services and empowerment, their experiences provide two different contexts to compare NIMBYism.</p>
<p>Beyond their contrasting outcomes, the cases also differ in terms of the type of services proposed, the population served, and the demographics of the project location. For the NYAWC, opposition was sparked by their purchase in June 2003 of a four-family brownstone house to be converted into a 20-bed residence primarily for Asian battered women and their children. This specific building was a corner property located in an urban residential neighborhood and on a block predominantly owned by Italian Americans. However, the broader neighborhood had a mix of long-time Italian American residents and upwardly mobile professionals who owned these brownstones as well as rentals occupied by younger people in their twenties. The area had good schools and was perceived as a safe place with easy access to shops and most amenities. Gentrification had increased the value and the prices of homes in this urban neighborhood.</p>
<p>The renovation of the brownstone house by a Chinese construction crew initiated a series of questions to the construction crew on ‘whether some kind of program’ was coming. Further inquiry led to the discovery by neighbors of the plan to open a shelter for abused women and their children. A large group of residents quickly mobilized in opposition to the plan. It is important to also note that there were members in the community who supported the NYAWC and demonstrated their support at community meetings and through letters and articles in the media. For its part, the NYAWC devoted considerable time, resources, and energy in addressing the opposition of neighbors, answering questions on safety, and explaining to their funders and the public the importance of continuing support for the shelter. They defended the right and importance of this location and were finally successful in opening the shelter.</p>
<p>The second case involves the Workplace Project’s initiative to create a worker center for day laborers searching for employment. Taking place in public spaces, day labor markets bring contractors looking for low-skilled to semi-skilled manual labor for small contracts often lasting only a day together with workers willing to provide this type of flexible labor. An informal day labor market formed along a major thoroughfare in Huntingport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392111429220">5</xref></sup> Some residents objected to this market. As with the NYAWC case, it is important to note that several members of the community supported the day laborers at community meetings as well as through letters and articles in the media.</p>
<p>Based upon complaints received, the Mayor of Huntingport announced that after a certain date it would be illegal to stand on a corner and search for employment. Seeing flyers announcing the change in policy, some of the day laborers contacted the Workplace Project and requested their assistance. In an effort to bring about a negotiated settlement to the dispute, day laborers supported by the Workplace Project proposed the establishment of a worker center. Worker centers are official hiring sites sanctioned by the local government and funded through public–private partnerships. These sites typically provide sheltered facilities with bathrooms. Day laborers at the sites generally agree to a minimum fee schedule for various jobs, and are selected for work either on a first come-first serve or a lottery system.</p>
<p>Opposition to the worker center was likely intensified by its proposed location in an area whose demographics differed considerably from our first case. Instead of being urban, the municipality is suburban, with 8399 residents according to the 2000 Census. Rather than being racially diverse, 87% of residents were listed as ‘White.’ The lack of regular interaction across socioeconomic and cultural differences most likely heightened fears and anxieties regarding the unexpected use of public space by less familiar social groups. While rental housing existed, 43.7% of housing units were single-family owner-occupied homes. The values and prices of these homes were relatively modest, with a median value of $212,000 compared to $242,300 for the entire county. As a result, it is likely that more residents felt their material interests were severely threatened by the hiring site than in a municipality with a large rental housing stock and rapidly increasing property values.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, through a series of well-publicized protests by day laborers, the Workplace Project was initially successful in getting the Mayor of Huntingport to permit a hiring site on public property. Less than a year later, however, the Mayor reversed his decision under pressure from a vocal group of residents led by the Concerned Citizens Association of Huntingport. Eventually, a site was then opened in the adjacent municipality of West Huntingport. The site closed less than a month later as a result of pressure on the landlord and intimidation of workers and staff. Two years later, a support organization named Huntingport Citizens for Viable Solutions opened Casa Colectiva. Privately funded, the center is not a hiring site. Instead, it provides a range of social services to immigrant workers. Recently the center has experienced difficulties in remaining open due to a lack of funding. Since a new mayor was elected on the promise to ‘get these day laborers off our streets,’ ticketing of day laborers in Huntingport has, once again, intensified. Nonetheless, the workers continue in large numbers to seek employment on the village’s streets. Over the last few years, the Workplace Project has experienced success in some campaigns to establish worker centers while continuing to encounter insurmountable resistance to other campaigns.</p>
<p>In both cases, NIMBYism and the response to NIMBYism involved publicly elected and appointed officials, courts, police, journalists, activists, clergy, and foundations. This broad-based involvement makes both cases important opportunities to understand how communities are defined in terms of where power is located, how issues of diversity and protecting immigrants’ rights are constructed, and what strategies foster just and positive community relations in rapidly diversifying neighborhoods.</p>

<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>We collected several sources of data. The past record of community collaborations of the authors and the relationship with the community-based organizations offered an opportunity to openly discuss and agree upon the roles and responsibilities of the academic participants and staff at the two community-based organizations. The academic partners searched and summarized the social science and activist literatures on collective organized responses to NIMBYism. Staff at the community-based organizations collected archived documentation related to their work and experiences (e.g. newspaper articles, official statements, and minutes of meetings). Next, the academic partners designed (with input from the community-based organizations) and administered surveys to organizational staff as well as conducted focus groups with some of those who played integral roles in the projects’ leadership teams.</p>
<p>Beyond answering our five research questions, the survey and focus group instruments (available upon request) had three additional goals in mind. First, respondents/participants were asked a series of questions designed to establish a timeline of the campaign. In so doing, we sought to better understand the sequences and processes through which advocates engaged authorities, opponents, and bystanders. Second, we asked questions based upon what research suggests promotes effective strategy (e.g. leadership composition, organizational structure, and decision-making). In so doing, we not only assessed the relevance of these factors to the outcomes of the campaigns, but also encouraged a greater focus by advocates upon these factors in reference to future efforts to establish other facilities. Third, the academic partners asked questions regarding what the community-based organizations thought were important lessons from their experiences. In so doing, they hoped to better understand the outcomes of their campaigns and to share these insights with other community-based organizations. Academic partners analyzed the archival data. Survey responses across organizations were merged and compared. The focus group discussions were transcribed and analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo! A report was drafted based on the analysis and findings and included several exchanges between the academic and community-based participants. These exchanges on the drafts of the report deepened insights for both theory and practice.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Our analysis of the two cases generates several practical lessons for ways to facilitate the creation of safe and shared spaces for immigrants. We evaluate the two cases using our conceptual framework of boundary contention. We first assess efforts to counteract exclusive discourses that stigmatized immigrants.</p>
<sec id="section11-0011392111429220">
<title>Altering symbolic boundaries</title>
<p>In both cases, some residents produced discourses that portrayed immigrants as a threat to the community. In particular, these discourses emphasized the victimization of established residents.</p>
<p>There were also important discursive differences between the two cases. Race, class, and gender played important roles in the relative potency of exclusive versus inclusive discourses within the general public, favoring an inclusive discourse in one case and an exclusive discourse in the other. Policy discourses also varied across the cases and influenced the degree of support for immigrants displayed by public officials. The degree of media accountability also differed, with important consequences for the extent to which exclusive and inclusive discourses were disseminated.</p>
<sec id="section12-0011392111429220">
<title>Availing of discursive opportunities</title>
<p>Some social contexts provide greater opportunities for success than others. Legal changes that substantively address movement demands both result from and produce ways of writing and talking that portray: (1) a social problem as a policy priority, and (2) groups affected by the problem as not the source of the problem and, therefore, deserving of support. The precedent of supportive intervention by authorities coupled with the availability of familiar and authoritative policy rhetoric to legitimate intervention encourages the emergence of powerful allies. The presence of these opportunities made success far more likely in the NYAWC case than in the Workplace Project case, where such opportunities were mostly absent.</p>
<p>The NYAWC framed establishing the shelter in terms of domestic violence against women. Under pressure from women’s rights organizations, Congress took up the issue of domestic violence, passing the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 and reauthorizing it in 2000 and 2005. The Act provides funding to investigate and prosecute violent crime against women, including domestic violence. In the course of securing approval of this legislation, a public discourse emerged that portrayed women experiencing domestic violence as victims worthy of support.</p>
<p>Government agencies and officials who publicly supported establishing the shelter framed their support in terms of domestic violence as a major policy priority and sympathy for battered women. In a letter to New York State Assemblywoman Joan Millman, the Commissioner of New York City’s Department of Health, Thomas Frieden, wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Domestic violence is a major public health problem affecting every community, regardless of race, ethnicity and socio-economic status. We as a society have a responsibility to assist the victims of domestic violence and to work toward addressing the conditions that perpetuate violence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a publicly released statement, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez said, ‘The most important thing to realize here is that these women are not criminals – they are women in need who have suffered a great deal and are looking for a safe place to go.’</p>
<p>In contrast to an established, authoritative, and sympathetic discourse around domestic violence, the Federal government has not addressed the issue of day labor markets. Whereas government intervention to prevent domestic violence is now a relatively well-established norm, government intervention to prevent the exploitation, harassment, and endangerment of immigrant workers is not. Along with the policy uncertainty surrounding immigration issues, public discourse regarding these markets has often portrayed day laborers as being in the country illegally and, therefore, undeserving of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392111429220">Maney and Abraham, 2008/2009</xref>). The Mayor echoed this oppositional framing in his letter to the <italic>Huntingport Observer</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service has investigated this matter and has advised us that due to budget constraints it only enforces immigration laws in factories and along borders of other countries, not on local streets. (<italic>Huntingport Observer</italic>, 30 June <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429220">2000</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The day laborers and their allies used civil liberties laws and court rulings to prevent the Mayor of Huntingport from intensifying efforts to shut down the market. As he wrote in the same letter:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, these ongoing negotiations are made difficult by several rulings from the US Supreme Court, which has deemed that loitering is not illegal anywhere in the country and allows day workers to assemble in public places. These decisions have greatly restrained the actions that the village and [name removed] County Police Department can take. If we attempt to expel people from public property, it is a violation of their civil rights and would likely result in an expensive lawsuit against the village. (<italic>Huntingport Observer</italic>, 30 June <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429220">2000</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Advocates, however, did not argue that establishing an official hiring site was important to protecting civil rights and enforcing labor laws. In the absence of familiar, authoritative policy rhetoric, the Mayor couched his decision to create the site in terms of group mediation. At the ceremony to open the official hiring site, he stated that the location was temporary and that they were ‘looking for a building, so that the needs of the workers can be met, and at the same time, respects the needs of the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392111429220">Morale, 2000</xref>). Whereas the dominant discourse in Kameron Glen, where the NYAWC shelter was being located, presented all classes in the community as facing the problem of domestic violence, the dominant discourse in Huntingport presented workers as an outside group whose needs conflicted with those who truly belong in the community.</p>
<p>Gender played an important role in constructions of victimization in both cases. Public officials frequently constructed women and children who would use the proposed shelter as victims of domestic violence worthy of assistance. In a letter to a constituent dated 29 October 2003, New York City Councilman Bill de Blasio wrote, ‘I appreciate your concern about this issue. As I’m sure you know, the City faces a pressing shortage of beds for women and children who have been victimized by domestic violence.’ NYAWC staff encouraged this discourse and used it to successfully mobilize a local women’s group.</p>
<p>In the other case, rather than being portrayed as victims of the global economy forced to come to the United States to support their families, public officials frequently constructed the male immigrant workers as criminals victimizing residents and, therefore, undeserving of an official hiring site. In explaining his decision to close the official hiring site that he had opened 14 months earlier, Huntingport’s Mayor was quoted in <italic>The New York Times</italic> as stating, ‘There were many complaints of harassing women. You know, “Chiquita, Chiquita,” with kissing noises as they passed. One of the men actually exposed himself to a girl at the bus stop . . .’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429220">Baker, 2001</xref>). Ironically a patriarchal discourse that disempowers women by portraying women as victims increased active support for the shelter. The same discourse that portrays men as powerful reduced support for the official hiring site by fueling concerns about safety by portraying immigrant men as potential victimizers and abusers. The findings underscore the need to consult and dialog with local officials early in the process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0011392111429220">
<title>Drawing inclusive identity boundaries</title>
<p>The cases examined here suggest that proponents of services for stigmatized populations are likely to benefit most from a two-pronged identity strategy. As a source of opposition, stigma depends upon strong identity boundaries between ‘us, the residents’ and ‘them, the intruders.’ An effective media and public education strategy, therefore, is to blur the identity boundaries between service users and other residents. Doing so, however, runs the risk of not mobilizing potential allies and supporters who would participate in response to framing that demonizes opponents. This suggests that community organizers may best be served with contrasting internal and external frames. Nonetheless, it is important to note that this dual framing runs the risk of confusing potential supporters and of encountering accusations of misleading the public.</p>
<p>Although some key staff and board members who were Asian were the primary interface with the community, the NYAWC chose to additionally include as many non-Asian spokespeople as possible at the advice of their public relations consultant. In the words of one survey respondent, ‘We chose them because we wanted to show more non-Asian faces so that neighbors could identify themselves with them.’ Attributions of similarity by residents sharing the spokespeople’s ethnicities along with few reminders of the different ethnicities of service users likely contributed to high levels of sympathetic media coverage combined with eventual support from some residents initially opposed to the shelter.</p>
<p>While by no means the sole spokespeople, day laborers from El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico featured prominently in the media campaign to establish an official hiring site in Huntingport. The decision, in part, reflected the Workplace Project’s commitment to helping immigrant workers find and use their own voices. Having Anglo allies speak for the day laborers is not particularly empowering. Despite the personalized, melodramatic narratives told by the day laborers, media coverage may have reinforced a sense that service users did not belong in a place implicitly defined in class, ethnic, and racialized terms.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in both cases opponents tried to blur identity boundaries in their public relations work. Shelter opponents organized as Concerned Citizens of Kameron Glen had a Chinese man as their spokesperson although their leader was an Italian American male. Similarly, opponents in Huntingport sent out a Salvadoran man to gather information on the day laborers and to present himself as a spokesperson for Latinos. We suspect that these practices constituted attempts to reduce the empirical credibility of any frames presenting opposition as being racially or ethnically motivated.</p>
<p>While blurring identity boundaries in media work appears to have reduced opposition to the shelter, reinforcing boundaries in organizing increased participation by allies and members. The NYAWC used opposition as a rallying cry for support. A foundation responded positively, offering additional funding for the facility and providing a strategy consultant free of charge. Board members who were previously inactive suddenly became quite involved. The staff themselves experienced a stronger commitment to the organization as a result of the opposition. One of the project leaders recalls having the following reaction after being menaced by an opponent as she walked to the subway station:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . for me it was a moment of truth, of solidarity, across generations, across racial lines, and to really embolden me that we needed to fight this. Because it really was about more than our shelter and about our women; it really was about something so innately wrong. (Focus group participant).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the beginning, clergy in Huntingport were considered to be important allies of the day laborers. Rather than intensify their commitment to the hiring site, opposition brought about a retreat in their levels of public support. Meetings involving both day laborers and a group of mostly European American supporters known as Huntingport Citizens for Viable Solutions were generally characterized as negative experiences. Instead of highlighting differences with opponents that could serve as a basis of unity, the meetings drew attention to differences among proponents. In the end, the leadership drew primarily upon a shared pan-ethnic identity as a basis for mobilization. In the words of a focus group participant, ‘We Latinos here saved ourselves.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0011392111429220">
<title>Holding the media accountable</title>
<p>As matter of law and practice, domestic violence (DV) shelters typically keep their location confidential so as to protect the victims from abusers. Studies have indicated that battered women face increased danger of being killed by their abuser after they have left the relationship. Therefore, as in past practice and in compliance with the law, the NYAWC had not publicized its shelter and had planned to move into the neighborhood as discreetly as possible. The NYWAC had not anticipated community opposition, given their prior record of having had no opposition on rental properties as shelters. Also given the confidentiality required of DV shelters, the group had not sought to assess or identify potential supporters or opponents within the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Recognizing the opportunity presented by these requirements and procedures, opponents sought to force the shelter to relocate by breaching confidentiality. Organized under the Concerned Citizens of Kameron Glen (CCKG), these opponents publicized the shelter’s location through fliers distributed throughout the neighborhood, banners, and websites. The CCKG also threatened to publicize the location in the ethnic press. One of the NYAWC’s key staff members had previously been a journalist. She used her experience and networks to convince the ethnic press that publicizing the location would constitute a serious violation of professional ethics.</p>
<p>While the media were, for the most part, balanced in offering the perspectives of both proponents and opponents of the worker center in Huntingport, stories consistently presented the day laborers as being from outside of the community. For instance, a story appearing in the <italic>Huntingport Observer</italic> quoted, without question, the Mayor as stating: ‘We’re looking for a building, so that <italic>the needs of the workers</italic> can be met, and at the same time, respects <italic>the needs of the community</italic>’ (21 April <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429220">2000</xref>; emphasis added). It was only when the Village Board moved to purchase a rental apartment complex housing day laborers that journalists acknowledged that day laborers not only worked, but also lived in the community. Because of this error in fact, the Mayor and the Trustees remained unchallenged in their assumptions that the only party in the conflict that they had a responsibility to as constituents were residents opposed to an official hiring site. The findings underscore the importance of managing the media’s construction of symbolic boundaries.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section15-0011392111429220">
<title>Altering relational boundaries</title>
<p>Opponents not only reinforced symbolic boundaries between established residents and more recently arriving ones, they also actively sought to discourage the formation of constructive, cooperative relationships between them. In both cases, opponents took advantage of a lack of ties between immigrant advocates and public officials. Limited initial consultations with those outside the immigrant community also deprived advocates of knowledge, skills, and experiences that could have enhanced their strategies. Eventual differences in the extent and character of ally involvement in the two cases contributed to different outcomes. Different venues for engaging and dialoging with opponents also produced contrasting results.</p>
<sec id="section16-0011392111429220">
<title>Insiders and strategy development</title>
<p>In his study of the United Farm Workers of America, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429220">Ganz (2000)</xref> identifies several factors that enhance the capacity of organizations to make the right decisions to empower immigrants. According to the author:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Strategic capacity is greater if a leadership team includes insiders and outsiders, strong and weak network ties, and access to diverse, yet salient, repertoires of collective action and also if an organization conducts regular, open, authoritative deliberation, draws resources from multiple constituencies, and roots accountability in those constituencies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429220">Ganz, 2000</xref>: 1005)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In particular, regular, open, authoritative deliberation allows for the adaptation of strategy based upon experiences arising in the course of encountering opposition. These adaptations to environmental contingencies may be crucial to whether or not service facilities are ultimately established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429220">McCammon et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to survey respondents and focus group participants, the NYAWC did little in the way of initial research and planning as they had not anticipated any opposition to the shelter given their prior positive experience in opening three other shelters. None of the leadership team on the project had experience with NIMBY opposition and was taken by surprise. As one staff member recalled during the focus group, ‘One thing is we had very good relationships with our neighbors with our prior communities. So we kind of like let our guards down.’ Over time, however, the organization did bring in outside consultants who helped them to formulate a strategy. Holding external and insider knowledge not possessed by staff, these consultants drew upon their outside experiences to make recommendations for promising practices. The leadership team brought in a consultant from a public relations firm. The consultant advised a key staff member in meetings involving residents to ‘be as calm as possible’ and ‘don’t let anybody fluster you and let your anger get a hold of you.’ A strategic consultant who volunteered his services helped the NYAWC to ‘use our elected officials in a way that we hadn’t [before]’ (focus group participant).</p>
<p>Upper-level staff, board members, and consultants held meetings where they discussed the situation. These meetings led to the adaptation of strategy. For instance, the project organizers had initially met with large groups of residents opposed to the shelter. They came to realize that these meetings were counterproductive and decided to hold smaller meetings with representatives from the opposition instead. These meetings were halted when they also ‘turned out to really not be productive’ (focus group participant).</p>
<p>Like the NYAWC, the Workplace Project conducted little advance research or planning. Unlike the NYAWC, the Workplace Project did not choose Huntingport as an ideal location for establishing services. Instead, they responded to calls by day laborers to intervene in a crisis situation where the rights of workers to search for employment were seriously threatened. None of the five day laborers on the leadership team had past experiences with this type of campaign. While the lead organizer of the Workplace Project did have experience with opposition to efforts to establish an official hiring site elsewhere, these experiences were not translated into practical lessons for the rest of the leadership team.</p>
<p>No consultants were brought in to assist in the development of a strategy. Early contacts with supportive local church leaders provided insider knowledge, resources, and ties that greatly assisted advocates in negotiating with local officials. Pressure by opponents, however, eventually resulted in these leaders exiting the campaign. Subsequent meetings with outsider allies were often chaotic and seemingly endless. According to one of the day laborers leading the campaign ‘We [the day laborers] put down the points we wanted or what we agreed to. And then she [leader of Huntingport Citizens for Viable Solutions] talked about something else. The meeting came out the same and it never arrived at a conclusion’ (focus group participant). Consequently, few if any strategic adaptations were made over time in response to oppositional concerns or tactics. The finding suggests that strong cross-cultural facilitation may be needed to realize the benefits of open, authoritative deliberations in the context of diverse organizing settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0011392111429220">
<title>Establishing ties with targets early in the process</title>
<p>Our analysis of the two cases suggests that projects will be more successful if advocates reach out to major stakeholders early in the process. Targets are those with the power to give advocates what they want. Early outreaches to targets can help organizers to determine whether or not they are sympathetic. Early outreaches, however, pose difficulties for domestic violence shelters given the importance of maintaining confidentiality of the site. In instances where targets are not sympathetic, advocates may be better off avoiding taskforces and instead focusing upon ways to generate pressure on the target.</p>
<p>In adherence to the rule to protect the confidentiality of the shelter, the NYAWC did not consult with targets prior to proceeding with their purchase of the house. In fact, the targets contacted the NYAWC after having been approached by opponents of their project. Our focus group reveals that a key NYAWC leadership member regretted this failure: ‘I would [now] go immediately to the elected officials, just as a courtesy, give them a heads up and that we’re coming and that we don’t foresee any problems . . . just because I think that would really diffuse a lot of the “sneaking in” thing.’</p>
<p>While the Workplace Project approached the Mayor of Huntingport early on, the approach was made in the form of a meeting demanding an end to the ticketing of day laborers and contractors by the village and the establishment of an official hiring site. Efforts to cultivate sympathy were made indirectly through Catholic clergy who had good relations with the Mayor and members of the Village Board. Along with pressure in the form of petitions and protests by the day laborers, these efforts appear to have increased the Mayor’s receptivity to permitting a hiring site to be organized given the short duration of the campaign (three months) following intensive efforts by the Mayor to shut down the market over the course of the previous year. Subsequent to this short-term success, however, opponents were successful in pressuring allied priests to exit from contention. The finding suggests the need to develop intra- and cross-group support systems to sustain allies who come under pressure by opponents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0011392111429220">
<title>Constructive engagement with opponents</title>
<p>Whether, when, and how actors interact with one another will have major effects upon service location outcomes. Our analysis suggests that projects will be more successful if sympathetic targets establish representative deliberative bodies rather than rely upon open public hearings or community forums. Sympathetic elected officials are more likely to intervene when they can formally play an intermediary role. Asking authorities to establish advisory boards for the service facility permits them to play this role while avoiding the risks of open hearings and community forums that can be stacked and packed with opponents. Neither open hearings nor community forums typically create focused or sustained dialog. Instead these formats are mostly conducive to debate and the entrenchment of positions. Properly facilitated and structured negotiations, on the other hand, can produce discussions that result in policy outcomes addressing multiple concerns and meeting multiple interests.</p>
<p>NYAWC staff found community forums to be intimidating and unproductive. Accordingly, they drafted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Assemblywoman Joan Millman and Councilman Bill de Blasio. Signed by several other prominent politicians, the MOU included the establishment of an 11-member community advisory board to address issues related to establishing the shelter. The MOU presented officials as addressing residents’ concerns while also ultimately facilitating the establishment of the shelter. As one survey respondent put it, the politicians were ‘very supportive but had to walk a fine line. If they seemed like they were pro-shelter, they would have a hard time gaining the trust of the opponents.’</p>
<p>While difficult, NYAWC staff found interactions with opponents within the context of the community advisory board to be useful. Through addressing concerns and enhancing trust, the board actually helped to change the perceptions of some of the residents who were initially opposed to the shelter:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And as painful as those [meetings] were at times I feel like they did eventually move towards progress. The last meetings that we had the neighbors almost had run out of steam. And we would joke around at points, and so I do feel like that, you know, that did eventually move things towards a point where it was safer to be in the neighborhood. (Focus group participant)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through petitions and protests by day laborers and their allies, advocates successfully pressured the Mayor of Huntingport to establish a temporary hiring site on public property. No advisory board for the site, however, was proposed. In the absence of such a board, increasingly vocal public opposition to the site led the Mayor to shut it down. The Mayor organized a series of community forums as a way to appear more responsive to residents’ concerns. With the assistance of an organization that had successfully mobilized against a proposal to establish an official hiring site in a neighboring county, local opponents packed these forums. Like NYAWC staff, supporters of the official hiring site found these events to be intimidating. During the focus group, one Latina supporter of the site described her experiences:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At the meeting, people were saying that they [the day laborers] are dirty, that they try to pick up women, or almost rape them. When I raised my hand to speak, the man who was in the front of my husband and I turned around and screamed at me. So I left and went out of there feeling a drag. And my husband says ‘what a shame that we’re the only Latinos among a lot of other people.’ (Focus group participant)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Without an advisory board, and along with the exiting from contention of influential clergy supportive of the day laborers, these meetings became the main basis for influencing the Mayor and the Village Board. With opponents heavily outnumbering supporters, the Mayor refused to reopen an official hiring site within the limits of Huntingport. Overall, these findings suggest that advisory boards facilitate boundary alteration by opening up possibilities for effective, long-term public education while community forums facilitate boundary policing by reinforcing polarization.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section19-0011392111429220">
<title>Altering physical boundaries</title>
<p>In both cases, opponents sought to block the location of services for immigrants from central areas within municipalities. While situating the facilities in more peripheral locations would spark less opposition, they would also reinforce symbolic and relational boundaries that excluded immigrants. Differences in zoning ordinances as well as advocate positions in relationship to the ownership of the service facilities greatly influenced both the leverage and vulnerability of the advocates. In one of the cases, the designation of a facility as being temporary encouraged rather than discouraged mobilization by opponents.</p>
<sec id="section20-0011392111429220">
<title>Zoning ordinances</title>
<p>Zoning ordinances facilitated the decolonization of municipal space in one case while reinforcing it in the other. The NYAWC had allies in the New York State Department of Buildings. The DOB was supportive of the shelter as the proposed use of the building did not violate any zoning laws. In fact, the agency was so outspoken on behalf of the shelter that they were named in the civil suit along with the NYAWC.</p>
<p>In contrast, opponents successfully pressured officials in Huntingport to enforce anti-loitering against day laborers looking for work in gas stations, sidewalks, and on streets. Code enforcers would routinely threaten and fine workers congregating along the main town thoroughfare. The discriminatory intent and physically exclusive consequences of the practice was widely recognized by advocates, who referred to the ordinances as ‘Standing While Latino’ laws.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0011392111429220">
<title>Ownership of facilities</title>
<p>To our knowledge, the NIMBY literature has not specifically addressed the relative value or role of full, private ownership of facilities as compared to renting property or using public funding and space in determining opposition or outcomes. Nonetheless, in several cases, opponents have successfully pressured local officials and private building owners to not use their properties as service facilities. By removing this dependency as a source of power for opponents, full, private ownership of facilities by service providers may offer a promising strategy in specific cases and contexts. Moreover, because of the frequent heavy financial reliance of municipal authorities upon property taxes, ownership enhances the ability of advocates to assert local citizenship rights and to demand local government accountability.</p>
<p>In the short term, full ownership of the shelter by the NYAWC increased opposition, as residents likely viewed the chances of removing the shelter once established as being remote:</p>

<p>I think, even also from the community point of view, it would’ve been maybe different too, because their seeing us as really invading their neighborhood in a way that it wouldn’t of been if Mr. Joe Shmo owned it and was renting it out. I mean they really, I think, felt more threatened by it. It was just, in every way, for both sides it was a more permanent step that we were embarking on. (Focus group participant)</p>

<p>Once established, however, the perceived permanence of the shelter demobilized opposition not only by reducing expectations of the likelihood of success, but also by quelling many of the residents’ concerns. Some of the main fears that motivated opposition were demonstrably dispelled. For instance, an NYAWC focus group participant noted that many of the residents feared a shelter would lower property values. A house next door to the shelter was immediately purchased after coming up for sale. Soon after the sale, a number of the residents in the neighborhood took down signs from their windows opposing the shelter.</p>
<p>Initially, Huntingport’s Mayor agreed to locate the worker center on public property adjacent to several privately owned residences. While assurances by the Mayor that the center was only temporary allayed some residents’ concerns, for others it signaled an opportunity to do away with the site completely. The proposed use of public space and monies for the project gave greater voice to opponents as taxpayers than if the center were privately funded and located on private property.</p>
<p>Being denied a public site for the worker center, the Workplace Project rented space from a privately owned, commercially zoned building in West Huntingport. Because the space was rented rather than owned, opponents were able to successfully pressure the owners to evict their tenants. Moreover, whereas the NYAWC’s purchase of their building involved a specific time-defined, one-off plea to funders in the context of building this shelter, the need to pay rent on an ongoing basis resulted in ongoing appeals to and negotiations with funders. Strong differences in opinion existed between the Workplace Project and the day laborers, on the one hand, and foundations on the other. As a result of these differences, another organization – the Huntingport Citizens for Viable Solution (HCVS) – had received funding to run Casa Colectiva – a center established to provide social services to day laborers. As one of the focus group participants put it: ‘That was another lesson. We were renters. In other words, regulated. And they told us whether we could do it with them or not. . . . We trusted that the people running the facility were going to respect workers’ self-determination. They didn’t.’ Another focus group participant talked about strings being attached by one organization funding Casa Colectiva: ‘One important thing is who gives the money. Because it depends who is giving out the money what’s going to be or not. . . . In other words, we can’t have anyone here who talks about abortion. We can’t have anyone here who talks about that. In other words, it’s limiting.’</p>
<p>Renting not only increased the vulnerability of service providers, but also of service users. Fewer than two months after establishing an off-the-street hiring hall on a village-owned lot, Huntingport officials announced a plan to take over an apartment building to allow for private redevelopment into luxury apartments. The building in question was mostly rented by Latinos, including day laborers. While possibly coincidental, the timing suggests that the plan was intended to solve the ‘day worker problem’ by physically removing day laborers from the community. Only through an anti-discrimination law suit were advocates able to block the redevelopment plan.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our research highlights the benefits of community-based participatory action research to activists and scholars alike. By referencing and inquiring about aspects of strategizing emphasized particularly by social movement scholars, our survey and focus group questionnaires encouraged strategic thinking by the staff and members of community-based organizations.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, the New York Asian Women’s Center has not experienced NIMBYism and is actively engaged in community building and service provision. It has not encountered issues with neighbors or safety issues at the shelter and has also been successful in opening more shelters. The Workplace Project has won key victories, including a New York State law protecting workers against wage theft and the establishment of an official hiring site in Freeport.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the existing literature and primary data reveals practical lessons for establishing facilities providing services to immigrants. Community organizations are well-served if they plan ahead; drawing upon knowledge from insiders and outsiders regarding key players in the area and developing a plan designed to both prevent and respond to opposition. Targets should be engaged early on in efforts to secure their support. Such support is likely to be forthcoming if organizers point toward public discourses that establish the facility as addressing a major policy concern and that create sympathy for service users. It is preferable to interact with residents in processes conducive to dialog and negotiation such as community advisory boards than in processes conducive to debate and polarization such as hearings and town hall forums. Media work should highlight support for the facility by those with whom most residents are likely to identify. At the same time, behind the scenes organizing should highlight opposition in ways that activate identity commitments among allies, bystanders, and members. Whenever possible, service providers should acquire ownership over the facilities providing services to immigrants.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying best practices for organizers, our research reveals two things neglected in other studies on NIMBYism as well as research on social movement strategy. First, campaign process matters. Who service facility proponents chose to include in planning and decision-making, when they chose to include these actors, and how the actors were included played important roles in the outcomes of the two cases examined. Second, political opportunities in the form of influential allies and supportive targets are dependent upon taking advantage of discursive opportunities that arise from the policy victories of previous movements.</p>
<p>NIMBYism has enormous consequences for both day laborers and victims/survivors of domestic violence. Inattention to such problems leads to the persistence of common myths and stereotypes that contribute to oppressive practices. It precludes the effective identification, intervention, and prevention of NIMBYism. Similar research projects drawing the conceptual framework of boundary contention can assist advocacy groups in creating public space for marginalized and vulnerable immigrant populations. They can be used as tools for encouraging strategic thinking, planning, and practice among community organizers. Through lessons learned and recommendations for promising practices, organizations can hone their strategies to maximize community support for services as well as to minimize the effects if not transform anti-immigrant/anti-minority attitudes and practices. We recommend a multi-pronged, holistic approach by advocates that strives, in the short term, to establish service facilities and, in the long term, to expand support for the facilities and service users in the neighborhood through expanding symbolic and relational boundaries. In the process, community organizations can improve their efforts to provide services that ensure safety and enhance the overall quality of life of all the residents and workers in these neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The interplay between theory and practice is particularly relevant to the development of strategies for challenging exclusion in the context of severe and multiple social inequalities. Deeply entrenched disparities in resources, prestige, and institutional control facilitate the agency of those in structurally advantaged positions while limiting the agency of those in structurally disadvantaged positions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429220">Jasper (forthcoming)</xref> writes, for marginalized groups challenging extant authority ‘there are often no good choices, only least bad ones, in which oppression is as prominent as the battle against it, in which the best choices may not be good enough.’ Through combining multiple sources of knowledge, skills, and experiences, praxis-oriented research teams pinpoint key bases and processes of both exclusion <italic>and</italic> inclusion. By highlighting dialectical tensions, the research process enhances a consciousness of actors and actions that impede and promote belonging.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that the use of separate terminology to identify academic and community actors can reinforce the erroneous and problematic assumption that institutions of higher education are somehow separate from ‘off-campus’ communities. We also recognize the power disparities that frequently exist in relationships between academic and community-based actors. Given that the authors’ roles in this particular project were defined primarily in terms of our acquisition and transmission of information generated through social science research methods, we chose to abide by the conventional terminological distinction.</p>
