<abstract>
<p>A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial was done to compare the results of carpal tunnel release using classic incision, short incision, or endoscopic technique. In total, 90 consecutive cases were included. Follow-up was 24 weeks. We found a significantly shorter sick leave in the endoscopic group. No significant differences in pain, paraesthesiae, range of motion, pillar pain, and grip strength could be found at 24 weeks of follow-up, although intermediate significant differences were seen, especially in grip strength, in favour of endoscopic technique. No major advantage to using a short incision could be found. There were no serious complications in either group. The results indicate that the endoscopic procedure is safe and has the benefit of faster rehabilitation and return to work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) remains standard practice in many centres in Europe. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) is presently the main competitor to the open technique; its major benefits are claimed to be earlier return to work or activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412475247">Agee et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412475247">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412475247">Sennwald and Benedetti, 1995</xref>). Others report variable success with ECTR with no significant difference between ECTR and OCTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412475247">Jacobsen and Rahme, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412475247">MacDermid et al., 2003</xref>). However, there is consensus that both techniques are effective in short- and long-term effects on various types of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412475247">Atroshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412475247">Ferdinand and MacLean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412475247">Trumble et al., 2002</xref>), and overall complication rates seems to be similar for OCTR and ECTR, although the risk of transient neurological problems is higher for ECTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412475247">Boeckstyns and Sorensen, 1999</xref>). Since the introduction of ECTR a modification of the classic incision for OCTR, extending from the mid-palm angulated over the flexion crease of the wrist, has been introduced to try to reduce surgical trauma and hence recovery time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412475247">Bromley, 1994</xref>), but no randomized controlled trial comparing ECTR versus OCTR with a modified incision has, to our knowledge, addressed return to work, and only two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412475247">Jugovac et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412475247">Richter and Bruser, 1996</xref>) have examined the time to return to work by comparing OCTR versus OCTR with a modified incision.</p>
<p>We therefore performed a randomized study with the purpose of establishing whether OCTR with a short incision has any advantage, especially with regard to sick leave and function, compared with ECTR and OCTR with a classic incision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412475247" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A total of 90 patients with CTS requiring operation were included in the study. Randomization was by sealed opaque envelopes, and patients were equally divided into three groups using block randomization. The study had ethical committee approval. Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, symptoms of paraesthesiae in two or more fingers innervated by the median nerve and of at least 3 month’s duration prior to inclusion, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies confirming CTS. Excluded from the study were post-traumatic cases, patients with recurrence of CTS after previous carpal tunnel release, limited wrist extension, medical history of rheumatoid or endocrine disease, polyneuropathy, coagulation disorder, or pregnancy. The patients were informed verbally and by letter, and all gave written consent. Only one hand per patient was included. Measurements were taken of both hands.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193412475247">
<title>Operative techniques</title>
<p>Patients were operated in Bier block and an outpatient setting. The three surgical exposures were 1) classic incision: a 7 cm curved incision just ulnar to the thenar crease and angulated over the flexion crease of the wrist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412475247">Figure 1</xref>) in order to release the flexor retinaculum and antebrachial fascia under direct vision; 2) short incision: an incision of 3 cm in the mid-palm distal to the flexion crease of the wrist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412475247">Figure 2</xref>) in order to release the distal portion of the flexor retinaculum under direct vision, and the proximal portion of the flexor retinaculum and antebrachial fascia were then carefully divided using scissor dissection in a plane deep to subcutaneous fat and skin; and 3) endoscopic procedure: using the Linvatec system as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412475247">Menon (1993)</xref>, which is a one-portal technique with a short transverse incision at the wrist using a disposable set of endoscopic instruments and a conventional 5 mm arthroscope. After trans-section the skin was sutured and a soft dressing without splinting applied.</p>

<title>Patient assessment</title>
<p>Follow-up was performed by an independent and blinded observer at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Blinding was executed by covering the palm and wrist crease with a dressing, and patients were instructed not to disclose the surgical method used. No fixed duration of sick leave was recommended. The patients had simply been informed that a sick-leave period between 2 days and 6 weeks would probably be required, that they could resume work whenever they felt able to, and that the trial information sheet could be used as documentation for their employer. Endpoint variables were pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]), paraesthesiae (VAS), grip strength (percentage of contralateral hand) measured with a Martin vigorimeter, range of movement (ROM) percentage of contralateral hand), pillar pain (tenderness adjacent to the actual ligament release, where the prominences of the trapezial ridge and hook of hamate are closest to the skin), and duration of sick leave.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412475247">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Kruskal–Wallis one-way non-parametric analysis of variance was used to analyze pain, grip strength, ROM, pillar pain, and paraesthesia. A significance level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The cumulative rate for sick leave was analyzed by life table analyses according to the Kaplan–Meier method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412475247">Armitage et al., 2002</xref>). Sick leave in the three treatment groups of patients was compared using the log-rank test, Chi-square test for trend, and odds ratio. Retired persons, housewives, and the unemployed were excluded from the sick leave analysis.</p>

<p>A total of 90 patients with CTS were included. Two endoscopic procedures were converted to open surgery and were excluded from the study. In one case the carpal tunnel was too narrow to allow safe insertion of the knife. In the second case, the distal part of the carpal transverse ligament could not be visualized.</p>
<p>We found no significant difference in terms of postoperative pain and disappearance of paraesthesia between the treatment groups. There was a tendency towards earlier return of grip strength (significant at 1, 2, and 3 weeks postoperatively) and ROM (significant at 1 and 3 weeks postoperatively) in the endoscopic group. At 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively, we found a significant difference in grip strength in favour of both the endoscopic and classic incision groups compared with the short incision group. However, no significant difference between the groups could be found at 24 weeks of follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412475247">Figures 3</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412475247"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412475247"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412475247">6</xref>).</p>

<p>Sick leave was significantly shorter after ECTR: median 7 days vs 16 days after OCTR with short incision and 20 days after classic incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193412475247">Figure 7</xref>). The odds ratio for returning to work within 2 weeks was 5 and 1.2 times larger in the endoscopic and short incision groups, respectively, compared with the classic incision group. However, we could not find a significant difference in terms of sick leave between the classic and short incision groups. We divided cases into white and blue collar workers, and there were no significant difference in occupation between the three groups.</p>

<p>Complication rates were minimal. There were two cases of superficial infections. One case resolved spontaneously and one patient received oral antibiotics. Two patients in the endoscopic group were complicated by digital nerve neuropraxy (transient ulnar paraesthesia), which in both cases had resolved at the final follow-up. There were no cases of major complications including nerve transections and complex regional pain syndrome. The incidence of pillar pain between treatment groups was similar. One week after the operation, 66 patients experienced pillar pain. At 24 week’s follow-up, there were four patients each in the short incision and endoscopic groups, and seven patients in classic incision group.</p>

<sec id="section7-1753193412475247" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results are in accordance with the findings in the literature: faster rehabilitation and earlier return to work after ECTR, few complications but a risk of nerve branch neuropraxy with transient neurological problems. On the other hand, this study does not show any major advantage of a short incision in the palm, although sick leave is shorter compared with the classic incision. Two studies have examined the time to return to work comparing OCTR with a short incision versus classic incision. One study did not find a significant difference in effect between the two types of incisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412475247">Richter and Bruser, 1996</xref>), whereas the other study found a significant earlier return to work in favour of the short incision group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412475247">Jugovac et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the high prevalence of CTS, duration of sick leave as a consequence of CTS and carpal tunnel release is therefore of considerable socioeconomic importance. Naturally, it depends on many factors, one of them being worker’s compensation and, not the least, on the patient’s work itself. The Cochrane database 2007 shows that ECTR resulted in earlier return to work or activities of daily living than OCTR, with a weighted mean difference of 6 days (95% CI 9 to 3 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412475247">Scholten et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, sick leave in the present study was very short after ECTR, to our knowledge the shortest of all published controlled series, which may surprise, considering that almost all citizens in Denmark are covered by worker compensation systems. One explanation for the short sick leave could be that no fixed duration of sick leave was recommended and patients were told to resume work whenever they felt able to.</p>
<p>Chung and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412475247">1998</xref>) performed a thorough analysis based on measuring differences in cost and effectiveness — expressed as quality-adjusted life-years — between ECTR and OCTR. The analysis demonstrates that ECTR is clearly cost-effective, but that this effectiveness is dependent on the incidence of serious complications. For example, by assuming one percentage point greater incidence of median nerve transection in ECTR, it becomes less effective than OCTR.</p>
