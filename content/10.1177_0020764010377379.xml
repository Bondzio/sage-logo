<p>Many healthcare professionals face the issue of consent on a daily basis. This is a complex field where each individual situation requires detailed preliminary analysis and lengthy consideration in order to arrive at an appropriate clinical judgement. As each of these decisions can have serious repercussions for both the clinician and patient, preparation is crucial in preventing legal action. Dimond has tackled the issue by producing this manual as a preliminary reference for all who face such quandaries in their everyday clinical setting. This groundwork should reduce the need for lawyers whose unpopularity is attributed, by Brenda Hale in the book’s foreword, to their arrival after the event to tell those involved what they should have done. This is the second edition of the book and is part of Dimond’s Legal Aspects of Healthcare series. The work has been revised to incorporate the introduction of the Mental Capacity Act in 2005. This development had a profound impact by providing clearer guidance on the treatment of those lacking sufficient mental capacity and therefore necessitated a revision of the first edition of the book. A curious additional change is that the practitioner is referred to as female throughout in a refreshing attempt to reflect the changing face of medicine.</p>
<p>The book is broken down into 25 chapters with a summarizing overview chapter. The opening chapters outline the key concepts of consent, which are then applied later to specific situations such as euthanasia, living wills and the mentally disordered. Each legal dilemma is introduced to the reader using a clinical vignette and then discussed with reference to the relevant laws. As a conclusion, the legally correct course of action for the originally mentioned situation is offered. Diamond also includes useful websites and references for further research and clarification. The book is laid out clearly with text boxes and logical explanations drawing on past cases and their outcomes in court.</p>
<p>Although most healthcare professionals may not directly encounter all the issues mentioned in their working life, this accessible text should be useful reference material for individual situations. It will prove particularly valuable to workers in the fields of mental health and intensive care, along with struggling medical students attempting to navigate the legal minefield of consent in their everyday practice.</p>
