<abstract>
<p>Violent crime victimization can have serious mental health consequences, but what it is that makes victims at risk of mental health problems or delayed recovery from such problems is largely unknown. Previous research has focused on, amongst other things, the disabling impact of personality factors involved in the regulation of <italic>emotions</italic>. Using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel (<italic>n</italic> = 2628), this study explored whether the association between violent crime victimization and change in mental health problems over a 1-year time span also varies by trait impulsivity (TI)—a personality factor involved in regulating <italic>behavior</italic>. TI may serve as a risk factor for mental health problems, but research into this topic is scarce and inconsistent. Results suggested that low TI subjects are prone to experience an increase in mental health problems following victimization. As a possible explanation for this finding, it was speculated that subjects with low TI do not perceive themselves at risk of victimization and thus see this positive assumption shattered when victimization does occur. Results were further discussed in terms of study limitations and strengths and implications for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The psychological impact of violent crime victimization has been studied rather extensively. The majority of victims does not experience any mental health problems or recover rather quickly from the act of victimization, but a substantial minority does. Possible mental health problems recorded among victims include: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468320">Orth, Cahill, Foa, &amp; Maercker, 2008</xref>), depression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512468320">Bargai, Ben-Shakhar, &amp; Shalev, 2007</xref>), avoidance behavior, fear of crime, (phobic) anxiety, hostility, somatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468320">Norris &amp; Kaniasty, 1994</xref>), panic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512468320">Winkel, 2009</xref>), eating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512468320">Brady, 2008</xref>), substance abuse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512468320">Vermeiren, Schwab-Stone, Deboutte, Leckman, &amp; Ruchkin, 2003</xref>), insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512468320">Krakow et al., 2001</xref>), sexual dysfunctioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512468320">Letourneau, Resnick, Kilpatrick, Saunders, &amp; Best, 1996</xref>), and perceived impairment in physical (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512468320">Kawsar, Anfield, Walters, McCabe, &amp; Forster, 2004</xref>) and social functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512468320">Browne, Salomon, &amp; Bassuk, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of available data, many issues still remain unclear. An important question that requires further clarification is what makes people prone to experience mental health problems following victimization. Previous research suggests that pre-, peri-, and postcrime factors may either help victims to overcome the act of victimization or put them at risk of delayed recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512468320">Sales, Baum, &amp; Shore, 1984</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468320">Denkers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468320">Denkers &amp; Winkel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512468320">Kunst, 2010</xref>). An important determinant of mental health problems may be victims’ personality. Research into this topic is scarce and mainly cross-sectional in nature. To our knowledge, personality has been considered to influence the psychological aftermath of crime victimization in a longitudinal general population study only once. More than a decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468320">Denkers (1996</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468320">Denkers &amp; Winkel, 1997</xref>) studied the impact of six personality traits on satisfaction with life and fear of crime: hardiness, locus of control, style of evaluation, information processing style, relative vulnerability, and need for affiliation. Factor analysis suggested these traits could be distinguished in protective and sensitizing traits. Hardiness, locus of control, and style of evaluation comprised a factor that was labeled <italic>self-confidence</italic>, while information processing style, relative vulnerability, and need for affiliation were summarized by the term <italic>dependence</italic>. However, neither of these two personality configurations interacted with crime victimization to impact upon any of the studied outcome measures. Presumably, this was due to the low number of participants who had reported violent crime victimization. This forced the authors to create a victimization variable that included both violent and nonviolent crimes. An alternative explanation is that the study focused on personality types that are less relevant to the study of crime victimization and its consequences.</p>
<p>Cross-sectional research provides some additional insight into the relationship between violent crime victimization, personality, and mental health problems. Unfortunately, many of these studies have been conducted <italic>among</italic> victims of violent crime (i.e., in samples exclusively composed of victims) and have often investigated the impact of personality traits involved in regulating <italic>emotions</italic> in stressful situations, such as the tendency to evaluate emotions in a negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512468320">Tull, Jacupcak, McFadden, &amp; Roemer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512468320">Kunst, 2011</xref>) and the tendency to inhibit the expression of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512468320">Kunst, Bogaerts, &amp; Winkel, 2011</xref>). No studies to date, however, appear to have examined the potentially disabling impact of personality traits involved in regulating <italic>behavior</italic> in stressful situations. The current study attempts to fill this gap by examining the association between trait impulsivity (TI) and mental health problems following violent crime victimization.</p>
<p>TI has been defined as “a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli with (diminished) regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512468320">Moeller, Barratt, Dougherty, Schmitz, Swann, 2001</xref>, p. 1784). Impulsivity as a personality trait should be distinguished from its pathological counterpart, which is <italic>characteristic</italic> of many Axis II disorders described in the fourth revised text edition of the <italic>Diagostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512468320">American Psychological Association, 2000</xref>), such as conduct disorders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512468320">Moffitt, 1993</xref>); eating disorders; substance-related disorders; and mood disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512468320">Bushnell, Wells, &amp; Oakley-Browne, 1996</xref>). TI has been widely examined as a predictor of crime victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512468320">Higgins, Jennings, Tewksbury, &amp; Gibson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512468320">Van Wilsem, 2011</xref>), although never as a risk factor for mental health problems following victimization. Previous research occasionally investigated the association between TI and development of mental health problems in general, but provided mixed results. One of the few available studies among adults was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512468320">Granö et al. (2007)</xref>. They found that high levels of TI at baseline in a large cohort of Finnish hospital employees predicted onset of depression 2 years later. Unfortunately, depression was measured with only one item in this study. Contrary to these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512468320">Eisenberg et al. (2009)</xref> detected low levels of impulsive temperament as a predictor of internalizing problems over a 4-year time span in a convenience sample of young children. Thus, to date, both high and low levels have been found to predict mental health problems. Replications in adult populations appear to be non-existent, though.</p>
<p>Given the aforementioned, the purpose of this study was to explore whether the impact of violent crime victimization on mental health problems varies by TI in a sample of the Dutch general population. The prospective nature of our data allowed us to specifically focus on <italic>change</italic> in mental health problems (deterioration/amelioration) over a 1-year time span. Violent crime victimization was defined to include non-sexual physical violence and <italic>threat</italic> with non-sexual physical assault. Since it is difficult to provide a clear, comprehensive, and operationalizable definition of mental health problems, we particularly focused on change in symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders. This was deemed appropriate, since previous research has shown that mood and anxiety disorders are the most commonly experienced psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468320">Bijl, Ravelli, &amp; Van Zessen, 1998</xref>). Due to its exploratory nature, and in view of the mixed findings of previous research, no prior expectations were held with respect to the differential impact of high and low TI.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0886260512468320">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Study participants were drawn from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS panel includes a representative sample of 5,000 households in the Netherlands, which were randomly selected from municipal registers in the Netherlands (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lissdata.nl/lissdata">www.lissdata.nl/lissdata</ext-link>). LISS panel members are required to fill in online questionnaires about different topics every month. Households without a personal computer (PC) were assigned one for the total duration of the panel’s existence to enable non-PC owners to participate as well (approximately 5% of the sample). For the current study, only adult panel members (≥ 18 years old) who had filled out the LISS Conventional and Computer Crime Victimization (CCCV) study and the first and second waves of the LISS health study were eligible for participation. The two modules of the LISS health were administered in November 2007 and November 2008, respectively. The CCCV module was sent out for completion in February 2008 (in between the two health modules).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512468320">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Of those who had participated in the first wave of the LISS health study (<italic>N</italic> = 4886), 4,417 had also filled out the victimization questionnaire. Three thousand three hundred and seventy-four (76.4%) of them responded to the second LISS health module. Seven hundred and forty-six respondents (22.1%) had missing values for any of the study’s variables of primary interest. Thus, the final sample consisted of 2,628 subjects.</p>
<p>Nonresponse analyses suggested that subjects included in our sample were slightly older than those without complete data for the three waves (<italic>M</italic> = 47.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.0 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 45.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, they were more often male (47.2% vs. 43.6%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025) and married (65.0% vs. 61.6%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025) compared to nonrespondents.</p>
<p>Compared to national statistics (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.nl">www.cbs.nl</ext-link>), our sample appeared to contain a slight overrepresentation of women and a substantial overrepresentation of married persons.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0886260512468320">
<title>Violent crime victimization</title>
<p>Two items from the Dutch Safety Monitor (DSM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512468320">Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2008</xref>) were adapted to measure violent crime victimization. More specifically, we distinguished between four types of violent crime: (a) nonsexual physical assault requiring medical treatment; (b) nonsexual physical assault not requiring medical treatment; (c) threat with nonsexual physical assault through electronic communication means (by email, SMS, or social networks); and (d) threat with nonsexual physical assault through other communication means (by letter, telephone, or face-to-face). For each category, respondents had to indicate the number of times they had experienced that type of violence during the past 12 months. This is a common way to measure violent crime victimization in general population research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512468320">Van Dijk, Van Kesteren, &amp; Smit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512468320">Wittebrood &amp; Junger, 2002</xref>). Due to high positive skewness, victimization data were collapsed into a binary violent crime variable (yes vs. no).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260512468320">
<title>Trait impulsivity</title>
<p>The 12-item dysfunctional impulsivity subscale of the Dickman impulsivity inventory-short version (DII-short, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468320">Dickman, 1990</xref>) was used to measure TI. Items had to be filled out on a two-point categorical scale (0 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 1 = <italic>agree</italic>). Item examples are “I often say and do things without considering the consequences.” and “I frequently make appointments without thinking about whether I will be able to keep them.” The DII-short has satisfactory psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468320">Claes, Vertommen, &amp; Braspenning, 2000</xref>) and requires completion in a yes/no format. Cronbach’s α for the dysfunctional impulsivity subscale was α = .73.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512468320">
<title>Mental health problems</title>
<p>The five-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468320">Berwick et al., 1991</xref>) was used to measure mental health problems. Items need to be answered on a six-point scale. The MHI-5 has been suggested as a screener for DSM Axis I disorders in the general population, but seems particularly useful for detecting mood and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512468320">Rumpf, Meyer, Hapke, &amp; John, 2001</xref>). Example items are “How much of the time, during the last month, have you felt so down that nothing could cheer you up?” and “How much of the time, during the last month, have you felt very anxious?” Cronbach’s α for the MHI-5 in the current study was α &gt; .83 on both assessments. Wave 1 and wave 2 scores for mental health problems correlated substantially (<italic>r</italic> = .54). Our dependent variable, change in mental health problems was computed by subtracting wave 1 from wave 2 MHI scores.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512468320">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>To describe the study sample, means; standard deviations; frequencies; and percentages for all study variables, as appropriate, were computed. To understand the data more thoroughly, several additional preliminary analyses were performed. First, a paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted to determine whether a significant overall deterioration/amelioration in mental health had occurred between baseline and follow-up (i.e., MHI-5 wave 1 and wave 2 scores) for the whole sample. Second, an ANOVA was done to see whether victims and nonvictims differed in change of mental health problems at follow-up when adjusting for baseline scores for mental health problems. Third, Spearman’s ρ correlation between TI scores and change in mental health problems was computed to explore their intercorrelation.</p>
<p>Next, hierarchical ordinary-least squares regression was used to address the study’s research question (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468320">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512468320">Cleary &amp; Kessler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468320">Cohen &amp; Cohen, 1983</xref>). To detect the independent impact of violent crime victimization and TI on mental health deterioration/amelioration, change in mental health problems, was first regressed on baseline mental health problems, violent crime victimization, and TI (step 1). The interaction term between violent crime victimization and TI was then added to the model to determine whether this would improve the predictive ability of the model (step 2). If the interaction between violent crime victimization and TI proved to be significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), predicted scores for change in mental health problems were graphically displayed to interpret the direction of the interaction effect.</p>
<p>All statistical tests were performed using the software package PASW 18.0 for Windows. To avoid multicollinearity, continuous predictors were centered prior to entry into the regression model (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468320">Holmbeck, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512468320">2002</xref>). Regression analyses were powerful enough to detect small effect sizes for individual parameters (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468320">Green, 1991</xref>). We did not adjust for multiple testing, as this is not required for exploratory research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468320">Bender &amp; Lange, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Regression Analyses</title>
<p>In the first step of the regression model, violent crime victimization and TI were positively associated with change in mental health problems at follow-up. This indicated that each of these predictors were significant predictors of <italic>increase</italic> in mental health problems. By contrast, baseline mental health problems were negatively associated with change in mental health problems at follow-up and thus predicted <italic>decrease</italic> in mental health problems. The second regression step significantly improved the predictive ability of the model and showed a meaningful negative interaction between violent crime victimization and TI (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512468320">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512468320">1</xref></sup> To graphically present this interaction, predicted change in mental health problems for victim status (yes vs. no) was displayed at two levels of TI: low TI (TI = <italic>zero TI</italic>) and high TI (TI = <italic>1 SD above TI mean</italic>). Visual inspection of the bar graphs suggested that predicted increase in mental health problems for victims was higher than for nonvictims at both levels of TI, but particularly at the lower level. At this level, victims were predicted to experience an increase in mental health problems, while nonvictims were predicted to experience a decrease (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512468320">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Violent crime victimization may result in a wide array of mental health problems, but why some victims experience such problems and others not is largely unknown. Several cross-sectional victimological studies have investigated the potentially adverse impact of certain personality traits, particularly traits involved in the regulation of emotions. Unfortunately, the only study to prospectively examine the impact of personality traits in a general population sample prior to the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468320">Denkers, 1996</xref>) failed to establish interactions between respondents’ personality scores and crime victimization. As mentioned before, this may not only have been due to the low number of violent incidents among victims included in that study, but also due to focusing on personality dimensions apparently not relevant to the consequences of crime victimization. The present study attempted to broaden the empirical base by considering TI as an alternative personality characteristic that may influence the impact of violent victimization on mental health. TI is characterized by lack of restraint and inadequate control over internal impulses and has been widely examined as a predictor of violent crime victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512468320">Van Wilsem, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512468320">Vazsonyi, Cleveland, &amp; Wiebe, 2006</xref>), but never as a risk factor for mental health problems following victimization.</p>
<p>Results indicated that violent crime victimization was associated with an increase in mental health problems, but most notably in subjects with low levels of TI. This finding is highly relevant in view of the current literature. While previous research indicates that <italic>high</italic> levels of TI entail a risk for crime victimization, the current findings suggest that <italic>low</italic> levels of TI put victims at risk of mental health deterioration. A possible explanation for this finding is that persons with low TI do not perceive themselves as likely victims of crime, because they do not take any unnecessary risks. When victimization does occur, however, they are overwhelmed by the act of crime, which is incongruent to their perceptions of invulnerability (cognitive invalidation), and cannot adequately cope with its impact (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512468320">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>However, our findings did not seem to suggest that high TI protects against an increase in mental health problems. After all, a main positive effect for TI on change in mental health problems was observed as well. Moreover, the index of mental health problems used in this study is particularly appropriate for screening for mood and anxiety disorders. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that other mental health outcomes of violent crime victimization vary by TI in a different manner than observed in the current study. For example, one might speculate that victimization is more likely to be associated with development of externalizing mental health problems (e.g., maladaptive anger) in individuals with high TI than in those with low TI. A review study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468320">Bettencourt, Talley, Benjamin, and Valentine (2006)</xref> provides preliminary support for this contention. They found that most studies included in their meta-analysis had managed to establish positive relations between TI and aggressive behavior, but only under provocation conditions and when anger was experienced. Since violent crime victimization is one of the ultimate provocations in real life, victims with high levels of TI may be assumed to be at risk for (reactive) aggression.</p>
<p>When interpreting the study’s results, several methodological limitations need consideration. First, we were unable to adjust for time lapse between assessment of violent crime victimization history and date of crime. Therefore, baseline scores for mental health problems may not have reflected <italic>pre</italic>victimization perceptions of well-being for all victims. This may have introduced the so-called horse-racing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468320">Peto, 1981</xref>). Analogue to a race between fast and slow horses, where one would expect the faster horses to be in front of the slower ones halfway throughout the race, baseline scores of an outcome variable may be affected by a change that was already set into motion prior to measurement. Consequently, a strong association between baseline and follow-up scores, such as the one observed between the two assessments of mental health problems in our study, does not necessarily indicate that changes in the outcome variable depend on its initial values, but may also reflect its stability over time. With regard to the current study, this might mean that the effects violent crime victimization on change in mental health problems at follow-up have been biased downward. If so, our results may reflect a conservative estimate of the effect of victimization on change in mental health problems. Second, we exclusively relied on computerized self-report measures. Data collection was thus susceptible of self-report bias. Third, we were unable to adjust for life events that may have occurred between the two assessments of mental health problems.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study was the first to consider TI as a determinant of change in mental health problems in the aftermath of violent crime victimization. Furthermore, it did so by using a large sample that approximated the Dutch population of 18 years and older. Finally, the prospective design of the study allowed us to identify different temporal associations between victimization and change in mental health problems. Future research should build on the present study by replicating our findings with other indicators of mental health problems.</p>

<p>While adjusting for baseline scores may remove biases in regression coefficients, it may introduce others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468320">Glymour, Weuve, Berkman, Kawachi, &amp; Robins, 2005</xref>). The best way to determine whether this is the case is to simply estimate models with and without such adjustment. Therefore we performed three alternative regression models: (a) with change scores as the outcome of interest, but without adjustment for baseline scores; (b) with wave 2 values for mental health as the outcome of interest and with adjustment for baseline scores; and (c) with wave 2 values for mental health as the outcome of interest, but without adjustment for baseline scores. However, none of these analyses produced parameter estimates which substantially differed from those in the reported model (results can be obtained from the first author upon request).</p>
