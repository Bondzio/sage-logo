<abstract>
<p>Experiments were conducted in a constant-volume combustion chamber to investigate the spray and combustion characteristics of soybean biodiesel (B100) and diesel (B0). The in-cylinder density was kept at 15 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and the ambient oxygen concentrations of 21, 18, and 15 per cent were maintained to simulate no exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), medium EGR, and heavy EGR in diesel engines respectively. The ambient gas temperature was varied from 800 K to 1200 K. The in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate were measured and the liquid penetration, natural flame emission, and soot formation characteristics were studied via new optical diagnostics. The results show that the peak pressure decreases with increasing ambient gas temperature and decreasing oxygen concentration for B0, except that at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent. For B100, a higher peak pressure is obtained at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent as opposed to that of 18 per cent. A lower heat release rate is found for B100 at the oxygen concentrations of 21 per cent and 18 per cent compared to B0, while a higher value is shown at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent. The liquid penetration increases with decreasing oxygen concentration and ambient gas temperature. As the oxygen concentration increases for B0 at the ambient gas temperature from 800 K to 1000 K, the integrated natural flame luminosity (INFL) increases, while at 1200 K, the INFL at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent has the highest value. For B100, with increasing oxygen concentration, the INFL increases at 800 K and 900 K, but decreases at 1000 K and 1200 K. The total soot mass increases with decreasing oxygen concentration and the soot formation duration is longer at a lower oxygen concentration. B100 has a shorter soot formation duration and soot is dramatically reduced by burning B100. The peak soot mass for B100 at 1200 K is comparable to that for B0 at 800 K.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Diesel engines are more widely used now because of the high thermal efficiency and lower hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Numerous studies on alternative renewable fuels have been conducted in recent years due to the increasing price and shortage of fossil fuel and to the more stringent emission regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011416291">1</xref>]. As an alternative fuel, biodiesel is obtained from renewable sources like vegetable oils and animal fats through transesterification. Emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO), CO<sub>2</sub>, particulate matter (PM), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can be reduced when biodiesel is used in diesel engines, but the nitrogen oxides (NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>) emissions and brake specific fuel consumption (b.s.f.c.) are slightly higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011416291">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011416291">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to lower the flame temperature to reduce the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions and to keep the PM emission at a relatively low level, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been applied in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011416291">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011416291">10</xref>] and diesel engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011416291">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011416291">12</xref>]. EGR was found to increase the ignition delay and the combustion duration in a heavy duty direct injection (DI) diesel engine. Extremely low NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission levels can be reached at high EGR and the increase of PM emissions at high EGR might be significantly reduced in a certain range by using high injection pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011416291">11</xref>]. However, the increase of the inlet temperature with EGR may have contrary effects on combustion and emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011416291">12</xref>]. Hountalas and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011416291">13</xref>] studied the effect of the cooled EGR gas temperature level for various EGR rates on the performance and emissions of a turbocharged DI heavy-duty diesel engine using a multizone combustion model. The results show that the reduction of the EGR gas temperature has a positive effect on b.s.f.c. and soot emission, while only a small positive effect on NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>A reduced-order dynamic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011416291">14</xref>] and a single-zone combustion model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407011416291">15</xref>] were also used to investigate the engine performance and thermal and emission characteristics with the application of EGR in engines. The location of premixed burn occurred further downstream from the nozzle and more mass was mixed into the premixed-burn region with EGR, while the equivalence ratio of the mixture remained the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407011416291">16</xref>]. Al-Qurashi and Boehman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011416291">17</xref>] investigated the effect of EGR on the oxidative reactivity of diesel engine soot in a common-rail DI light-duty diesel engine. It is suggested that EGR has a strong impact on the physical properties of the soot, resulting in an enhanced oxidation rate, and the highly reactive soot might be achieved by manipulating the physical properties of the soot via EGR. It is shown that the soot produced under 0 per cent EGR strictly followed an external burning mode with no internal burning, while the soot generated under 20 per cent EGR had slow external burning and rapid internal burning. The combustion of the first firing cycle can be improved significantly by introducing a certain amount of EGR as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407011416291">18</xref>]. Compared with high-pressure moderately cooled EGR, a decrease by approximately 50 per cent in NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission while maintaining the PM emission level can be obtained with supplemental cooled EGR using a low-pressure EGR loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407011416291">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The benefits of using biodiesel in diesel engines have been reported by many previous studies. EGR was found to have more effect on biodiesel combustion compared to diesel combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407011416291">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407011416291">21</xref>]. The combination of 21 per cent EGR and emulsified biodiesel with 30 per cent water showed a significant reduction of NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> without increasing the smoke emission in a single-cylinder DI diesel engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407011416291">22</xref>]. Pradeep and Sharma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407011416291">23</xref>] investigated the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> control strategy in a biodiesel fuelled compression ignition engine using hot EGR. The practical problems faced while using a cooled EGR system were avoided with hot EGR. It is also found that when a similar amount of EGR was used in diesel and biodiesel combustion, a similar reduction in NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission was achieved, but the smoke emission was significantly lower in the case of biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407011416291">24</xref>]. EGR can also be used to initiate the low temperature combustion (LTC). Simultaneous reduction of NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> and soot was achieved when the ignition delay was prolonged by more than 50 per cent from the case with no EGR at low-load conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954407011416291">25</xref>]. The reduction of NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission was also observed by Karra <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407011416291">26</xref>] for biodiesel–diesel blends when using EGR in a multicylinder diesel engine under the LTC regimes.</p>
<p>The objective of the current experimental study is to investigate the different transient spray and combustion characteristics of biodiesel and diesel at various EGR rates and ambient gas temperatures. In this study, the liquid penetration was measured to analyse the fuel spray characteristic, the natural flame emission was recorded to study the combustion flame, and the soot formation was analysed using a new technique called forward illumination light extinction (FILE). The combustion pressure and heat release rate, liquid penetration depth, natural flame emission, and total soot mass data of pure soybean biodiesel were obtained at different ambient gas temperatures under different EGR rates, and were then compared to the results obtained using diesel fuel.</p>

<title>2 Experimental Apparatus and Procedure</title>
<p>The experiments were conducted in a constant-volume combustion chamber, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011416291">Fig. 1</xref>. This chamber is able to simulate the thermodynamic condition inside a diesel engine. A previous publication provides an in-depth discussion of the combustion chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954407011416291">27</xref>]. The operating conditions, such as the ambient pressure, temperature, density, injection duration, and injection pressure, etc., were adjusted accordingly, so that a wide range of diesel in-cylinder thermodynamic conditions could be simulated.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0954407011416291" position="float">
<label>Fig. 1</label>
<caption><p>Schematic of the combustion chamber</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011416291-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The combustion chamber was optimized for optical access and was fitted with a Caterpillar direct-injection hydraulic-actuated electronic-controlled unit fuel injector (HEUI). The injector has six orifices with separate chambers for hydraulic oil and fuel. It is mounted in the head and pointing upwards with the spray making a 22° ascension angle measured from the head surface. The fuel comes out of the nozzle tip at around 1.2 ms from the moment the injector is triggered. The combustion chamber has a bore of 110 mm and a height of 65 mm. A mixing fan, a spark plug, and a pressure sensor are installed in the chamber wall. Optical access is provided by Dynasil 1100 fused silica located on the top and one side of the chamber, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011416291">Fig. 1</xref>. The optical windows have high ultraviolet (UV) transmittance down to 190 nm. The chamber is heated with cartridge electric heaters to simulate an engine wall temperature of 380 K and to prevent water condensation on the windows. The end window on the top of the chamber is used for this study and one of the six spray jets is examined.</p>
<p>The experimental procedure used to simulate diesel fuel injection and combustion processes in a constant-volume combustion chamber was developed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954407011416291">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954407011416291">30</xref>]. The chamber is first filled with different gases at a specified density, and then the mixture is ignited using the spark plug, producing a hot and high-pressure environment in the chamber as in the real engine. After the premixed gas combustion occurs, the mixture within the chamber slowly cools down due to the heat loss through the chamber wall and windows, and as a result the chamber pressure decreases. When the desired pressure is reached, the injector is triggered and the fuel injection, autoignition, and combustion processes ensue.</p>
<p>The density, temperature, and composition of the ambient gas inside the chamber at the time of injection can be varied to simulate different working conditions in a diesel engine. The chamber used in this study allows an ambient density up to 30 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which is about 25 times the room air density. Acetylene is chosen as the premixed burnable gas and different amounts of oxygen/nitrogen determine how much oxygen is left in the chamber after premixed gas combustion. For example, to simulate the oxygen concentration of 21 per cent and the density of 15 kg/m<sup>3</sup> inside the chamber for spray combustion, 4 per cent acetylene, 30.6 per cent oxygen, and 65.4 per cent nitrogen (by volume) are needed in the mixture. That will require 60 per cent air and 35.9 per cent O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixture gas (50 per cent oxygen balanced in nitrogen, by volume). The molecular weight of this mixture is 0.029 738 kg/mol, which is very close to that of air. The resulting burnt mixture will still have 21 per cent oxygen left. Different oxygen concentrations (simulation of different EGR rates) and densities can then be simulated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407011416291">Table 1</xref> shows the operating conditions considered in this study. Note that the operating condition of 1000 K ambient gas temperature and 15 kg/m<sup>3</sup> ambient density resembles the top dead centre (TDC) condition in a typical large bowl diesel engine with low r/min. The ambient oxygen concentrations of 21 per cent and 15 per cent correspond to running the engine with no EGR and heavy EGR respectively. However, the burned gases used in the present investigation and used as EGR are not exactly the same as the real EGR in a diesel engine.</p>

<title>3 Combustion Diagnostics Techniques</title>
<p>A high pulse rate copper vapour laser was used as the light source and was synchronized with a Phantom v. 7.1 high-speed digital video camera. The image resolution, frame rate, and exposure time for the camera were 256 × 256 pixels, 15 000 fps and 3 µs respectively.</p>
<p>Three different optical diagnostics were employed in this study, which are FILE, light-scattering, and natural flame luminosity imaging techniques. The new FILE method was developed and verified by Xu and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954407011416291">33</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the FILE technique has the ability to provide a two-dimensional time-resolved quantitative soot measurement while using only one optical window, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011416291">Fig. 2</xref>. Unlike the back illumination technique, where two windows are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954407011416291">34</xref>], the FILE technique has a light diffuser placed behind the flame plume, so that the light source and camera can be located at the same side of the flame through one window. The total soot mass is calculated by summing the values of all pixels in each FILE image. If the area represented by each pixel is a square with a dimension of Δ<italic>r</italic>, then the soot mass at each pixel will be given as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954407011416291">35</xref>]</p>

<p>The light-scattering technique was adopted to study the liquid jet penetration with combustion. The liquid penetration in this paper refers to a continuous dense liquid region measured from the injector tip. The set-up is identical to the FILE setup, except that no light diffuser was used. Since the chamber wall has a much lower reflectivity compared to that of the liquid jet, more incident light will be reflected back to the camera from the liquid jet, eliminating much of the background signal. The masking and analysis of the spray images are similar to the method reported by Naber and Siebers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954407011416291">36</xref>]. The threshold intensity used to separate the spray region (with a high light intensity) from the background ambient gas (with a low light intensity) is determined from the cumulative intensity histogram of each image. Two peaks appear in the histogram, including one corresponding to the ambient gas region with low intensity and another corresponding to the spray region with high intensity. An intensity midway between the two peaks in the cumulative histogram is chosen as the threshold intensity of this image. Pixels with intensity levels below the threshold are defined as ambient gas while pixels with values above the threshold are defined as liquid spray.</p>
<p>Natural flame luminosity images were recorded to visualize the combustion processes. The integrated natural flame luminosity (INFL) was obtained by summing all the pixel values of a natural flame luminosity image at a given time. The natural flame luminosity consists of two parts: chemiluminescence and soot luminosity. However, chemiluminescence is a relatively weak natural light emission to identify the autoignition of the spray. Usually it will not be detected by a conventional camera, but an intensified camera can give a spatial distribution of the chemiluminescence. Soot luminosity is a product of thermal emission of soot particles that are heated within the combustion flame. The intensity of the image depends on the soot volume fraction and the temperature of the soot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954407011416291">37</xref>]. Chemiluminescence occurs throughout the entire heat release process, but the relatively low signal is overcome by soot luminosity seen shortly after ignition. The high-speed digital video camera was used to capture the natural flame luminosity directly. The flame luminosity imaging is a relatively qualitative measurement of soot luminosity with arbitrary sensitivity depending on the camera set-up. More information about these techniques can be found in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954407011416291">27</xref>].</p>

<title>4.1 In-cylinder combustion pressure and heat release rate results</title>
<p>The in-cylinder combustion pressure and heat release rate results of B0 and B100 at different ambient gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011416291">Fig. 3</xref>. The data acquisition process began at the same time the injector was triggered. The ignition delay is defined as the interval between the moment the fuel injection begins and the heat release rate curve goes from negative to positive for the first time.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0954407011416291" position="float">
<label>Fig. 3</label>
<caption><p>In-cylinder combustion pressure and heat release rate of B0 (left) and B100 (right) at different ambient gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011416291-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The peak combustion pressure is higher at a lower ambient gas temperature due to less heat transfer and radiation through the chamber wall and windows. With increasing oxygen concentration at a fixed ambient gas temperature, the peak combustion pressure increases slightly for B0 because of the more efficient combustion at a relatively higher oxygen concentration, except that at low ambient gas temperature conditions (800 K and 900 K). This exception is due to the longer ignition delay at a low ambient gas temperature, which results in more time for the fuel to mix with ambient oxygen, leading to a more efficient combustion despite the effect of low oxygen concentration. However, for B100, it is also shown that the highest peak combustion pressure occurs at the oxygen concentration of 21 per cent, but the peak pressure is higher at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent than at the oxygen concentration of 18 per cent at all ambient gas temperatures.</p>
<p>A longer ignition delay is observed for both B0 and B100 at a lower oxygen concentration; more obvious differences can be seen at a lower ambient gas temperature. At the oxygen concentrations of 21 per cent and 18 per cent, the heat release rate of B0 is higher than B100. This resulted from the higher heating value of B0 than B100. While at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent, which is the simulation of the heavy EGR rate, the heat release rate of B100 has a higher value than B0 due to the oxygenated species inside biodiesel, resulting in a more efficient combustion for B100 at a low oxygen concentration. At a certain oxygen concentration, the ignition delay is also shorter at a higher ambient gas temperature, due to the higher evaporation rate in a hotter environment.</p>
<p>A significant transition from premixed combustion to mixing controlled combustion can be observed in the heat release rate results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011416291">Fig. 3</xref> for both fuels. For B0, at 800 K ambient gas temperature, the combustion is a premixed-like combustion, while both premixed combustion and mixing controlled combustion are found at ambient gas temperatures from 900 K to 1100 K. The combustion then becomes mixing controlled combustion at 1200 K. The combustion at the ambient gas temperature of 900 K is premixed dominant combustion, and at 1000 K and 1100 K it is mixing controlled dominant combustion. For B100, the two-stage combustion can be seen as the ambient gas temperature is varied from 800 K to 1100 K, and becomes mixing controlled combustion at 1200 K.</p>

<title>4.2 Light-scattering results for liquid jet penetration</title>
<p>Six typical light-scattering images of B0 and B100 at the ambient gas temperature of 800 K, oxygen concentration of 15 per cent, and the calculated liquid penetration depth of both fuels at different ambient gas temperatures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011416291">Fig. 4</xref>. Only one of six jets is studied. In each image, the time stamp is shown at the top left and a ‘J’ label at the top right represents the measurement of the liquid jet. The injector orifice is marked at the top centre while the chamber wall is at the bottom of the image. The liquid jet penetration depth is clearly demonstrated using the light-scattering technique and the flame is totally filtered out.</p>

<label>Fig. 4</label>
<caption><p>Light-scattering images of B0 and B100 at the ambient gas temperature of 800 K, oxygen concentration of 15 per cent (top), and the liquid penetration depth of B0 (bottom left) and B100 (bottom right) at different ambient gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011416291-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Fuel comes out of the injector nozzle at around 1.26 ms for B100, earlier than that of B0. The reason for this is that the high bulk modulus of biodiesel results in it being less compressible than diesel and therefore comes out of the nozzle a little earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954407011416291">38</xref>]. Also it can be seen from those images that the spreading angle of biodiesel is smaller than diesel because of the higher viscosity of biodiesel than diesel fuel.</p>
<p>With the liquid penetration depth determined from each image, the jet penetration evolution with time of B0 and B100 at different oxygen concentrations and ambient gas temperatures were obtained, as shown in the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011416291">Fig. 4</xref>. The first small pulse of the liquid penetration curve is the pilot injection, which is followed by the main injection. After the fuel penetrates into the chamber, it soon reaches the peak penetration depth, where the fuel evaporation and the liquid jet injection reach a balance. The liquid jet then keeps at this penetration depth with some fluctuations until the injection ends.</p>
<p>The liquid penetration depth increases with decreasing oxygen concentration for both B0 and B100 due to the longer fuel–air mixing time at a lower oxygen concentration before autoignition, such that a longer time is available for fuel to penetrate. With increasing ambient gas temperature, however, the liquid penetration depth decreases. The reason is that a higher ambient gas temperature and flame temperature results in quicker evaporation and a shorter ignition delay.</p>
<p>For B0, the oxygen concentration has little effect on the penetration depth as the ambient gas temperature changes from 900 K to 1200 K, while a more obvious effect is found at 800 K when the oxygen concentration changes from 18 per cent to 15 per cent. However, for B100, the effect of the oxygen concentration on penetration depth is more significant, especially when the oxygen concentration changes from 18 per cent to 15 per cent, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011416291">Fig. 4</xref>. The penetration depth is longer for B100 than B0 at all tested conditions. The explanations are as follows: first, the higher viscosity and boiling point of biodiesel result in slower evaporation and larger fuel droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954407011416291">39</xref>], such that each droplet will have a higher inertia for penetration, causing a longer liquid penetration depth; and second, the high bulk modulus and density of biodiesel makes it less compressible, so the actual injection pressure is slightly higher for biodiesel than diesel under the same hydraulic oil pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954407011416291">39</xref>].</p>

<title>4.3 Natural flame emission measurement results</title>
<p>Natural flame emission images of B0 and B100 at 21 per cent oxygen concentration and 800 K ambient gas temperature and the integrated natural flame luminosity (INFL) results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011416291">Fig. 5</xref> to illustrate the effects of oxygen concentration and ambient gas temperature on flame development within the chamber. Six pictures are shown for each fuel to present the flame development processes. The flame duration in this paper is defined as the duration between the moment the INFL curve goes from zero to positive and the INFL curve goes from positive to zero.</p>

<caption><p>Natural flame emission images of B0 and B100 at the ambient gas temperature of 800 K, oxygen concentration of 21 per cent (top), and the INFL of B0 and B100 at different ambient gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011416291-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>It is very interesting to notice from those images that the combustion flame appears later and ends earlier for B100 than B0. Lower luminosity can be observed for B100 as well. The INFL results between 1.0 ms and 7.0 ms were obtained by summing up all the pixel values of a natural flame luminosity image at a given time. The INFL decreases with decreasing ambient gas temperature for both fuels. This is because at a lower ambient gas temperature, the combustion temperature decreases and the ignition delay is longer, and the fuel then has more time to mix with the ambient gas. More oxygen is entrained to the fuel jet before the autoignition occurs, reducing the soot mass and hence its luminosity decreases. B100 has a lower INFL than B0 at all cases because a lower soot mass is released during combustion, as will be shown in section 4.4.</p>
<p>The flame appears later at a lower oxygen concentration for both fuels at all ambient gas temperatures. This can be explained by the longer fuel–air mixing time at a lower oxygen concentration before autoignition occurs, which results in a longer ignition delay. However, the flame of B100 appears later and ends earlier compared to B0 for all cases, indicating a shorter flame duration for B100. In terms of the flame appearance time, oxygen concentration has a more significant effect on B0 than B100, especially at a lower ambient gas temperature. At the ambient gas temperature from 800 K to 1000 K, the flame appears almost at the same time for B100 at the oxygen concentrations of 18 per cent and 15 per cent.</p>
<p>The INFL decreases with decreasing oxygen concentration for B0 at the ambient gas temperature from 800 K to 1000 K. This is because B0 combustion at a lower oxygen concentration lowers the in-cylinder combustion temperature. Although there is a slightly higher soot mass at lower oxygen concentrations, the soot luminosity remains low. However, the INFL at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent, the ambient gas temperature of 1200 K has a higher value compared to other oxygen concentrations at 1200 K. This results from both the high ambient gas temperature and high soot mass at 1200 K.</p>
<p>It is very important to notice that with decreasing oxygen concentration, the INFL decreases at the ambient gas temperature from 800 K to 900 K but increases from 1000 K to 1200 K for B100. At the ambient gas temperature from 800 K to 900 K, the explanation is similar to that of B0. When the ambient gas temperature rises to 1000 K and 1200 K; however, the increase in INFL is due to: first, a higher ambient gas temperature results in a high combustion temperature and soot mass; second, decreasing the oxygen concentration slightly lowers the B100 combustion temperature but increases soot mass; and third, the high oxygenated content inside B100 leads to a much higher combustion temperature inside the chamber. Those results indicate that the oxygen concentration affects B100 and B0 combustion in a different way.</p>

<title>4.4 FILE measurement results of soot formation</title>
<p>A series of two-dimensional FILE measurement soot distribution images of B0 and B100 at the ambient gas temperature of 800 K and the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent from a representative combustion cycle are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011416291">Fig. 6</xref>. The liquid jet is shown in FILE images because the reflected light from the liquid jet is much weaker than from the diffuser. The small rise of the total soot mass curves after the start of fuel injection and before the autoignition is mainly the result of a contribution from the liquid jet.</p>

<caption><p>Soot formation images of B0 and B100 at the ambient gas temperature of 800 K, oxygen concentration of 15 per cent (top), and total soot mass of B0 and B100 at different ambient gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954407011416291-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>From the line-of-sight results in the soot distribution images, great differences can be found in the soot formation process of B0 and B100. In most cases, the soot mass is very low when B100 is used. Soot mass increases with decreasing oxygen concentration for both fuels at all ambient gas temperatures. This is because less oxygen is available at a lower oxygen concentration, resulting in more soot in the combustion process. It is also found that the total soot mass increases with increasing ambient gas temperature mainly due to a shorter ignition delay at a higher ambient gas temperature. A shorter ignition delay results in less oxygen entrained into the fuel jet. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011416291">Figure 6</xref> also shows that the combustion of B100 reduces soot dramatically compared to B0 at all conditions. At 800 K ambient gas temperature, near-zero soot mass is detected during the combustion of B100 at the oxygen concentration of 21 per cent. The total soot mass for B100 at the ambient gas temperature of 1200 K is comparable to that for B0 at 800 K in the LTC mode.</p>
<p>The soot formation duration increases with decreasing oxygen concentration due to the higher soot generation rate, lower flame temperature, and slower soot oxidation rate at a lower oxygen concentration. It is also very interesting to see that B100 has a shorter soot formation duration than B0 in all studied conditions. The oxygen concentration seems to have more effect on the soot formation process when the oxygen concentration changes from 18 per cent to 15 per cent than from 21 per cent to 18 per cent for both fuels.</p>

<title>5 Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, the pure European low sulphur diesel (B0) and soybean biodiesel (B100) were experimentally investigated in a constant-volume combustion chamber. The in-cylinder density was kept at 15 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to simulate the real engine in-cylinder density. The tested ambient gas temperature was varied from 800 K to 1200 K and the in-cylinder oxygen concentrations of 21 per cent, 18 per cent, and 15 per cent were used to simulate the real engine operating conditions of no EGR, medium EGR, and heavy EGR respectively. The in-cylinder combustion pressure, heat release rate, liquid penetration depth, natural flame emission, and total soot mass results under different operating conditions were obtained to give an overall understanding of diesel and biodiesel combustion. Based on the results shown above, the following important findings and conclusions are summarized:</p>
<list id="list1-0954407011416291" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The peak combustion pressure is higher for a lower ambient gas temperature due to less heat transfer and radiation through the chamber wall and windows. Generally, higher peak combustion pressure occurs at a higher oxygen concentration for B0, while for B100, the peak combustion pressure is higher at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent than 18 per cent under all tested ambient gas temperatures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The higher heating value of B0 results in a higher heat release rate for B0 than B100 at the oxygen concentration of 21 per cent and 18 per cent. However, at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent (heavy EGR), the heat release rate of B100 is higher than B0 at all ambient gas temperatures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although a significant transition from premixed combustion to mixing controlled combustion can be observed for both fuels, the ambient gas temperature at which the transition occurs is different.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The liquid penetration depth increases with decreasing oxygen concentration and ambient gas temperature. However, the change of oxygen concentration has a more significant effect on the penetration depth of B100.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The INFL increases with increasing ambient gas temperature for both fuels at all oxygen concentrations. However, the oxygen concentration affects B100 and B0 combustion in a different way. For B0, the INFL increases with increasing oxygen concentration at the ambient gas temperature of 800 K to 1000 K, while at the oxygen concentration of 15 per cent and ambient gas temperature of 1200 K, the INFL has a slightly higher value. For B100, the INFL increases with increasing oxygen concentration at the ambient gas temperature from 800 K to 900 K, but it increases with decreasing oxygen concentration at the ambient gas temperature from 1000 K to 1200 K.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The flame appears later and ends earlier for B100 compared to B0 under the same operating conditions, indicating a shorter flame duration for biodiesel. The flame appears later at a lower oxygen concentration for both fuels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The total soot mass increases with increasing ambient gas temperature and decreasing oxygen concentration. The soot formation duration increases with decreasing oxygen concentration and B100 has a shorter soot formation duration than B0 at all studied conditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Biodiesel reduces soot dramatically compared to diesel at all tested conditions. At the ambient gas temperature of 800 K, near-zero soot mass is detected for B100 at the oxygen concentration of 21 per cent. Soot for biodiesel at 1200 K is comparable to that for diesel at 800 K in the LTC mode.</p></list-item>
