<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patient and public participation has been a strong trend in health care services in western countries during the last decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011423464">Tritter, 2009</xref>). It builds on ideas of democracy, consumer rights and individual responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011423464">Martin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011423464">Mizrahi, Humphreys, &amp; Torres, 2009</xref>). A goal for patient participation is the acknowledgement of patient experience and the patient as an expert of his or her health, indicating a more equal status of patient and expert knowledge. Such ideas suggest a development of clinical practice that emphasizes participation and choice and in which the patient is viewed as an active agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011423464">Coulter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011423464">Salmon &amp; Hall, 2003</xref>). Patients are expected to be active agents in coping with their disease. As a consequence, participation presupposes that the patient is a rational and responsible individual. However, not all citizens or patients are seen as rational and responsible. The lack of rational features is sometimes what defines mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011423464">Rogers, Lacey, &amp; Pilgrim, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In mental health services, expert accounts are privileged over lay accounts so that lay persons’ claims about being rational could be discounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011423464">Hamilton &amp; Roper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011423464">Rogers et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, mental health patients may be defined by service providers as ‘difficult’ if they have unusual help-seeking behaviours or personal behaviours that some find challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011423464">Koekkoek, Hutschemaekers, van Meijel, &amp; Schene, 2011</xref>). The characterization of patients as difficult leaves such patients at risk of not getting the help they need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011423464">Koekkoek, van Meijel, &amp; Hutschemaekers, 2006</xref>). Patient participation is sometimes directed solely towards patients with specific characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011423464">Hamann et al., 2009</xref>), leaving other patients without their right to participate. The balancing of the ethical principles of autonomy and beneficence could be a challenge in mental health services if health professionals judge the patient to have an absence of rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011423464">Breeze, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasing patient participation while characterizing mental health services users as unable to act in their best interest indicates a paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011423464">Canvin, Bartlett, &amp; Pinfold, 2005</xref>). If patient participation is built on ideas of responsible and self-sufficient individuals, defining some patients as ‘difficult’ and irrational raises questions about the potential for patient participation in mental health care. The aim of this article was therefore to investigate mental health service users’ and providers’ views on patient participation during episodes of mental illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764011423464" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a qualitative interview study among service users and health professionals at a mental health community hospital in central Norway that offers both inpatient and outpatient treatment. In the Norwegian mental health care system, community mental health hospitals have been established to provide specialized, easily accessible inpatient and outpatient services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011423464">Storm &amp; Davidson, 2010</xref>). The recruitment and data collection took place in 2009. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics. All participants gave written consent to participate.</p>
<sec id="section8-0020764011423464">
<title>Participant recruitment</title>
<p>We recruited patients, public representatives, health professionals and hospital managers. The sampling strategy was theoretical and informants were recruited continuously alongside the analysis to ensure variation and to reach saturation. To recruit patients, invitations were mailed to a random sample of 60 patients. Sixteen patients returned contact information and a consent form; 15 of them were interviewed, while one patient was excluded because she spoke neither Norwegian nor English. Two patients recruited themselves by responding to a note posted in the inpatient unit. In addition, three user representatives were recruited. Sampling of health service providers was done to ensure variety in gender, age, unit representation, experience and health service provider groups. All managers and mid-level managers were invited to be interviewed, and those participating in the interviews suggested subsequent informants among the staff at the researchers’ request and according to the sampling criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764011423464">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Pre-set interview guides were developed for service users and service providers, respectively. These were evaluated and modified during the data collection. The guides had questions on experiences with, and attitudes towards, patient participation.</p>
<p>The first and second authors carried out the interviews, which were conducted at the hospital, in the interviewer’s office or in the patients’ homes. Service users were interviewed individually. Most health professionals were interviewed individually, except for three interviews that had two informants. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The quotes are identified with the type of participant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020764011423464">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>A project group consisting of all authors undertook the analysis using a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011423464">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). One author had service user experience from mental health services. Sampling was done until theoretical saturation, when no new topics emerged in new interviews. The authors coded the first transcripts by hand, and each author coded some interviews alone and some together with the group. The group discussed and modified the codes until deciding upon a list of basic codes. All interviews were subsequently coded into categories using QSR Nvivo 8.0. The project group refined the categories by continuous discussions and confirmed them by constant comparison with the transcripts.</p>
<p>After categorization, each code was made subject to meaning condensation and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011423464">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2008</xref>). One of the emerging categories encompassed data from users and providers that characterized mental illness as such. Another category encompassed data on how users and providers perceived the practice of patient participation during mental illness. Subsequent analysis of these categories illuminated the challenges regarding participation during mental illness, and how users and providers perceived this to be handled.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section12-0020764011423464">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 17 patients, three service user representatives, 17 health professionals and eight managers. One of the three service user representatives was female, while 11 of the 17 patients were female. Patients were aged 21–69, and varied in diagnosis, time in treatment and whether they had experience of in- or outpatient treatment. Of the 17 health professionals, 13 were female. Professionals were psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses (with and without speciality in mental health), enrolled nurses, physiotherapists and from other health professions. Of the eight managers, three were female. Managers and health professionals varied in age, work site and time working in mental health services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0020764011423464">
<title>Mental illness as a challenge in patient participation</title>
<p>Both users and health professionals characterized patient participation as challenging when patients suffered from strong symptoms in some phases of illness. First, both service users and health professionals focused on how mental illness could lead to a distorted world view implying poor insight into the patients’ disease or even problems acknowledging having an illness. Second, difficulties in verbal communication were perceived as an obstacle for participation during the worst phases of illness. A third aspect that both service users and professionals focused on as a challenge towards patient participation was the patients’ ability to cooperate during phases with strong symptoms. Although users and professionals agreed upon these elements as important, their interpretation of each element differed.</p>
<sec id="section14-0020764011423464">
<title>Service users’ views</title>
<p>For service users, absence of insight rendered patients unable to make good judgements for themselves, making it difficult to participate in decision-making during all phases of illness.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Reason and such, it is unfortunately set aside. (Service user 1a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lack of insight was interpreted as an outcome of mental illness but also as part of what had caused mental illness or the aggravated state. As such, lack of insight would signify that the user was unlikely to choose what was in his or her best interest. The best interest of a person in lack of insight was seen as what could make the person better.</p>
<p>A complexity of emotions would hinder users in describing appropriately how they felt. Such situations would influence service users’ ability to communicate with health professionals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You are nearly unable to answer for yourself you know. They tell you stuff and you just answer: “yeah, whatever”. (Service user 7a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these service users, communication was coloured by the context of mental health services. Having complex emotions, it was easier to submit to what they were told to do than to participate in discussions. Communicating about how one really felt was not just dependent on internal states. Rather, patients’ lack of ability to communicate was connected to patients’ trust in the therapist. If health professionals did not interact well, patients would be reluctant towards communication.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mentally ill patients, we are often persons who are very sensitive and very observant towards other people’s reactions and such. And all it takes is a look… if I feel that the other person is disinterested in listening to me talking, then… (Service user 5b)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As such, difficulties communicating could influence cooperation, and difficulties in cooperating would be an obstacle towards patient participation. Service users had experienced that patients would have trouble participating during the most ill phases when they had trouble with decision-making, had few opinions about their options and preferred others to make the decisions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult [to have patient participation] when I’m not well, not feeling well myself. … Then it is difficult to take part in decision-making and in delegating tasks to the [professional] team. (Service user 10b)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0020764011423464">
<title>Health professionals’ views</title>
<p>For health professionals, patients’ phases of poor insight included difficulties in judging what was good for oneself. Health professionals also focused on patients’ lack of insight into disease and treatment as problematic for participation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is often a lack of insight in the disease, at least during some periods – maybe especially at the time of submission. (Mental health professional 6a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patients had been experienced by health professionals as having a lack of verbal abilities during severe phases of illness. Understanding patient participation as dependent on communication about patients’ opinions, communication became a barrier to patient participation during these phases.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At least some users might have problems expressing their opinion. (Mental health professional 2a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some patients were seen as reluctant to cooperate. Health professionals described challenges in cooperation when patients had trouble accepting services, missed out on appointments, opted to change therapist or had ambivalent wishes. Patients could, however, also be too dependent or wish to be taken care of to a degree that the health service provider could not offer.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes we give up if the patient is reluctant towards that way of cooperating. (Mental health professional 2b)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patients’ reluctance towards the ways of the mental health service system had been experienced as an obstacle in patient participation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0020764011423464">
<title>Accomplishing patient participation during difficult phases: A shift in responsibility</title>
<p>For both users and health professionals it was pertinent that patient participation changed when patients lacked insight and had trouble communicating and cooperating. Service users primarily described a wish to be taken care of, but did not elaborate on how this should happen. Rather, they highlighted a need for professional advice. Both parties described that a change of responsibility was necessary when patients were seen as unable to act in their own best interest. The best interest of a patient was defined as what would lead to better mental health or what would help them to avoid injuring themself either physically or socially. During such phases of illness, patient participation was redefined to health professionals’ taking care of the patient’s best interest rather than improving choice and democratic ideals. Health professionals had different strategies to help patients participate in such phases, even when the patient was reluctant. Offering advice and support in order to empower patients to participate, they provided patients with information, simple choices and enhanced motivation.</p>
<sec id="section17-0020764011423464">
<title>Exchanging information and knowledge</title>
<p>Health professionals would inform patients about treatment options, aspects of the diagnosis and practicalities concerning the patients’ situation. Moreover, during users’ poorest illness phases, information had a value in itself. If a patient resisted cooperation, health professionals would still provide information. However, it was professional knowledge that was emphasized as important to provide. Information from patient to health care providers was not only seen as knowledge transfer but also as being respected, heard and seen.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, the answer is to provide information. (Mental health professional 10a)</p>
<p>And to explain about diagnosis and how we think about it, that’s where we have huge pedagogical challenges. But we have to a large extent succeeded with some of these patients. (Mental health professional 4b)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both professionals and users described that knowledge could empower users to act in their best interest. Users’ previous experiences with feeling a lack of knowledge about mental illness had been experienced as disempowering.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because everything is new and unfamiliar and a bit frightening maybe and you don’t have enough knowledge about the disease or the healthcare system to participate very much, that’s how I see it. But at the same time, in my opinion, participation should increase tellingly as soon as you are ready yourself. (Service user 4b)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Users saw health professionals as having more knowledge about solutions for their illness than they could have themselves during their most ill phases. Service providers’ expert status led users to see them as better equipped to take responsibility for decision-making and considerations about patient participation during these phases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0020764011423464">
<title>Reducing the number of choices</title>
<p>One way that health professionals could take responsibility when patients were unable to choose what was in their best interest was to reduce the demands for choice and decision-making, for instance through making choices for patients. Professionals described that they occasionally made decisions that were in opposition to patients’ wishes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the one hand, we can’t submit to their withdrawal or passivity or… If we do, we don’t provide any treatment, so we have to challenge them and try to motivate and push them to get going, and sometimes you get close to, or, it might look like, you go against the wishes and needs of the patient. (Mental health professional 8a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Questions about when and how patients could participate became dependent on professional judgements. There were two situations, in particular, that made patient participation difficult. One was if patients were negative or passive towards treatment. The second was if the patient had been diagnosed with a disorder that had changing opinions often as one of its symptoms. Accepting reversed wishes was seen as anti-therapeutic and raised a conflict between health professionals’ professional judgement and a focus on patient participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0020764011423464">
<title>Enhancing patients’ motivation</title>
<p>The last strategy for taking responsibility was to motivate patients towards decisions that health professionals saw as being in the patients’ best interest. There were different techniques for motivation, for instance providing ‘offers too good to refuse’ or giving the patient two choices, of which the patient had to choose one. Alternatively, health professionals could give the patient ‘a kick out of bed’, which meant that patients were urged and motivated to do what the professionals considered to be in his or her best interest.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In this ward we have many users who have experienced assaults both physically and mentally. So tempting and luring are my tools, but if they have a clear depression and do not have a history of abuse or assault, then I will use other methods. Then we might rather give them a kick out of bed. (Mental health professional 1a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For health professionals, the line between treatment and patient participation was obliterated. It became a pedagogical challenge to motivate patients into patient participation while maintaining the patients’ best interest.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0020764011423464">
<title>Maintaining respect and dignity</title>
<p>During phases of illness that made patient participation difficult, patient participation could be redefined, as described above. However, maintaining respect and dignity was seen as essential by all parties and through all phases. There were two aspects of respect from health professionals towards service users. One was about seeing users as individuals with worth no matter how ill they became. This level was described as absolute and not to be redefined during any circumstances.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I see it as our respect for the patient… that is, our respect for the patient as an independent individual that is here for our help. Not someone who should be persuaded… respect as integrity. That’s my attitude. (Mental health professional 13b)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other level was about who were able, and allowed, to take responsibility of choice and actions. When health professionals had to take charge and help patients to act in their own best interest, it was important that they did not overrule all aspects of the patients’ decision-making. To maintain patient participation while helping mentally ill service users, health professionals had to avoid taking too much responsibility. Users described a close connection between being encouraged and asked to participate and feeling respected and treated respectfully. Participation could give them a sense of being valued as individuals despite mental illness. This could be carried out through being taken seriously by health professionals during all phases of illness. Users emphasized that although they might not be able to participate fully in some phases, it was a sign of respect if they were allowed more participation when their insight improved.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I find it very important since I see a difference from not having it. It does depend upon how ill you are. I find it especially important at the out-patient clinic. Because, then you are normally not as ill as when you are submitted into the in-patient clinic. And when you are better you have a lot of healthy thoughts and then they should have some space, or they must be allowed to participate. And yes, it does something to you to be allowed to participate, to be allowed to have some control of things yourself. (Service user 1a)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, patient participation became a tool towards dignity. Poor phases of the illness left health professionals in charge of maintaining patients’ dignity. Maintaining dignity implied leaving patients with at least a limited amount of decision-making about their own situation but also hindering patients from making unhealthy decisions. Therefore, although respect and dignity were highlighted by both users and health professionals as non-negotiable, it was also part of the assessments where the benefit of patient participation was judged against the patient’s best interest. Maintaining patient dignity could trump ensuring patient participation.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>

<p>The interviews in this study provide views from both service users and health professionals. One limitation is that all interviewees are associated with one mental health community hospital in central Norway.

<title>Patient participation in mental health services</title>
<p>The context of mental health services is that professionals are legally responsible for providing appropriate care to users. Professionals are given control through the roles of caregiver, educator and gatekeeper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011423464">Vatne &amp; Fagermoen, 2007</xref>). From a professional perspective, patient participation can be optimized through listening to and motivating patients by building cooperation, getting to know the person and reinforcing self-care capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011423464">Sahlsten, Larsson, Sjostrom, &amp; Plos, 2009</xref>). Professionals may, however, experience dilemmas between motivating patients to participate and allowing them to control their own degree of involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011423464">Elstad &amp; Eide, 2009</xref>). In the present study, health professionals would use strategies to ensure some patient participation at all stages of mental illness but only as far as they could agree on it being in the patients’ best interest.</p>
<p>Patients and providers may have different perspectives on involvement in mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011423464">Storm &amp; Davidson, 2010</xref>). In the present data, however, we found that both users and health professionals saw patient participation as professionals’ responsibility for patients’ best interest during irrational phases of mental illness. Such agreement indicates how structures of health services, where some individuals come to receive help from others, influence notions of choice and responsibility. Theoretically, the structure of helper and person in need of help will always create inequality even when the helper opts for equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011423464">Grimen, 2009</xref>). Systems may colonize the lifeworlds of those subject to them, and influence what both users and health professionals accept as problems and solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011423464">Hodge, 2009</xref>). Persons who have been long-time users of mental health services could have been socialized into service rationalities. As our findings indicate, this is especially true in phases of severe illness where users have few other options than to submit to the logic of health care services.</p>
<p>The context of mental health services is one explanation of why some patients are seen as difficult by health care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011423464">Koekkoek et al., 2011</xref>). In a mental health service context, it is health professionals who have the privilege of determining patient insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011423464">Hamilton &amp; Roper, 2006</xref>). Having insight would therefore relate to acting out what is seen as rational by health professionals or others who are defined as mentally healthy. Experiencing some patients as lacking insight into their own best interest indicates that these patients’ views were seen as invalid. Assumptions about mental health patients’ inabilities to hold valid opinions are not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011423464">Hickey &amp; Kipping, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011423464">Rogers et al., 1993</xref>). It builds on a paternalistic tradition of mental health services in which service providers are meant to help patients obtain ‘normality’. When the patient is reluctant to accept professional help, health care professionals may interpret it as a deviation that is necessary to correct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011423464">Sommerseth, 2010</xref>). Classification of patients as non-compliant due to patients’ inability to conform to treatment has connotations of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011423464">Canvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011423464">O’Brien &amp; Golding, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011423464">Robinson, Callister, Berry, &amp; Dearing, 2008</xref>). Indeed, encouraging patients towards active coping could be interpreted as a request to cooperate with staff’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011423464">Peerbhoy, Hall, Parker, Shenkin, &amp; Salmon, 1998</xref>). Our findings support previous studies in that patients’ abilities to participate are seen in relation to their ability to act in coherence with advice from health professionals. A redefinition of patient participation for patients who are perceived irrational makes visible that a shift from patient participation to ‘the patient’s best interest’ maintains traditional power structures and paternalistic views in mental health services.</p>
<p>A proposed benefit from patient participation is that participation may offer added therapeutic value through users being involved in decision-making, especially in mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011423464">Hickey &amp; Kipping, 1998</xref>). Health professionals’ solutions to difficulties of patient participation indicate difficulties of separating it from treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011423464">Malterud (2010)</xref> has suggested that within health care, empowerment as an emancipatory project has been replaced by a framework where empowerment is a professional effort to support patients towards healthy choices. Empowerment and patient participation have strong connotations. Our findings suggest that if patient participation is understood to be what health professionals see as the patients’ best interest, patient participation might be dismissed as a goal in and of itself for the most ill service users.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study highlight how mental health service users and health professionals experience patient participation through the context of mental health services where some individuals are helpers and some individuals are in need of help. Our findings raise questions about how patients are supposed to achieve real patient participation if health professionals, and even patients themselves, see psychiatric patients as lacking insight during certain phases. Users and health professionals need to partake in discourses on the distinctions between treatment and participation, and patient participation needs more thorough defining. If mental health problems are seen as an obstacle towards patient participation, mental health service users who have insight, communicate well and are eager to cooperate should have every possibility for extensive patient participation. Having patient participation at all phases of illness demands sensitivity from staff to avoid using patient participation as a means towards their own treatment goals. Although mental health services have been reformed during recent decades, it is necessary to have further discussions on rationality and normality – in mental health practice, among policy makers and throughout the education of health professionals. Questions of patient participation for the most ill patients should not, however, be laid solely upon individual health professionals who strive to give patients the best treatment. Acknowledging it as a system problem is necessary for improvements. Moreover, more research on the subject is warranted. Although potentially challenging, research with service users during and after such phases of illness is warranted.</p>
