<abstract>
<p>An online experiment tested the influence of “he said/she said” coverage versus active adjudication of factual disputes, as well as strategy versus policy framing in postdebate news coverage. Adjudication in policy-framed stories increased epistemic political efficacy (EPE), a measure of confidence in one’s own ability to determine the truth in politics. However, adjudicated policy stories also elicited greater cynicism than passive policy framing. This suggests a caveat for the spiral of cynicism, calling into question its assumption that all policy framing behaves similarly in reducing cynicism. Results also provide several forms of evidence that effects of adjudication on EPE differ from spiral of cynicism effects while further validating the EPE construct as distinct from the reverse of political cynicism. Adjudication also positively affected evaluations of the coverage as interesting and informative.</p>

<title>The Influence of Postdebate News Framing and Fact Checking on Epistemic Political Efficacy and Cynicism</title>
<p>This study examines the effects of two often-criticized aspects of modern political news coverage, both of which have been studied separately in past experiments: a tendency to treat politics as a game, and a passive, “he said/she said” approach to factual disputes. Game framing is the act of organizing a news story around the idea of competition between politicians or parties and includes such topics as candidate performance, style, poll numbers, political maneuvering, and strategic ulterior motives. Game frames operate in contrast to policy frames, which emphasize differences between policy alternatives proposed by the politicians. Game-framed news has been found to increase audience cynicism about politics, an effect referred to as the spiral of cynicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella &amp; Jamieson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, policy framing is not a sufficient condition for high-quality journalism. As many scholars have argued, when news does focus on substantive policy matters, it too often addresses them in overly passive, “he said/she said” terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650212439205">Cunningham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650212439205">Durham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650212439205">Jamieson &amp; Waldman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650212439205">Rosen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650212439205">Streckfuss, 1990</xref>). In other words, reporters are often satisfied with passively quoting contradictory factual claims from each side, rather than delving further into the story to “adjudicate factual disputes” by finding additional information that could help readers decide which side is correct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650212439205">Jamieson &amp; Waldman, 2003</xref>). Stopping at quoting both sides would be appropriate in subjective disputes, or where the disputed claims are, for whatever reason, impossible to verify or falsify with a reasonable degree of certainty. However, when disputes are about knowable facts, a “he said/she said” story seems to imply that all claims are equally valid, that there are no facts in politics, or that getting to the bottom of factual disputes about policy is too difficult even for a professional political reporter.</p>
<p>Empirical research has only recently begun to examine the effects of passive journalism on audiences. This study follows up on two recent studies that found exposure to passive news can decrease epistemic political efficacy (EPE), the confidence in one’s own ability to assess the accuracy of political claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650212439205">Pingree, Brossard, &amp; McLeod, 2006</xref>). In contrast to traditional conceptions of political efficacy that are primarily related to political action, epistemic political efficacy focuses on understanding politics. As such, EPE is conceptually better suited than political participation efficacy to explain behaviors oriented toward understanding politics, such as information seeking, accuracy-motivated reasoning (Kunda, 1990), or understanding-oriented political discussion (Rojas, 2008). EPE has been validated as distinct from political participation efficacy, media trust, close mindedness, and dogmatism and predicts democratically important outcomes such as information seeking and (non-)acceptance of dishonesty by political elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We replicate both this EPE research and the spiral of cynicism in a combined study for two reasons. First, we want to test an alternative explanation of past research on EPE in which the effects found were a proxy for the familiar spiral of cynicism effect. EPE has not been shown to be empirically distinct from political cynicism, and thus it is plausible that some who score low on EPE measures are merely expressing general political cynicism. Although the past two EPE experiments did not include game-framed news, and instead used policy stories that were either passive or adjudicated, the adjudicated policy stories could perhaps have served as a stronger version of the policy frame. Second, past research on the spiral of cynicism has not differentiated passive versus adjudicated policy-framed news. Because adjudication highlights misleading or inaccurate statements by politicians, it may actually increase political cynicism. If it does, this would point out an important exception to the spiral of cynicism effect, in which policy-framed news can actually increase cynicism if it actively adjudicates factual disputes by pointing out that politicians are either wrong, misleading, or deliberately lying. This would also further distinguish EPE from cynicism, with the former linked to adjudication and the latter to strategic framing.</p>
<p>This study addresses these issues by combining the two lines of research discussed above in a single experiment in the context of news coverage following candidate debates. Specifically, we test effects of exposure to the three theoretically relevant forms of postdebate news coverage from the two lines of research (strategy, passive policy, and adjudicated policy) on both outcome variables (political cynicism and EPE).</p>

<title>Game-Framed News and Cynicism</title>
<p>Political coverage has often been criticized for presenting politics as a game by emphasizing winning, losing, candidate performance, strategy, and poll numbers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650212439205">Fallows, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650212439205">Lawrence, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650212439205">Patterson, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650212439205">1994</xref>). Game-framed news stories can include “horse-race” coverage of the impact of the debate on poll results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650212439205">Patterson, 1980</xref>), evaluations of candidates’ speaking styles or body language during a debate, and strategic attribution, which explains candidates’ policy statements in terms of candidates’ strategic ulterior motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella &amp; Jamieson, 1997</xref>). Content analyses have shown that the game frame became dramatically more common in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650212439205">Patterson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The meaning of the term <italic>framing</italic> in this work differs from its meaning in psychology (e.g., Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1986), in which frames differ only in how the exact same information is presented (e.g., “95% fat free” vs. “5% fat”). Media framing studies rarely, if ever, can claim such “equivalence framing” (Druckman, 2002). This is defensible because distinguishing effects of information from presentation is at best a secondary goal of this research. The primary goal is to test effects of exposure to common types of news stories that are thought to result from a reporter’s use of a frame to construct a news story. In the case of the game frame, a reporter’s choice to organize a story around the game frame leads to the inclusion of different information (e.g., poll numbers, quotes about candidate strategy, etc.), not just to a different way of presenting the same information. We adopt the term <italic>game framing</italic> merely for consistency with past media framing research, but it could just as well be called <italic>game coverage</italic>. Regardless of the label for it, the effect of this general type of news story on audiences is worthy of study because of its prevalence in modern political media coverage.</p>
<p>Among other effects on audiences, game-framed news has been found to foster cynicism about politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella &amp; Jamieson, 1997</xref>). This “spiral of cynicism” effect has since been replicated in other studies (DeVreese, 2005; DeVreese &amp; Elenbaas, 2008; Valentino, Beckmann, &amp; Buhr, 2001); however, note that the effects of cynicism on political participation have at times been limited to a subset of the audience, have been weak, or even unsupported (see DeVreese, 2005; Valentino, Beckmann, &amp; Buhr, 2001). The explanation for this effect hinges on the conceptual similarity of game framing and audience political cynicism because an emphasis on competitive ulterior motives is central to both concepts. Thus, exposure to a steady diet of game-framed news could create this same emphasis in the minds of the audience when thinking about politics and could result in higher cynicism; this may occur either via conscious acceptance of the appropriateness of this way of describing politics or via a more subtle automatic effect in which game considerations become more chronically accessible in memory and, therefore, come to mind more readily (see Price &amp; Tewksbury, 1997).</p>

<sec id="section4-0093650212439205">
<title>Passive News and Adjudication</title>
<p>Many scholars have argued that when modern news does cover policy, it too often stops at a passive, “he said/she said” description of the competing claims, even when these claims are about verifiable facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650212439205">Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650212439205">Jamieson &amp; Waldman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650212439205">McChesney, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650212439205">2004</xref>; Patterson, 2000; Plasser, 2005). That the news should play a more active role in factual disputes—in a word, adjudicating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650212439205">Jamieson &amp; Waldman, 2003</xref>)—is not a radical proposal foreign to reporters’ habits; instead, it comes down to doing a little more ordinary reporting work (e.g., reading the text of a bill, checking transcripts or recordings of speeches, interviewing experts or eyewitnesses, etc.). It also does not require any radical epistemic claims of absolute truth or complete certainty; instead, it merely involves reporters making some effort to go beyond the initial quotes and “push the story, incrementally, toward a deeper understanding of what is true and what is false” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650212439205">Cunningham, 2003</xref>, p. 3).</p>
<p>We adopt Jamieson and Waldman’s term <italic>adjudication</italic> for such active journalism because it invokes a very useful metaphor of journalism as judge in the jury trial of public opinion, as opposed to a mere stenographer. This judge role involves keeping arguments honest and grounded in acceptable forms of evidence while helping structure (but not make) decisions for the jury. In this same metaphor, passive journalism can be summed up as the news playing the role of a stenographer, merely recording what is said and leaving it to the jury to decide for themselves which arguments are honest, what kinds of evidence are acceptable, and how best to structure the decision.</p>
<p>Two arguments are commonly made against the critique of passive journalism, both claiming that the public would be as well or better off with a mere stenographer instead of a judge. The first argument is based on assumptions of strong partisan bias. If one assumes that a reporter’s own partisan leaning will strongly influence the results of adjudication, then one could argue that reporters simply cannot be trusted to be fair to both sides in playing such an active role. However, research has repeatedly failed to find a link between the political beliefs of professional news reporters and the content they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650212439205">Lee, 2005</xref>). Passive journalism can also be defended by arguing that citizens no longer have as strong a need for reporters to do the work of adjudication for them due to increasing availability of public access to primary source materials such as congressional voting records, the full text of bills, or candidate speeches. However, it is unrealistic to assume that a substantial proportion of citizens will go to such lengths of examining these materials in detail, and even if they did, it does not seem preferable for hundreds of millions of citizens to redundantly do this instead of having a few reporters do it for them. Such an enormous inefficiency is only justifiable if one accepts a quite extreme version of the partisan bias argument, in which reporters cannot be trusted to do any fact checking whatsoever. Even with this efficiency issue aside, publicly available records are not the only resource required for adjudication. For instance, reporters often pursue a story further by asking questions of politicians, experts, or eyewitnesses. Each such source simply cannot field questions from millions of citizens every day. In sum, active journalism must be seen as conceptually distinct from transparency, which is the extent to which readers have access to the raw information on which news stories were based. One bright spot in modern journalism may be a shift toward more transparency, for example, with the inclusion of links to primary source records in online news stories. Although this may help some readers adjudicate, it does not constitute adjudication by the journalist unless the news story itself points out what in those materials contradicts one side’s factual claims.</p>
<p>Despite urgent alarms about the decline into passive journalism, there has been little empirical research on its effects. This may be in part because criticism of passive news usually stresses its effects on elites, warning of the consequences of journalism failing to keep mass-mediated elite debate accountable and grounded in reality. Any such effects on the honesty of political claims by elites are important, but direct effects on audiences are also possible and have largely been neglected, even at the conceptual level, in past work. A partial exception to this is research on “manufacturing uncertainty,” which refers to organized campaigns by industry taking advantage of balanced news to undermine specific factual beliefs among the public, such as the health consequences of smoking or the link between human activity and climate change (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650212439205">Michaels &amp; Monforton, 2005</xref>). This work has focused on effects of public uncertainty about the particular issues under dispute but does not appear to have even conceptualized any broader effects on a generalized sense of uncertainty (such as epistemic inefficacy). Furthermore, although an implicit critique of passive news is central to this line of work, the factual disputes it addresses are restricted to domains of expert scientific or medical knowledge rather than the much broader set of everyday political factual disagreements that reporters should be able to check for themselves.</p>

<title>Epistemic Political Efficacy and Related Concepts</title>
<p>Epistemic political efficacy (EPE) is a measure of confidence in one’s own ability to assess the accuracy of political claims. Although past research has not addressed the relationship between EPE and cynicism, it has shown EPE to be distinct from media trust, close-mindedness, dogmatism, and internal and external political efficacy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree, 2011</xref>). Internal political efficacy is confidence in one’s own ability to participate effectively in politics, and external political efficacy is confidence that the political system is responsive to citizen participation, in general (Easton &amp; Dennis, 1967; Nieme, Craig, &amp; Mattei, 1991). Standard measures of these two political efficacy constructs contain some items that overlap partially with EPE. We follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref> in using modified measures of internal and external political efficacy specific to political participation, not political understanding. However, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref>, we will refer to them as measures of “political participation efficacy,” not just “political efficacy,” to emphasize their difference from standard measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref> found that EPE provided a unique contribution above and beyond political participation efficacy and other related orientations such as media trust, dogmatism, political interest, and political knowledge (but again, not cynicism), in predicting several outcome variables, including information seeking and acceptance of dishonesty by political elites.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650212439205">Bandura, 1982</xref>) provides a theoretical foundation to ground any self-efficacy construct. However, it does not provide general measures of self-efficacy. New self-efficacy measures have to be developed specific to each task domain because a general self-efficacy measure would be indistinguishable from self-esteem (Brockner, 1988). The central lesson of self-efficacy theory is that people do not simply do what they want to do; instead, they do what they also think they can succeed at. This may seem an obvious point, but it is one we often ignore, effectively assuming that motivation is the sole predictor of behavior. For instance, note how natural it is to infer that those who do not seek political information must lack political interest. Conceptually, if political interest is anything, it is a motivational construct. Self-efficacy theory reminds us that some individuals who choose not to seek political information may in fact lack epistemic efficacy, not necessarily epistemic motivation.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy theory also posits several determinants of efficacy that shed light on mechanisms of effects on any self-efficacy construct. Enactive mastery is the strongest among these and results from frequent or recent personal experiences of success or failure with the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650212439205">Bandura, 1982</xref>). To apply this to effects of adjudicated news on EPE, when audience members encounter a factual dispute in the news that they are interested in resolving, they are likely to make at least some cognitive effort to resolve it. This effort is more likely to feel like a success in an adjudicated story because such stories, by definition, provide further information that can help the audience resolve the dispute. As a result, for those with enough interest in the issues under dispute to motivate some cognitive effort to resolve it, stories that adjudicate factual disputes should increase EPE, and stories that do not should decrease it. Moreover, self-efficacy can be affected by vicarious experience or observing others succeed or fail at a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650212439205">Bandura, 1982</xref>). In our context, this can be summed up as reporters making resolution of factual disputes look easy when they adjudicate and making it look difficult when they do not. This mechanism cannot be ruled out and could be occurring alongside enactive mastery, but the moderating role of issue interest found in the previous two studies is better explained by enactive mastery. Finally, in the absence of accessible memories of personal or vicarious success or failure at a task, accessible task-relevant beliefs may also be used to construct a self-efficacy judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650212439205">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). In the case of EPE, such beliefs may include cynicism, media trust, trust in politicians, or a more general epistemic efficacy construct that is not specific to politics.</p>
<p>Both past studies on EPE found that for interested readers, exposure to news stories containing adjudication of factual disputes increases EPE, consistent with the enactive mastery explanation of self-efficacy formation. In other words, when journalists go beyond a passive, “he said/she said” story, interested readers not only feel more certain about the particular matter under dispute but also feel more confident in their own ability to get to the bottom of political factual matters in general. Effects on disinterested readers deserve more study in future work, but our interest at present is in distinguishing the effect on interested readers from the spiral of cynicism. As such, we will use a context for this study in which readers were extremely high in prior issue interest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0093650212439205">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Our main focus is on the effects of news framing and adjudication on general political orientations (EPE and political cynicism). We begin with some basic predictions that are implicit in the above discussion and serve, in part, as manipulation checks. The first is effects on subjective evaluations of the quality of the coverage itself. Our three forms of postdebate coverage could affect such perceptions in a variety of ways. By resolving factual disputes, adjudication could lead readers to see the coverage as higher quality. However, some journalists may refrain from adjudication out of a concern that readers would see it as a breach of neutrality and would thus evaluate adjudicated coverage negatively. It is also an open question whether strategy framing or policy framing are seen more favorably by audiences. Although it may be tempting to assume that the aforementioned historical trend toward strategy framing is driven entirely by consumer demand, and thus that strategy framing is preferred by audiences, some critics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650212439205">McChesney, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650212439205">2004</xref>) have cautioned that news production cost minimization may instead explain this shift. Commercial media may have shifted toward strategy framing in spite of a basic audience preference for higher quality journalism. Accordingly, we predict that adjudicated news will be evaluated the most positively and, furthermore, that even passive policy framing will be evaluated more positively than strategy framing.</p>
<list id="list1-0093650212439205" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a (H1a)</italic>: Reader evaluation of news story quality will be higher for adjudicated policy-framed news than for passive policy-framed news.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1b (H1b)</italic>: Reader evaluation of news story quality will be higher for passive policy-framed news than for strategy-framed news.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Self-reported perceptions that a news article was high in quality of course do not guarantee acquisition of correct beliefs. To more directly assess the effects of adjudication on the specific factual beliefs in question, and as a manipulation check of whether adjudication helped readers arrive at correct beliefs, we predict with a pair of hypotheses that adjudication will result in higher agreement with correct factual belief statements, relative to each of the other two kinds of coverage.</p>
<list id="list2-0093650212439205" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: Exposure to adjudicated policy-framed news will result in higher agreement with correct factual belief questions than exposure to (a) passive policy-framed news or (b) strategy-framed news.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We now turn to our core predictions. First, we aim to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella and Jamieson’s (1997)</xref> finding that strategy framing increases cynicism, relative to policy framing. However, we draw a distinction they did not, the difference between passive policy framing and adjudicated policy framing. To the extent that fact checking of policy disputes reveals that factual claims made by political elites were dishonest (or at least incorrect), adjudicated policy framing may increase cynicism relative to passive policy framing by drawing attention to that dishonesty or inaccuracy. Therefore, we hypothesize a replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella and Jamieson’s (1997)</xref> findings only in terms of passive policy framing and hypothesize that adjudicated policy framing, like strategy framing, will also increase cynicism.</p>
<list id="list3-0093650212439205" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: Exposure to (a) strategy-framed news or (b) adjudicated policy-framed news will increase political cynicism relative to exposure to passive policy-framed news.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We also aim to replicate past work on EPE, in which adjudication was found to increase EPE among those with high levels of interest in the issue under dispute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650212439205">Pingree, Brossard, &amp; McLeod, 2006</xref>) and in one study to decrease EPE among those with low levels of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650212439205">Pingree et al., 2006</xref>). Although these reverse effects are interesting and worthy of future study, their external validity is somewhat questionable because real news consumption so often involves selective exposure and selective attention, resulting in real-world news consumption taking place under conditions of relatively higher issue interest. As we will discuss further below, widespread high levels of interest in the issue chosen for the present study allowed us to predict a main effect of adjudication on EPE without any moderating role of political interest; in effect, the vast majority of subjects were expected to fall into what would have been the high-prior-interest group in the two previous studies. Therefore, we predict a replication of this past finding as a simple main effect, with adjudication resulting in higher EPE than exposure to an otherwise identical policy story without adjudication.</p>
<list id="list4-0093650212439205" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4a (H4a)</italic>: Exposure to adjudicated policy-framed news will result in higher EPE than exposure to passive policy framing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As discussed above, there is an alternative explanation for past findings on EPE in which EPE is merely a measure of the inverse of cynicism, and effects on EPE merely replicate spiral of cynicism effects. If this is the case, effects on EPE should be concentrated in the portion of variance of EPE that is shared with cynicism. Treating this alternative explanation as the null, we predict that effects of adjudication on EPE will exist above and beyond controls for cynicism. By the same token, effects on EPE could also be driven by the substantial variance EPE is known to share with the other two political efficacy constructs (internal and external political participation efficacy). Therefore, we also include these other two related constructs in predicting that adjudication effects on EPE operate on the portion of EPE variance that does not overlap with any of these constructs.</p>
<list id="list5-0093650212439205" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4b (H4b)</italic>: The effect predicted in H4a will still exist after controlling for political cynicism, internal political participation efficacy, and external political participation efficacy.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, we take a step beyond the experimental effects on EPE that are the main focus here to examine EPE’s contribution to predicting outcome variables. As discussed above, information seeking and participation are key outcome variables not only for their substantive importance for democracy but also because they highlight the conceptual distinction between EPE and other political efficacy constructs. A crucial test of EPE’s validity is whether it can add any unique contribution to predicting these outcomes above and beyond other general political orientations such as cynicism, internal efficacy, external efficacy, ideological strength, political knowledge, and issue interest (the latter variable is included because both outcome variables are measured in terms specific to the issue of the economy). Not only is EPE expected to play a particularly strong role in predicting information seeking for obvious reasons but it may also predict participation via a demobilizing influence of feelings of uncertainty.</p>
<list id="list6-0093650212439205" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis H5 (H5)</italic>: EPE will add a unique positive contribution to predicting (a) information seeking and (b) participation, above and beyond political cynicism, internal efficacy, external efficacy, ideological strength, political knowledge, and issue interest.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0093650212439205">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected by means of an experiment embedded in a web-based survey of undergraduate students at two large Midwestern universities and one large Southern university (N = 1,207). Respondents were offered extra credit for participating in this experiment. Potential participants were contacted by email and given the website address of the online experiment. The study took place during the 2 weeks leading up to the 2008 U.S. general election. Demographics were fairly typical for an undergraduate sample: 62% female, 85% White, and ages ranging from 18 to 45 (M = 20.5). None of these demographics differed significantly across experimental conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0093650212439205">
<title>Design and Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned using a 3 × 3 factorial design in which the factors were the type of postdebate coverage (game frame, passive policy frame, and adjudicated policy frame), and a second factor, unused here, involving manipulation of the timing and wording of an open-ended prompt, included in this data collection for the purposes of another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650212439205">Pingree, Scholl, &amp; Quenette, 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650212439205">1</xref></sup> The unused factor was entered as a covariate in all experimental analyses.</p>
<p>After completing pretest questions, all participants were shown a 6-min video clip from the first presidential debate on the topic of tax policy. This clip was chosen because it contained two clear factual disputes, both of which were adjudicated by the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://factcheck.org">factcheck.org</ext-link>, and in opposite directions, with one adjudication favoring Obama and the other favoring McCain. The first dispute concerned the business tax rate, with Senator McCain claiming American businesses pay a 35% tax rate, one of the highest in the world, whereas Senator Obama claimed that this 35% tax rate on paper was misleading because the existing loopholes and tax credits mean that American businesses actually pay one of the lowest tax rates in the world. The second factual dispute began with McCain claiming that Obama had voted to “increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 per year.” Obama interrupted to say, “That’s just not true, John,” to which McCain responded, “That’s just a fact. You can look it up.”</p>
<p>After viewing the debate clip, participants were asked to read a fictional Associated Press news brief about the debate, which contained the experimental manipulation. The three versions of this article were kept as similar as possible (full text of the articles is included in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0093650212439205">appendix</xref>), all beginning with the same lead paragraph and following the same story structure. The game and passive policy articles had the exact same word count and described the same candidate policy positions, differing in whether these positions were attributed to strategic ulterior motives such as “to attract working class voters,” or policy reasons such as “to stimulate the economy through increased consumer spending.” The fact-checked policy article was by necessity slightly longer because it included two additional fact-checking paragraphs, one for each dispute, both attributed to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://factcheck.org">factcheck.org</ext-link>. Other than these two additional paragraphs, the fact-checked policy article was identical to the passive policy article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0093650212439205">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Except where otherwise noted, all items were measured on 11-point scales with 10 representing <italic>strongly agree</italic> and 0 representing <italic>strongly disagree</italic>. With the exception of adding a single item to the EPE scale, the three efficacy scales are measured identically to those in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref>, and include changes to standard internal and external efficacy scales to differentiate them better from EPE. Cynicism measures were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella and Jamieson (1997)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section11-0093650212439205">
<title>Factual beliefs</title>
<p>To assess effects of adjudication on beliefs about the specific factual beliefs adjudicated in the stimulus story, we asked participants how strongly they agreed with the following statements: “Businesses in this country pay one of the lowest tax rates in the world,” and “Obama voted yes on a bill that increased taxes on people who make $42,000 per year.” Responses were measured on an 11-point scale with 10 representing <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 5 representing <italic>unsure</italic>, and 0 representing <italic>strongly disagree</italic>. Note that both items were worded such that higher values correspond to stronger agreement with the correct response according to the adjudication in our stimulus. By including a scale that measures not only degree of agreement but also degree of disagreement, this measure can capture not only strengthening beliefs in the correct direction but also weakening beliefs in the incorrect direction. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the two factual belief items were uncorrelated (r = −.03), so they were kept separate for analyses (tax rate belief, <italic>M</italic> = 4.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.68; voting record belief, <italic>M</italic> = 5.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.65).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0093650212439205">
<title>Article evaluation</title>
<p>Subjective evaluations of the quality of the article (Cronbach’s α = .86, <italic>M</italic> = 5.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.89) were measured with four items: “The news article was informative,” “I learned something from reading the news article,” “The news article satisfied my need for information,” and “The news article was interesting.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093650212439205">
<title>Political cynicism</title>
<p>In our data, as in other studies (e.g., DeVreese, 2005), reliability was somewhat problematic for the political cynicism measures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella and Jamieson (1997)</xref>. The subset of these items with the highest reliability were the reverse-coded ones: “Elections give voters a real choice among candidates with different positions,” “Candidates seriously discuss major problems facing the nation and offer detailed solutions to those problems,” and “It makes a difference who wins elections.” These three items were reversed and averaged to create a cynicism scale (Cronbach’s α = .60, <italic>M</italic> = 5.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23).</p>
<p>On face validity, disagreement with these three items seems to us a better indicator of <italic>general</italic> cynicism because each of the nonreversed items seems to tap some overly specific underlying reason to be cynical that may overlap substantially with other concepts. For instance, the item “politicians usually do or say whatever it takes to win” is certainly a reason one might be cynical, but it is not the only such reason, it does not even guarantee cynicism (e.g., if one believes that enough citizens see through politicians’ lies to make democracy meaningful), and it could even be seen more as an indicator of trust in politicians than an indicator of general political cynicism. Another example of a nonreversed item that illustrates a very different reason to be cynical is “who is elected won’t make much difference because the candidates’ positions are determined by the interests of those who gave them campaign funds.” In our view, measurement of political cynicism needs much more work to distinguish this concept from various forms of political trust, external efficacy, and beliefs about the power of special interests. At present, using available items, the three reverse-coded items are the items with the highest reliability in our sample and also seem to most clearly tap general political cynicism without overlapping with other constructs by being overly specific about the reasons for that cynicism.</p>
<p>For our purposes, there is an additional advantage of this entirely reverse-coded cynicism scale: it provides a more stringent test of whether EPE can be distinguished empirically from the reverse of cynicism. With all EPE and cynicism items measured in the same direction (i.e., all as positive statements about politics), the differences we hope to find between the two cannot be attributed to differences in the direction of measurement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0093650212439205">
<title>Internal political participation efficacy</title>
<p>The internal political participation efficacy scale (Cronbach’s α = .84, M = 4.71, SD = 2.06) was created by averaging four items: “I consider myself well qualified to participate in politics,” “I feel that I could do as good a job in public office as most other people,” “Given the right opportunity, I feel that I could do a good job influencing public officials,” and “To the extent that citizens can influence politics, my efforts to do so would be more effective than the average person.” The former two item wordings are taken from the NES and are frequently used. The latter two items were developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref> to replace two NES internal efficacy items with a strong epistemic dimension (e.g., “I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of the important political issues facing our country”). Self-efficacy constructs can be measured at varying levels of specificity but should match the level of specificity of the behaviors they aim to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650212439205">Bandura, 1982</xref>; Brockner, 1988). Thus, the standard internal efficacy scale is arguably only appropriate if the behavior one wishes to predict is very generally “politics,” including both attempting to understand politics and attempting to take political action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0093650212439205">
<title>External political participation efficacy</title>
<p>Also following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref>, external political participation efficacy (Cronbach’s α = .73, M = 5.62, SD = 1.66) was measured using four items: “People like me don’t have any say about what government does” (reverse-coded), “I don’t think public officials care much what people like me think” (reverse-coded), “Ordinary people can influence the government,” and “Public officials care what ordinary people think.” As with internal efficacy above, the former two items are standard and the latter two items were developed to replace items that overlap with EPE (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0093650212439205">
<title>Epistemic political efficacy</title>
<p>The epistemic political efficacy scale (Cronbach’s α = .82, <italic>M</italic> = 5.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.76) was created by averaging four items, including three which were used as the EPE scale in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref>: “I feel confident that I can find the truth about political issues,” “If I wanted to, I could figure out the facts behind most political disputes,” and “There are objective facts behind most political disputes, and if you try hard enough you can find them.” One additional item was added, “It is possible to figure out the truth about political issues.”</p>
<p>A crucial test of the validity of EPE is whether it adds a unique contribution to predicting outcome variables such as information seeking and participation, above and beyond other efficacy constructs and related political orientations. The remaining variables in this section were all measured for this purpose. The first two are dependent variables theoretically related to the distinction between EPE and other political efficacy measures: information seeking and participation. The remaining variables are other political orientations included as covariates to test whether EPE adds anything to predicting these outcomes above and beyond these orientations.</p>

<title>Information-seeking likelihood</title>
<p>Information-seeking likelihood (<italic>r</italic> = .70, <italic>M</italic> = 6.61, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.29) was measured by averaging two items: “How likely would you be to read another news story about the issues discussed in this debate clip, if you encountered one?” and “How likely would you be to pay attention to a TV news story about the issues discussed in this debate clip, if you encountered one?” Responses were measured on an 11-point scale with 10 representing <italic>very likely</italic> and 0 representing <italic>not at all likely</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0093650212439205">
<title>Participation likelihood</title>
<p>Likelihood of political participation (Cronbach’s α = .83, <italic>M</italic> = 4.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.01) was created by averaging seven items asked under the heading “How likely would you be to . . . ,” including “explain your views on the candidates’ economic proposals to someone you know,” “contact a news organization to express your opinions on the candidates’ economic proposals,” “post a comment on a blog or other webpage about the candidates’ economic proposals,” “forward an email or webpage related to the election campaign,” “donate money to one of the candidates,” “volunteer for activities in support of one of the candidates,” and “vote in the presidential election.” Responses were measured on an 11-point scale with 10 representing <italic>very likely</italic> and 0 representing <italic>not at all likely</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0093650212439205">
<title>Ideological strength</title>
<p>A measure of ideological strength was used as a covariate in the models predicting information seeking and participation, both for the purpose of validating EPE. A single item was used, “Where would you place yourself on the political spectrum,” with responses on an 11-point scale ranging from <italic>very liberal</italic> to <italic>very conservative</italic>. Ideological strength (M = 2.08, SD = 1.33) was constructed by folding this item around its midpoint (the absolute value of the difference between a given response and 5, the midpoint).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0093650212439205">
<title>Political knowledge</title>
<p>Self-reported political knowledge was also used as a covariate in the models predicting information seeking and participation. It was assessed using a single item (<italic>M</italic> = 5.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.24), “How knowledgeable are you about political issues?” Responses were measured on an 11-point scale ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>very</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0093650212439205">
<title>Issue interest</title>
<p>A final covariate used in the models predicting information seeking and participation was a scale assessing the perceived importance of issues addressed in the stimulus materials. Issue interest (Cronbach’s α = .80, <italic>M</italic> = 8.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.32) was measured using five items under the heading “How important are the following . . .”: “The economy in general,” “Unemployment and jobs,” “The stock market,” “Inflation and prices,” and “Taxes and the size of government.” Responses were measured on an 11-point scale ranging from <italic>not at all important</italic> to <italic>very important</italic>. As discussed above, the timing of this study during a major financial crisis resulted in almost universally high interest in economic issues. According to a Pew survey released on October 1, 2008, 70% of Americans were following news about the economy “very closely,” making the economic crisis “one of the top ten most closely followed news stories in two decades of Pew Research Center news interest surveys” (Pew, 2008, p. 1). Our respondents were no exception, with only 2% of our respondents scoring below the midpoint on our Issue Interest Scale.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section23-0093650212439205">
<title>Factor Analyses</title>
<p>We conducted two factor analyses to verify that our measurement adequately separated EPE, cynicism, and political participation efficacy at the level of individual items. The first is a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the model fit for the three political efficacy scales replicated here from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree (2011)</xref>. The second is an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) that also includes the cynicism items. CFA allows a test of how well the data fit a predetermined theoretical model—in this case, that each of the efficacy scales consists of items that reflect that scale only. In contrast, an EFA model does not specify a priori which items belong to which factors or even the number of factors involved. Although the two approaches are usually discussed in terms of an either-or choice of EFA or CFA, following up a CFA with an additional EFA should also be considered as a broad reassurance about possible cross-loadings or unanticipated alternative structures that may fit the data even better than the hypothesized structure (Schmitt, 2011).</p>
<p>The CFA model was conducted using AMOS 19.0 with maximum likelihood estimation. The model structure was typical for a simultaneous CFA with correlated factors and reflective indicators. Specifically, no cross-loadings were included, a single item on each factor had a regression weight fixed at 1, each item had its own error term, and each factor was covaried with each of the other three factors. After examination of modification indices, the error term for the second item in the external efficacy scale was covaried with the error terms for each of the other three external efficacy items; no other error terms were covaried. This item, “I don’t think public officials care much what people like me think,” could perhaps be reworded in future research to make it less redundant with other items in the scale or even removed to make the scale more efficient. We elected to retain the item in these analyses to more directly test the model fit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650212439205">Pingree’s (2011)</xref> efficacy measures. Furthermore, covaried error terms among items for the same scale are generally considered acceptable in CFA models. <italic>N</italic> was more than sufficient at 1,108, given the commonly accepted minimum <italic>N</italic> of 10 per estimated parameter. Three criteria were used to assess model fit, as recommended by Hu and Bentler (1999): a Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) above .95, a comparative fit index (CFI) above .95, and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) below .06. The model satisfied all three criteria (TLI = .964, CFI = .974, RMSEA = .049).</p>
<p>The EFA model used the generalized least squares method in the SPSS software program. Examination of a scree plot suggested a four-factor solution that explained 62.06% of variance. As the efficacy factors were known to be moderately correlated, oblimin rotation was used. Results show a clean separation of the four factors exactly as hypothesized. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650212439205">Table 1</xref> shows the pattern matrix after a six-iteration “direct oblimin” function of SPSS (a Quartimin oblique rotation with Kaiser normalization), with all factor loadings with absolute values below .10 hidden to facilitate interpretation. Note that all efficacy items loaded on their intended factor by at least .5, no items cross-loaded on any unintended factor above .2, and only six cross-loadings exceeded .1. The four factors had some moderate correlations as expected, necessitating further analyses (see the ANCOVA below) for discriminant validity to show that experimental effects on EPE are on the portion of EPE’s variance unshared with the other efficacy constructs. EPE was moderately positively correlated with both internal efficacy (r = .422, p &lt; .01) and external efficacy (r = .301, p &lt; .01). The two participation efficacy constructs were also moderately correlated with one another (r = .311, p &lt; .01), and the only other significant correlation among the four constructs was between cynicism and external efficacy (r = −.090, p &lt; .01). The correlation between EPE and cynicism was negative and not significant (r = −.051, p = .079).</p>

<title>Experimental Effects</title>
<p>H1a and H1b, which predicted framing and adjudication effects on subjective evaluations of news story quality, were tested using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. This model included two dummy variables, one for adjudication and the other for game framing, leaving passive policy framing as the missing dummy. Thus, main effects of these two dummy variables serve as tests for H1a and H1b, both of which predict differences relative to passive policy framing. Article evaluations were, as predicted, highest in the adjudicated policy condition (M = 6.63), followed by the passive policy condition (M = 5.33), and lowest in the game condition (M = 5.07). H1a, which predicted a difference between the adjudicated and passive policy conditions, was supported, as the adjudication dummy was significant, F(1, 1069) = 97.03, one-tailed p &lt; .001. H1b, which predicted a difference between the game and passive policy conditions, was also supported, as the game dummy was significant, F(1, 1069) = 3.87, one-tailed p = .025.</p>
<p>H2a and H2b, which predicted that the two factual belief measures would each be higher in the fact-checking condition than in either of the other conditions, were tested as least significant difference (LSD) contrasts on two ANOVA models, one for each factual belief question, with the news article manipulation entered as a single three-level factor. Mean differences between the three experimental groups were in a direction consistent with predictions for both factual belief items.

In both models, the mean in the adjudication condition was significantly higher than that of each of the other two conditions, with all four relevant LSD contrasts significant at the p &lt; .001 level.</p>
<p>H3a and H3b, which predicted framing and fact-checking effects on political cynicism, were tested using another ANOVA model identical to those testing H1 above, with political cynicism as the dependent variable. Cynicism was highest in the fact-checked policy-framing condition (M = 5.50), followed by the game-framing condition (M = 5.46), and lowest in the passive policy-framing condition (M = 5.33). H3a, which predicted that game framing would produce higher cynicism than passive policy framing, was not supported, as the main effect of the game-framing variable was not significant, F(1, 1048) = 2.09, one-tailed p = .074. H3b, which predicted that fact-checked policy framing would produce higher cynicism than passive policy framing, was supported, F(1, 1048) = 3.56, one-tailed p = .03.</p>
<p>H4a, which predicted that fact-checked policy framing would produce higher EPE than passive policy framing, was tested using an ANOVA with the dependent variable being EPE instead of cynicism, otherwise identical to the previous model. Specifically, EPE was highest in the fact-checked policy-framing condition (M = 6.13), followed by the passive policy-framing condition (M = 5.85) and the game-framing condition (M = 5.79). As fact-checked policy framing produced significantly higher EPE than passive policy framing, F(1, 1063) = 4.279, one-tailed p = .020, H4a was supported. H4b predicted that this same effect would exist above and beyond controls for political cynicism, internal efficacy, and external efficacy. As these constructs share some variance with EPE, it is important to demonstrate that the experimental effect is on the portion of variance unique to EPE. This was tested using a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) that included these three additional variables as covariates and was otherwise identical to the model testing H4a. In this model, the main effect of fact checking remained significant, F(1, 1045) = 5.14, one-tailed p = .012, supporting H4b. To further verify that these effects are on EPE and not other forms of efficacy, we ran two additional ANOVA models replacing EPE with one of the two other political efficacy constructs. In these models, adjudication had no significant effect on either internal political participation efficacy, F(1, 1059) = .027, p = .870, or external political participation efficacy, F(1, 1059) = .232, p = .630.</p>
<p>Again, because of the almost universally high levels of interest in economic issues due to the financial crisis at the time of data collection, with only 2% of respondents scoring below the midpoint of the issue interest scale, we hypothesized a main effect of adjudication on EPE instead of the interest-moderated effect found in the two previous studies. That this hypothesis was supported of course does not rule out the possibility that even among a sample where virtually all respondents were interested in the issue under dispute, varying degrees of interest might be associated with varying effect strength. Alternatively, one might also predict that only a certain threshold of interest is necessary to cause readers to want a dispute to be adjudicated and that above that threshold additional interest does not make the experience any more or less relevant to future feelings of epistemic efficacy. Therefore, we ran one additional supplemental analysis to test the moderating role of interest. This model was an OLS regression (<inline-formula id="inline-formula3-0093650212439205">

</inline-formula> = .02) predicting EPE from issue interest, the adjudication dummy, a game dummy, interaction terms between issue interest and each dummy, and two additional dummies for the other (unused) experimental manipulation. In this model, adjudication significantly predicted EPE (β = .33, one-tailed p = .038), as did issue interest (β = .11, one-tailed p &lt; .001), but their interaction term was actually negative and not significant. Thus, it appears only some threshold level of interest is necessary to create the conditions under which exposure to adjudication matters for EPE; specifically, a cognitive effort by the reader to resolve the factual dispute, resulting in accumulation of efficacy or inefficacy via “enactive mastery” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650212439205">Bandura, 1982</xref>), depending on the perceived success or failure of this cognitive effort.</p>

<title>EPE as a Predictor of Outcomes</title>
<p>Hypotheses 5a and 5b concerned EPE’s unique contribution to predicting information seeking and participation above and beyond other general political orientations. These hypotheses were tested with two OLS regression models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093650212439205">Table 2</xref>). The three efficacy scales and political cynicism were included as predictors, along with a set of relevant political orientations: ideological direction, ideological strength, issue interest (because both outcomes were specific to this issue), and self-reported general political knowledge. In the model predicting information seeking, EPE was a significant and positive predictor, supporting H5a. External efficacy was also a significant and positive predictor, but internal efficacy and cynicism were not significant. EPE was also just barely significant in the model predicting participation, supporting H5b. EPE therefore adds predictive power above and beyond cynicism and a variety of other general political orientations in predicting two important outcomes, and particularly so for information seeking, the outcome more closely conceptually related to EPE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study replicated past findings that journalistic adjudication can increase audience EPE while demonstrating that this effect is distinct from the spiral of cynicism. In general, adjudicated policy coverage had the most positive outcomes of the three forms of coverage examined, including the most positive subjective evaluations of story quality, the highest accuracy in terms of factual beliefs, and an increase in EPE. However, adjudicated policy coverage also had the potentially negative side effect of increasing political cynicism. Perhaps because adjudication necessarily highlights inaccurate or misleading claims by elites, it negatively affects evaluations of the political process despite its positive effects on perceptions of the quality of the news and the possibility of getting to the bottom of factual disputes.</p>
<p>Overall, this side effect of adjudication on cynicism does not dissuade us from advocating for more journalistic adjudication, for two reasons. First, even if we take this increase in cynicism at face value, a broad shift toward more journalistic adjudication might arguably only produce a short-term increase in cynicism by highlighting elite dishonesty, while at the same time providing a stronger incentive for elites to become more honest, resulting eventually in a reduction in cynicism. Second, one might also question the normative implications of these cynicism effects. Political cynicism is a contested concept in the literature, both conceptually and operationally. No well-validated or even particularly reliable measures exist, and although research has fairly consistently replicated media effects on cynicism, any effects cynicism may have in turn on other outcomes (such as political participation) have been inconsistent or weak at best (see DeVreese, 2005). Furthermore, what is measured as cynicism may also be skepticism. The argument that political cynicism is an undesirable citizen orientation rests on a conceptual distinction between cynicism and skepticism, with both concepts involving negative beliefs about politics but cynicism involving holding these beliefs closed-mindedly and without exception (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650212439205">Cappella &amp; Jamieson, 1997</xref>). Although we find the normative argument compelling in terms of cynicism being less desirable than skepticism, it is not clear that this conceptual distinction has been successfully operationalized with cynicism measures. Thus, any effects found on cynicism could just as well be interpreted as effects on skepticism, a much more democratically desirable outcome. One could even argue that any short-term media effects on cynicism should be interpreted as effects on skepticism because, by definition, cynicism is an inherently close-minded orientation and thus should be more stable. Until better measures of political cynicism are developed, we should be very skeptical in drawing normative conclusions about any effects on it.</p>
<p>However, we can at least conclude from this study that whatever political cynicism is, EPE seems quite distinct from it. The lack of any political cynicism measures in past EPE studies left open a plausible alternative interpretation of EPE as measuring the inverse of cynicism, with adjudication acting as merely a stronger policy frame and thus the effects found being merely the familiar spiral of cynicism. The measure of cynicism used here provided a particularly stringent test of whether EPE taps the reverse of cynicism by using reverse-coded cynicism items. The alternative interpretation was unsupported by the results of this study in four ways. First, at the level of individual items, factor analysis resulted in clean separation between political cynicism, EPE, and two other forms of political efficacy. Second, when entered together in a regression predicting information seeking, EPE was a significant predictor but cynicism was not. This suggests that EPE measures variance that is not only independent from cynicism but also useful above and beyond cynicism in predicting information seeking. Third, if an adjudicated news story was merely a stronger version of the policy frame because the additional fact-checking paragraph added more time spent on the topic of policy, arguably any effect of adding another paragraph or two of (adjudicated) policy coverage should be dwarfed by the difference between a policy frame throughout the article versus a game frame throughout the article, in terms of effects on EPE. In fact, results showed no significant difference between the game-framed and passive policy articles, counter to what the alternative interpretation would predict. Fourth and finally, the shared-variance aspect of the alternative interpretation failed the most direct test. The effects of adjudication on EPE remained after controlling for cynicism, confirming that the effects found were not on the portion of EPE variance shared with cynicism.</p>
<p>In terms of effects on EPE, adjudication significantly increased EPE as in past studies, but unlike past studies this effect was significant as a main effect across all participants and was not confined to those above the median on a measure of prior interest in the issues under dispute. This is likely a consequence of high interest in the issues chosen for this study (the economy and taxes) due to an economic crisis at the time of data collection. In terms of effects on political cynicism, strategic framing did not significantly increase cynicism relative to passive policy framing, but adjudicated policy framing did. This failure to replicate the basic spiral of cynicism effect is unsurprising in a one-shot intervention consisting of a brief news article and should not be treated as evidence against the spiral of cynicism as a long-term, accumulating effect of strategic news coverage. Furthermore, the context of this study is far from typical, with almost universally high levels of interest in the issue among respondents due to a quite frightening economic crisis. However, the finding that adjudicated policy-framed articles increased political cynicism should give us pause and is worthy of future study. This potential negative side effect of adjudication may be specific to cases involving a clear implication that politicians on both sides made dishonest factual claims, as in the stimulus in this study. It is plausible that another form of adjudication could be identified that increases EPE without also increasing cynicism, such as fact checking that implicates dishonesty only by one side or that implies the incorrect claims were the result of an honest mistake.</p>
<p>External validity is a substantial limitation of this study, as with any experiment using a student convenience sample. The effects found on these participants may not generalize to any broader population. Furthermore, as with most experiments, the particular stimulus materials used may have had their effects due to some idiosyncratic feature other than what we intended to manipulate. The context of the study may also not be representative of real-world conditions; participants viewed a textual postdebate news article immediately after viewing the debate video, and the issue highlighted was one that most participants had very high interest in at the time. Both of these conditions may be unusual in real-world news use, again calling into question whether the effects found here can be generalized. As this is the third study to demonstrate that adjudication can increase EPE for interested readers, across three different issues (the economy, health care, and wrongdoing by a fictional corporation), the concerns about idiosyncratic stimulus features or an idiosyncratic issue context are somewhat reduced. However, because all three of these studies used convenience samples of undergraduate students, a crucial next step is to examine these effects in a more representative adult sample.</p>

<title>Text of Treatment Articles With Game Frame Condition in Italics and Fact-Checking Paragraphs in Bold</title>
<p>News Brief: Candidates [dispute/<italic>bicker about</italic>] tax policies</p>
<p>Oxford, MS: Senators Barack Obama and John McCain presented their cases to the American people at the first presidential debate tonight at the University of Mississippi. The debate was originally slated to cover foreign policy but due to the financial crisis focused instead on the economy.</p>
<p>Early in the debate, a question about the economic crisis led to a heated discussion of taxes and spending.</p>
<p>McCain continued to emphasize earmark spending reform [as an important part of his economic recovery plan/<italic>to take advantage of anger among many voters over wasteful spending in congress</italic>]. At the same time, he advocated for corporate tax breaks [breaks as a way to stimulate growth and create jobs/<italic>to connect with economic conservatives, business owners, and potential large contributors to his campaign</italic>].</p>
<p>Obama’s proposals concentrated on tax cuts for the middle class [as a way to stimulate the economy through increasing consumer spending. He argued that further corporate tax breaks would not lead to new jobs due to low levels of consumer spending/<italic>to attract working class voters, a particularly important group for the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and a group that Obama had trouble with in the primary</italic>].</p>
<p>When the candidates [debated/<italic>sparred about</italic>] the business tax, McCain [asserted that the U.S. business tax rate is the second highest in the world. Obama disagreed, claiming that U.S. businesses pay one of the lowest tax rates in the world/<italic>aggressively interrupted the moderator and insisted on a continuation of the discussion before moving on. Obama appeared patient and calm throughout the exchange</italic>].</p>
<p><bold>According to the non-partisan <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://FactCheck.org">FactCheck.org</ext-link>, Obama’s claim is correct. Although the business tax rate is thirty-five percent, which would be one of the highest rates in the world, most businesses pay considerably less through various exemptions and credits in the current tax code.</bold></p>
<p>[The candidates also disagreed on individual tax rates. Although both claimed they would lower taxes, McCain argued Obama had a history of raising taxes and would continue to do so. Specifically, McCain claimed Obama voted to raise taxes on people making as little as US$42,000./<italic>However, later in the same discussion, Obama appeared to lose his cool during an exchange about individual tax rates. During McCain’s turn to speak, after comments about Obama’s tax voting record, Obama became visibly annoyed, looking away from McCain, frowning, and shaking his head.</italic>]</p>
<p>He then interrupted saying, “That’s just not true John. That’s not true.”</p>
<p>To which McCain replied, “And that’s just a fact. You can look it up.”</p>
<p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://FactCheck.org">FactCheck.org</ext-link> found McCain’s claim was correct. Obama voted for a budget resolution that called for higher federal income tax rates on a single, non-homeowner who earned as little as US$42,000 per year. The general purpose of that resolution was allowing most of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts to expire.</bold></p>
