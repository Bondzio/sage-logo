<p>The defining feature of autobiographies is not necessarily the vivid recollection of the author. Old men — and women, too — forget or deliberately shuffle life's blemishes so far back into the memory that, among a torrent of reminiscence, they escape mention. Hence it is difficult not to seize upon an omission from the late Bob Edwards' book that remains, 30 years after the event, an unexplained journalistic blunder that was for most of those involved a source of embarrassment and humiliation.</p>
<p>When in 1982, Norman Lucas, a fine reporter, discovered that a nighttime intruder had managed not only to enter Buckingham Palace but actually find his way into the Queen's bedchamber to awaken a startled monarch, the <italic>Sunday Mirror</italic> was presented with a scoop to excite any journalist. Editor Edwards, along with company chairman and editorial director Tony Miles — both away from the office on holiday — were understandably cautious, having less than two years previously incurred the displeasure of the royal household with a story alleging that the Prince of Wales had secretly been visited by then girlfriend Lady Diana Spencer on board the royal train, parked overnight in Wiltshire sidings. The Palace had instantly refuted a “totally false story”; Edwards refused to apologise, convinced it was true (grave doubts were to emerge later).</p>
<p>After establishing the strength of Lucas's sources, it was agreed that the story of the royal intruder would be put by the newsdesk to the Palace at noon on the Saturday prior to publication. A denial would be accepted; the lack of one and any obvious prevarication, such as “No comment”, would be taken by the paper as a green light. As one of Edwards' assistant editors, I was senior man on the backbench when the Palace reply arrived: “No comment.” Whereupon both editor and chairman lost their nerve; from afar they instructed the story should be spiked.</p>
<p>With an astonished, outraged and disheartened newsroom still reeling, the report of Michael Fagan's extraordinary royal escapade escaped — doubtless with some assistance — into Fleet Street and appeared as the splash story in the following Monday's <italic>Daily Express.</italic> The by-lined reporter, Norman Luck, was subsequently honoured for his Scoop of the Year. I failed to see any mention of its provenance in the obituaries of Luck following his death earlier this year; nor does it emerge within the covers of Edwards' finely-written memoir, although the royal train furore is fully documented.</p>
<p>There is much in the recounting of his childhood, however, that explains aspects of Bob Edwards' character in later life. His frequently absent father secretly maintained a double life with two separate families, an arrangement depriving young Bob of any normal father-son relationship and surely determining his later devotion to the mercurial Express Group proprietor Lord Beaverbrook and the apparent constant search for a father figure. When I worked for Edwards he frequently referred to Tony Miles, several years his junior, as “The Old Man”. “He's younger than you,” I observed one day. Edwards looked at me uncomprehendingly. “But ever since Beaverbrook I've called all my chairmen The Old Man,” he protested.</p>
<p>It was Beaverbrook who fast-tracked Edwards into journalism's major league after having his attention drawn to the vigorous young editor of the left-wing <italic>Tribune.</italic> Edwards impressed his original Old Man at the <italic>Evening Standard</italic> and <italic>Sunday Express</italic> and then famously twice became editor of the then mighty <italic>Daily Express</italic> — an out-of-town sojourn in Scotland punctuated his tenures — before succeeding the legendary Sam Campbell at <italic>The People</italic> and subsequently moving to Mirror Group's sister Sunday title. Four separate national newspaper editorships won him a place in the <italic>The Guinness Book of Records</italic>, a seal of recognition of a “record” that Bob continued to acknowledge long after the category was dropped from the book and, indeed, even when Richard Stott — <italic>The People</italic> twice, <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> twice and <italic>Today</italic> — overhauled him.</p>
<p>It was at <italic>The People</italic> that Edwards' journalistic nous and flair probably peaked. When years later I edited the title, having found his stewardship of the <italic>Sunday Mirror</italic> erratic (although his political antenna was still acute and his editorials beautifully crafted), I asked an old hand what he had thought of Bob's leadership. “Best editor I ever worked for,” he replied. “Clever, brave and totally loyal to his staff.” In this book, Edwards writes: “Which paper did I most enjoy editing?… Them all, is the answer, including the <italic>Evening Citizen</italic> in Glasgow. But the <italic>People</italic> was the most exciting.” I wish I had worked with him then.</p>
<p>The last of Edwards' “Old Men” did for him in the end. Bob had befriended Robert Maxwell years before he bulldozed his way into the chairman's office at Mirror Group and in <italic>Goodbye Fleet Street</italic> observed, “I felt I was used by him much more than he gave in return.” That's largely true: Edwards supplied Maxwell with knowledge and advice about newspapers — when the editor was absent from his office, the <italic>Sunday Mirror</italic> newsdesk or I often fielded late-night phone calls from a Maxwell impatient to learn of any mention of him in the Sunday papers — and was repaid come the arrival of his new boss by “promotion” to senior group editor and then the equally impotent role of deputy chairman. Retirement swiftly followed.</p>
<p>He was only 60 when he waved goodbye to a Fleet Street in which he had starred for so long. This account of those years and much more besides is a delicious doughnut of a book, let down only by the hole in the middle.</p>
