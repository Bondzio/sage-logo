<p>Another school year has started and with it another year of possibilities. How can music educators make the most of their possibilities this year? At a recent meeting of general music educators, I heard a common thread weave its way through the conversation—the need for music educators to connect and collaborate. The most successful connecting and collaborating involves individuals from all levels of the music-learning community—students, parents, colleagues, and administrators. Commit to an open dialogue with all the stakeholders in your music programs.</p>
<p>Be passionate about your teaching delivery, instructional materials, and music repertoire this year. Remember it is the teacher who creates classrooms filled with enthusiasm.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The passionate teacher fully believes that learning is fun, satisfying, and self-reinforcing. He believes that how he talks about this specific topic and the ways he leads students to experience it can make each lesson more engaging. He builds lessons that are intrinsically rewarding. Students learn without noticing, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312458105">Steele, 2009</xref>, p. 187)</p>

<p>Students recognize and are drawn to passionate and enthusiastic teachers.</p>
<p>A fellow educator, from the Rhode Island Department of Education, expressed her opinion of the importance of music in the schools. I was moved by the passion in Dr. Burns’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1048371312458105">1</xref></sup> words and hope it will do the same for the <italic>General Music Today</italic> readers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Learning music improves students’ ability to read and do math. It does this because of the nature of music—the way we think and our brains operate while processing music. The more opportunities that students get to engage critically with music—the making of and thinking about music—the more it offers to students. It is important that people know this because student engagement in music is good for student learning.</p>
<p>Music keeps many [children] coming to school—as do several other things that speak to students’ personal sense of belonging and relevance (sports, visual art, and even science and math class for different kids). These statements are true and should be communicated, because they are true and they support a common agenda. The fact of the matter is, that when student learning is integrated across disciplines they learn better and more deeply. When instruction brings students to emotionally connect—they learn better and more deeply. Learning that includes music provides these opportunities. However, music—in my humble opinion, the most accessible of art forms—brings a depth of connection to the human experience in a way that has made great women and men drop to their knees. It emboldens us to act, to reconsider, to express our love, to question authority, to fall into line and to explore ideas that no words can conjure. What happens when students don’t get to explore these possibilities? What happens when they do? Rhetorical questions (sort of), but really, who would care about music if it just helps us read and do math better? Music sustains and will always sustain for much more fundamental reasons.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Every time you venture into your classroom, I challenge you to connect, collaborate, and remember the importance of your role as a music educator in the lives of those students who daily cross the thresholds of your music classrooms.</p>
