<abstract>
<p>Research on work as a calling is limited by measurement concerns. In response, the authors introduce the multidimensional Calling and Vocation Questionnaire (CVQ) and the Brief Calling scale (BCS), instruments assessing presence of, and search for, a calling. Study 1 describes CVQ development using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a cross-validated split-sample approach with 456 undergraduates. The CVQ contained six reliable subscales that form CVQ-Presence and CVQ-Search scores, which demonstrated moderate 1-month test–retest reliability, good fit to a six-factor structure, and initial support for construct validity. Study 2 reports a multitrait–multimethod analysis with 134 undergraduates and 365 informants. Self-reported CVQ and BCS scores moderately to strongly correlated with informant reports and scores for both instruments correlated in hypothesized directions with work hope, prosocial work motivation, life meaning, and the search for meaning. CVQ and BCS scores provide psychometrically sound measures of calling, with the CVQ offering the potential for more fine-grained, multidimensional analyses.</p>

<p>The idea that work can be approached as a calling or vocation has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711434410">Hardy, 1990</xref>), but a short past within the social sciences, which only recently have begun to investigate the construct empirically (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711434410">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711434410">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711434410">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072711434410">Elangovan, Pinder, &amp; McLean, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711434410">Serow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711434410">Steger, Pickering, Shin, &amp; Dik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, &amp; Schwartz, 1997</xref>). The notion of calling seems to lie at the heart of a holistic understanding of work in the context of life, highlighting concerns such as career development, job satisfaction, well-being, and personal growth. Research suggests that it holds potential for uniting these and other domains (e.g., social justice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711434410">Dik, Duffy, &amp; Steger, 2012</xref>; spirituality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711434410">Steger et al., 2010</xref>). However, as with many emerging areas of scholarship, measurement challenges have been a primary obstacle to overcome as research on calling proceeds (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik &amp; Duffy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski, 2010</xref>). In response, the primary purpose of the current research was to develop and establish psychometric support for the Calling and Vocation Questionnaire (CVQ), a theoretically derived, multidimensional instrument designed to assess calling in the domain of work. A secondary purpose was to examine the construct validity of the Brief Calling scale (BCS), a highly efficient instrument designed to assess the extent to which people perceive that they have a calling, or are seeking one.</p>

<title>Research on Calling</title>
<p>As interest in the construct of calling has grown within psychology, sociology, and management, numerous studies have examined its importance to specific populations and how it relates to a host of other variables. Several have shown that a large proportion of college students and adults endorse the construct. Using data from over 5,000 college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711434410">Duffy and Sedlacek (2010)</xref> found that more than 40% state that having a calling to a particular line of work was mostly or totally true of them; no substantive differences were found across gender or ethnicity. Similar percentages of working adults also view their careers as a calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711434410">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711434410">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that the term is salient to a wide range of people.</p>
<p>Most research on calling has investigated its relation to career-related criterion variables. For college students, the presence of a calling has correlated positively with career decidedness, choice comfort, vocational self-clarity, career decision self-efficacy, work-related outcome expectations, academic satisfaction, and intrinsic work motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711434410">Dik, Sargent, &amp; Steger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072711434410">Duffy, Allan, &amp; Dik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711434410">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711434410">Steger et al., 2010</xref>). In other words, students more likely to endorse a calling tend to be more firm, comfortable, and confident in their career choices, view their future careers more positively, and are more satisfied in the academic domain. Similarly, calling has related positively with beneficial work-related variables among employed adults. For example, those with a calling tend to display greater occupational identification, occupational importance, career commitment, work meaningfulness, perceived organizational duty, work zest, and work satisfaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711434410">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711434410">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069072711434410">Duffy, Dik, &amp; Steger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711434410">Peterson, Park, Hall, &amp; Seligman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711434410">Serow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1069072711434410">Steger &amp; Dik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski et al., 1997</xref>). To a somewhat lesser degree, calling also has been positively associated with well-being. College students endorsing a calling tend to be slightly more satisfied with their lives and report higher levels of life meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711434410">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1069072711434410">Steger &amp; Dik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711434410">Steger et al., 2010</xref>); these linkages are somewhat stronger when assessed with employed adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711434410">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711434410">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). To summarize, endorsing higher levels of a calling appears to be related to both positive work-related and general well-being criterion variables.</p>

<title>Measurement Issues</title>
<p>When discussing research on calling, it is critical to point out concerns with how the construct has been measured. Calling measures have been constructed almost exclusively on an ad hoc basis according to the needs of individual studies. Often, they operationalize a construct that is only loosely defined in the studies from which measures have originated, and thorough psychometric evidence is rarely reported. Typically, measurement strategies have consisted of the following: (a) categorizing participants into “calling,” “job,” or “career” orientations based on ratings of vignettes describing different work orientations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711434410">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski et al., 1997</xref>); (b) scales developed for specific populations of workers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711434410">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711434410">Dobrow &amp; Tosti-Kharas, 2011</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711434410"> Serow, 1994</xref>); and (c) multiitem unidimensional scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711434410">Dobrow &amp; Tosti-Kharas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711434410">Dreher, Holloway, &amp; Shoenfelder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1069072711434410">Treadgold, 1999</xref>). Each type of instrument carries limitations. Categorization techniques have reliability concerns and may limit the capacity to assess the full range of variability that likely exists among the endorsement of a calling. Instruments developed for specific occupations are often useful in their immediate context, but the extent to which such instruments can be used with other samples is unclear. Finally, unidimensional strategies are unable to examine complexities that may exist in how people express or experience a sense of calling, given that the construct has been conceptualized as multidimensional in nature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik &amp; Duffy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072711434410">Elangovan et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1069072711434410">
<title>The Current Research</title>
<p>Without valid, theoretically grounded instruments to assess calling, it is more difficult for this line of research to advance in a rigorous and conceptually clear manner. Efforts to construct a new measure should begin with a clear definition of the construct being assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072711434410">Dawis, 2000</xref>). We conceptualize calling in line with the three-part definition proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy (2009)</xref>, who described a calling as “(1) a transcendent summons, experienced as originating beyond the self, to (2) approach a particular life role in a manner oriented toward demonstrating or deriving a sense of purpose or meaningfulness and (3) that holds other-oriented values and goals as primary sources of motivation” (p. 427, numbers added). Calling often is used interchangeably with the closely related term <italic>vocation</italic>. However, following authors who have noted changes in how the latter term has been used over time, Dik and Duffy defined vocation as an approach to a life role consisting of derivation of purpose or meaningfulness and other-oriented values or goals, but without the additional component of a perceived summons from an external source (i.e., vocation consists the second and third dimensions of calling). This manner of conceptualizing calling also posited two overarching and overlapping aspects of the construct: presence and search. That is, some individuals may perceive that they currently have a calling (presence), whereas others may not currently sense a calling but report that they are actively seeking one (search).</p>
<p>Assessing the “presence of” and “search for” (a) transcendent summons, (b) purposeful work, and (c) prosocial orientation dimensions of calling provides two primary advantages not shared by other measurement approaches. First, linking the measurement instrument to a clearly articulated definition of calling provides a level of conceptual clarity not currently available among most measures of calling. Second, assessing the construct multidimensionally allows exploration of more sophisticated research questions than can be examined using coarse unidimensional measures of calling. To summarize, the current research seeks to address a critical gap in literature by developing and validating a multidimensional instrument to measure calling, using Dik and Duffy’s tripartite definition as a theoretical guide.</p>
<p>The second study reported in this article also provides a psychometric evaluation of the BCS, which assesses the presence of calling and search for a calling using scales consisting of just 2 items each. The BCS does not overcome the third limitation described above; it distinguishes presence and search dimensions but uses a unidimensional strategy to do so, collapsing the three components of calling into general calling scales. However, some researchers may at times desire to assess the extent to which a person believes she has a calling or is seeking one generally, without further examining the underlying dimensions. In such circumstances, brief instruments are especially useful, provided they yield reliable and valid scores. The BCS has been used in a few studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711434410">Dik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711434410">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711434410">Steger et al., 2010</xref>) with promising psychometric support, but this study provides the first thorough examination of the construct validity of its scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1069072711434410">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>The purpose of study 1 was to develop, refine, and provide initial psychometric evaluation of the CVQ, which was accomplished via the following steps: (a) development of an item pool, (b) a test of the items and establishment of an initial factor structure using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), (c) further refinement of the item pool using both EFA and CFA, (d) cross-validation of the measurement model using CFA, and (e) establishment of initial evidence for reliability and validity of scale scores. The first step was writing items, following available guidelines (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711434410">Clark &amp; Watson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072711434410">Dawis, 2000</xref>), designed to assess both “presence” and “search” dimensions across each of the three domains specified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition of calling. Attempts were made to write items that were straightforward, that avoided colloquialisms, and that would be appropriate across a wide range of cultural groups. Attempts also were made to write a large pool of items that liberally oversampled the construct in ways that accounted for the disparate approaches to defining it, with the intent of allowing the data to “speak for themselves” when factor analytic strategies were applied. For example, because some definitions in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072711434410">Dalton, 2001</xref>) postulate attributions of calling to particular sources (e.g., God, social needs, one’s own abilities), items were written that included these sources as well as items that were source-free. Similarly, because some definitions explicitly frame calling in a religious context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711434410">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>), items were written to include the religious content contained in those definitions. Finally, some items were written which we expected could load negatively on factors assessing perceptions of work as a calling. This strategy followed directives by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711434410">Clark and Watson (1995)</xref>, who suggested that “the initial item pool (a) should be broader and more comprehensive than one’s own theoretical view of the target construct and (b) should include content that ultimately will be shown to be tangential or even unrelated to core constructs” (p. 311).</p>
<p>This item generation process resulted in an initial pool of 180 items. A four-level response scale (1 = <italic>not at all true of me</italic>, 2 = <italic>somewhat true of me</italic>, 3 = <italic>mostly true of me</italic>, 4 = <italic>absolutely true of me</italic>) was selected to eliminate a neutral or midpoint response option (and therefore to minimize the central tendency response bias; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072711434410">Dawis, 2000</xref>) and to allow participants to classify themselves meaningfully without forcing unrealistically subtle distinctions between response levels. The 180 items were screened for clarity by a counseling psychologist (not otherwise involved in this study) with expertise on the topic of calling as well as scale construction, and by a group of undergraduate psychology volunteers. Their ratings and feedback prompted a round of revision, with some items rewritten and others deleted due to lack of clarity or redundancy, resulting in a revised pool of 156 items. Readability statistics available in Microsoft Word revealed that the items had a Flesch Reading Ease rating of 64.7 and a Flech–Kincaid Grade Level rating of 6.0, indicating a standard level of difficulty corresponding to approximately a sixth-grade reading level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069072711434410">Harvey, 1997</xref>). This revised item pool was subsequently administered to a sample of college students to facilitate further refinement and to provide initial evidence of reliability and validity.</p>
<p>Regarding validity evidence for the completed instrument, we hypothesized that those attending religious services more frequently and those indicating in absolute (i.e., yes or no) terms that calling is relevant to their approach to work would score higher on presence of calling and search for calling scales than those attending less often or reporting that calling is not relevant. We also examined differences across sex, race/ethnicity, and year in school, approaching these comparisons as research questions rather than as tests of directional hypotheses relevant for evaluating criterion-related validity. Finally, to establish initial evidence of construct validity, we administered measures of criterion variables with varying degrees of conceptual relatedness to calling. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> suggestion that calling is an ongoing process rather than something to be discovered once and for all, we expected high correlations between scores reflecting the presence of, and search for, a calling. We also expected these correlations would be stronger than those of either calling variable with intrinsic work motivation, which would in turn be stronger than correlations between calling variables and career decision self-efficacy, extrinsic work motivation, or life satisfaction.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>A total of 456 participants were recruited from introductory psychology courses at a large, Western, public research university (<italic>n</italic> = 360) and two small, Midwestern, Christian liberal arts colleges (<italic>n</italic> = 96). College students were selected because of the developmental relevance of seeking and experiencing a calling for many students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1069072711434410">Hunter, Dik, &amp; Banning, 2010</xref>). The public research university sample was supplemented by students at the religiously affiliated institutions following a purposive sampling strategy guided by the expectation that calling may be particularly salient for participants with faith commitments. Participants reported a mean age of 18.78 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.42, range of 17–31) and self-identified mostly as women (72.7%) and White/European American (85.1%; 2.4% = Latino/Hispanic American, 2.2% = Asian American and Pacific Islander; 1.3% = Black/African American; 0.9% = American Indian/Native American; 2.6% = biracial or multiracial; 1.8% = other). Although the sample included a high percentage of White women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711434410">Worthington and Whittaker (2006)</xref> noted that “representativeness in scale development research does not follow conventional wisdom—that is, it is not necessary to closely represent any clearly identified population as long as those who would score high and those who would score low are well represented” (p. 816).</p>
<p>Participants were offered partial course credit for participation. Students providing their informed consent were directed to an Internet survey that included the item pool and a brief demographic questionnaire. One month after the initial questionnaire (Time 1) was administered, an e-mail was sent to the public university students with a link to a second questionnaire (Time 2) containing the item pool and additional instruments (see below) for purposes of assessing test–retest reliability and establishing initial evidence of construct validity. A total of 333 (92.5%) of the original 360 public university participants participated at Time 2 (76% women, 83% White).</p>

<title>Refining the Item Pool</title>
<p>The first step in our analytic strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711434410">Steger, 2006</xref>) was to use EFA coupled with parallel analysis to (a) verify the presence of factors specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition in the item pool, and (b) identify extraneous item content. EFA was used to verify that the desired item content remained intact through efforts to reduce the size of the item pool. To maintain an adequate item-to-participant ratio at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1069072711434410">Kahn, 2006</xref>), we conducted the initial EFAs on the full sample of 456 participants. Anticipating that factors would be intercorrelated, we subjected the correlation matrix for the 156 items to a principle axis factoring (PAF) analysis with oblique, promax rotation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1069072711434410">Kahn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711434410">Steger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711434410">Worthington &amp; Whittaker, 2006</xref>). The initial solution demonstrated that the matrix was factorable (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy = .95, Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity − χ<sup>2</sup>(12,090, <italic>N</italic> = 456) = 67,231.46, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, Determinant = 1.46E − 075). Parallel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711434410">Hayton, Allen, &amp; Scarpello, 2004</xref>) indicated that nine factors should be extracted. These nine factors explained 60.42% of the variance. An examination of item content across these factors revealed that five factors corresponded to the six dimensions specified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition: Transcendent summons—presence (20 items that left open the source of the summons); Transcendent summons—search (11 source-free items); Purposeful work—presence (15 items); Purposeful work—search (16 items); and one factor containing presence and search items related to prosocial motives (29 items). The remaining factors consisted of source-specific items (religion, spirituality, 28 items, or fate as source, 3 items), “anticalling” items (materialistic values, lack of purpose, lack of prosocial motives, 26 items), and a factor consisting of items referencing a need for financial security and a need to follow a family legacy (8 items). These latter four factors were deemed outside of the content area specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition, and items that loaded on these factors were deleted, resulting in a final pool of 91 items. A second EFA using PAF with promax rotation confirmed that deleting these items left the five definition-relevant factors intact.</p>
<p>The next step aimed to accomplish two objectives: (a) shorten the measure to increase its utility for research purposes while maintaining high reliability and (b) equalize the number of items on each scale, since there is no theoretically indicated reason for differentially weighting the dimensions. Because the item pool was smaller, we were able to use a split-sample method, employing an iterative process with multiple EFAs (PAF, promax) on a randomly selected portion of the sample, representing roughly 50% of completed surveys (<italic>n</italic> = 234). This approach allows for cross-validation of the final factor structure in a subsample that is relatively independent from efforts to refine the item pool. This reduces capitalizing on sample-specific variance. In this case, the full sample was used to eliminate a number of items, but the split-sample method protected half the sample from decisions about eliminating items that contain the specific content identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy (2009)</xref>, meaning this half of the sample provides a relatively “clean” estimate of the conformance of the final item pool to the theoretically suggested factor structure.</p>
<p>First, the 11 items with factor loadings less than .60 on their intended factor were eliminated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072711434410">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>). Additional item elimination decisions were based on redundancy of items, adherence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> conceptualization of calling dimensions, and α values if particular items were deleted. The item deletion process ceased when αs for scale scores dipped below .85 or scale brevity resulted in inadequate coverage of the definition of the construct. These procedures resulted in a revised item pool of 24 items, all of which were positively scored. These remaining 24 items were subjected to a final PAF with promax rotation, with six factors extracted. Evidence suggested a factorable matrix (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy = .88, Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity − χ<sup>2</sup>(276, <italic>N</italic> = 230) = 3,629.70, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, Determinant = 4.72E − 008). The prosocial orientation items previously loading on a single factor split into separate Presence-Prosocial Orientation and Search-Prosocial Orientation factors, and all other items also loaded on their expected factors. The eigenvalues for the six factors were 8.06, 3.78, 2.58, 1.71, 1.13, and 0.76, respectively, accounting for 33.56%, 15.76%, 10.74%, 7.13%, 4.70%, and 3.18% of the variance, for a total of 75.09%.</p>
<sec id="section15-1069072711434410">
<title>Final revisions to the item pool</title>
<p>Factor structure is not the only criteria for judging the items of a new measure. Efforts also should be made to avoid introducing method bias in an item pool. Using EFA to refine an item pool can maximize item homogeneity, which may extend to item valence. As noted above, all of the items that made it through the EFA analyses were positively scored. To reduce bias (e.g., acquiescence) that may arise from having all positively scored items, we reintroduced eight reverse-scored items that were consistent with adherence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> calling dimensions, but which were eliminated earlier. Thus, a total of 32 items were passed through to finalizing and testing the measurement model.</p>

<sec id="section17-1069072711434410">
<title>Finalizing and Testing the Measurement Model</title>
<p>Although EFA provides valuable information about the patterns of interrelations among items, CFA is the preferred method for finalizing psychological measures and evaluating the fit of items to theoretical measurement models. The major advantage of CFA over EFA approaches to scale construction is that CFA provides empirical indices of model fit (so models can be compared) and modification indices (so the model can be improved to maximize fit; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711434410">Floyd &amp; Widaman, 1995</xref>). CFA quantifies the discrepancy between hypothesized relations among variables (e.g., an item is correlated with one subscale’s latent factor and not with another) and the relations actually observed in the data. We used the structural equation modeling software AMOS 6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711434410">Arbuckle, 2005</xref>) to evaluate how well the hypothesized six-factor structure fit the relations among the 32 remaining items in the item pool (referred to as Model 1), initially using the same first half of the split sample. When necessary, the results of CFA were used to eliminate items according to these three criteria: (a) poor model fit, (b) standardized factor loadings less than .60, and (c) summed modification indices greater than 25.00.</p>
<p>Model 1 did not provide a good fit to the data, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1069072711434410">Hu and Bentler’s (1999)</xref> criteria of Confirmatory Fit Index (CFI) and Nonnormed Fit Index (NNFI) close to or greater than .95 and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and root mean square approximation of error (RMSEA) close to or less than .05, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 449) = 924.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .88; NNFI = .87; SRMR = .08; RMSEA = .07; RMSEA 90% confidence interval (CI) = [.06, .10]. According to our criteria, we eliminated 8 items, most of them negatively scored. We next tested Model 2, consisting of 24 items, with each subscale consisting of a latent factor that loaded onto 4 items.</p>
<p>Model 2 provided acceptable fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 237) = 410.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .94; NNFI = .94; SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .06; RMSEA 90% CI [.05, .07]. Freeing four pairs of item error estimates would have improved the model above all of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1069072711434410">Hu and Bentler’s (1999)</xref> criteria (i.e., Model 3), χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 233) = 364.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .96; NNFI = .95; SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .05; RMSEA 90% CI [.05, .06]. In the interests of parsimony and in an effort to avoid exploiting sample-specific error, we chose to accept Model 2 as the final CVQ solution. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072711434410">Table 2</xref> presents the factors and standardized regression weights (for both halves of the sample) for this solution.</p>

<p>Because CFA was used to make changes to the original model tested using the first half of the split sample, validation of the final model using the second half of the data set was attempted. The fit was actually slightly better in the cross-validation half of the data set, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 237) = 391.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .96; NNFI = .95; SRMR = .04; RMSEA = .06; RMSEA 90% CI [.05, .07]. The fit of this model was compared to two alternative models using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) statistic, which is appropriate for nonnested models. The AIC of the final model identified above was 517.29. The AIC of the first alternative model, in which one latent factor loaded on all “search” items and a second latent factor loaded on all “presence” items, was 2,029.26; the AIC of an alternative model in which all items loaded on a single factor was 2,193.61. Because smaller values indicate a better fit, it can be concluded that the six-factor CVQ model fit better than plausible alternative models. Thus, we concluded that the solution in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1069072711434410">Table 3</xref> provided a good measure with good initial evidence of structural validity. The final CVQ therefore consisted of 24 items, comprised of three 4-item subscales (Presence-Transcendent Summons, Presence-Purposeful Work, Presence-Prosocial Orientation) that reflect the presence of calling (CVQ-Presence) and three 4-item subscales (Search-Transcendent Summons, Search-Purposeful Work, Search-Prosocial Orientation) that reflect the search for calling (CVQ-Search). Combining the respective Presence and Search subscales into summed Presence and Search total scores reduced the fit of the model. It appeared that this decrease in model fit was primarily caused by the amount of variance shared by the presence and search Purposeful Work subscales and the presence and search Prosocial Orientation subscales. This shared variance can be seen in the high positive correlations between these subscale pairs on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072711434410">Table 2</xref>. However, we feel that the advantages of creating Presence and Search total scores in terms of increased usefulness of the CVQ outweighs the better structural fit achieved by keeping each subscale separate. Thus, wherein CFA suggests six relatively independent subscales, we provide analyses based on CVQ-Presence and CVQ-Search scores as well.</p>

<title>Relations With Demographics</title>
<p>Mean comparisons at Time 2 evaluated the effect of demographic variables on CVQ scores.

No differences were found across ethnicity categories for CVQ-Presence, <italic>F</italic>(6.323) = .838, MSE = 56.149, <italic>p</italic> = .541 or CVQ-Search, <italic>F</italic>(6, 321) = 1.559, MSE = 98.724, <italic>p</italic> = .159. Similarly, no differences were found for year in school on either CVQ-Presence, <italic>F</italic>(3, 316) = 1.157, MSE = 77.896, <italic>p</italic> = .326, or CVQ-Search, <italic>F</italic>(3, 315) = .307, MSE = 19.647, <italic>p</italic> = .827.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, there was a significant effect for attendance at religious services for CVQ-Presence, <italic>F</italic>(5, 323) = 8.204, MSE = 495.219, <italic>p</italic> = .000, and CVQ-Search, <italic>F</italic>(5, 321) = 9.730, MSE = 550.329, <italic>p</italic> = .000. Post hoc Tukey’s HSD tests showed that participants who report attending religious services more than once a week had significantly higher scores on CVQ-Presence and CVQ-Search than those who reported attending services two to six times a year, one to three times a year, or never. Participants who reported attending services one to three times a month also had significantly higher scores for both presence of and search for calling than those who indicated they never attend. All other comparisons yielded nonsignificant differences. Also as hypothesized, participants who responded <italic>yes</italic> to any of the three relevance of calling items scored significantly higher than those who responded <italic>no</italic> to all 3 items, both for CVQ-Presence (<italic>yes</italic>: M = 30.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.65; <italic>no</italic>: M = 22.53, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.24), <italic>t</italic>(333) = 10.308, <italic>p</italic> = .000, and CVQ-Search (<italic>yes</italic>: M = 31.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.30; <italic>no</italic>: M = 22.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.67), <italic>t</italic>(331) = 9.988, <italic>p</italic> = .000.</p>

<title>Internal Consistency and Test–Retest Reliability</title>
<p>At Time 1, internal consistency reliability coefficients for CVQ subscales were as follows: Presence-Transcendent Summons, α = .85; Search-Transcendent Summons, α = .86; Presence-Purposeful Work, α = .88; Search-Purposeful Work, α = .88; Presence-Prosocial Orientation, α = .88; and Search-Prosocial Orientation, α = .92. Total scores revealed similar internal consistency, with α = .89 for CVQ-Presence and α = .87 for CVQ-Search.

<p>Correlations among all continuous variables at Time 2 are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1069072711434410">Table 1</xref>. As hypothesized, the most robust relationship existed between presence of and search for calling.

CVQ-Search was moderately correlated with intrinsic motivation and positively but weakly correlated with extrinsic work motivation; its relations with CDSE and life satisfaction were weak and not significant.

<title>Summary and Discussion</title>
<p>Study 1 reported on the use of EFA and CFA to establish empirical support for the CVQ, a multidimensional measurement instrument designed to assess the facets of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> conceptualization of calling. Results using a split-sample, cross-validation approach to refining the item pool and testing the measurement model provide support for a 24-item CVQ with strong evidence of internal consistency reliability. Test–retest reliability coefficients suggested that scores on the constructs are moderately stable over a 1-month period, which is reasonable given that calling is conceptualized as a generally stable yet malleable construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072711434410">Dik, Duffy, &amp; Eldridge, 2009</xref>). Results indicated that women scored slightly higher than men on both presence and search dimensions. Scores also were higher for those reporting more frequent (compared to less frequent) attendance at religious services, and for those indicating that calling is a relevant concern in their career development, providing initial support for criterion-related validity of CVQ scores. No other significant demographic differences were found. Initial evidence was also found supporting the convergent and discriminant validity of scale scores, given that scores on the calling scales correlated more highly with each other than with less conceptually similar criterion variables. The CVQ is unique among instruments designed to measure calling in that it is grounded in a clearly defined conceptualization of calling and provides a multidimensional approach to assessing the construct. However, the initial validity evidence in Study 1 is limited to the criterion variables included in the study. Furthermore, although validity evidence was examined using data collected at a later point in time, participants were the same as those providing the data used to develop and refine the instrument. Therefore, a more comprehensive and formal test of the construct validity of CVQ-Presence and CVQ-Search scores was desired, using an independent sample and a wider array of criterion variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1069072711434410">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of both CVQ and BCS scores using a multitrait–multimethod matrix design. This design provides a comprehensive means of investigating construct validity by testing how well scores on a measure succeed in assessing their targeted construct without measuring other constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1069072711434410">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). Specifically, evidence for convergent validity is established when scores on measures of the same trait are significantly correlated, whether they are measured using the same method (monotrait–monomethod) or different methods (monotrait–heteromethod). Evidence for discriminant validity is established when convergent correlations (i.e., between measures of the same trait) are higher than correlations with scores on measures of conceptually dissimilar traits, whether they are measured using the same method (heterotrait–monomethod) or different methods (heterotrait–heteromethod). The two methods employed in this study were self-report and informant-report. Conceptually, if the CVQ and BCS meet the measurement claims we make for them, scores on the instrument should reflect not just self-perception, but a pattern of behavior observable by others. Hence, patterns of convergent and discriminant correlations should be similar for self-report and informant-report methods. To keep the number of comparisons manageable, we focused on total scores (i.e., CVQ and BCS Presence and Search) in this study rather than also examining CVQ subscale scores.</p>
<p>Because convergent validity is established when different measures of the same trait are highly correlated, we expected significant and very strong positive correlations for CVQ-Presence with BCS-Presence scores, and for CVQ-Search with BCS-Search scores. We also expected significant positive correlations between presence scale scores on both instruments with scores on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, and Schwartz (1997)</xref> calling measure, although we expected that differences in definitions of calling would result in lower correlations involving this latter scale than those found between the CVQ and BCS scales. We also expected significant positive correlations between self- and informant-reports on the same variables.</p>
<p>In contrast, because discriminant validity is established when convergent correlations are stronger than correlations of dissimilar variables, we expected that correlations among calling variables (especially those between like CVQ and BCS scales) would be stronger than correlations between CVQ or BCS scores and scores on measures of less conceptually similar variables. In this study, these other variables consist of work hope, prosocial work motivation, meaning in life, and life satisfaction; each of these are expected to be positively related to calling, but since they are measures of constructs other than calling, these correlations should be weaker in magnitude than correlations of the different measures of calling with each other. Also, we expected different methods of measuring the same variables (monotrait–heteromethod) to be more highly correlated than the same method of measuring different variables (heterotrait–monomethod). Finally, this study compared the patterns of convergent and discriminant correlations of CVQ, BCS, and Wrzesniewski et al.’s single-item scores to assess the extent to which the three scales are differentially supported by construct validity evidence.</p>

<sec id="section25-1069072711434410">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants providing self-report scores were drawn from psychology courses at a large research university in the Western United States and compensated with course credit. They were asked to send to the researchers names and e-mail addresses of two to four people who knew them well (such as friends, parents, or siblings) and who would be willing to respond to a brief survey. Informants were then e-mailed a link to the same items to which referring participants responded, and were instructed to rate each item as if they were the referring participant.</p>
<p>A total of 134 participants referred two or more informants who provided usable data. These referring participants were predominantly female (81.3%) and White (84.2%; 5.8% self-identified as multiracial, 2.9% as Latina/Latino, 1.4% as Asian or Pacific Islander, .7% as African American, 1.4% as other, and 3.6% did not respond) and reported a mean age of 19.33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.10, range of 17–49). The 365 informants also were predominantly female (65.8%) and White (83.8%; 4.4% self-identified as Latina/Latino, 3.6% as multiracial, 2.7% as African American, 1.4% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1.4% as Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.6% as other, and 3.6% did not respond) and reported a mean age of 32.03 (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.57, range of 13–81).</p>
<p>Scores provided by the informants for each referring participant were averaged to form a composite “informant” score for that participant; these were used to compute correlations between self and informant on each pairing of scale scores. Referring participants had an average of 2.72 informants providing usable data.</p>

<sec id="section27-1069072711434410">
<title>BCS</title>
<p>The BCS is a 4-item scale providing unidimensional scores that assess the presence of, and search for, a calling. The BCS defines calling as “a person’s belief that she or he is called upon (by the needs of society, one’s own inner potential, by God, by a Higher Power, etc.) to do a particular kind of work.” Items use a five-level response scale and are provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1069072711434410">Appendix B</xref>. The 2 items in the BCS-presence scale and the 2 items in the BCS-search scale were reported to correlate <italic>r</italic> = .81 and <italic>r</italic> = .75, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711434410">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>). Scores on both scales have correlated in expected directions with criterion variables such as sense of calling (assessed using a career development strivings strategy; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711434410">Dik et al., 2008</xref>), career decidedness, self-clarity, decision self-efficacy, meaning in life, intrinsic work motivation, and materialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711434410">Dik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711434410">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>).</p>

This conceptualization of calling differed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition in that it reflects an approach to work characterized by a sense of social value and personal fulfillment, and did not include a transcendent summons component. In the current study, the calling paragraph was administered along with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711434410">Wrzesniewski et al.’s (1997)</xref> single-item scale for rating the extent to which the person depicted in the paragraph is 0 = <italic>not at all like me</italic>, 1 = <italic>a little [like me]</italic>, 2 = <italic>somewhat [like me]</italic>, or 3 = <italic>very much [like me]</italic>.

<p>The Work Hope scale (WHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711434410">Juntunen &amp; Wettersten, 2006</xref>) is a 24-item measure designed to assess work hope, a motivational state, with positive valence, characterized by having agency and pathways for pursing work-related goals held by the individual. Items (e.g., I expect to do what I really want to do at work) use a 7-point response scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Scores on the WHS have demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .93) and 2-week test–retest (<italic>r</italic> = .90) reliability, and have correlated in predicted directions with criterion variables such as career decision making, vocational identity, and optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711434410">Juntunen &amp; Wettersten, 2006</xref>).

<title>Convergent and Discriminant Validity for CVQ-Presence and BCS-Presence Scores</title>
<sec id="section35-1069072711434410">
<title>Convergent correlations</title>
<p>Convergent validity is indicated when correlations of CVQ responses provided by self-report and informant-report are positive and substantial (heteromethod), and when CVQ scores correlate with responses on other measures of calling within self- and informant-reports (monomethod). Self-reports and informant-reports for CVQ-Presence scores correlated <italic>r</italic> = .51, providing evidence of convergent validity (heteromethod). The Self/Informant correlation for BCS-Presence was weaker but significant (<italic>r</italic> = .27), and the corresponding correlation for the calling paragraph was nonsignificant (<italic>r</italic> = .15). Similarly, CVQ-Presence and BCS-Presence scores correlated positively and significantly within self-reports and informant-reports (monomethod; <italic>r</italic> = .69 for self-report, <italic>r</italic> = .42 for informant-report). This same pattern was observed for correlations between the CVQ-Presence and the BCS-Presence using the heteromethod approach (<italic>r’</italic>s of .46 and .32). Correlations between CVQ-Presence scores and the single-item calling paragraph scores were weaker; the four pairings of these variables ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .11 to <italic>r</italic> = .38, and two were nonsignificant. Correlations between BCS-Presence and the calling paragraph were similar (<italic>r’</italic>s from .04 to .38), suggesting that the calling paragraph assessed a different construct than did CVQ-Presence and BCS-Presence scales.</p>

<title>Discriminant correlations</title>
<p>Discriminant validity is indicated when the correlations identified above exceed those observed between the CVQ and other constructs (heterotrait).</p>
<p>Evidence for discriminant validity was supported in that the magnitudes of correlations between CVQ-Presence and BCS-Presence scores (i.e., convergent correlations) generally were higher than correlations found between scores on either scale with scores on work hope, prosocial work motivation, meaning in life, and life satisfaction (i.e., discriminant correlations). Specifically, the monomethod convergent correlation among self-report scores on the CVQ-Presence with BCS-Presence of .69 exceeded all monomethod correlations of scores from these two calling measures with scores from other heterotrait measures (<italic>r’</italic>s of .01 to .60).</p>
<p>The heteromethod convergent correlation between self- and informant-report scores on the CVQ Presence scale was .51. This exceeded all heteromethod discriminant correlations (<italic>r’</italic>s of −.04 to .31). The heteromethod convergent correlation between self- and informant-report scores on the BCS Presence was .27. This exceeded some heteromethod discriminant correlations but was lower than correlations of self-report BCS-Presence scores with informant-report scores on the calling paragraph (<italic>r</italic> = .28), work hope scale (<italic>r</italic> = .28), and prosocial work attitudes scale (<italic>r =</italic> .30). The monomethod convergent correlation between informant-report BCS and CVQ scores was .42, which exceeded all discriminant correlations except the correlations of informant-report scores on the CVQ-Presence with prosocial work motivation (<italic>r</italic> = .62) and CVQ-Search (<italic>r</italic> = .58).</p>
<p>Convergent correlations for the calling paragraph with CVQ-Presence and BCS-Presence computed using monomethod (i.e., both self-report or both informant-report) scores were larger than all discriminant correlations except for its correlation with work hope (<italic>r</italic> = .29) for self-report scores. However, because three of the four heteromethod convergent correlations with the calling paragraph were small and nonsignificant, ranging from <italic>r’</italic>s of .04 to .18, discriminant validity was not supported for these scores.</p>

<title>Summary and Discussion</title>
<p>Results from the multitrait, multimethod analysis generally supported convergent and discriminant validity for CVQ and BCS scores representing the presence of, and search for, a calling. For both instruments, convergent validity evidence was somewhat stronger for Presence scores compared to Search scores. Discriminant validity evidence was supported by the predicted patterns of relationships, with a few departures. The weight of this evidence, paired with the strong evidence of internal consistency reliability, supports the practice of summing the three presence subscales and three search subscales to form total scores for CVQ-Presence and CVQ-search, respectively. The strong relationships found between CVQ scores with prosocial motivation scores under some conditions are not surprising, given the conceptual similarity of the third dimension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition of calling with prosocial work motivation. The high correlations between presence and search dimensions for the CVQ, which were notably higher than those between the presence and search dimensions for the BCS, suggest that although participants may differentiate between seeking and experiencing when thinking about calling, generally they appear less likely to do so when evaluating the three dimensions of calling in a more specific and multidimensional manner. This supports the interpretation that calling is a process in which people experience, maintain, and seek their callings on a continuous and ongoing basis; that is, part of having a calling may mean continually seeking ways to maintain, enhance, or expand that calling. Finally, results suggested that BCS scores were supported at a level comparable to that associated with total scores on the CVQ, but that calling paragraph scores were not well-supported by validity evidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section43-1069072711434410">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The primary purpose of the current research was to address a gap in the literature by developing and establishing psychometric support for a multidimensional measure of calling rooted in a clear definition of the construct. The resulting CVQ yields scores for both the presence of, and search for, a sense of calling, as well as three subscale scores for the presence dimension and three for the search dimension. Evidence from Study 1 supported the measurement model and revealed strong evidence for internal consistency reliability, while demonstrating a moderate level of stability from 1-month test–retest reliability coefficients for both subscale and total scores. Furthermore, the study provided initial evidence supporting criterion-related and construct validity of CVQ-Presence and CVQ-Search scores. Study 2 provided a more comprehensive and sophisticated means of evaluating construct validity for CVQ total scores; it did so for BCS scores as well, thus satisfying a secondary purpose of the current research. Strong evidence of internal consistency reliability was found for both instruments' scores, and results supported the construct validity of both CVQ and BCS scores, which performed comparably to each other and favorably to scores obtained using the single-item calling paragraph. To summarize, although additional research is needed, these studies establish the CVQ and affirm the BCS as psychometrically supported means of assessing calling within one’s work or career.</p>
<p>Both the BCS and CVQ offer improvements over existing measures of calling. The BCS assesses presence and search dimensions with just 4 items, an important advantage for researchers interested in measuring these general dimensions of calling with maximum efficiency. The CVQ is less efficient in terms of number of items, but is the first instrument of which we are aware that provides a multidimensional approach to assessing calling in a manner tied to a clearly articulated definition of the construct. The CVQ also provides users with the flexibility to examine calling at the level of total scores for presence and search, as well as at the more specific subscale level. For example, users also could explore differences between individuals who resonate with all three components of a calling with those who find a transcendent summons irrelevant, but are nevertheless well-described with the second and third dimensions of the term. To use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> terminology, such a study would compare those with a calling to those with vocations, but not callings. The CVQ also can be used, potentially, across a wide range of populations. For example, because it refers to one’s work or career generally, it can be used with participants representing different career paths, and because it refers to a transcendent summons but leaves open the source of the summons, it can be used with participants representing a range of religious, spiritual, and cultural worldview beliefs.</p>
<p>Although presence and search subscale scores across the CVQ and BCS were highly correlated, the fact that CVQ presence and search scores were strongly positively correlated, while BCS presence and search scores were weakly correlated, suggests that different processes may be at work in how participants evaluate calling items that require general appraisals compared to those that assess more specific facets of calling. Similar to speculation for why facet measures of job satisfaction often do not equal ratings of overall job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069072711434410">Fritzsche &amp; Parrish, 2005</xref>), it may be that different people who identify with the concept of calling may emphasize different dimensions of the domain. As noted earlier, the correlation of CVQ Presence and Search scores may suggest that calling is an ongoing process rather than a one-time event. For example, instead of someone seeking a calling but not yet experiencing one, then ceasing the search upon discovering her or his calling, perhaps people oriented to the concept of calling are continually and dynamically trying to evaluate their careers and approach their work in a way that maintains or increases the experiential properties that reflect a calling. Such possibilities have not yet been addressed in research on calling, and are fruitful areas to explore.</p>
<p>Future research also could also investigate the six subscales of the CVQ. Although the cross-validated measurement model in Study 1 supported the presence of six factors, space constraints precluded a more thorough evaluation of the subscales in this article. Relevant questions that can be explored include: To what extent does each subscale add incremental validity when assessing overall presence of, or search for, a calling? To what extent does the transcendent summons dimension behave differently for those with sacred versus secular conceptualizations of calling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711434410">Steger et al., 2010</xref>)? Are purposeful work and prosocial orientations differentially active for individuals within individualist versus collectivist cultures? Such questions could not be readily addressed prior to the development of the CVQ.</p>
<p>The transcendent summons, purposeful work, and prosocial orientation domains of calling have served as a means of organizing recommendations for career counseling practice designed to address and integrate clients' perceptions of calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik et al., 2009</xref>). Although counselors can use informal and qualitative means of assessing these calling components, the CVQ can corroborate these efforts, and identify the relative salience of particular dimensions of calling to be addressed in counseling. The CVQ or BCS may also serve as an entry point for discussing calling with clients, or as a screening tool to identify the relevance of calling among clients at the outset of counseling. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711434410">Dik, Duffy, and Eldridge (2009)</xref> for a more thorough discussion of practice recommendations relevant to the three calling domains. Although organizational applications need to be further developed, managers and human resource professionals may also find the CVQ helpful as a screening tool or as part of a battery of assessments to measure the psychological climate within a work unit or organization.</p>

<sec id="section44-1069072711434410">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Other directions for future research stem from several limitations of the current research, which should be weighed when using the CVQ or BCS. First, the samples in the current research were disproportionately White and female. Although a recent study found no differences in the CVQ measurement model across gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069072711434410">Eldridge, 2010</xref>), further research is needed that examines the generalizability of the instrument across different groups. Second, the sample with whom the CVQ item pool was refined and tested consisted of college students. Although calling is highly developmentally relevant for college students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1069072711434410">Hunter et al., 2010</xref>), it cannot be assumed that nonstudent adults approach the construct in the same way; this is a matter for future research to address. Third, participants in the sample were drawn from two regions in the United States. Future research should explore possible regional, national, and cultural differences that exist in how calling is conceptualized and in the degree to which it is considered a relevant construct for participants. Fourth, although CVQ and BCS scores were found related to a wide array of criterion variables in the current research, the variables and scales included were by no means exhaustive. Future research should compare the CVQ and BCS to additional measures of calling, and more comprehensively investigate the nomological net of calling. Finally, it bears reminding that causal inferences cannot be made from correlational data, such as that presented in the current research. Research is needed that examines how a sense of calling may develop over time, and that investigates the nature and extent of causal influences that calling may have on work-related and well-being outcomes.</p>

<title>Appendix B Brief Calling Scale (BCS)</title>
<p>Broadly speaking, a “calling” refers to a person’s belief that she or he is called upon (by the needs of society, by a person’s own inner potential, by God, by a Higher Power, etc.) to do a particular kind of work. The following questions assess the degree to which you see this concept as relevant to your own life and career. Please respond honestly, not according to what is socially desirable or what you feel you “ought” to think. Please indicate the extent to which each of the following statements <underline>currently</underline> describe you, using the following scale.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text2-1069072711434410" position="float">
<p>1 = Not at all true of me</p>
<p>2 = Mildly true of me</p>
<p>3 = Moderately true of me</p>
<p>4 = Mostly true of me</p>
<p>5 = Totally true of me</p>
