<abstract>
<p>The aim of the study was to find out if there is an optimal mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for renal function in elderly patients during the early postoperative period. We analysed the data of 122 patients &gt;70 years of age with normal preoperative renal function who had been subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures on CPB. Patients were divided into 3 groups, according to MABP during CPB: group MP (n=50) included patients whose MABP was maintained between 60–70 mmHg; group LP (n=36), the MABP was &lt;60 mmHg; and group HP (n=36) where the MABP was &gt;70 mmHg. The patients’ clinical data were evaluated during the first three postoperative days. The rate of renal impairment (urine output &lt;50ml/h) in the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery did not differ among the groups. Oliguria developed in 3 patients (6%) of the MP group, in 2 patients (5.6%) in the LP group and in 6 patients (16.7%) in the HP group (χ<sup>2</sup>=3.6, df=2, p=0.161). Evaluation of MABP on renal excretion showed that there was no difference in urine output among the groups. Serum creatinine levels at the end of the first postoperative day in groups MP, LP and HP were 102.7±20.1, 116.4±58.6 and 113.2±39.8 µmol/L, respectively (F=0.5, df=2, p=0.640). There were no significant differences among the groups at the end of the second and the third day either. Volume balance at the end of surgery and during the early postoperative period was similar in all groups. The need for diuretics did not differ among the groups. The length of postoperative hospital stay was not significantly different among the groups. Our study did not reveal any relationship between a MABP of 48-80 and postoperative renal dysfunction in elderly patients after CABG surgery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute renal injury is a common and serious complication of cardiac surgery. Elderly patients undergoing CABG represent a population of patients that is at additional risk of suffering perioperative kidney function alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112436751">1</xref></sup>. Perioperative mortality in the elderly, therefore, is more frequent than in younger patients. Elderly patients tend to have less physiologic organ reserve; consequently, elderly patients are at an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. This difference is most likely attributable to the frequent incidence of coexisting diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112436751">2</xref></sup>. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and is thought to be related to the systemic inflammatory response and renal hypoperfusion secondary to extracorporeal circulation. As older, sicker patients increasingly constitute the cardiac surgical population, the incidence of postoperative renal injury is likely to increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112436751">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A survey of historical aspects of this problem shows that, as early as 1976, Bhat and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112436751">4</xref></sup> established that prolonged CPB time, hypotension, oliguria, low output syndrome, and hemoglobinemia during open heart surgery correlated with the development of renal failure postoperatively. In 1992, Urzua et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112436751">5</xref></sup> studied if hypotension during CPB impairs intraoperative and postoperative renal function and revealed that there was a significant correlation between creatinine clearance and perfusion pressure intraoperatively, but not postoperatively. Gold and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112436751">6</xref></sup>, in a randomized trial, compared intraoperative high versus low mean arterial pressure and showed that higher mean arterial pressures during CPB effectively improve outcome after CABG. Fischer et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112436751">7</xref></sup> noted that, on average, greater renal injury was associated with longer bypass durations, lower flows and longer periods with a CPB pressure less than 60 mmHg. In contrast, the Abel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112436751">8</xref></sup> retrospective study that accounted for known risk factors in evaluating perfusion management did not link low CPB blood pressure (with maintained flow) with postoperative acute renal injury. Dehne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112436751">9</xref></sup> studied renal effects of CPB in the elderly and examined creatinine clearance and the excretion of sensitive marker proteins in older adult patients undergoing CABG. They noted that, by using modern techniques of bypass, creatinine clearance remained lower in the older patients without significant differences pre- and postoperatively.</p>
<p>There are many studies dealing with different factors associated with CPB and contributing to impairment of renal function during heart surgery. A high degree of hemodilution during CPB is a risk factor for postoperative renal dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112436751">10</xref></sup>; its detrimental effects may be reduced by increasing the oxygen delivery with an adequately increased pump flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112436751">11</xref></sup>. Hemoglobin-induced renal injury may be a major contributor to CPB-associated acute renal failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112436751">12</xref></sup>. Pulsatile flow during CPB has favorable influence on creatinine clearance and urine output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112436751">13</xref></sup>, but the extent of haemolysis and capillary leak is higher when compared to non-pulsatile flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112436751">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Studies on the influence of mean arterial blood pressure during CPB on renal function in the elderly are not abundant. In our recent study, we found that CBP perfusion pressure in the range of 50–86 mmHg did not cause postoperative renal failure in cardiac surgical patients. The age of the patient, valve surgery procedures, duration of CPB and duration of aortic cross-clamp are potential causative factors for acute renal failure after cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436751">15</xref></sup>. Considering CPB perfusion pressure, controversy continues as to whether hypotension during CPB impairs intraoperative and postoperative renal function. The aim of our study was to find the optimal MABP during CPB for renal function in elderly patients during the early postoperative period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659112436751" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>The study population consisted of 122 randomly selected elderly patients (70 years or older) with normal preoperative renal function who were scheduled for first-time elective CABG surgery on CPB. The sample size reflects the population size at an error of 0.05. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee and all patients provided their informed consent before inclusion in the study. Patients with diabetes mellitus were not included in this study.</p>
<p>During preoperative assessment, patients were blindly (envelope method) randomized into three groups with different mean MABPs during CPB: group MP (50 patients) 60–69.9 mmHg (median pressure); group LP (36 patients) 45–59.9 mmHg (low pressure) and group HP (36 patients) 70–95 mmHg (high pressure). The size of the groups was homogenous (χ<sup>2</sup>= 3.2, df=2, p=0.2).</p>
<p>Acute renal failure (ARF) in the postoperative period was defined according to The Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group with reference to RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage kidney disease) criteria: serum creatinine concentration is doubled compared with preoperative serum creatinine concentration (baseline) and/or urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112436751">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112436751">17</xref></sup>. Renal function was evaluated on the first three postoperative days.</p>
<p>Standard anesthesia techniques were applied for all patients: they were premedicated one hour before the operation with morphine 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly and midazolam 7.5 mg orally. Anesthesia induction consisted of the administration of midazolam 0.05mg/kg, fentanyl 1–2 μg/kg, thiopental sodium 1–3 mg/kg and 0.08–0.1 mg/kg of pipecuronium. Sevoflurane (0.6% – 0.7%) or izoflurane (0.4% – 1.6%), 3 µg/kg/hour of fentanyl, and 1–4 mg/hour of midazolam were used for the maintenance of anesthesia.</p>
<p>Standardized CPB was established using a roller pump, a hollow-fiber membranous oxygenator (Compactflo D703, Dideco, Mirandola, Italy) and an open, hard-shell, venous reservoir. The CPB circuit was primed with 1500 mL of Ringer’s acetate crystalloid solution with the addition of heparin (300 U/kg) to achieve an activated clotting time greater than 450 seconds. Cardiac arrest was achieved with cold crystalloid cardioplegia, using an infusion of one dose of 1000 mL, then consecutive doses of 500 mL of cold (approx. +4°C) crystalloid solution (1000 mL Ringer’s solution, 24 mEq KCl, 9.5 mEq NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.8mEq CaCl<sub>2</sub>) into the aortic root. An additional 500 mL of solution with 18 mEq KCl was administered every 30 minutes or whenever necessary (e.g. at resumption of electrical activity of the heart). Body temperature was allowed to drift to a minimal temperature of 34°C.</p>
<p>Volemia was routinely corrected using 500–1000 mL colloid solution (Voluven, 6% HES). Low hemoglobin concentration (less than 80 g/L) was corrected using infusions of leukocyte-reduced red blood cell concentrates. Plasma and crystalloids were not routinely used in this study during CPB. The pump flow was maintained at 2.4 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> to achieve a target venous blood saturation of 78%. Maximal blood flow was 3 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>. There were no differences in pump flow among the groups. MABP was controlled using catecholamines (norepinephrine) or nitrates. Vasoactive drugs were used on demand, taking into consideration the appropriate group protocol. Doses were adjusted to each patient individually to control arterial pressure. Doses of vasopressors were minimal (up to 0.05 µg/kg/min) or moderate (0.06 – 0.1 µg/kg/min), according to the clinical situation. MABP was registered every 5 minutes during CPB.</p>
<p>The following postoperative clinical variables were daily recorded and analysed: serum creatinine, serum creatinine clearance, the requirement of vasoconstrictors or inotropic drugs, diuretic therapy (furosemide dosage was adjusted according to the target urine output at 0.8-1.5 mL/kg/h), central venous pressure, urine output, fluid balance, acidosis, potassium level in blood serum, the need for hemotransfusions and blood products, nephrological, cardiovascular and respiratory complications, duration of mechanical lung ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, the length of hospitalization and mortality during the study period.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Standard descriptive methods were used to calculate mean values and standard deviations (SD) of variables. Categorical data are presented as counts and percentages in brackets. One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for determination of quantitative data distribution. Normally, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z is computed from the largest difference (in absolute value) between the observed and theoretical cumulative distribution functions. This test tests whether the observations could reasonably have come from the specified distribution. Continuous scale data were compared using parametric ANOVA and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. Post hoc comparisons were performed using the two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Pearson’s Chi-Square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test or Fisher’s exact test were used for comparison of discrete variables. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been shown in the literature that patient age is an independent risk factor of ARF following cardiac surgery. This is possibly associated with loss in renal functional reserve by the progressive decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, making these patients more susceptible to severe renal lesions due to renal hypoperfusion. Renal blood flow during CPB is not autoregulated and varies with pump flow rates and blood pressure. However, CPB hypotension is not equivalent to hypotension with hemorrhagic shock or low cardiac output states, because low pressure during CPB is not necessarily associated with low flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112436751">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We did not find any significant influence of MABP during CPB on renal function and other clinical variables potentially associated with renal impairment during the early postoperative period after CABG surgery. Our data showed that relatively low MABP during CPB (48–59 mmHg), as well as duration of low arterial pressure, did not evoke renal hypoperfusion. On the contrary, MABP during CPB as high as 70–94 mmHg did not show any advantages over low or median 60–69 mmHg arterial pressure applied during CABG surgery. Urine output was slightly lower in the LP group only at the end of surgery, but there were no differences (p&gt;0.05) during the overall postoperative period. We did not find any differences in fluid balance during the early postoperative period among the study groups. Concerning fluid balance, our results coincide with Haugen’s findings that intraoperatve fluid balance was similar in animals with elevated and with lowered mean arterial pressure during CPB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112436751">19</xref></sup>. Renal function cannot be related solely to volume diuresis decreases as diuretics are given more. In our study, the rate of urine excretion and requirement for diuretics did not differ among the groups during the early postoperative period. Creatinine concentration in blood serum was similar in all groups. Serum potassium level and serum creatinine clearance did not differ among the groups intraoperatively or during the early postoperative period. We found no differences in the requirement for vasoconstrictors or inotropic drugs. The incidence of renal failure in the early postoperative period did not differ among groups. The number of patients with oliguria was 3 patients (6%) in group MP, 2 patients (5.6%) in group LP and 6 patients (16.7%) in group HP (p&gt;0.05). None of these patients developed anuria or a need for hemodialysis. These findings are consistent with our previous study concerning the influence of CPB perfusion pressure on renal function following cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112436751">17</xref></sup> and with data of other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112436751">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112436751">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112436751">9</xref></sup>. The length of stay in ICU and the length of postoperative hospital stay were not significantly different among the groups.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study did not reveal any relationship between a MABP of 48-80 and postoperative renal dysfunction in elderly patients after CABG surgery. Furthermore, our results suggest that MABP during CPB, possibly, is not so important when sufficient perfusion rates ensure adequate kidney perfusion. Further prospective studies on large numbers of patients are necessary to study renal function in this high-risk group of patients to optimize CPB management. We agree with other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112436751">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112436751">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112436751">21</xref></sup> that the general principles to avoid renal impairment after CABG include treatment of life-threatening features such as shock, respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis and sepsis, stopping and avoiding low perioperative hematocrits, administration of nephrotoxins, optimization of hemodynamic and fluid status, and adjustment of drug dosage appropriate to glomerular filtration rate and early diagnosis of threatening renal failure.</p>
