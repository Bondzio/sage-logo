            <p>Malaria is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical countries. The availability, appropriate management, and rational use of medicines are critical to the successful implementation of the malaria control programs. The aim was to assess the availability, use, and utilization of medicines used for preventing and treating malaria in public health facilities in Jimma zone in Southwest Ethiopia. An indicator-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from March 25 to April 30, 2011 at selected public health facilities, providing antimalaria drugs to treat and prevent malaria in Jimma zone. Three data collection techniques were used: document reviews, structured interviews, and physical inventory checks using the World Health Organization Checklist. All data collected were then analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 16.0 software. On average, 88% of the core medicines monitored was available in the public health facilities and 90% of the medicines prescribed by the prescriber were dispensed to the patients. On average, stock out period was 38%. The highest and lowest prescribed antimalaria drugs observed are Artemether/lumefantrine 120 mg/20 mg tablet and chloroquine syrup, which were 45% and 5.5%, respectively. The adherence to Standard Treatment Guidelines of Ethiopia (STG) was 85%. There was poor inventory control system and long stock out period, and the majority of prescribers are adhering to national STGs. Implementing good inventory control system, training on drug supply management, and continuous supervision of the public health facilities by zonal health bureau is recommended.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Malaria is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical countries. Malaria remains a major public health challenge worldwide, with most malaria illnesses and deaths caused by the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>parasite.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452122">1</xref>
            </sup> Malaria has been estimated to account for 515 (range, 300-660) million clinical attacks, with about 2.2 billion people exposed to the threat of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>malaria.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512452122">2</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512452122"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452122">4</xref>
            </sup> Recent estimates using spatial analysis of populations at risk indicate similar estimates with 2.37 billion people being at risk of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>in 2007. Of these, 26% live in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region and 62% in the combined South East Asia region and Western Pacific region.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512452122">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512452122">6</xref>
            </sup> The burden of malaria is greatest among children under 5 and pregnant women. For example, in 2000, there were about 116 million malaria episodes in children under 6 years of age, with 545,000 children being admitted with severe malaria and 3.6 per 1000 per annum episodes of severe malarial anemia.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512452122">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512452122">7</xref>
            </sup> Studies in some health care institutions in Africa showed that malaria constitutes 20% to 60% of all outpatients’ consultations and 10% of hospital admissions.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512452122">8</xref>
            </sup> In addition, out of 96% of caregivers who treat malaria promptly within 24 hours, only 14.3% treat correctly.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512452122">9</xref>
            </sup> In terms of socioeconomic impact, it is the most important of the transmissible parasitic diseases.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512452122">9</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The availability, appropriate management, and rational use of medicines are critical to the successful implementation of the malaria control programs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512452122">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512452122">11</xref>
            </sup> Further, malaria programs recognize that mortality is reduced when patients are identified and treated early and appropriately in the community; in this context, the community includes households as well as providers of medicines. As most patients are not treated in health facilities, efforts to improve pharmaceutical management must focus on ensuring availability of appropriate treatment near their home and that families seek, obtain, and correctly use essential medicines at public or private sources.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512452122">11</xref>
            </sup> Rational drug use is using the right drug in the right patient, for the right indication, in the right dose and dosage form, for the right duration of time. Ineffective treatment can lead to recrudescent infections, thus requiring additional treatment, which can lead to increased cost and loss of productivity, complications or death, and the development of resistance to antimalaria medicines. In addition, lack of careful selection, incorrect quantification, high prices, poor quality, theft, improper storage, expiration of medicines, irrational prescribing, and incorrect use of medicines by patients can result in losses totaling more than 70% of initial acquisition costs of medicines in general.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512452122">12</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>In Ethiopia, one barrier to effective case management of malaria in the health system is that the medicines needed are often not available. There is a poor pharmaceutical logistic system, resulting in shortages and stock out of drugs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512452122">13</xref>
            </sup> Furthermore, access to reliable and consistent information about malaria prevention and treatment is poor. To reduce these problems, proper monitoring and evaluation of drug use practice is very essential. The assessment of drug utilization is important for clinical, educational, and pharmacoeconomic purpose. Thus, this study aimed to undertake an indicator-based assessment on evaluation of antimalarial drug availability and utilization among selected public health facilities in southwest Ethiopia.</p>

            <p>The study was conducted in selected public health facilities in Jimma zone in southwest Ethiopia from March 5 to April 30, 2011. An indicator-based cross-sectional study was conducted on selected public health facilities using tools developed by the Management Science for Health, Rational Pharmaceutical Management (RPM) project.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512452122">14</xref>
               </sup> The manual was adapted to the local situation prior to the assessment. Public health facilities where more than 5 cases of malaria expected per day and those with antimalarial treatment records were included in the study. On the other hand, public health facilities with no history of malaria prevalence in the area and new health facilities that started service for fewer than 6 months were excluded from the study.</p>
            <p>There are about 48 public health facilities in Jimma zone; from these, 30 fulfill the inclusion criteria. The geographic location was designed to the north, south, east, and west of Jimma town municipality, considered to develop a sample that is representative of the zone. All 30 health facilities were grouped in to four categories. In sampling the health facilities within each geographic location, proportionate to their size, 5 health facilities were randomly selected by lottery method. Accordingly, Bolawajo Health Center, Mandara Health Center, Jimma Health Center, Toba Health Center, and Seka Health Center were selected randomly. The rationale for selecting a sample size of 5 health facilities is based on previous studies and methodologies extrapolated from WHO Expanded Program on Immunization and International Network for Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) studies.</p>

The three data collection techniques used for the DAS were document reviews, structured interviews, and physical inventory checks. To assess DUS, retrospective and prospective methods were utilized. The retrospective medical records review covered from August 2010 to January 2011, and then prospectively direct observation and exit poll interview took place in selected public health facilities.</p>
            <p>Data were collected by trained final-year pharmacy degree students from Jimma University. The data collection was supervised and coordinated by supervisors, who were university staff at Jimma University. The questionnaires were checked by supervisors at the end of each day during the survey for omission of incomplete answers and for coding the responses.</p>

            <p>To assess the prescribing and dispensing practices for managing malaria cases, a total of 65 malaria-specific prescription papers and patient registration books were reviewed. The average percentage of encounters with patients diagnosed with malaria that were prescribed antimalaria drugs consistent with treatment guidelines was 85%. The most commonly prescribed medication was Arthemeter/lumefantrine combination tablet (45%), followed by chloroquine 150 mg tablet (23.5%), quinine 300 mg tablet (14.5%), chloroquine syrup (11.5%), and quinine injections (5.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512452122">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This study showed that there was acceptable availability of core antimalaria drugs (88%) in public health facilities of Jimma zone but it is still below the estimated target, which was set at national level.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512452122">16</xref>
            </sup> As a plan to increase availability of essential drugs from 65% to 100% in all public health facilities (and all the assessed antimalaria drugs were included as essential drugs in the Ethiopian national essential drug list), the government of Ethiopia has been supported by a number of nongovernmental international aid organizations to improve the health care delivery system of the country. The federal ministry of health has received donations from Global Fund and the Roll Back African project to increase the availability of Artemether/lumefantrine combination drugs free of charge in government-owned health facilities and to implement the new approaches to the eradication of malaria.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512452122">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861512452122">17</xref>
            </sup> The low level of target achievement of Jimma zone was probably due to low logistics management information system reporting rate of health facilities to Ministry of Health (MOH) and Zonal Health Bureaus (ZHBs). The delay in release of allocated budget to the fiscal year can also contribute to the delay of procurement of pharmaceuticals, which can ultimately affect the availability of drugs. A research done in the republic of Iran to evaluate availability of drugs in 100 primary health care centers showed that on average, 92% of the 12 essential drugs monitored were available in the health center pharmacies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512452122">18</xref>
            </sup> A similar study done in Sudan to evaluate availability of essential drugs in 36 public health facilities found that on average, 82% of the core medicines monitored were available in the centers.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512452122">19</xref>
            </sup> The difference in the availability of the two studies is probably due to small study size of this study and relatively low health care cost expenditure of Ethiopia compared to others.</p>
         <p>The finding showed that there is a long stock out period of antimalaria drugs (38%); the zonal average stock out duration in public health facilities s was 68 days. This figure is greater than ideal value and the expected national target to be achieved at the end of year 2015 (35% to 0%),<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512452122">16</xref>
            </sup> and also to that of a research done in Iran,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512452122">18</xref>
            </sup> with the stock out duration of less than 1 month on average. This might be due to poor pharmaceutical logistics system, which was proved by the presence of many expired drugs and poor inventory control system in the public health facilities.</p>
         <p>Based on this finding alone, one can conclude that the zonal pharmaceutical and supply service department either is not doing inspection or monitoring and evaluation activities or not functioning very well. Zonal Health Bureau designed strategies and set key activities to achieve the target. Putting in place an efficient and effective drug and medical equipment management system at all levels of the health system, systematizing and modernizing of drug supply and management system through use of appropriate software, and providing necessary instruments and tools to ensure proper management and use of drugs at health facilities were designed as a strategy, but it seems none were implemented, probably due to high professional turnover and inadequate budget allocation for transportation, conduct supervision, training, and so on. It is obvious that all the aforementioned deviations from the standard norms have a negative impact on availability, access, and rational use to essential drugs.</p>
         <p>The present study revealed that the average percentage of prescribers’ adherence to national treatment guideline for this study was 85% of patients. This is higher than other studies done in Sudan,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512452122">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512452122">20</xref>
            </sup> which reported adherence to national treatment guidelines ranging from 38.6% to 64%. The relatively high level of adherence to STGs of this study compared to the Sudan study is probably due to small sample size of this study and poor implementation of national drug policy in Sudan.</p>
         <p>In this study, the average percentage of drugs encounter with antimalaria that was prescribed sufficient quantities to complete a full courses treatment was 90%. This indicator measures the extent to which malaria patients/caregivers are prescribed sufficient medicines by the public health facility to complete a full course of treatment. A full course of treatment is based on the description given on standard treatment guidelines for Ethiopia. For instance, for Artemether/lumefantrine combination tablets, a full course for an adult would normally be 4 tablets 2 times a day for 3 days. The total number of tablets required for the course of treatment is 24 Artemether/lumefantrine combination tablets of 120 mg/20 mg each.</p>
         <p>Regarding the availability of STGs, ideally all health facilities should have a copy of STGs but in the present study only about 80% of visited health facilities had a copy of STGs. The ministry of health had prepared and distributed a number of standard treatment guidelines for various disease conditions. The Ethiopian Food, Medicine, and Health Care Administration Control Authority (FMHACA) has also prepared standard treatment guidelines for different levels of health facilities in 2004 (revised in 2010) and distributed to every regional health bureaus.</p>
         <p>In the current study, 90% of prescribed antimalaria drugs were dispensed by public health facilities. This indicator is based only on the prescriptions for antimalaria drugs presented for dispensing at public health facilities. Other studies reported the finding in the range of 85% to 95%.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512452122">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512452122">19</xref>
            </sup> Three-fourths of patients/caregivers correctly describe how to take/give the prescribed antimalaria medicines. This indicator measures if patients have adequate knowledge on how to take the drugs dispensed to them. Knowledge about the drug constitutes ability to tell dose, frequency of administration, and length of therapy fully. This figure is in line with national target (68%-100%).<sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Overall availability of antimalarial drugs in the zone was acceptable though there were poor inventory control systems and a long stock out period of antimalaria drugs in public health facilities of the zone. There was a practice of good dispensing. The knowledge of the majority of patients or caregivers about dispensed drugs was also good. The majority of prescribers adhere to STGs of country when prescribing antimalaria drugs. Implementing a good inventory control system, training on drug supply management, and continuous supervision of the public health facilities by the zonal health bureau is recommended.</p>
