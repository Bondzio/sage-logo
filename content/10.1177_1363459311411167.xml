<abstract>
<p>Organ donation and transplantation has been extensively addressed in the biomedical and bioethics literature in relation to debates around organ allocation and procurement strategies, and concerns about consent, coercion and commodification. This article addresses the topic sociologically, drawing on data from face-to-face in-depth interviews undertaken between 2008 and 2010 with organ and tissue recipients, anonymous altruistic donors and donor family members to discuss questions of reciprocity and intercorporeality that arise in the course of tissue exchange. In particular, the article examines the place of anonymity protocol for organ donors and transplantation recipients in New Zealand and their responses to conventions and scripts surrounding this rule. The article concludes by calling for discussion to re-examine anonymity protocol and rituals around organ donation and transplantation, citing lessons from gamete donation policies and recent law in New Zealand as productive for thinking through matters of personhood and identity relating to organ transfer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social scientists have long argued that reciprocity is a basic principle of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311411167">Berking, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311411167">Gouldner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311411167">Sahlins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311411167">Simmel, 1996</xref>). In lay terms, reciprocity is often construed as a two-way process of giving and receiving, realized in quotidian conduct as a golden rule admonishing people to ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. Reciprocity has many forms however, and not all of these are equivalent or tit-for-tat, as the authors cited above diligently note. Broadly speaking, reciprocity refers to situations of mutual exchange between persons or groups of persons where an item or service is returned or where there is an obligation to return an item or service. In this sense, reciprocity relations both unite and differentiate persons or social groups ‘as separate members in the exchange relationship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311411167">McLeish, 1993</xref>: 622). Although a social norm of gift-giving, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311411167">Komter (2005</xref>: 36) suggests that the reciprocity rule does not directly apply to bodily gifts, such as blood or organ donation. In the 21st century, this is not only due to the treatment of blood and organs as part of a global economy of tissue exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311411167">Waldby and Mitchell, 2006</xref>), but because the donation of bodily gifts is assumed to be altruistic – voluntary, one-way and disinterested.</p>
<p>Komter’s sociological observation does not simply describe current institutional and organizational arrangements, it is also a bioethical imperative promulgated by professional groups and policy makers. That is, the prevailing ideology governing tissue exchange in jurisdictions where commercialization of body parts is illegal is largely shaped by debates around informed consent, altruism and the gift (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311411167">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). In keeping with this ideology, the metaphor of the ‘gift of life’ is used to promote organ donation as a supererogatory altruistic act. Yet, as a number of researchers on this topic have noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311411167">Fox and Swazey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311411167">Sharp, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311411167">Siminoff and Chillag, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311411167">Tutton, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311411167">2004</xref>), the gift trope is often misleadingly couched in the terminology of the gift <italic>relationship</italic>, which is not synonymous with the notion of the gift as free and unconditional. Rather, gift relationships as defined by anthropological discourse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311411167">Mauss, 1990</xref>) refer to exchange practices as part of a chain of giving-receiving-and-reciprocating. In such economies gifts establish on-going reciprocity relations between donors and recipients. Failure to return a gift, or to say thank you for that matter, symbolizes a refusal to cement the social and moral bond.</p>
<p>Empirical research undertaken by the author with donors and recipients of reproductive body matter and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311411167">Shaw, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311411167">2008</xref>), and with health professionals working in the domain of organ donation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311411167">Shaw, 2010</xref>) demonstrates that ‘gift of life’ terminology, which is used to promote tissue donation as unidirectional, frequently fails to account for the complex entanglement of psycho-social and intercorporeal processes occurring between participants involved in these procedures. In this article, I examine the prevailing view in New Zealand of the gift as ideally one-way and the impact of this non-reciprocity rule as it relates to anonymity protocol between organ donors, donor families and transplant recipients. I suggest the anonymity rule takes a toll on the emotional and moral experience of some organ transfer participants, and that taking different views about embodiment, bodily integrity and identity into account may help improve the outcomes for those affected, especially psycho-socially, and may even impact positively on donation rates.</p>

<title>Background to the study and methods</title>
<p>This article draws on face-to-face in-depth interviews from a qualitative research project investigating perceptions of organ donation and transplantation processes in New Zealand. The interviews were undertaken between October 2008 and April 2010 and involved talking with 24 organ and tissue recipients, 13 living organ donors, and nine donor family members who identified as New Zealand European/Pākehā. Two separate studies with health professionals and members of stakeholder groups were undertaken (27 participants in total) as part of the larger study, as well as interviews with 15 donors and recipients in an adjunct study with Māori and whānau (family) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311411167">Webb and Shaw, 2011</xref>). The overall study was designed to determine how the respective roles, beliefs and understandings of different groups of interviewees towards human embodiment and identity shape and frame their attitudes and moral experience of organ donation and transplantation. The study was funded by a Royal Society (NZ) Marsden grant (07-VUW-028 SOC), and ethics approval for the study was granted in stages, corresponding to different phases of the project (MEC/08/03/027; AUTEC 08/179_19/08/08; and VUW HEC 16628/4/06/09).</p>
<p>Living organ donors, donor family members and transplant recipients who participated in this study were self-selected adults from all over New Zealand, independently recruited through advertisements in national newspapers, magazines, and websites associated with organ donation and transplantation. Calls for study participants were made several times throughout 2008 and 2009. The advertisement wording was neutral, calling for people who had been involved in making decisions about organ and tissue donation and those who had experienced organ transplantation. The aim was to obtain an information-rich sample that described the phenomenon of organ transfer in-depth. Prospective interviewees were sent a participant information sheet explaining the nature and aims of the study and the purpose of the interviews. All but two prospective respondents agreed to participate in the study. Interviews were undertaken in people’s homes or in a location convenient to the interviewee. The interview process was time-consuming for the researcher as it meant travelling to different locations all over New Zealand. All interviewees participated enthusiastically and without persuasion, with interviews typically between one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half hours.</p>
<p>The participant interviews had several aims. Across the study, participants were interviewed to build a picture of how they made sense of their experience of organ donation and transplantation and to determine the extent to which their understandings were influenced and shaped by discourses available to describe their experiences (principally ‘gift of life’ terminology) and the context in which organ transfer occurred. In addition to taking detailed notes, the interviews were audio-taped with the consent of participants and then transcribed verbatim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459311411167">1</xref></sup> Following conventions of contemporary qualitative research, transcripts were sent to participants for validation and editing and amended accordingly. Many interviewees showed interest in receiving their interview transcript as a document for family members.</p>
<p>The study interviews were narrative in style and began by asking participants to tell their story; ‘starting at the beginning, wherever that is for you’. The natural pattern for organ and tissue recipients was to begin with explanations of illness onset and then discuss physical symptoms, mishaps and problems before broaching explicitly moral questions. Donor family members also began by discussing the onset of illness and death of a family member. Numerous recipients, living donors and donor family members had told their stories before; in medical settings to prospective donors and transplant recipients, to medical students and physicians, in Thanksgiving services or to the media. Most participants explicitly stated the difference between those accounts and the nature of their talk with me, which often included emotional and personal disclosure. Other interviewees had not recounted their stories previously and valued the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>In addition to sending the Participant Information Sheet to prospective study participants, and as a preamble to each interview, the researcher introduced general topics for discussion, including the notion of the gift, altruism and socio-moral connections between donors and recipients. Like studies examining perceptions of the donor in assisted reproduction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311411167">Grace et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311411167">Tober, 2002</xref>), a core aim of the study was to learn how organ recipients viewed the donative act, whether they thought about the donor and if perceptions of the donor affected them in significant ways or not at all. Interviewees were thus well prepared to discuss their perceptions and feelings about organ donation and transplantation as a total experience, rather than compartmentalizing the process into a ‘transplantation, procurement or retrieval, and donation’ event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311411167">Sharp, 2007</xref>: 10). In many of the interviews with transplant recipients, living organ donors who were blood- or emotionally related, and donor family members for this study (as well as some of the interviews with health professionals) there were tears. Although the topic of emotion in the interview process with participants for this study is discussed by the author at length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311411167">Shaw, 2011</xref>), it should be noted that participants described being able to express emotion in their conversations with the interviewer in positive terms. Discussions about the ethics of organ transfer were typically animated, especially in interviews with the health professionals, and many interviewees conveyed relief being able to talk freely about guilt, gratitude and the sacrifice of others in the donation process. For donor family members, and particularly for transplant recipients, being able to express anxiety and ambivalence around shared corporeality, the incorporation of alien organs and integration of those body parts into their own identity was important. Many appreciated doing this in the relative safety of a neutral interview situation with an independent researcher, and said as much. The expression of emotion by interviewees in this project highlights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311411167">Waldby’s (2002</xref>: 240) observation that bodily, psychic and social connection between organ donors and transplant recipients is ‘not impersonal or affectively neutral’. As other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311411167">Shildrick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311411167">Vamos, 2010</xref>) confirm, the presence of emotional distress points to a very real need to make space in the health care environment to discuss all aspects of the organ transfer process honestly, openly and pre-emptively in the interests of improving quality of life and clinical outcomes for those involved.</p>
<p>This article focuses primarily on interview extracts with 16 organ and tissue recipients who received body parts from deceased donors, three altruistic anonymous donors and eight members of donor families who donated the body parts of deceased loved ones, and the private moral work undertaken by these participants in the course of making sense of the relation between donors and recipients in the donation and transplantation experience. As such the article gives an account of one specific aspect of the data corpus from the entire research project, pertaining to the researcher’s theoretical interest in interviewees’ perceptions of the existence, or lack thereof, of ethical, social and metaphysical connection between donors and recipients. All interviewees have been given aliases to protect confidentiality as agreed at the outset of the study.</p>
<p>The research data was processed manually using thematic analysis, a broad method for identifying and categorizing common themes across a range of theoretical perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311411167">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311411167">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). In analysing the data, issues of concern for research participants around the topic of socio-moral ties between donors and recipients were coded by a research assistant with an anthropology background but no prior theoretical knowledge of the subject, in order to cross-check and aid reliability of the data interpretation. The research assistant developed provisional coding themes for the data set, discussing these in conjunction with the author, who then linked the data and themes back to phenomenological theory about embodiment, identity and organ transfer. Data in this article are organized under the general rubric of anonymity and around themes of reciprocity and intercorporeality relating to the question of identity. Reciprocity between tissue recipients and donor family members included feelings of gratitude, writing thank you letters, giving gifts, attending Thanksgiving services, actual donor–recipient contact, speaking publicly about donation and transplantation experiences and participating in support groups. The notion of intercorporeality encompasses ideas and feelings about donor–recipient connection or lack thereof in a bodily, subjective and social sense.</p>
<p>One of the initial aims of the larger study was to investigate the extent to which the corporeal generosity of organ donors and family members of deceased donors approximated paradigmatic cases of gift-giving. The aim was to understand people’s motivations and reasons to engage in altruistic acts. During the course of the research, as expected, other topics emerged. An issue transplant recipients raised time and again was the question of connection with anonymous donors and families of deceased donors, and the impact of anonymity protocol on interpersonal social relations between organ donors and recipients. Unlike pockets of the United States of America where organ donor and transplant recipient relations are permitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311411167">Sharp, 2006</xref>), organ transfer exchanges in New Zealand remain governed by a social-organizational imperative of anonymity. This protocol, mediated by various policies, practices and rituals, both facilitates and constrains the moral work participants in this domain are able to do. Consequently, when research participants in the present study discussed the topic of anonymity it was often voiced emotively. Transplant recipients talked, in particular, about the difficulties they experienced showing gratitude and reciprocity, difficulties that are clearly related to constraints around perceptions of altruism and how to receive what are typically characterized as unconditional gifts.</p>

<title>The impact of anonymity protocol on the moral work of donors and recipients</title>
<p>Despite low numbers of deceased organ donors in New Zealand,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459311411167">2</xref></sup> and observations that ‘gift of life’ rhetoric has increased awareness but not donation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311411167">Siminoff and Chillag, 1999</xref>), organ donation remains unambiguously couched as life-giving. The expression of renewed life and rebirth, in turn, is an important theme in the personal stories of transplant recipients, as are tropes around living one’s life well in light of the donor’s gift. Most of the transplant recipients in the present study, for example, made reference to this in their interviews. Because organ donation is supposed to be a selfless act of giving and generosity that grants new life to the recipient many of its rituals promote and memorialize life-giving aspects. One rebirth ritual often referred to by recipients in the literature is the celebration of a second birthday or re-birthday marking the date of the transplantation operation. Several transplant recipients in this study talked about their ‘second birthdays’. A mother of a transplant recipient, whose husband was also a deceased donor, was explicit about this ritual, stating: ‘In our family we still celebrate [son’s] transplant birthday’ (Helen). The focus here, as Sharp says, is on life not death, and the discourse provided to articulate this for recipients is a very particular script, reliant on its interlocutors to master certain phrases and expressions to describe their experiences. The following statement from the present study is typical: ‘I mean it really is like a rebirth. You just feel a sense of gratitude that you can never possibly feel … I mean um, having a second chance of life is better than winning, being a billionaire.’</p>
<p>This language fits with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311411167">Frank’s (1997</xref>: 131) observation that the experience of serious illness can create ‘a moral imperative for the ill person to “rise to the occasion” and to be “successfully ill”’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311411167">Frank (1997</xref>: 131–132) remarks, in the Parsonian tradition of medical sociology the moral agency of the patient is primarily limited to expectations around ‘compliance’ or ‘adherence’ to health and drug-taking regimens. For those on kidney dialysis waiting for transplantation, and for transplant recipients who are required to take a cocktail of drugs each day at specified intervals this is often a key concern. Related to the question of their own or others’ risky, deviant or resistant behaviours around dialysis, diet and self-care, transplant recipients also spoke about coming up against other interpersonal and organizational impediments to express moral agency. Under New Zealand law and policy, one perceived impediment is that organ and tissue donation is anonymous and confidential, except for blood- and emotionally related donation.</p>
<p>A concern for recipients in their efforts to connect with donors and donor families was related to the ability to convey gratitude and reciprocity. In the present study some transplant recipients experienced so much guilt associated with receiving their magnanimous gift that this produced anxiety around the letter-writing process. Transplant recipients I spoke with were mindful of respecting the privacy of donor families and their rights to confidentiality. They were concerned to minimize harm, distress, embarrassment and suffering to donor families and avoided approaching them (e.g. at public Thanksgiving services) without warrant. Daphne, a kidney recipient who had two failed transplants said she did the right thing by not writing to her donor family, as she did not want them to think their donative act was in vain. For many transplant recipients whose operations were successful the desire to say thank you was nonetheless a paramount concern. For some transplant recipients, making direct contact with non-related donors and donor families was also an expressed desire, although several recipients I spoke to felt overwhelmed by this prospect. One kidney recipient, Eryx, was actively interested in meeting his donor family until he heard the mother of a deceased donor unexpectedly share her grief over her daughter’s death at a Thanksgiving service. The mother’s distress at the distribution and re-location of daughter’s organs and tissues in up to seven strangers’ bodies across Australia and New Zealand (New Zealand has a reciprocal organ sharing arrangement with Australia) was too much for this recipient to bear.</p>
<p>To preserve the privacy of those involved from making direct contact, an anonymity imperative protects donors and recipients in living altruistic donation between strangers and in deceased organ donation, and is carefully managed by those who work in this arena. There are various reasons given for ensuring anonymity between organ donors, donor families and transplant recipients, and their families. The current practice in New Zealand is to withhold information about donors to transplant recipients. Recipients do not know the name of their donor and they are not given contact details about their family. Many recipients know only their donor’s age and occasionally their gender, but in one District Health Board catchment the practice was strictly not to give out this information.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311411167">Sharp (2006</xref>: 106) identifies the rationale health professionals in the United States have used for ensuring the anonymity mandate (which is similar elsewhere): to respect donors and donor families’ privacy, free from intrusion in the grieving process; to prevent recipients ‘identifying psychologically’ with donors; and to protect recipients from overwhelming feelings of guilt because ‘someone had to die so that they could live’. Sharp also pinpoints problems associated with not naming donors to recipients. In her view the practice consigns deceased donors to a nameless and ‘generic category of dead’ people (2007: 35). Moreover, the inability of recipients to name donors obscures the identities of organ donors and not only silences recipients but also donor families. Anonymity protocol therefore denies people ‘the opportunity to tell their stories and speak of personal pain and loss’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311411167">Sharp, 2007</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>Interview data from the present study appear to confirm Sharp’s observation in terms of articulating what she refers to as the silent narrative of pain, loss and guilt, especially in conjunction with attempting to establish moral connection with donors and donor families. I had not expected to hear this narrative expressed quite so evocatively in the interviews for this study when the project first began. Like Sharp I was concerned to ask how donors and recipients give voice to these concerns within the constraints and parameters of public discourse around organ transfer.</p>
<p>The language available to participants to articulate themselves plays a key role in determining what one is able to say. Recipients’ stories told in the public arena in New Zealand, such as Thanksgiving services at national cathedrals designed to thank donors and their families, contain certain taboos in the storytelling. While the language used communicates shared feeling it also delimits what can be said and felt. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311411167">Siminoff and Chillag (1999)</xref>, ‘gift of life’ rhetoric is a key culprit, constantly operating as form of ‘social control’ to remind recipients to comply with care regimens as gratitude for their second lease of life. In addition, the emphasis on life and repeated references to rebirth, renewal and salvation denies painful ‘emotional outbursts, [and] graphic accounts of suffering or death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311411167">Sharp, 2006</xref>: 109–110).</p>
<p>The moral work that people are able to do publicly in terms of talking about their experiences of organ donation and transplantation requires them to manage their emotions and keep them in check by following scripts or adopting a prescribed narrative form. This relates specifically to gift rhetoric, terminology recipients are more inclined to use than donors and members of donor families. Although most people I have interviewed do not interpret the ‘gift of life’ in strictly anthropological terms, transplant recipients nonetheless understand gifts as signifying relationships based on giving, receiving <italic>and</italic> reciprocating. As stated earlier, this kind of gift relationship is cut short when organ transfer policies and practices conceptualize gifts as one-way transactions, promoting generalized but non-specific forms of reciprocity. So, although donor and recipient anonymity works to ensure the unidirectional gift as unconditional and disinterested, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311411167">Fox and Swazey (1992)</xref> observed many transplant recipients never feel free of their moral responsibilities towards donors, donor families and the transplant community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1363459311411167">
<title>Reciprocity: expressing gratitude and saying thank you</title>
<p>Recipients are permitted to write thank you letters to their donors or to donor families, which are then passed through recipient and donor co-ordinators to ensure anonymity and privacy between the two parties. This is welcomed by tissue recipients and by donor family members I have spoken to as an advance on earlier practice. Orion, who had his first corneal transplant in the 1970s, said that as far as he knew letter writing did not exist then (nor was he aware of this option for his last corneal transplant in 2005). This interviewee spoke of waiting for the donor in the bed in the room next to him to die before he could have his operation. He said the doctor of the dying man came to talk to him at one point; as he put it, to check if he was ‘a worthy recipient’. Thirty-five years later it still bothers this man’s moral memory, to borrow Simmel’s phrase, that he has not been able to say thank you to his original donor family.</p>
<p>In the following extracts, transplant recipients comment on the thank you letter. Leda begins by speaking about preparing for her transplantation operation and how thoughts of the donor family are uppermost in her mind as she travels to the hospital transplantation unit. She then goes on to talk about the thank you letter and the difficulties of writing one given the magnitude of the gift she had been given.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Leda:</speaker>
<p>See, I haven’t even been able to write my thank you letter. I’ve done it three or four times. And found, I’ve looked at it and thought how can I send that? I’m just going to rub salt in the wound. Obviously I’m going to do it. This woman that I had affinity with who has also had lungs, she sent a card, a simple card. And I thought don’t try to say too much, don’t try to … just say thank you. Maybe keep it very super simple, just do it, just say thank you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Someone I spoke to once told me of a person who took eight years to write their thank you letter. And most people I’ve spoken to say it’s a really difficult thing to do.</p>

<p>Oh, is that right? Isn’t that strange?</p>

<p>Is it really? I feel so guilty about it, I think, oh my God: everybody says ‘just do it’.</p>
</speech>
<p>Several points need to be made here. First, the thank you letter obviously preyed upon this interviewee’s mind as she offered information about it without any kind of segue in the conversation chain. Second, as this account shows, many of the recipients I spoke to were not aware that others felt similarly, and that they shared anxieties around not having written their thank you letter, not knowing what to write, and subsequently feeling guilty because they had not yet written.</p>
<p>In the following extract Anteia, also a lung recipient expresses similar feelings:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It took me a year to write that letter. I started after about six months to write it and I had it on my PC and I’d start to look at it, and I’d sit there and cry and make a few adjustments to it. And then I’d think no, that’s not right either. What do you say to somebody who saved your life basically? And they are going through their grieving process because their family member died. So it was a really, really hard letter to write. And it must have been over a year before I thought; well I can’t say any more than I did.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other interviewees expressed their anguish over writing to the donor family. While letter writing provides an opportunity for recipients to say thank you, letters do not always ease the burden of guilt for many recipients who are troubled for years after their transplantation operation about how to say thanks. Andreus, a male heart recipient had this to say:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Obviously I’m thankful and I’m glad that that’s what they considered [organ donation]. But I tried to write some letters … We can write letters anonymously, and I just couldn’t, it was just garbage. Emotionally it wasn’t garbage, it was just straight from my heart and you just couldn’t read it. You can’t tell someone something like that after they’d given you; you know given away I guess a part of their self or their family. If you know what I mean, I mean you need to be articulate and considerate and thoughtful, and it’s just, I couldn’t do that. I tried and tried and tried, it’s, and I, and I remember [Transplant co-ordinator] saying, ‘Just write something to the point, you know, just be simple’, but … I think I probably should just do that, but it just doesn’t seem like reciprocity, it doesn’t seem like giving anything significant.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, Elissa, a female heart recipient who has not written to her donor family said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have absolutely no idea of what I would say. I just couldn’t bring myself to. … I tried to write a few things and when my words were entirely, entirely inadequate I gave up. Now I’ve regretted that a few times, because I thought that the donor families probably, I don’t know any donor families so I can’t comment for certain, but I believe that the donor families actually like getting that communication. I think they like that, by and large.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interviews with eight of the donor family members in the present study indicate that this is generally the case. Several appreciated the letters and cards they received and found them ‘inspiring’. All stated they felt good knowing other people benefitted by their decision. One donor family member (Dymas) remarked that he did not know he could receive communication. Castalia, another donor family member stated the letter she received gave her no solace whatsoever – for her the donative act was simply ‘intellectual’ and she felt no connection to the recipient. Contrastingly, extracts from interviewees in the next section foreground the intense identification some recipients feel for their donor and the importance they attach to being able to establish moral ties with donor families.</p>

<title>Intercorporeality: bodies we are and bodies we have</title>
<p>Tissue exchange not only saves and enhances lives, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311411167">Waldby (2002</xref>: 240) says; it is also ‘relational and social’. For some people, the incorporation of body parts is thought to reconstitute embodied identity in moral and spiritual ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311411167">Lock, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311411167">McKenny, 1999</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311411167">Sanner, 2006</xref>). From a phenomenological perspective incorporating the body parts and tissues of others has implications for individual and social identity, culturally and subjectively. Because phenomenology holds that the body is inextricably interwoven with the self, relocating a donated organ into the body of a transplant recipient has the potential to produce anxiety for those who see the procedure as breaching norms about bodily integrity. If the organ is not only thought of as a spare part, but also has magical qualities, then the transplant recipient must integrate the new organ by becoming part of another individual.</p>
<p>As well as producing identifications at the level of recipients’ embodied identity, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311411167">Waldby (2002</xref>) the literal intercorporeality of organ transfer also produces dis-identifications, thus complicating the experience of tissue transfer for donors and recipients who regard body fragments as alienable. Historically, cultures have objectified the body in a variety of ways, but transferring and transplanting body parts depends on changing medical conceptions of what the body is, new criteria for life and death such as brain stem death and the engineering capabilities to make bodies ‘other’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311411167">Hacking (2007</xref>: 78) describes our contemporary relationship to new body technologies as neo-Cartesian; a kind of ‘spare parts’ view of embodiment, marking a ‘return to an increasingly mechanical view of the body’ that may or may not fit ‘existing moral codes’ and frameworks. As recent research shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311411167">Haddow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311411167">Shildrick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311411167">Vamos, 2010</xref>), if donor families and transplant recipients think of the body as something we ‘have’ and thus detachable from subjective identity after physical death then the problem of anonymity that this article raises may not be perceived as an issue. On the other hand, those who view the body as co-existent with personhood, and as something we ‘are’, may construe tissue exchange as intersubjective and corporeal, and interpret body part incorporation as permissible or impermissible for that reason.</p>
<p>Both attitudes resonate for Pākehā and Māori interviewees in the larger study for this project. The latter view is especially significant for interviewees who subscribe to holistic notions of embodiment, identity, health and well-being and those for whom the line between life and death is not absolute. For Māori who hold traditional cultural and spiritual views about burying the dead, the donation and incorporation of body parts from the deceased requires special consideration. Traditional Māori cultural belief dictates bodily integrity prior to burial by interring the body whole. Having body parts living on outside the body could tamper with the ancestral line and breach customary rules and observances, especially in the absence of correct protocol and proper safeguards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311411167">Hudson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311411167">Lewis and Pickering, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311411167">Te Puni Kokiri, 1999</xref>). Knowing where and who donated organs have come from and being able to return them, in the appropriate way, is thus important. This not only relates to whānau but also tribally, in terms of obligations to the group. In the interview extract below, Cassandra, a Pākehā woman talks about her family’s interactions with a recipient after donating her deceased son’s organs. The extract shows how strong beliefs about shared corporeality and identity might play out in practice in New Zealand and offers a reason why anonymity protocol may need to be re-examined in the health care context to account for different people’s beliefs about the effect of transferring body parts on constructions of subjective and social identity.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Cassandra: One of [the recipients] was Māori, and for the year after [my son’s] death, every now and then there would be a telephone call. With the first one nothing was said at all, and the second one, nothing much was said. And then, after about a year, this man explained to us that we mightn’t want to know him, because he was an old Māori bloke, but he had received one of [my son’s] kidneys. And we assured him that it made no difference to us that he was an old Māori bloke. But what transpired from that was, when [X] had [a significant] birthday he invited us, and he invited the family of the other recipient and the surgeons, and we all met on the Marae together to celebrate his birthday. … So that was pretty amazing, and it wasn’t until then, really, that I began to understand the whole issue about organ donation and so on, as far as Māori are concerned. The interesting thing was when [X] finally died he had left a phone message to say, ‘would it be all right for … [sobs] … [my son’s] kidneys to stay with him?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this passage organ donation is not seen as a one-way gift but as a gift relationship, bringing different groups of people together who would not otherwise be connected but for biomedical and technological innovation. The woman’s comment is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311411167">Godelier’s (2002)</xref> reading of Mauss in that bodily gifts may be rendered alienable in terms of use by some people but not in terms of possession. A comment from Sanders, a Pākehā anonymous altruistic donor confirms this view on a personal level:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s funny but I still feel like I’ve got two kidneys. It’s just the other one is in someone else’s body and that is part of the reason why I have asked the transplant co-ordinator to let me know if the recipient actually does pass away, because that’s part of me. And also I feel that if I die tomorrow in an accident, well there’s actually still part of me alive. I know that sounds really weird but I do feel like I still do have two kidneys. Obviously I’m not going to get the other one back, nor do I want it back, but I still do feel that I’ve got two, just one of them is in someone else’s body.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Occasionally recipients I spoke with mentioned incorporating the personal and embodied qualities of the donor through the organ transfer process. Rosengarten (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311411167">Waldby, 2002</xref>: 248) refers to cases where the organ becomes personified to the extent that recipients worry about the presence of the alien organ affecting their sense of self. She notes the case of an African American man who felt distrustful of white people and expressed concern that his transplanted kidney, which came from a white donor, would ‘reject him’ and thus be incompatible with his embodied identity.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a reflective account of organ transplantation, Leda said that she understood her donor was male and this knowledge initially bothered her. It was important for her well-being to have more detail about the donor to allay anxieties about the strangeness of the organ transfer experience.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I felt uncomfortable. That’s the only word I can say, which isn’t quite the right word. I felt they weren’t my lungs basically. But mind you, a lot of that is physical, because when you’ve had a lung transplant you’re still breathing up here. And the physiotherapist comes in and says, ‘you’re breathing wrong still, you’ve got lungs now, you breathe down there.’ And I couldn’t do it; I couldn’t do it for weeks. I was used to breathing up here and not down there. And I’ll still be going like this (takes a deep breath). But now I can breathe with delight because I can breathe properly. But anyway, then I found out my donor was female, a lady in her 40s, and I immediately felt happier. Isn’t that strange?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is difficult to know precisely what this statement means. At one point in her interview Leda described herself as an ‘old-fashioned feminist’, which I took to mean a view of men and women as essentially (physiologically, biologically and psychologically) different. From the perspective of this interviewee, the incorporation of an organ from a man – a stranger with whom this woman had no relationship – could mean several things. The woman might believe the organ had the potential to masculinize her body-self, or, incorporating a strange man’s organ could have connotations of intimacy akin to beliefs about donor insemination as a form of infidelity.</p>
<p>Research on donated gametes in assisted human reproduction provides an instructive analogue to the question of shared corporeality for these organ transfer participants. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s New Zealand fertility clinics have operated a policy of openness and identifiability regarding donor information for children conceived with the aid of donor-assisted technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311411167">Adair and Rogan, 1998</xref>: 268–269; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311411167">Blyth et al., 1998</xref>: 72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311411167">Daniels, 2004</xref>: 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311411167">Ellis and Irwin, 2002</xref>). In 2004 this policy was made law by The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act, as was a legal Register for records of gamete donations resulting in birth after 20 August 2005. Prior to this period, no records were kept for sperm donors in New Zealand and their identities were anonymous. The rationale for change in policy and law recognized the importance of tracing genealogy and the exchange of information about genetic origins; of particular significance to Māori, as well as acknowledging the psychological and emotional well-being of openness for donor offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311411167">Hargreaves, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311411167">Hargreaves and Daniels, 2007</xref>). For Māori, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311411167">Lovelock (2010</xref>: 136–137) explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the lack of legal status for gamete donors is problematic, as within Māori kinship those who donate genetic material must continue to be responsible for the use (social) of that material. In addition, decisions relating to donation use and outcomes should be made by <italic>whānau</italic>, and ‘mixing’ <italic>whānau</italic> without <italic>whānau</italic> consent is unacceptable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although there are cultural differences between Māori and Pākehā understandings of kinship and ancestorship, in a postmodern bicultural environment these respective views do not exist in isolation. The idea of families comprising social <italic>and</italic> biological parents who take on different roles in relation to offspring might not be the statistical norm but such family formation is no longer considered unconventional by 21st-century standards. There are parallels between the donation of gametes and anonymous deceased and altruistic organ donation. The point is well made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311411167">Waldby (2002</xref>: 251) who states; ‘biomedically engineered intercorporeality’ has the potential to replay older expressions of kinship in cases where participants wish to extend ‘family’ through tissue exchange to include relations between fictive kin. Pre-1980s, there was a policy of secrecy in New Zealand around donor identity in assisted reproduction. In 2011, the deceased organ donor (and their family) is currently a ‘dead former person’ whose identity is also erased as a ‘particular other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311411167">Plevak, 2008</xref>: 164). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311411167">Plevak (2008)</xref> urges us to take ‘proper consideration’ of the ‘personhood’ of deceased donors and the donor’s family into account. This would entail recognizing the significance many people increasingly attach to the relationship between the ‘biological’ and the ‘social’ in organ transfer, and acknowledging this perspective in the narratives of transplant recipients, donors and donor family members.</p>
<p>Unlike recipients who had an intercorporeal view of embodiment through organ transfer, a number of interviewees I spoke with thought the notion that one takes on personal attributes and qualities of the donor through tissue exchange was far-fetched. For example, Elissa said the idea of psychic and social communion with her donor was ‘irrelevant’. She remarked; ‘It’s only about how the heart feels in a physical sense, like how it’s functioning, that’s all that matters.’ Likewise, Maia, a lung recipient who had suffered from Cystic Fibrosis and received a transplanted lung several years before the interview did not invest her organs with personhood. Twice during our conversation she stated that her old lung ‘was a hunk of meat’ and that her body was simply a vessel for her soul or spirit. As she put it:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am extremely grateful to my donor and I don’t mean to trivialize it. … I know that not all cultures see it that way, but when you see the organ and if you didn’t know what it was you’d probably think it was something in the supermarket. It’s a piece of meat. Um, I don’t mean to sound insensitive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is significant, in light of these quotations, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311411167">Shildrick (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311411167">Siminoff and Chillag (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311411167">Vamos (2010)</xref> point to evidence indicating that people who view donated organs as spare parts do better post-transplant clinically and psychologically (at least initially) in terms of integrating the organ as part of their new sense of self.</p>

<title>Conclusion: re-examining anonymity protocol</title>
<p>The matter of how to construct one’s identity in relation to donors and donor family members was a recurrent theme for transplant recipients in the study interviews for this project. The question this article raises is whether relaxing the rules around anonymity protocol to facilitate greater exchange of donor–recipient information or contact would help people psycho-socially integrate their new body part better. Although this is not a universal problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311411167">Shildrick (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311411167">Vamos (2010)</xref> independently suggest that anticipating and acknowledging the topic, by allowing patients to talk about these issues in the health care environment, may improve the well-being and clinical outcomes for those involved.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while a number of transplant recipients and donor family members may benefit from relaxed rules around this protocol, some recipients may be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the gift and obligations to repay. Increasing donor–recipient contact in such circumstances may exacerbate rather than alleviate feelings of guilt and unworthiness.</p>
<p>This article has skimmed the surface of anonymity versus connection debates between donors and recipients and more data are needed from the perspective of those directly affected by organ transfer to make a case for facilitating less restricted forms of communication between donor families, anonymous donors and transplant recipients. Data from the sample presented in this article indicate the need for further consideration around withholding information about participants in this process. Obviously the rights of donors and donor families must be respected in the first instance. But there are lessons to be learnt from fertility clinics in New Zealand around openness to donor information in terms of psycho-social benefits for donor offspring and access to genealogical knowledge – a cultural imperative for Māori, and increasingly so for Pākehā – in the organ donation domain. Institutional discourse and policy currently prohibit unmediated exchange of identifying information in organ transfer, giving various reasons for doing so, but it may now be timely to re-examine the ethics and rituals around anonymity protocol for the benefit of those directly involved. This necessitates rethinking current organ donation and transplantation gratitude rituals; specifically the form and facilitated exchange of thank you letters and the degree to which communication ties between donors and recipients are accepted or discouraged by health professionals.</p>
