<abstract>
<p>While businesses may attract potential offenders and thus be conducive to disorder, the number of employees could offset this by exercising social control on offenders. This study uses data from different sources to test this expectation across 278 Dutch neighborhoods in the four largest cities of the Netherlands, using multivariate multilevel analysis to disentangle individual perception differences of disorder and neighborhood effects. Attention is paid to traditional explanations of disorder (i.e., poverty, residential mobility, and ethnic heterogeneity). Results show a positive relationship between business presence and neighborhood disorder. We do not find consistent results of the number of employees (i.e., bigger businesses are not always better or worse). Our research demonstrates that the presence of neighborhood businesses could rival the effects of social disorganization theory.</p>

<p>This article investigates the relationship between nonresidential land use, for example, the presence of firms, shops, or small businesses in urban neighborhoods, and perceived social and physical disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810397948">Kelling and Coles 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427810397948">McCord et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427810397948">Sampson and Raudenbush 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427810397948">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427810397948">Skogan 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810397948">Taylor 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427810397948">Wilcox et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427810397948">Wilson and Kelling 1982</xref>). Usually, social disorder refers to problems such as unsupervised teens, fighting neighbors, loud noise, or arguing, while examples of physical disorder are vandalism, graffiti, and litter on the streets. As such, social and physical disorder are “minor” forms of deviant behavior, some of which are prohibited by law (e.g., vandalism), while others are not (e.g., loitering), although this differs between places and time periods. The seriousness of a disorderly deviant act is usually deemed low (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427810397948">Rossi et al. 1974</xref>). Nevertheless, social and physical disorder is a pervasive problem in many urban areas, as it is quite common in urban neighborhoods to be confronted with, for example, garbage in front of one’s door. In addition, physical disorder can be detected after the act, while many serious delinquent acts (e.g., armed robbery) can only be perceived when the act itself is taking place.</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature devoted to explaining disorder, but relatively few studies focus on the effects of (different types of) businesses on neighborhood disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427810397948">Taylor et al. (1995)</xref> concluded that street blocks with more nonresidential land use experience more incivilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427810397948">LaGrange (1999)</xref> found that the presence of malls was positively related to property damage (i.e., physical disorder). The presence of catholic high schools was positively related to park vandalism, but not vandalism of other buildings or bus stops, whereas the presence of public high schools was related to all three types of property damage. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427810397948">Wilcox et al. (2004)</xref> suggested a positive relationship between places of business and disorder, but schools had no effect on disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427810397948">Sampson and Raudenbush (2004)</xref> did not find a relationship between the proportion of block groups with mixed land use and perceived incivilities in Chicago. However, using a more specific measure of mixed land use, they showed that the presence of bars and liquor stores, alcohol/tobacco advertisements, and commercial building security was related to both types of disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427810397948">McCord et al. (2007)</xref>, however, criticized the statistical analysis and measurement of nonresidential land use in this latter study. Their analyses show that residents with more crime-generating or crime-attracting land uses nearby reported their neighborhood as more disorderly. Interestingly, of the traditional explanatory neighborhood conditions, such as residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, and socioeconomic status, only the socioeconomic status of the neighborhood was significantly related to less perceived incivility after controlling for mixed land use. Based on ethnographic research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427810397948">St. Jean (2007)</xref> argues that specific places, for example, businesses, in the urban environment provide opportunity for deviant behavior, and that these places are a more important explanation for crime and disorder than traditional explanations which focus on social cohesion and social control.</p>
<p>Given the growing literature on nonresidential land use and its association with disorder, it is surprising that the role of employees in neighborhood businesses has not been studied so far. Among the very few exceptions are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427810397948">Clarke (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427810397948">Felson (2002)</xref>, who mention the potentially important role of business employees in the explanation of disorder. Employees of neighborhood businesses might be even more important to a neighborhood’s order than the residents themselves: in a neighborhood with businesses and a high employment rate of residents, there may be more business employees present than residents during working hours, provided the employees are themselves not residents of that neighborhood. As such, these employees may be better able to prevent disorder than the residents. Of course, the businesses where these employees work may attract more potential offenders who would not’have come to the neighborhood had there not been a business to visit in the first place. Therefore, when explaining disorder, the ratio between the number of neighborhood businesses and the number of employees in these businesses should be investigated, while controlling for traditional explanations.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the role of business employees to extend the discussion on the importance of nonresidential activities in explaining neighborhood disorder. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427810397948">McCord et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427810397948">St. Jean (2007)</xref>, we investigate arguments from two prominent theoretical perspectives, routine activity theory and social disorganization theory. We use detailed information from 278 neighborhoods in the four largest cities of the Netherlands.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022427810397948">
<title>Theory</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss two prominent theories for the explanation of disorder in neighborhoods, routine activity theory and social disorganization theory, and we show that these provide complementary arguments. In addition, they provide explicit arguments on the effects of business presence and the number of employees on a neighborhood’s social and physical disorder.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022427810397948">
<title>Routine Activity Theory</title>
<p>Routine activity theory states that for any deviant act to occur, <italic>motivated offenders</italic> must have contact with <italic>suitable targets</italic> in the absence of <italic>capable guardians</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810397948">Clarke and Felson 1993</xref>). Most deviance occurs during the <italic>routine activities</italic> that people conduct in their daily lives, such as living, working, and shopping. Thus, offenders and targets converge in space and time because of their daily activities: we call places that are most conducive to such convergence <italic>suitable places</italic>. Routine activity theory usually assumes that motivated offenders are present, and predominantly tries to explain the suitability of the target (i.e., the relative vulnerabilities of targets as perceived by potential offenders) or the presence of capable guardians. The intriguing implication of this theory is that even if every neighborhood harbors a similar number of motivated offenders, differences in deviance may occur because of different distributions of suitable targets or capable controllers.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427810397948">Eck and Weisburd (1995)</xref> introduced the term “controller,” a more general concept than “guardian.” Controllers may be either people related to the potential victim (e.g., parents and close friends), guardians (e.g., other residents, but also formal institutions such as the police), or place managers (e.g., store clerks). In the remainder of this article, we will refer to “controller” even if the original text used the term “guardian” because this term also includes “place managers,” which are exactly the type of controllers we investigate in this article.</p>
<p>To apply routine activity theory to neighborhood physical and social <italic>disorder</italic>, we need to provide arguments regarding the presence of offenders and controllers, the ratio of which serves as a measure of the suitability of a place. In contrast, to explain <italic>personal victimization</italic>, we would also need to account for an individual’s movement through space during the course of a day (i.e., their routine activities). In our research, however, a neighborhood, which does not move through space, is the “target.”<sup>

<sec id="section3-0022427810397948">
<title>Social Disorganization Theory</title>
<p>Social disorganization theory is another prominent perspective guiding neighborhood studies on disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397948">Hipp 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427810397948">Pratt and Cullen 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427810397948">Shaw and McKay (1969)</xref> argued that specific social structures of a neighborhood diminish its ability to remain socially organized, thus leading to higher levels of disorder. Recent research replicated these findings and further developed the original theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810397948">Markowitz et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427810397948">Sampson and Groves 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427810397948">Smith, Frazee, and Davison 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>First, residential mobility and ethnic heterogeneity undermine the social control that residents exercise over each other and over strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427810397948">Bursik 1988</xref>). While residential mobility impedes the formation of stable relationships necessary for social control, ethnic heterogeneity impedes communication between groups in the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427810397948">Bursik 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427810397948">Bursik and Grasmick 1993</xref>). Second, it is argued that in such neighborhoods the cultural transmission of delinquent values takes place more easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427810397948">Pratt and Cullen 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427810397948">Shaw and McKay 1969</xref>). The (lack of) social control and the ease of passing on of criminal traditions differ in each neighborhood, and thus neighborhoods differ in their rates of delinquency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427810397948">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Thus, while social disorganization theory is a neighborhood-level theory, the recent adjustments to the theory assume that the neighborhood-level outcomes are caused through the interrelated actions of individual actors. Social disorganization and routine activity theory distinguish the same relevant actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397948">Hipp 2007</xref>): capable controllers and potential offenders. However, in social disorganization theory, actors, if specifically mentioned at all, are assumed to be merely the neighborhood residents themselves. In reality, there are also other actors present in a neighborhood. We believe that the intervening actions of employees may be as important as, or even more important than, the actions of residents to explain neighborhood differences in social and physical disorder.</p>
<p>In this study, we control for the resident-based explanations of social disorganization theory to gauge the net effect of the neighborhood businesses and the number of people who work in these businesses. In line with assumptions of social disorganization theory, we expect to find more physical and social disorder in neighborhoods with more residential mobility, a higher percentage of nonwestern migrants, lower income, and higher population density.<sup>

<title>Do Businesses Provide “Suitable Places” for Neighborhood Disorder?</title>
<sec id="section5-0022427810397948">
<title>Businesses attract offenders and controllers</title>
<p>Neighborhoods with many businesses are suitable places for disorder to occur because these businesses attract people in the course of their daily routine activities, for example, shopping, working, or spending leisure time. These are not only people who live in the neighborhood, but often are people that come to these businesses from outside the neighborhood. Businesses attract a mixture of offenders and controllers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427810397948">Brantingham and Brantingham 1995</xref>) who meet there in time and space.</p>
<p>Previous research provides theoretical arguments regarding both positive effects as well as negative effects of business presence on deviance. On one hand, businesses are expected to attract potential offenders and decrease the number of capable controllers. Their presence impairs resident-based control by attracting outsiders, discouraging the use of space by residents, and providing public space for which no one takes responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427810397948">Taylor 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427810397948">Taylor, Gottfredson, and Brower 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810397948">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427810397948">Taylor et al. 1995</xref>). Residents of streets with stores are less likely to interact with others, and thus nonresidential land use weakens resident-based social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810397948">Baum, Davis, and Aiello 1978</xref>). On the other hand, there is also some research suggesting positive effects of businesses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810397948">Jacobs (1961)</xref> argues that regular customers provide eyes on the street, thereby acting as controllers or deterrents without having to act. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397948">McPherson and Silloway (1986)</xref> argue that social interaction between residents and shopkeepers of small commercial centers within neighborhoods can promote social cohesion and neighborhood attachment, thus enhancing controlling behavior. Because arguments have been made for both positive and negative effects of businesses, we view these as competing hypotheses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427810397948">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427810397948">Brantingham and Brantingham (1995)</xref> further argue that the effect of business presence on deviance differs by business type because business types differ in the specific mixture of offenders and controllers that they attract. They summarize these business types as attractors, generators, and neutral areas. Crime attractors provide many easy criminal opportunities, and motivated offenders are attracted to the business and the surrounding space specifically for that reason (e.g., bars; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427810397948">Gruenewald et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427810397948">Livingston 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427810397948">Roncek and Bell 1981</xref>). Businesses are crime generators if many people come there without any particular criminal motivation (e.g., high schools; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427810397948">LaGrange 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427810397948">Roncek and Faggiani 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427810397948">Roncek and Lobosco 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427810397948">Wilcox et al. 2004</xref>), but some potential offenders may also be among the crowd and subsequently notice and exploit criminal possibilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022427810397948">5</xref>
</sup> Businesses are neutral areas if they neither specifically attract offenders nor create easy criminal opportunities. Thus, for some types of businesses, the number of controllers may offset the number of attracted offenders, while for other types of business the attracted offenders will outnumber the controllers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022427810397948">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In practice, however, a business will never be purely of one type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427810397948">Brantingham and Brantingham 1995</xref>). In addition, an exhaustive list of business types and their expected effects is not feasible. Therefore, we tentatively expect that bars and liquor stores have stronger effects on disorder than fast-food businesses, which in turn have stronger effects on disorder than high schools and supermarkets, because of the mix of actors brought together in these places.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022427810397948">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we argue that there may be moderating effects of a neighborhood’s social disorganization on the relationship between land use and crime. We expect the presence of businesses to affect disorder especially strongly in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. In those neighborhoods, the businesses are situated within neighborhoods with very little resident-based social control (i.e., an interaction effect). Previous research supports this notion: for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427810397948">Peterson, Krivo, and Harris (2000)</xref> found that the presence of bars has stronger effects on robbery and rape incidents in highly deprived neighborhoods than in nondeprived neighborhoods (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427810397948">Wilcox et al. 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022427810397948">
<title>Business employees act as capable controllers</title>
<p>What has not been analyzed in the research discussed above is that besides neighborhood residents and visitors, the employees of the neighborhood businesses can also act as capable controllers. Not only the neighborhood residents and visitors, but also people who are working in the neighborhood can control others’ potentially deviant acts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810397948">Jacobs (1961)</xref> referred to the active role that shopkeepers can play in the prevention of neighborhood problems, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427810397948">Clarke (1992)</xref> explicitly focuses on the employees themselves and how they can regulate the behavior of others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427810397948">Felson (2002)</xref> argues that employees are responsible for particular settings, and are probably the most important controllers in society.</p>
<p>To derive hypotheses on the influence of business employees on neighborhood disorder, or more generally, the influence of capable controllers on deviance, we assume that controllers’ actions are broadly rational in nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810397948">Cornish and Clarke (1986)</xref> argue that <italic>offenders</italic> seek to “benefit themselves by their criminal behavior; that this involves the making of decisions and of choices […]; and that these processes exhibit a measure of rationality, albeit constrained by limits of time and ability and availability of relevant information.” Here, we extend this argument by assuming that <italic>controllers</italic> also act according to these assumptions.</p>
<p>If we assume that controllers make at least limited rational decisions, then we can expect that because their livelihood depends on business survival and business survival depends on customer demand (and assuming that customers prefer shops without litter, graffiti, or drunken people nearby), employees can be expected to act as capable controllers. Potential disorder generated by the attracted offenders may thus be offset by employees in the neighborhood, and we can therefore expect <italic>less</italic> disorder if there are <italic>more</italic> employees. However, the assumption that controllers behave rationally (within certain limits) also leads to an alternative expectation due to free-riding effects: when a group is sufficiently large, the incentive for any one member to act on behalf of the common good is diminished below a certain threshold. In large groups there emerges a participation paradox: a clean and safe neighborhood is a common good, which means that no one can be excluded once it is produced.

<title>Data</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses, data on physical disorder and social disorder from a resident survey were combined with census data on the socio-structural characteristics of neighborhoods, and data on the types of businesses and employment opportunities available in the neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The Police Population Monitor (PPM) is a nationwide biannual Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing Survey and was provided by the “Directie Politie en Veiligheidsregio’s” of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Hague. Residents are asked, inter alia, about their perception of neighborhood disorder and personal background information. Statistics Netherlands (CBS) provided information on the neighborhood-level average residential income, residential mobility, and the percentage of western and nonwestern migrants in each neighborhood. The LISA (in Dutch: “Landelijk Informatiesysteem Arbeidsplaatsen”) dataset provided information on neighborhood businesses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022427810397948">8</xref>
</sup> When errors are found in this dataset, all previous years are updated with the correct information, thereby ensuring the best available complete dataset on Dutch businesses. For each business, the activity in which it engages, the number of people who work there, and its location are recorded.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods are defined as “natural areas” by the CBS. This definition of a neighborhood is arguably better than the definition by a four-digit postal code, which is often used in studies of this kind. These CBS neighborhoods are small, homogeneous areas: there exist about 11,000 of these neighborhoods, compared to about 4,000 four-digit postal code areas. Moreover, CBS gathers data at this smaller level of neighborhood, so any aggregation into four-digit postal code areas would enlarge measurement errors. Furthermore, the 2005 PPM survey uniquely includes the location of each respondent at the street level. This enabled us to locate the respondents in the actual CBS neighborhoods. Our measurement of neighborhoods is therefore more precise than those of most other studies in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Previous research in the United States has been primarily conducted within urban neighborhoods and focuses on one city at a time. We improve on this research by using 278 neighborhoods nested in the four largest cities of the Netherlands, with a total of 7,927 respondents. Because we expect the inner city core with many shopping streets to be substantially different from residential areas located in the periphery, we excluded those inner-city neighborhoods as well as neighborhoods that only served as business districts outside the city center: we are interested specifically in <italic>mixed use</italic> neighborhoods. Furthermore, because the predictors at the neighborhood level are hypothesized to be causes of disorder, we used the relevant predictor variables measured in 2004 and used as outcome variables the perceived social disorder and physical disorder in 2005.</p>

<p>Nine items related to disorder are used in this study. All items are measured on a three-point scale indicating whether this type of disorder occurs often, sometimes, or almost never in the respondent’s neighborhood. The items were recoded so that a higher score on an item reflected a higher prevalence of disorder (almost never = 0, sometimes = 1, often = 2). Physical disorder is reflected in the following five items: (a) litter on the (b) <italic>dog feces</italic> on the streets and sidewalks, (c) <italic>vandalism</italic> of phone booths, bus- or tram-stops, (d) <italic>noise</italic> (nontraffic), and (e) <italic>graffiti</italic> on walls or buildings.

<p>The LISA data were used to construct more precise business variables. First, dummies were created reflecting the presence of at least one establishment per business type. In this manner, we can investigate whether the presence of at least one establishment of a specific business type affects neighborhood disorder. Second, we constructed variables that show the numbers of “small,” “medium,” and “large” businesses in terms of the number of employees. Where possible, these variables are treated as interval variables, as in the case of bars. However, for liquor stores and high schools, we could not reasonably construct such ordinal measures given their low frequency in the data. Thus, we constructed two dummies reflecting whether at least one “small” or “large” business is present (0 = no, 1 = yes) in the neighborhood. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427810397948">Table 2</xref>

<p>To classify business size as “small,” “medium,” or “large,” we tried to find a balance between the level of detailed information for each business and its frequency of occurrence in the data.

<p>Residential mobility reflects the number of movers to or from a certain neighborhood in one year per 100 residents of that neighborhood. Ethnic heterogeneity was measured as the percentage of western migrants (i.e., from Europe, North America, Oceania, Indonesia, and Japan, based on socioeconomic and cultural position relative to the native Dutch) and nonwestern migrants (i.e., from Turkey, Africa, Latin America, and Asia) living in each neighborhood, here recoded so that an increase of 1 reflects a 10 percent increase in reality. To capture poverty, the average income of the residents per neighborhood (after taxes) was divided by 10,000. Population density is the number of residents per hectare of land (i.e., 100 × 100 meters) divided by 10,000. Lastly, the total number of residents per neighborhood was included, also divided by 10,000, to account for differences in neighborhood size. All of these variables were centered on their grand means so that the intercept of the model reflects the amount of disorder for an average neighborhood. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427810397948">Table 3</xref>

<p>Analysis for multicollinearity between neighborhood-level predictors shows that the percentage of (non) western foreigners correlates with the average neighborhood income (western: <italic>r</italic> = .78; nonwestern: <italic>r</italic> = –.74). Thus, western foreigners live in relatively affluent neighborhoods, while nonwestern foreigners live in relatively poor neighborhoods. Previous studies have also found that the percentage of ethnic minorities and poverty overlap. However, to be able to compare with these previous studies, we included both predictors in our model. The numbers and types of businesses also tend to cluster somewhat within neighborhoods, but the analyses for multicollinearity did not lead us to believe that this influenced our results (tables available on request).</p>

<title>Individual-level variables</title>
<p>If the perception of disorder is systematically influenced by personal characteristics of the respondents and people with similar characteristics tend to cluster together in neighborhoods, the perceived neighborhood disorder is not correctly estimated (i.e., a composition effect). For example, a neighborhood may not really be more littered than other neighborhoods, but if many elderly people live in that neighborhood, they may <italic>perceive</italic> and thus report litter more readily. Thus, compositional differences of neighborhoods need to be taken into account by controlling for individual characteristics. The PPM dataset permits controlling for the following individual characteristics: age (in years), level of education in seven categories, status of employment (0 = employed, 1 = unemployed), gender (0 = male, 1 = female), and the country of birth of the respondent (1 = Netherlands, 2 = western country, 3 = nonwestern country, 4 = other/unknown).<sup>

In addition, because physical and social disorder measurements are conceptually and empirically related, we estimated these two dependent variables simultaneously in all of the models. We employ a three-level model: the two dependent variables, physical disorder and social disorder, are nested; within respondents, which are nested; and within neighborhoods. There is no significant variation between the four cities, so we do not account for differences at the city level. The model has no Level 1 variation specified because Level 1 only exists to define the multivariate structure. In all models, we control for individual perception bias by including individual-level covariates, and we add neighborhood-level covariates to explain physical disorder and social disorder.</p>

<title>Spatial Dependence</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427810397948">Tobler’s (1970)</xref> first law of geography, “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”. In our models, individual data are nested within neighborhoods. This already represents a spatial dependence that is taken care of in the multilevel models. However, on the neighborhood level, dependence between localized observations can still be present. Positive “spatial autocorrelation” occurs when high or low values of a variable tend to cluster in space, and negative spatial autocorrelation occurs when geographical areas tend to be surrounded by neighbors with very dissimilar values. Spatial dependence between observations causes biases in the estimated effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397948">Bernasco and Elffers 2010</xref>). Applying spatial models is a common way to optimally take care of spatial dependence in clustered observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810397948">Anselin 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The measurement of global spatial autocorrelation in this article<sup>

</sup> statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810397948">Anselin 1988</xref>), which is the most widely known measure of spatial clustering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022427810397948">16</xref>
</sup> Inference is based on a standardized <italic>z</italic>-value of <italic>I</italic> that is computed by subtracting the mean and dividing the result by the standard deviation. A positive and significant <italic>z</italic>-value for Moran’s <italic>I</italic> indicates positive spatial autocorrelation. Similar values of the variable, either high or low, are more spatially clustered than could be caused purely by chance. In contrast, a negative and significant <italic>z</italic>-value for Moran’s <italic>I</italic> indicates negative spatial autocorrelation, which comes down to a correlation between clusters that is lower than would be expected by chance. The results for Moran’s <italic>I</italic> are to a large extent determined by the choice of the spatial weight matrix. In general, a pattern of decreasing autocorrelation with increasing orders of relation (contiguity) is typical of many spatial autoregressive processes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022427810397948">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>If spatial autocorrelation is present, regression models can incorporate a spatial lag or error component reflecting the spatial dependence in the dependent variable; incorporate spatially lagged explanatory variables; or, incorporate both at the same time (Durbin model). The distinction between the spatial lag and spatial error specifications is important because in the former case, disorder in one location is linked to disorder in other locations, whereas in the latter case, linkages between locations occur via the error generation process. Because we did not have a priori substantive hypotheses about the effect of explanatory variables of surrounding areas on the disorder in the <italic>focal</italic> area, we tested both <italic>x</italic>-lagged and <italic>y</italic>-lagged specifications of spatial autocorrelation. Models incorporating a spatial lag of disorder (instead of spatial lags of explanatory variables) take care of the spatial dependence sufficiently to assure unbiased conclusions on the explanatory variables in the multilevel model.</p>
<p>For each model shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427810397948">Tables 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022427810397948">6</xref>, we completed the following steps of analysis: (a) we first estimated each multivariate multilevel model without a spatial lag component; (b) we used the neighborhood level residuals to test whether there was spatial autocorrelation according to Moran’s <italic>I</italic>; (c) in each model this turned out to be the case (and as expected, the spatial autocorrelation decreased with each subsequent model because of the inclusion of explanatory variables); (d) we constructed the spatial lag components for physical disorder and social disorder and added these as a control variable in the model; and (e) and we tested for remaining spatial autocorrelation on the new neighborhood level residuals.</p>

<title>Intercept-Only Model</title>
<p>An intercept-only model provides information on how the total variance in physical disorder and social disorder is distributed across the individual level and the neighborhood level. It also provides information on the average disorder across all neighborhoods, while taking into account the nested structure of the dataset as well as the spatial dependence. In addition, it provides an estimation of the correlation between physical disorder and social disorder. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022427810397948">Table 7</xref>
 shows the results for both physical disorder and social disorder after controlling for spatial dependence of disorder. We will discuss spatial dependence of all models separately in the section titled “Spatial Dependence.”</p>

<p>An average neighborhood has more perceived physical disorder (4.34) than social disorder (1.35), even taking into account that physical disorder has a greater outcome range (0 to 10) than social disorder (0 to 8). For physical disorder, 95 percent of all neighborhoods fall between 3.77 and 4.91 (a’range of two standard deviations around the mean). For social disorder, 95 percent of all neighborhoods fall from 0.83 to 1.86.</p>
<p>We can estimate how much of the variance of disorder can be attributed to the neighborhood level with the intraclass correlation, which is the neighborhood level variance divided by the total variance. This shows that about 6.2 percent of the variation in perceptions of physical disorder can be attributed to the 278 neighborhoods, whereas this value is 10.5 percent for social disorder. People within the same neighborhood agree more easily on the occurrence of social disorder indicators than on the occurrence of physical disorder.<sup>

</sup> The correlation between the two types of disorder can be calculated from the covariance between physical disorder and social disorder. On the individual level, this provides a correlation coefficient of .42, which is a moderately strong correlation. A stronger correlation is found on the neighborhood level, namely .66.<sup>

<title>Perceptual Differences of Disorder</title>
<p>As we stated before, if the perception of disorder is systematically influenced by personal characteristics and people with similar characteristics tend to cluster together in neighborhoods, the perceived neighborhood disorder is not correctly estimated. Compositional differences of neighborhoods need to be taken into account by controlling for individual characteristics. Except for age, individual characteristics have a stronger effect on the perception of physical disorder than the perception of social disorder. Elderly people are more likely to report less physical and social disorder than younger people in the same neighborhood. Women and the highly educated report more physical and social disorder in comparison with men and less-educated people. Foreigners report less physical disorder than native Dutch in the same neighborhood. For social disorder, only the “other” category of foreigners significantly reports less disorder than native Dutch (tables available upon request).</p>

<title>Physical Disorder</title>
<p>The results for physical disorder are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427810397948">Table 4</xref>
. Model 1 starts with the traditional explanations from social disorganization theory, and our expectations are partly supported. Neighborhoods with more residential mobility, lower average income, greater population density, and a larger number of residents have more physical disorder. When controlling for the aforementioned variables, the percentage of migrants has no significant effect on physical disorder, contrary to expectations. Next, we compare the effects of a one standard deviation increase of predictor variables on physical disorder. For residential mobility, a one standard deviation increase (.40) results in an increase of physical disorder by about .23. For income, a one standard deviation increase (.32) decreases physical disorder by about .34. For population density and the number of residents, a one standard deviation increase of each leads to an increase of physical disorder of .12.<sup>

</p>
<p>Model 2 adds local businesses as an explanatory mechanism for physical disorder. Even with the relatively crude measure of “total number of businesses,” we find that the total number of businesses positively affects physical disorder and is highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Even when controlling for the variables known to be highly related to deviance, a one standard deviation increase in the number of businesses increased the perceived physical disorder by about .20, which is almost as large as or larger than the effects of residential mobility, population density, and the number of residents.</p>
<p>As was suggested theoretically, a specific subset of businesses may be especially related to disorder, and therefore, we explored the role of these businesses more specifically in Model 3. In this model, dummies reflect whether at least one storefront of such a business is present (1) or not (0). Of the five investigated business types, the presence of fast-food restaurants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and supermarkets (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) is positively related to physical disorder. If both are present in the neighborhood, these business types increase physical disorder by 1.05.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022427810397948">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Model 4 shows the effects of the presence of each business type as well as the effect of its size in terms of the number of employees. Liquor stores and high schools do not exist in enough neighborhoods to warrant an interval variable reflecting their exact number. Therefore, these two kinds of businesses remain in the analysis as dummy variables, but we changed each into two dummies reflecting small and large establishments, respectively. Conversely, multiple bars, fast-food restaurants and supermarkets of different sizes were present in many neighborhoods. Therefore, we included interval variables reflecting the number of those businesses of each size.</p>
<p>When taking the number of employees in each business type into account, large high schools and large supermarkets positively affect physical disorder. For these types of businesses, size does matter for the occurrence of physical disorder. These, however, have relatively small effect sizes, comparable to the effect sizes of population density and the number of residents, of .15 for the presence of at least one large high school and .11 for a one standard deviation increase in large supermarkets. In addition, we do <italic>not</italic> find instances where smaller neighborhood businesses actually <italic>decrease</italic> the neighborhood’s physical disorder.</p>

<sec id="section22-0022427810397948">
<title>Social Disorder</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427810397948">Table 5</xref>
 presents the results of the same models for social disorder as the dependent variable. Model 1 gives support for social disorganization theory but not all expectations are supported: the percentage of western migrants and neighborhood income are not significantly related to social disorder. In contrast to the model of physical disorder, a higher percentage of nonwestern migrants living in the neighborhood relates to a higher perception of social disorder, with an effect size of .28 for a one standard deviation increase. Only residential mobility and population density have similar effects across the two types of disorder and increase social disorder by about .15 and .17, respectively, for a one standard deviation increase. Lastly, neighborhoods with more residents experience less social disorder, though this effect is only marginally significant.</p>
<p>In Model 2, the number of all business establishments relates positively to social disorder. For social disorder, we find a stronger effect of the number of businesses than for physical disorder (a one standard deviation increase equals an increase of social disorder of .25). The effect of the number of neighborhood businesses is similar to the strongest explanatory variable of social disorganization theory, the percentage of nonwestern migrants. Clearly, the number of businesses in a neighborhood is important for the explanation of social disorder, even after controlling for the traditional explanations.</p>
<p>Repeating this analysis with a specific subset of businesses in Model 3, the results indicate that neighborhoods with at least one liquor store and at least one bar experience more social disorder. If both are present in the’neighborhood, these business types increase social disorder by .53 (.245 + .285). As with physical disorder, the presence of at least one high school does not significantly affect social disorder. Moreover, the results indicate that the presence of a fast-food establishment or a supermarket also does not affect the neighborhood’s social disorder, in contrast to our previous findings. Such establishments add uniquely to the physical problems in the neighborhood but not to its social problems.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the estimates in Model 4 show that neighborhoods with small high schools actually experience less social disorder than neighborhoods without such schools. In contrast to physical disorder, we find that other business types have positive effects on social disorder, that is, a greater number of such businesses results in more social disorder. Medium-sized bars and fast-food establishments (both <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), as well as large fast-food establishments (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and large bars (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), increase social disorder. large fast-food establishments and large bars increase social disorder similarly for a one standard deviation increase of .12 and .14, respectively. Comparable to physical disorder, the number of large supermarkets contributes significantly to more social disorder.</p>

<title>Interaction Effects</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022427810397948">Table 6</xref>
 shows the results of including interaction effects between the business variables in Model 4 and the social disorganization variables. We consistently find that the neighborhood income interacts with the number (or presence) of businesses in the neighborhoods. In general, poor neighborhoods with many businesses are worse off than rich neighborhoods with many businesses. Though we included the individual-level covariates as well as the other social disorganization variables, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022427810397948">Table 6</xref> only shows the main effects and interaction effects between neighborhood income and the businesses.</p>
<p>For physical disorder, the presence of a small or large liquor store was not significant in Model 4 but now significantly interacts with neighborhood income: the presence of such businesses in poor neighborhoods relates to higher levels of physical disorder. For the number of large supermarkets, the interaction points in the other direction: the number of large supermarkets seems to decrease physical disorder in poor neighborhoods but increase physical disorder in rich neighborhoods. However, descriptive statistics show that in both rich and poor neighborhoods, there are at most only two or three large supermarkets present, depending on our cutoff point that indicates rich neighborhoods. In contrast, some neighborhoods of average wealth have as many as eight large supermarkets. Therefore, we should only compare neighborhoods with a few large supermarkets, and then the interaction tells a similar story: poor neighborhoods with a few large supermarkets fare worse than wealthier neighborhoods with a few large supermarkets.</p>
<p>For social disorder, including interactions between businesses and income resulted in a significant and positive main effect of income in the analysis. This indicates that when there are no businesses present in a neighborhood, residents of richer neighborhoods actually reported more social disorder than residents of poorer neighborhoods. For poor neighborhoods, having a (small or large) liquor store results in more social disorder. Moreover, residents of poor neighborhoods with a higher number of small bars report greater social disorder, while residents of rich neighborhoods with many small bars only report moderate social disorder.</p>

<title>Spatial Dependence</title>
<p>As discussed in the Methods section, the results may be biased when we assume independence between observations when in fact the data have spatial dependence. Standard multilevel analysis in itself is not sufficient to account for this type of dependence. In all models except Model 3 for physical disorder, there was strong support for initial spatial dependence, and we therefore included a spatial coefficient in each model. The inclusion of this spatial coefficient resulted in a nonsignificant subsequent Moran’s <italic>I</italic> test for spatial dependence (a table comparing Moran’s <italic>I</italic> before and after controlling for spatial dependence is available upon request). The parameter estimates indicate that neighborhoods in which the surrounding areas experience a lot of physical disorder also experience more physical disorder themselves, and these results are similar for social disorder. In Models 1 to 3, we find that the effect sizes of spatial dependence are stronger for social disorder than for physical disorder, while in the latter models the effects are comparable.</p>
<p>It is especially interesting to compare the intercept-only “empty” model excluding and including a control variable for spatial dependence. The estimated averages of physical disorder (4.27 without a spatial coefficient) and social disorder (1.24 without a spatial coefficient) are comparable, but the neighborhood-level variances differ greatly. The model without a spatial coefficient estimates .512 and .503 for physical disorder and social disorder, respectively, whereas these variances are .326 and .268 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022427810397948">Table 7</xref>. Not accounting for spatial dependence results in overestimation of neighborhood differences. Because the individual-level variances are the same, the intraclass correlation is similarly overestimated when we do not correct for spatial dependence. A model without a spatial coefficient suggests intraclass correlations of 9.4 percent and 18 percent for physical disorder and social disorder, respectively, instead of the more conservative 6.2 percent and 10.5 percent. Failing to account for spatial dependence would also have led us to believe that the neighborhood-level correlation between physical disorder and social disorder is even stronger than .66 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022427810397948">Table 7</xref>), namely .78.</p>
<p>We also tested whether the <italic>physical</italic> disorder of the surrounding neighborhoods affected the <italic>social</italic> disorder in the focal neighborhood and vice versa. We did not find such spatial dependence in any of our models. Neighborhoods with physical disorder cluster spatially, as do neighborhoods with social disorder, but we did not find evidence for “cross-type” spatial dependence.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Our analyses partly support the traditional explanations provided by social disorganization theory to explain neighborhood differences in disorder. In particular, we found that more residential mobility, lower income, and higher population density enhance <italic>physical</italic> disorder. The percentage of (non) western migrants is not related to physical disorder. For <italic>social</italic> disorder, residential mobility, a higher percentage of nonwestern migrants, and a higher population density positively affect the outcome. In contrast to physical disorder, however, neighborhood income does not affect social disorder. The effect of neighborhood size (in terms of number of residents) differs between model specifications: when it is significant, neighborhoods with more residents experience <italic>more</italic> physical disorder but <italic>less</italic> social disorder. For physical disorder, the most <italic>robust</italic> explanations across all models are residential mobility and neighborhood income, while for social disorder, the ethnic heterogeneity of a neighborhood, the population density, and the number of residents better explain the data.</p>
<p>The analyses show that the presence of a larger local economy (i.e., the total number of all business establishments in a neighborhood) leads to more physical disorder <italic>and</italic> social disorder. This measure is relatively imprecise because it also includes businesses that do not physically attract customers to the neighborhood or do not have many employees who may intervene, but we still find strongly significant results that rival the explanatory power of the separate social disorganization explanations. Next, we used more precise measures on specific types of business. The presence of fast-food establishments and the presence of supermarkets turned out to be important predictors of physical disorder. For social disorder, the relevant businesses are liquor stores and bars.</p>
<p>Moreover, we find effects of the number of employees. Large high schools and large supermarkets add significantly to the neighborhood’s physical disorder. For social disorder, medium-sized and large bars, medium-sized and large fast-food establishments, and large supermarkets have positive effects. Finally, in contrast to physical disorder, a neighborhood with at least one small high school experiences <italic>less</italic> social disorder.</p>
<p>Lastly, we find that effects of liquor stores on physical and social disorder are moderated by neighborhood income, thereby supporting our argument that business presence is especially detrimental in already disadvantaged neighborhoods. In addition, we find similar moderating effects for large supermarkets (with respect to physical disorder) and small bars (with respect to social disorder).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Combining two theories of deviance, social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, the empirical results shed light on the relative explanatory power of each theory. The explanations of social disorganization theory are more robust across both types of disorder but the presence of businesses rivals these explanations. This suggests that explanations of neighborhood disorder based solely on the social disorganization perspective overlook the fact that neighborhood businesses are important contributors to the explanation of physical and social disorder. In addition, we argued that neighborhood employees are important actors to better explain social and physical disorder, and our empirical results confirm that for some types of business, size matters. We also made a first step to evaluate the robustness of social disorganization theory in a different setting than American cities, while simultaneously accounting for business presence and the number of employees in each neighborhood.</p>
<p>We believe that we have opened up a fruitful area of further research: we stress that neighborhoods are not only places where people live, but also places where people work and spend their leisure time. Moreover, we believe that a recasting of current theory toward a focus on the actions of interdependent individuals is necessary as well as promising. With regard to disorder, a form of deviance specifically found in public spaces, individual actors can be either potential offenders, who may act in a deviant manner, or controllers, who may intervene. Although an explanation of the spatial distribution of disorder should also include such conditions as poverty, ethnic heterogeneity, and population turnover of a neighborhood, this is only one part of the explanation. Social disorganization theory provides arguments on the <italic>propensity</italic> toward disorder. The rest of the explanation, and one more suited to the <italic>occurrence</italic> of disorder, is sought in the meeting in time and space of interdependent actors.</p>
<p>Though also often lacking in other studies, we feel the main weakness of this study is that we could not directly include the amount of social control and trust among the residents in each neighborhood. Instead, we try to add to the current debate by using data on the presence of businesses and employees in each neighborhood. We can be sure that we have included all possible businesses (of a certain type) because we used a complete dataset of businesses instead of our own observation or asking the residents themselves about the presence of neighborhood businesses in a survey.</p>
<p>Our data also did not allow us to simultaneously analyze the consequences of physical and social disorder on business presence. To some extent, the presence of businesses in a neighborhood is a result of community safety rather than a cause: merchants may hesitate to open a business in a neighborhood with high levels of crime. It is of course possible that disorder prior to 2004 resulted in selective in- and out-movement of businesses, which resulted in the distribution of business types and sizes across neighborhoods in 2004. However, because we used the social disorganization indicators and the business variables in 2004 to predict disorder in 2005, we feel confident enough to at least tentatively speak about “cause” and “effect.” Future research would ideally explore the causes and consequences of a prospering neighborhood economy vis-à-vis the neighborhood’s physical and social disorder with longitudinal data.</p>
<p>In addition to the possibilities for future research mentioned above, actual <italic>intervention</italic> by neighborhood actors should be investigated more fully. As indicated in the theoretical part of this article, it is unclear under which circumstances individual actors actually intervene. For example, if others are present who might also intervene, individual actors may refrain from doing so because of free-riding behavior. Thus, research should not focus only on explanations and outcomes on the neighborhood level but also give attention to the individually interdependent microexplanations underpinning these neighborhood outcomes. In this respect, people who live and work in the same neighborhood (i.e., home-based entrepreneurs) are especially interesting in comparison to regular residents. These actors combine two spheres of life in the same place, have more stakes in the neighborhood than regular residents, and can therefore be expected to exercise more social control than regular residents or neighborhood employees.</p>
<p>Because business success depends on the environment (i.e., neighborhood) in which the business operates, we could expect that business employees will intervene in problematic situations, and do more for the public good than regular residents. However, this study reveals that neighborhoods with larger businesses (i.e., more employees) have more perceived physical and social disorder than neighborhoods with smaller businesses. Perhaps, the business employees are not <italic>capable</italic> controllers, that is, they do not take action on behalf of the neighborhood, or large businesses attract too large a group of offenders, or large businesses survive in or move to disorderly neighborhoods more regularly than small businesses. Further research using longitudinal data and investigating the actions of the interdependent actors (i.e., neighborhood residents, employees, and business owners) on behalf of the neighborhood is needed to solve this puzzle.</p>

<p>Some neighborhoods may also be more suitable targets than other neighborhoods because they provide more opportunities for deviancy, for example, by the presence of anonymous high-rise buildings with many escape routes. Research with regard to “crime prevention through environmental design” (CPTED) and “situational crime prevention” provide such arguments on the suitability of a target.

<p>In the Netherlands, some semilegal or illegal businesses flourish despite their controversial status. Due to nonenforcement, “coffee shops” that sell cannabis are tolerated. In addition, prostitution is legal and regulated. Of course, it would be very interesting to include those business types in our analyses. However, the dataset we used in this article has a single category for “specialty shops,” which also includes sellers of butter, eggs, honey, coffee/tea, nuts, and spices, in addition to coffee shops. Prostitution is part of a category “other services,” which includes businesses such as astrology, dog-walking services, and tattoo parlors. Nonetheless, we included these abstract categories in the analysis, but the results were not significant. Moreover, the numbers of brothels and cannabis cafes are lower than is believed outside of the Netherlands—thus, we believe this would not have greatly affected our results.</p>

<p>In this article, first- and second-order distance weight matrices were tested in spatial autoregressive modeling but for reasons of parsimony, we will only present analyses using the first-order (inverse distance) weight matrices that fitted our data best. Earlier research on the level of Dutch neighborhoods used a similar weight matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427810397948">Van Oort 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The relatively low numbers are not necessarily problematic: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427810397948">Raudenbush and Sampson (1999)</xref> note that large neighborhood effect sizes can give rise to an intraclass correlation as low as .14.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-0022427810397948">
<label>19.</label>
<p>This correlation coefficient could also be a reason to collapse the two disorder scales into one scale. We chose to keep them separate and allow them to covary in every model because this enables differences in parameter estimates of the explanatory variables to be seen for both types of disorder separately.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn24-0022427810397948">
<label>20.</label>
<p>An anonymous reviewer noted that in large Dutch cities, high population density neighborhoods may have lots of open space or very little open space depending on their age, and open space may provide opportunities for physical disorder. To test this hypothesis, we added a variable that captures the amount of “recreation space” in the neighborhood as a percentage of the total neighborhood area (mean = 11 percent, <italic>SD</italic> = 12 percent). This new variable does not affect any of our substantive results. We found that the percentage of recreation space had a positive significant effect on physical disorder but not on social disorder. A 10 percent increase in open space resulted in about .1 more physical disorder (on a scale of 0 to 10).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn25-0022427810397948">
<label>21.</label>
<p>Although we do not show this in the tables, we also explored the effects of primary schools, cultural institutions (i.e., libraries and museums), churches, and semilegal or tolerated businesses (i.e., brothels and cannabis selling points, though these business types are contained within a large category of “other services” or “specialty shops”) on physical and social disorder. We did not find any significant results either when including these “businesses” as a dummy variable as in Model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427810397948">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427810397948">5</xref> or when taking the number of employees into account as well, as per Model 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427810397948">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427810397948">5</xref>.</p>
