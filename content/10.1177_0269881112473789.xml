<abstract>
<p>The aim was to explore weight and body mass index (BMI) changes by baseline BMI in patients completing three years of monotherapy with various first- and second-generation antipsychotics in a large cohort in a post hoc analysis of three-year observational data.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed by antipsychotic and three baseline BMI bands: underweight/normal weight (BMI &lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25–30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (&gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Baseline BMI was associated with subsequent weight change irrespective of the antipsychotic given. Specifically, a smaller proportion of patients gained ≥7% baseline bodyweight, and a greater proportion of patients lost ≥7% baseline bodyweight with increasing baseline BMI. For olanzapine (the antipsychotic associated with highest mean weight gain in the total drug cohort), the percentage of patients gaining ≥7% baseline weight was 45% (95% CI: 43–48) in the underweight/normal weight BMI cohort and 20% (95% CI: 15–27) in the obese BMI cohort; 7% (95% CI: 6–8) of the underweight/normal cohort and 19% (95% CI: 13–27) of the obese cohort lost ≥7% baseline weight.</p>
<p>BMI has an association with the likelihood of weight gain or loss and should be considered in analyses of antipsychotic weight change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Weight gain has been associated with all antipsychotic treatments in observational as well as randomized studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112473789">Haro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112473789">Kahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112473789">Kane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112473789">Neovius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112473789">Perez-Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>) and attention has been drawn to the need for weight management programs and treatments for patients receiving these agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112473789">Bushe et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112473789">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112473789">Haddad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112473789">Holt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112473789">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Baseline body mass index (BMI) may be an important confounder in determining the degree of weight change during treatment. Mean baseline BMI is highly variable in clinical trials; reported baseline BMIs include 22.2 (SD 3.4) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112473789">Kahn et al., 2008</xref>), 23.1 (SD 3.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112473789">Perez-Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>), and 24.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 24.4–24.8) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112473789">Wu et al., 2008</xref>) in first-episode schizophrenia patients, 31.5 (SD 7.6) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112473789">Stroup et al., 2009</xref>), 25.7 (SD 2.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 26.8 (SD 4.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112473789">Baptista et al., 2008</xref>), in patients with chronic schizophrenia, and 32.3 (SD 0.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup> in a weight management study involving patients with severe mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112473789">Pendlebury et al., 2007</xref>). The initial BMI of a patient may be a determining factor in choice of antipsychotic.</p>
<p>There are few longer term studies with data over one year that allow weight change comparisons between antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112473789">Karagianis et al., 2009</xref>). This analysis reports on the mean and categorical weight change endpoints by antipsychotic agent and by baseline BMI category in patients who completed three years of monotherapy on the same antipsychotic. The authors have recently published a paper describing the full weight changes in this cohort by individual antipsychotic reporting a variety of categorical weight outcomes, hence these data are not included in this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112473789">Bushe et al, 2012</xref>). This analysis focuses only on weight change and its relation to initial BMI, a clinically relevant issue that may influence antipsychotic choice, and a question that may be specifically asked about by patients. This paper explores the actual changes and the trajectory of those changes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881112473789">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>The European (EU) Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes (SOHO) and Intercontinental (IC)-SOHO studies were three-year, prospective, nonrandomized, observational studies started in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112473789">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112473789">Novick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112473789">Karagianis et al., 2009</xref>). The two SOHO studies were conducted in different geographical regions but the key elements of the design were identical, enabling the data to be pooled. The patient populations consisted of outpatients aged 18 years or older with schizophrenia. Patients were included in the studies when they started or changed antipsychotic medication and were evaluated for 36 months (three years). The studies complied with regulations relating to informed patient consent and appropriate ethics review. Further methodological details are available elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112473789">Bushe et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112473789">Karagianis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112473789">Novick et al., 2009</xref>). EU-SOHO was conducted in 10 European countries, and enrolled 10,972 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112473789">Novick et al., 2009</xref>). IC-SOHO enrolled 7658 patients from 27 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112473789">Holt et al., 2010</xref>). By combining the data from both studies, the largest dataset of its kind was produced: the Worldwide-SOHO (W-SOHO) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112473789">Karagianis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The BMI categories have been selected as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO),which in 1995 adopted BMI as a tool to determine the level of obesity. The figure of 7% as a percentage indicating clinically significant weight gain or loss has been traditionally accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and reported in many clinical papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112473789">Bushe et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881112473789">
<title>Cohort definition</title>
<p>A total of 17,384 patients were available for analysis. Of these, 12,763 were prescribed antipsychotic monotherapy at baseline. In the present analysis, cohorts were defined by the antipsychotic initiated as monotherapy at baseline. A total of 11,088 patients completed the three-year study (referred to as the monotherapy cohort). Of these, 4626 remained on their initial antipsychotic for at least three years (referred to as the monotherapy completer cohort).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881112473789">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The primary analysis cohorts were monotherapy completers; sensitivity analyses were also conducted on the monotherapy cohort (data available from the authors on request). An initial exploratory plot of weight at study entry versus weight change after three years revealed a moderate negative relationship as expected, indicating the presence of regression to the mean. Longitudinal three-year profiles of adjusted mean weight change were evaluated using generalized linear mixed models (GLIMMIX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112473789">Fitzmaurice et al., 2008</xref>) adjusting for weight at study entry, time (log transformed), age, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score, monotherapy treatment group, sex, region, independent housing status (yes/no), involvement in social activities (yes/no), antipsychotic use before study entry (yes/no) along with (log) time-by-treatment group and weight at study entry-by-treatment group interaction terms.</p>

<title>Baseline demographics</title>
<p>Comparison of the baseline demographics for the monotherapy and monotherapy completer cohorts revealed the two groups to be similar in terms of mean age, gender, overall symptoms, baseline weight, BMI and percentage of patients who were underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese.

<title>Overweight cohort (baseline BMI 25–30 kg/m2)</title>
<p>A similar pattern of weight/BMI changes was observed in patients who were overweight at baseline to that seen among the underweight/normal weight cohort.</p>
<p>Analysis of patients who were overweight at baseline revealed weight gain at three years with all drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112473789">Figure 1</xref>), but the magnitude of this weight gain was slightly less than that observed in the underweight/normal weight cohort. Weight gain was greatest in patients treated with olanzapine (4.2 kg, 95% CL: 3.7; 4.7) and lowest in patients treated with quetiapine (1.6 kg, 95% CL: –0.1; 3.3). Weight gain ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years occurred with all drugs, but the percentage was generally lower than among the underweight/normal weight cohort. The percentage of patients gaining ≥7% of baseline bodyweight was highest in patients treated with olanzapine (42%, 95% CL: 37; 47), followed by amisulpride (41%, 95% CL: 23; 63) and lowest in patients treated with oral FGAs (26%, 95% CL: 18; 36). Among patients receiving depot FGAs, the percentage of patients who gained ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years was roughly the same in the overweight cohort (40%, 95% CL: 27; 55) and the underweight/normal weight cohort (39%, 95% CL: 26; 54). Weight loss ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years occurred in patients treated with all drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112473789">Figure 2</xref>). The percentage of patients losing ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years was highest and similar for risperidone (13%; 95% CL: 9; 18), quetiapine (13%, 95% CL: 6; 24) and clozapine (13%, 95% CL: 7; 24), and lowest in patients treated with depot FGAs (5%, 95% CL: 2; 15) and amisulpride (5%, 95% CL: 1; 23).</p>

<p>Different patterns of weight, BMI and percentage bodyweight changes occurred in the cohort of patients who were obese at baseline compared with those in the other cohorts.</p>
<p>Analysis of patients who were obese at baseline revealed that mean weight gain at three years did not occur with amisulpride though it was seen with all other drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112473789">Figure 1</xref>). Weight gain in patients treated with the second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) cohorts was lower than in the FGA cohorts. Weight gain was greatest in patients treated with oral FGAs (1.8 kg, 95% CL: –0.8; 4.4), and lowest and similar in patients treated with risperidone (0.4 kg, 95% CL: –1.2; 2.0), quetiapine (0.5 kg, 95% CL: –2.7; 3.7) and olanzapine (0.5 kg, 95% CL: –0.6; 1.6). Weight loss occurred in patients treated with amisulpride (–1.2 kg, 95% CL: –5.9; 3.4). Weight gain ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years occurred in patients treated with all drugs. The percentage was highest in patients treated with depot FGAs (26%, 95% CL: 14; 45) and lowest in patients treated with amisulpride (12%, 95% CL: 3; 39). Weight loss ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years occurred in patients treated with all drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112473789">Figure 2</xref>), but the percentages were generally higher than those observed in the other BMI cohorts. The percentage of patients losing ≥7% of baseline bodyweight at three years was highest for quetiapine (22%, 95% CL: 10; 41) and lowest for depot FGAs (9%, 95% CL: 2; 30).</p>
<p>Comparing across antipsychotics, all weight gain variables were significantly lower in the olanzapine obese cohort than the normal or overweight cohorts. This was not the same for all antipsychotics as the weight changes in the FGA cohorts were similar in the obese and overweight cohorts. In the risperidone cohort weight changes tended to be lower in the obese cohort than other cohorts, and in the amisulpride cohort there was some weight loss in the obese cohort.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This post hoc analysis of data from the two SOHO studies explored mean weight and BMI changes, as well as the percentage of patients experiencing clinically significant weight gain and loss from baseline over three years by drug and by BMI category at baseline. It is acknowledged that the findings from this study are consistent with the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM, discussed below). In addition to RTM, however, baseline BMI continues to be associated with subsequent weight change irrespective of the antipsychotic given. While this has been shown before in short-term studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112473789">Allison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112473789">Gebhardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112473789">Gentile, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112473789">Keck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112473789">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), the data presented here show that baseline BMI remains a factor over three years in a large cohort remaining on their initial monotherapy. Specific findings from this analysis are as follows: 1) Baseline BMI was associated with the degree of weight gain or loss with the various antipsychotics; the same general pattern was seen with all agents; 2) In general, increasing baseline BMI was associated with a smaller mean weight increase, and in the case of amisulpride (the agent associated with the smallest mean weight increase in the full cohort), those who were obese at baseline showed a mean weight decrease; 3) Increasing baseline BMI was associated with a smaller proportion of patients gaining ≥7% baseline bodyweight; 4) Increasing BMI was associated with a greater proportion of patients losing ≥7% baseline bodyweight. These data highlight the importance of baseline characteristics in meta-analyses and systematic reviews.</p>
<p>Our total study cohort had a mean BMI of 25.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and was therefore an appropriate population within which to compare weight change among the BMI cohorts. Considering weight and BMI changes across all three baseline BMI categories, there are a number of differences between the weight changes in the obese cohort and other cohorts. These are exemplified by the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269881112473789">Table 2</xref>. There were significant differences with olanzapine treatment between the obese group and the other baseline BMI categories in all variables and in the risperidone cohort when considering weight gain. Considering weight gain ≥7%, there was a significant difference for clozapine between the obese and the underweight/normal cohorts. Thus, the W-SOHO data show differences between some drugs by baseline BMI; specifically that among patients with olanzapine, risperidone or clozapine treatment, those who were obese at baseline gained less than patients who were not obese at baseline. The data also indicate that olanzapine, the antipsychotic associated with the greatest weight gain, is less likely to be prescribed in patients in an obese BMI class (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112473789">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Data also showed that in the obese cohort weight loss was observed with amisulpride (although patient numbers were low compared with other groups), FGAs (oral and depot formulations) were the only antipsychotics with which significant weight gain was observed, and that there was little weight change in patients receiving olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone.</p>
<p>The trajectories of weight responses showed differences both between individual agents and in accordance with baseline BMI. The rate of weight increase was most marked for patients who were underweight or normal weight at baseline, and the rate of weight loss was most marked for those who were overweight at baseline. For overweight and obese patients there was less evidence of any slowing of the percentage of patients having categorical increases or decreases of ≥7% weight, in contrast to the mean changes that showed a slower rate of weight increase after 12 months. The trajectory of mean weight and BMI changes showed a rapid increase over the initial six to 12 months, with slowing thereafter but with no evidence of a plateau in the normal and overweight cohorts. Few individuals who were overweight or obese receiving depot FGAs lost ≥7% of baseline bodyweight. Mean weight change was greatest in patients receiving oral and depot FGAs in the obese cohort.</p>
<p>The finding that most weight gain and increases in BMI occurred in the first six to 12 months of treatment is in line with previous findings from the EU-SOHO study, including a six-month follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112473789">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>) and a 36-month follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112473789">Novick et al., 2009</xref>). In both these analyses weight gain reached an early plateau with olanzapine in contrast to our finding of continuing weight gain over three years. This discrepancy may be due to the different patient cohorts that were studied. In the six-month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112473789">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>) and 36-month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112473789">Novick et al., 2009</xref>) analyses cohorts were defined by the antipsychotic that was initiated as monotherapy at baseline and the patients were followed for six and 36 months but may have changed antipsychotics during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112473789">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112473789">Novick et al., 2009</xref>). In the present analysis, cohorts were defined by the antipsychotic initiated at baseline and maintained for 36 months. Millen and colleagues also reported that weight gain with olanzapine reached a plateau with some cohorts but did not plateau with others in their analysis of pooled data from 86 clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112473789">Millen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section17-0269881112473789">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The main limitation of the observational SOHO studies is that the groups were not randomized, so the possibility that variables other than the prescribed antipsychotic may have impacted on differences in weight change cannot be excluded. In particular prescribing bias means that patient characteristics may differ among the antipsychotic cohorts though the statistical modeling does attempt to control at least in part for this.</p>
<p>A number of other general limitations should also be taken into account when considering these findings. This was a post hoc analysis, which means that it was an exploratory investigation and the results may be complex to interpret. A variety of models can be used to analyze data and it is not always easy to select a model that provides the most appropriate and accurate presentation of the data. We have presented raw as well as adjusted data to enable the reader to make his or her own interpretation. Another limitation is that both of the SOHO studies were largely composed of patients with established schizophrenia; the results cannot therefore be applied directly to recent-onset patients. It is generally accepted that such patients are more prone to weight gain with a range of antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112473789">Haddad, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A general limitation associated with interpreting observational data is that of RTM, which is the tendency for measurements to move toward the average over time. RTM is a statistical artifact not related to or affected by treatment or disease-related factors; the principle of RTM predicts that greater mean weight change will occur in those individuals with more extreme (high and low) baseline body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112473789">Allison et al., 2009</xref>). As W-SOHO was an observational study, the weight change observed is likely to be a combination of RTM and the potential association with antipsychotic treatment, and the two cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Finally, as this was a completer analysis, the reasons for dropout are unknown, and it must be acknowledged that some patients may have discontinued because of weight gain. However, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the monotherapy cohort and the results were similar to the completers, indicating that dropouts did not bias these results.</p>
<p>By its observational nature there is no placebo control group in our data set and indeed a placebo control would be virtually impossible in a long-term randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with established schizophrenia. As such the observed increase in BMI in this cohort also has to take into account factors other than antipsychotic medication that may lead to an increase in BMI. This is particularly relevant as recent decades have seen an increase in BMI in the general population in most developed countries. In a large Canadian cohort during 1996–2001 men less than 45 years and women less than 55 years were gaining around 0.45 kg/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112473789">Hopman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While the relevance of these limitations is acknowledged, it is important to remember that the SOHO data are unique, representing long-term weight data in a very large cohort.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, among schizophrenia outpatients receiving long-term antipsychotic monotherapy, baseline BMI is associated with subsequent weight change irrespective of the antipsychotic given. Specifically, a smaller proportion of patients gain ≥7% baseline bodyweight, and a greater proportion of patients lose ≥7% baseline bodyweight with increasing baseline BMI. From a clinical viewpoint, these findings may help clinicians and patients understand the degree of long-term weight changes that may occur in individual patients receiving different antipsychotics. In clinical practice patients should receive regular monitoring of weight throughout treatment and be offered advice and appropriate interventions to reduce the risk of weight gain or lead to weight reduction if overweight. Further study is needed to confirm these findings in an RCT setting.</p>
