<abstract>
<p>Agnew’s general strain (1992) theory postulates that negative relationships and negative life events can give rise to delinquency by way of negative emotions, such as anger. However, the factors that might condition the effects of general strain on juvenile delinquency remain unclear. As a result, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011427715">Agnew et al. (2002)</xref> have advocated continued efforts to identify factors that moderate one’s response to strainful experiences. Using data from a national sample of adolescents, the present study responds to their request by examining how the effects of general strain on offending vary according to youths’ level of physical development. The findings suggest that advanced pubertal development may significantly increase the effects of general strain on delinquent outcomes and that these effects may differ by gender. The implications of this conclusion for criminological theory, future research, and policy are discussed.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, Agnew’s (1992) General Strain Theory (GST) has received a considerable amount of attention. The theory postulates that, under certain circumstances, negative relationships and negative life events give rise to delinquency, in part because these experiences engender feelings of anger and frustration that promote delinquent forms of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011427715">Agnew, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011427715">2006</xref>). GST’s focus on the influence of negative relationships and events on delinquency is distinct from other mainstream criminological theories, which have focused instead on the power of positive relationships to either promote or constrain delinquency.</p>
<p>Overall, empirical tests of GST demonstrate a significant relationship between general strain and various delinquent outcomes, providing support for the main tenets of the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011427715">Broidy, 2001</xref>). Additionally, the majority of the GST literature supports the claim that anger at least partially mediates the relationship between the experience of strain and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011427715">Capowich, Mazerolle, &amp; Piquero, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204011427715">Jang &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is much support for the mediating role of anger, scholars have found less empirical support for the role of conditioning variables in the relationship between strain and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011427715">Agnew &amp; White, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011427715">Hoffman &amp; Su, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Piquero, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011427715">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011427715">Paternoster &amp; Mazerolle, 1994</xref>). Because GST considers delinquency to be a form of maladaptive coping, it claims that factors that improve coping strategies or provide coping resources (e.g., self-efficacy, self-esteem, and social support) might attenuate the effects of strain on delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011427715">Broidy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Sealock, 2000</xref>). Similarly, other factors (e.g., low self-control, temperament, and intelligence) might exacerbate the effects of strain on delinquency. Several studies have examined the potential moderating role of these factors. The results of this line of research are mixed at best, although some recent studies reveal conditional effects of strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011427715">Botchkovar, Tittle, &amp; Antonaccio, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011427715">Hay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Mahs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011427715">Moon, Morash, McCluskey, &amp; Hwang, 2009</xref>). It is possible that there are additional important factors that impact coping capabilities and/or resources that are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that one important moderating factor in the strain–crime relationship may be pubertal development. In particular, early pubertal development has been consistently linked to deviant outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011427715">Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, &amp; Silva, 2001</xref>). Moreover, several studies have examined interactions between pubertal development and various social factors in the prediction of offending and have found support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011427715">Caspi, Lynam, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Brezina, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1541204011427715">Smith, Udry, &amp; Morris, 1985</xref>). Still, whether or not early pubertal development and adolescent strain interact to predict delinquent outcomes has yet to be empirically tested.</p>
<p>There are several reasons to suspect that early pubertal development and strain might interact to predict adolescent deviance. Because puberty is a time of pronounced biological change and hormone production accompanied by increasing societal demands, it is reasonable to suggest that pubescent youth may experience greater difficulty managing strain in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). Moreover, negative emotionality (i.e., an irritable and impulsive disposition), which has been linked to hormone levels typical of early puberty, has been found to encourage delinquent reactions to strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011427715">Agnew, Brezina, Cullen, &amp; Wright, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011427715">Ge, Conger, &amp; Elder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1541204011427715">Susman, Dorn, &amp; Chrousos, 1991</xref>). Therefore, if an irritable disposition does indeed encourage maladaptive behaviors (e.g., delinquency) by conditioning reactions to strain, early maturation might have a similar effect by prompting persistent negative emotionality. Additionally, it is possible that the coping resources needed to adequately avoid a criminal response to strain are not as accessible to youth experiencing early pubertal maturation as they are for other youth. For example, pubescent youth may socially isolate themselves from positive coping resources, such as parents and teachers, in an effort to assert their autonomy and prove their maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011427715">Moffitt, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>To the extent that early pubertal development exacerbates strain in the ways outlined, then investigation into the moderating effects of puberty on the association between strain and delinquency is warranted. Thus, the goal of this study is to address a void in the literature by examining whether early pubertal development moderates the effect of adolescent strain on delinquency. This relationship is tested using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). First, the degree to which both strain and the experience of early puberty are predictive of delinquency will be examined. Second, the extent to which early pubertal development conditions the effect of strain on delinquent outcomes will be tested. This study will address the void in the literature (a) by examining the biosocial phenomenon of early pubertal maturation as a potentially important moderator to strain that operates to increase delinquency and (b) by specifying the social factors that matter most in compelling early maturing youth to offend. This study has the potential to clarify <italic>who</italic> is at greater risk of committing deviant acts in response to strain and provide informed hypotheses concerning how this process might unfold.</p>
<sec id="section1-1541204011427715">
<title>General Overview of GST</title>
<p>According to GST, strain can come from several sources. The theory names three categories of strain implicated in delinquent acts: the inability to achieve a goal, the removal of a positive stimulus, and the presentation of a negative stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011427715">Agnew, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011427715">1992</xref>). The theory argues that these three categories of strain can trigger negative emotional states, which can cause people to commit deviant acts. In particular, anger is seen as being especially influential in producing deviant outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011427715">Agnew (1992)</xref> hypothesizes that anger can increase perceived injury, foster a desire to retaliate, lower inhibitions, and energize corrective action. Thus, although other emotions may result from strainful experiences, GST postulates that anger will most likely lead to a deviant response to strain.</p>
<p>GST does not, however, suggest that all strains will invariably result in delinquency. In general, Agnew claims that strain will most often lead to crime in situations that favor the use of delinquent adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011427715">2006</xref>). Specifically, the availability of coping resources (e.g., problem-solving abilities), a disposition toward delinquency, and constraints to delinquent coping (e.g., the absence of opportunities for crime) will all impact the use of delinquent adaptations. Agnew, Brezina, Wright, and Cullen (2001) have also specified four conditions under which strain might be expected to result in crime. They claim that stressors are most likely to lead to crime when they are seen as unjust, are high in magnitude, are low in social control, and create incentives for criminal responses. Agnew has also recently identified the types of strain that best fit these criteria, including physical and verbal abuse, parental rejection, poor school performance, and work-related problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011427715">2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1541204011427715">
<title>Previous Tests of GST and Their Findings</title>
<p>The research on GST is quite extensive. However, individual studies typically do not test all of the tenets of the theory but focus on one or two of its claims. Nevertheless, three broad generalizations can be drawn from the strain literature. First, virtually all studies that have examined the basic relationship between general strain and crime have found supportive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011427715">Brezina, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011427715">Broidy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011427715">Hay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Piquero, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1541204011427715">Robertson, Stein, &amp; Schaefer-Rohleder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1541204011427715">Simons, Yi-Fu, Stewart, &amp; Broidy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1541204011427715">Slocum, Simpson, &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>). These studies have defined strain mostly in terms of various negative life events and relationships. For example, Agnew and White’s (1992) early test examined the effects of several strains, including parental conflict, neighborhood safety, and conflict with adults. The authors found these strains to have a significant positive effect on delinquency and drug use for the adolescents in their sample. More recent tests have expanded the list of strains examined. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron (2004)</xref> examined the effects of various types of abuse and victimization, as well as monetary dissatisfaction, homelessness, and unemployment on delinquent outcomes. He found that several of these strainful experiences, such as property victimization and homelessness, had direct effects on delinquent outcomes.</p>
<p>A second conclusion that can be drawn from the literature is that the effects of general strain on delinquency are at least partially mediated by negative affect, particularly anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011427715">Aseltine, Gore, &amp; Gordon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011427715">Brezina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011427715">Capowich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1541204011427715">Simons et al., 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204011427715">Jang and Johnson (2003)</xref> examined a nationally representative sample of African American adults and found negative affect to completely mediate the relationship between strain and crime. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011427715">Mazerolle and Piquero (1998)</xref> only found partial support for the mediation of anger. Specifically, they found that strain predicted crime by way of anger only when the delinquent outcome was violent (i.e., fighting). Still, the literature generally supports GST’s claim that anger mediates the relationship between strain and crime.</p>
<p>A third conclusion is less clear in its support for GST. The literature provides mixed support for the role of conditioning variables in the strain–crime relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011427715">Agnew &amp; White, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011427715">Botchkovar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011427715">Hoffman &amp; Su, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011427715">Moon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011427715">Paternoster &amp; Mazerolle, 1994</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay and Evans (2006)</xref> found the effects of victimization (classified here as a type of strain) on crime to be greater for those with low self-control. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011427715">Botchkovar, Tittle, and Antonaccio (2009)</xref> found that self-control did not significantly moderate the relationship between general strain and crime in their international sample. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron (2004)</xref> found in several instances that high levels of self-esteem interacted with measures of strain to <italic>increase</italic> delinquent outcomes, which contradicts Agnew’s original hypothesis regarding the protective role of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Sealock, 2000</xref>). Still, the moderating role of other variables, such as delinquent peers, social networks, and negative disposition, has garnered some support in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Mahs, 2000</xref>), despite having received little support in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011427715">Capowich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Piquero, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Such unclear findings have been acknowledged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204011427715">Agnew et al. (2002)</xref> who stated that “there is much uncertainty regarding the factors that condition the effects of strain on delinquency, [which] severely limits the explanatory power of GST” (p. 43, 45). They assert that a consideration of moderating factors is vital since “most forms of strain have only small to moderate effects on delinquency,” implying that only some people react to strain with deviant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al., 2002</xref>, pp. 43–45). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al. (2002)</xref> emphasize that personality traits such as irritability and impulsivity might influence whether or not an individual responds to strain with delinquency. Still, they advocate continued efforts to “identify [additional] factors that influence the reaction to strain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al., 2002</xref>, p. 44). This study is a response to their request in that it considers the moderating role of pubertal maturation, which may condition the strain–crime relationship by way of its influence on personality and temperament.</p>

<title>A Review of the Research on Early Pubertal Development</title>
<p>Early pubertal development has received significant recent attention in criminological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Brezina, 2001</xref>). Pubertal maturation entails bodily changes that facilitate sexual reproduction in humans. Specifically, the onset of puberty brings with it a host of chemical and hormonal changes in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>). In particular, androgen levels significantly increase in males and females, enabling sexual reproduction and the manifestation of secondary sex characteristics (e.g., breast development for females, increased muscle mass for males).</p>
<p>Theoretically, several reasons, both biological and social, have been posited as to why pubertal development might impact delinquent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). First, it is possible that youth who mature early are “faced with developmental tasks that they are not prepared to handle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>, p. 968). These circumstances demand cognitive expertise and emotional regulation which may not be commensurate with the youth’s abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). If such is the case, the onset of puberty could engender stress and maladjustment, which may lead early maturing youth to turn to delinquent coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1541204011427715">Petersen &amp; Taylor, 1980</xref>). Additionally, it is also possible that those who mature early experience a “maturity gap,” where they rebel, and sometimes offend, in an effort to gain autonomy in accordance with their biological development that society and parental figures will not yet permit them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011427715">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Third, the hormonal changes that occur in both males and females influence negative emotionality, such as anger and depression, which may increase the likelihood of delinquent adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011427715">Ge et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1541204011427715">Susman et al., 1991</xref>). Also, the physical changes that occur during maturation may facilitate delinquency through increased opportunity, particularly when these changes occur early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011427715">Ghiglieri, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011427715">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>). For boys, increased muscle mass and aggression-inducing testosterone at an early age may facilitate risk taking and the commission of certain offenses (e.g., assault or robbery), whereas for girls, developed breasts and curvature can facilitate delinquency by making them more apt to associate with older and/or delinquent male peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011427715">Dabbs &amp; Morris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011427715">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1541204011427715">Scerbo &amp; Kolko, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1541204011427715">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>All of the hypotheses mentioned are plausible explanations of the association between pubertal maturation and crime, as they are consistent with the general findings of the early maturation literature. To date, the literature is generally supportive of the puberty–crime relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011427715">Cota-Robles, Neiss, &amp; Rowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Brezina, 2001</xref>). Numerous studies have been conducted indicating a significant effect of early pubertal development on deviant and maladaptive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204011427715">Drigotas &amp; Udry, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011427715">Graber, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Archibald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011427715">Moffitt et al., 2001</xref>). Generally, males who mature early have been found to be more socially dominant, less connected to their families, and more apt to externalize hostile feelings through the use of violence and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011427715">Ge et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011427715">Kim &amp; Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1541204011427715">Tremblay et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson and Haynie (2002)</xref> found that adolescent males who were more physically developed than their peers were more likely to engage in violence, drug use, property crimes, and sexual behaviors. They concluded that the direct effects of pubertal development on delinquency were “comparable in strength to the effects of peer delinquency and school performance” (2002, p. 982). Early maturing females have also been found to be at higher risk for delinquency, as they are more apt to associate with older peer groups and to have greater contact with delinquent peers, which increases their likelihood of offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011427715">Caspi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204011427715">Flannery, Rowe, &amp; Gulley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Several additional studies have found that early pubertal maturation exerts a significant effect on deviant outcomes when interacting with a host of other social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011427715">Caspi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Brezina, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1541204011427715">Smith et al., 1985</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver and Wright (2005)</xref> found that early pubertal development interacted with personality characteristics as well as social variables to predict delinquency. Specifically, negative interactional skills, poor impulse control, and delinquent peers interacted with increased pubertal development to produce deviance in males. For females, however, the effects of pubertal development were much less consequential for offending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver and Wright (2005)</xref> point to the possibility that, in general, early developing males may be more likely to engage in misconduct due to their increased physical strength, surging testosterone levels, and changing self-image revolving around masculinity, and that poor interactional skills and low impulse control likely only contribute to delinquent outcomes further (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011427715">Dabbs &amp; Morris, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation, there is reason to believe that pubertal development, especially when it occurs early relative to one’s peers, is implicated in adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011427715">Dubas, Graber, &amp; Petersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011427715">Moffitt et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, research has indicated that both individual and social factors can impact whether or not youth navigate pubertal development in a prosocial manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011427715">Caspi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Brezina, 2001</xref>). Taking these findings into account, it is reasonable to suggest that the experience of early pubertal maturation could also condition whether or not a youth responds to certain life stressors with delinquent adaptations.</p>

<title>Considering Pubertal Development as a Moderator of General Strain</title>
<p>There are several ways in which early maturation might condition the effects of general strain on crime. Following the lead of previous GST research and in line with GST theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011427715">Agnew, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011427715">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011427715">Broidy, 2001</xref>), it is proposed that early pubertal development may encourage a delinquent response to strain by (a) weakening the coping resources available to the youth, (b) promoting the use of maladaptive coping strategies, (c) increasing the likelihood of interpreting relationships and events as negative and distressing, and/or (d) exacerbating and possible prolonging feelings of anger and frustration in response to strain.</p>
<p>Puberty may weaken the coping resources available to youth in several ways. First, an early maturing youth may be more likely to isolate himself, both physically and mentally, from conventional sources of social support and social control, such as parents and teachers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>). Moreover, youth who mature early will likely experience the maturity gap, in which parents expect the youth to behave like an adult, but do not give him the autonomy commensurate with being an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011427715">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Experiencing such cognitive and emotional dissonance may compel youth to rebel and self-select environments and/or peers that do not provide adequate coping resources, thereby increasing the likelihood of delinquent coping in response to distressing relationships and events.</p>
<p>Puberty may also encourage the use of maladaptive coping strategies in several ways. Physical changes in the body might function to encourage delinquency in a youth experiencing strain. For example, muscle development and elevated testosterone levels in males might elicit a greater disposition toward violent acts, whereas among females, menstruation and breast development may influence sexual precociousness, which is significantly correlated with delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011427715">Dabbs &amp; Morris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204011427715">Flannery et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011427715">McAndrew, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1541204011427715">Mott &amp; Haurin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1541204011427715">Walsh, 2008</xref>). Moreover, puberty may simply exhaust adaptive coping strategies by placing adolescents in scenarios that frequently demand effective decision making and the regulation of sexual urges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). For example, early maturing youth may suddenly find themselves in conspicuous positions of leadership in their peer group, or possibly under pressure from parents to be more responsible and mature than before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). Such demands might not be commensurate with the adolescent’s psychological development. Specifically, the neurons in the frontal lobe, which facilitate higher-order executive functions (e.g., planning, abstraction, self-control), have been neither fine-tuned nor adequately myelinated at the onset of puberty, leaving the frontal lobe underdeveloped until adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011427715">Blakemore &amp; Choudhury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204011427715">Durston et al., 2006</xref>). As a result, early maturing youth feeling pressure from others (i.e., strain) may turn to delinquency to cope.</p>
<p>Apart from exacerbating the impact of objective strains, early pubertal development may cause a youth to interpret a larger proportion of their relationships and experiences as distressing than they otherwise would have. Such interpretations could occur in response to hormonal and neurological changes in the body. Some studies have found an association between increased testosterone production, which occurs in pubescent males, and brain responsiveness to angry facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204011427715">Archer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1541204011427715">van Honk et al., 1999</xref>). This surge in testosterone, and the changes it induces in the male pubescent brain, can lead to frequent misinterpretations of others’ intentions as hostile and/or threatening, which in turn may increase defensive and/or antisocial behaviors in pubescent males (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011427715">Brizendine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011427715">McClure, 2004</xref>). These aggressive reactions may be especially likely in youth experiencing strain, as stressful experiences during puberty have been linked to the diminished capacity of emotional regulation and increased negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1541204011427715">Romeo &amp; McEwen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1541204011427715">Spear, 2009</xref>). Moreover, early maturation has been associated with psychological disorders, including depression, eating disorders, and suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011427715">Graber et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is quite feasible that early maturation might color the way life events and relationships are interpreted by altering brain chemistry.</p>
<p>On a similar note, puberty may exacerbate and/or prolong feelings of frustration and anger in response to strain. There is evidence that links negative affect to advanced maturation and higher androgen levels in young adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011427715">Ge et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1541204011427715">Susman et al., 1991</xref>). Considering that both strain and early pubertal development have been linked to anger and negative affect, it is quite possible that experiencing both strain and early maturation might cause feelings of anger and frustration to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011427715">Aseltine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011427715">Brezina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011427715">Capowich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1541204011427715">Simons et al., 2003</xref>). Such an occurrence may provide specific incentives for delinquency (e.g., an escape from the anger, compensation for the frustration, or satisfaction of a desire to retaliate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these considerations suggest that early pubertal development may increase the effect of strain on delinquency. Specifically, it is proposed that early maturation can potentially function to decrease social controls, minimize coping resources, and increase criminal opportunities and/or incentives. An alternative possibility is that the effects of general strain on delinquency are not conditioned by early pubertal development. It may be that strain and early development only exert significant independent effects on delinquency without exerting any significant interactive effects. If such findings do indeed emerge, one possible explanation might be that factors that occur during the life course prior to puberty may influence an individual’s general personality and disposition, which may be more consequential for coping skills than the experience of early maturation. There has been some research that suggests that periods of stress and change, such as the onset of puberty, may only amplify individual differences that emerge early in the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204011427715">Caspi &amp; Moffitt, 1991</xref>). If this is the case, then early maturation may instead serve as a protective factor for those who are already high in personality traits that are conducive to law-abiding behaviors. Whatever the case may be, the results of the current study have the potential to be of great interest to researchers, as they would represent an initial step in clarifying the variables that are most consequential in conditioning the relationship between strain and crime.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The current article examined the extent to which early pubertal development moderates the relationship between strain and crime. To date, researchers have found mixed support for the conditional effects of such factors as self-control, delinquent peers, and social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011427715">Botchkovar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011427715">Capowich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Piquero, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the strain literature has neglected to examine the role of pubertal development in conditioning adolescents’ response to strain, even though the research on pubertal development has found support for the role of these biological changes in both the psychosocial adjustment and maladaptive behaviors of youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011427715">Cota-Robles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>).

</p>
<sec id="section6-1541204011427715">
<title>Data</title>
<p>To test these hypotheses, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were utilized. Add Health is a nationally representative, longitudinal study of youth in Grades 7 through 12 during the 1994–1995 school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011427715">Bearman, Jones, &amp; Udry, 1997</xref>). The data were collected from 132 randomly selected middle and high schools in the United States. At Wave 1, in-school questionnaires were administered and in-home interviews were conducted. However, during subsequent waves, in-school questionnaires were no longer administered. Overall, more than 90,000 adolescents completed the in-school surveys, with a subsample of 20,745 youth being recruited to participate in the in-home interviews. Adolescent in-home interviews were supplemented by additional interviews with each adolescent’s primary caregiver, which in most cases was the mother.</p>
<p>The present study examines data from the public-use version of the Add Health study (<italic>N</italic> = 6,504) obtained during in-home interviews at the first and second waves of data collection. These data were used to examine the effects of Wave 1 strain and pubertal development on Wave 2 delinquency. A longitudinal design was used in the present study mainly to (a) establish temporal ordering, (b) include the youngest adolescent respondents possible in the analysis for the purpose of detecting early maturation, and (c) control for the effects of prior delinquency. Therefore, while a cross-sectional design may tap the effects of fleeting anger that strain can cause, the advantages of the longitudinal approach outweigh the disadvantages for the purpose of this study. Additionally, there may be reason to suspect that the anger that results from strain may persist under conditions of early maturation. Specifically, strainful experiences might provoke a biological tendency toward irritability/anger (which can occur as a result of early puberty) to manifest itself and to persist for longer than it otherwise would have. If this is the case, a longitudinal design could be used to assess the interactive effects of strain and puberty on delinquency a year later. Additionally, previous research examining strain has employed longitudinal designs, lending credence to the design of the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011427715">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011427715">Johnson &amp; Morris, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the relevance of the timing of puberty in impacting deviant outcomes, the sample for this study is limited to youth of ages 11–15, as these are the ages in which early maturation is most likely to take place (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). With these limits in place, the final sample size consisted of 3,098 participants, roughly 48% of the original sample. The sample contained 1,439 males (46.4%) and 1,659 females (53.6%). Roughly 67% of the sample identified themselves as White, 25% identified themselves as Black, and 11% considered themselves to be of non-White Hispanic origin.</p>

<title>Measures</title>

<title>General Strain</title>
<p>The Add Health data included several items that are particularly well-suited to measuring strain, as they reflect the strains that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew (2001)</xref> claimed have the greatest consequence for delinquency. Agnew postulated that negative relationships and life experiences revolving around the family and peers would be particularly relevant to deviant outcomes. The specific dimensions of general strain that were measured in this study were school problems, victimization, and family strain. Previous criminological research has considered all three of these sources of personal strain and has linked them to a variety of delinquent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011427715">Aseltine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011427715">Hay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011427715">Johnson &amp; Morris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204011427715">Kort-Butler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To construct a composite measure of general strain, 16 items measuring strain were standardized and averaged (α = .75), with higher values indicating greater overall strain. Adolescents were asked how often they had had trouble in the past year in the following areas regarding school: getting along with teachers, getting along with peers, paying attention, and finishing homework. Response categories ranged from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 4 (<italic>everyday</italic>). Additionally, adolescents were asked whether they felt socially accepted at school, with response categories ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Furthermore, in line with Agnew’s emphasis on victimization as a form of strain, the scale also includes items in which respondents were asked about stressful experiences regarding victimizations that they had experienced or witnessed. Specifically, they were asked how often in the past 12 months they had witnessed a shooting or stabbing, been shot or stabbed themselves, had a knife or gun pulled on them, or been “jumped.” Response categories for these items ranged from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 2 (<italic>more than once</italic>), and all items were coded so that higher values correspond to higher strain. Adolescents were also asked whether, in the last 4 weeks, they had argued with their mother about their own behavior (0 = <italic>No</italic>; 1 = <italic>Yes</italic>) and/or with their father about their own behavior (0 = <italic>No</italic>; 1 = <italic>Yes</italic>). Additionally, adolescents were asked how much they wanted to leave home, if they felt their family understood them, how much they felt their mom cared about them, how much they felt their dad cared about them, and how much they felt their parents jointly cared about them. Response categories for these items ranged from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating greater strain.</p>

<p>Several prior studies using the Add Health data have utilized the self-report indicators of male and female development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011427715">Cota-Robles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). The items available in the Add Health data parallel those used in the widely known and reliable Pubertal Development Status scale, where youth self-report concerning their physical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1541204011427715">Petersen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1541204011427715">Petersen, Crockett, Tobin-Richards, &amp; Boxer, 1987</xref>; Peterson &amp; Taylor, 1980). Generally, self-report measures of physical maturation have been found to be highly correlated with physicians’ reports on an adolescent’s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011427715">Brooks-Gunn, Warren, Rosso, &amp; Gargiulo, 1987</xref>). Therefore, the use of these items in tapping pubertal development is warranted, given their desirable measurement features.</p>
<p>In order to measure pubertal development, 4 items measuring physical changes indicative of puberty in males were used, as well as 4 items measuring physical changes indicative of puberty in females. Males in the sample were asked to describe the amount of hair that was on their face and under their arms, how deep their voice had become, and to assess how physically mature they were relative to their male peers of the same age. Each of these measures was standardized and compiled into an averaged index to create a development score for each male in the sample (α = .66). Females in the sample were asked questions regarding their breast development, the curvature of their bodies, as well as whether they had experienced menarche. Additionally, they were also asked to describe their physical maturation relative to their same-aged female peers. The female development index was created in the same manner as the male development index (α = .68). While non self-report, medical measures of pubertal development would have been preferred, the limitations of the data only allow for the use of these items. Still, previous criminological studies have used the same items to examine the effects of physical maturation on criminal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Delinquency</title>
<p>In this study, the outcome variable of delinquency was measured in 1996 at the second wave of data collection. Delinquency was measured using a scale of overall offending and a subscale of violent offending. Overall offending, or total participation in delinquency, was measured with 17 items that asked adolescents about their misconduct, including drug, property, and violent offenses. Adolescents were asked how often in the past 12 months they had engaged in a serious physical fight, participated in a group fight, used or threatened someone with a weapon, pulled a knife or gun on someone, shot or stabbed someone, painted graffiti, damaged another’s property, shoplifted, stolen something worth $50 or more, stolen something worth less than $50, burglarized a building, and/or stolen a car. Response categories ranged from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 3 (<italic>five or more times</italic>), or, in the case of two items measuring serious violence, 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 2 (<italic>more than once</italic>). Furthermore, youth were asked whether in the past 12 months they had used marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, and other illegal drugs. Higher scores correspond to a greater amount of overall participation in delinquency at Wave 2. The index was constructed by standardizing and averaging the responses to all 17 items (α = .84). The subscale of violent offending was measured using 5 items from the overall offending scale that tapped violent delinquency (α = .72). Items were coded so that higher scores were illustrative of greater participation in violent delinquency. The 5 items were standardized and averaged to create a violent offenses index.</p>

<sec id="section11-1541204011427715">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>Several controls were included in the present OLS regression model. In addition to sex, race, and age, the analysis included controls for socioeconomic status (SES), delinquent peers, and supervision to address the possibility of spuriousness. All of the control variables may be correlated with, or directly impact, the experience of strain, puberty, and delinquency, and therefore are included in the model to prevent erroneous results.</p>
<p>SES was measured using 4 items that asked participants whether in the last month they had received financial assistance from Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, unemployment compensation, or housing subsidy/public housing. Response categories were dichotomous, being either 0 (<italic>no</italic>) or 1 (<italic>yes</italic>). All items were recoded to reflect whether the respondent had received any assistance within the previous month, with those who had received any of the four types of assistance being coded as a 1 and those who had received no assistance being coded as a 0.</p>
<p>Additionally, because delinquent peers are consistently found to be one of the strongest predictors of a youth’s participation in deviant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1541204011427715">Warr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1541204011427715">Warr &amp; Stafford, 1991</xref>), the analysis included a standardized delinquent peers index modeled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver and Wright (2005)</xref> that consists of three questions asking respondents whether they have at least three friends who drink alcohol more than once a month, smoke cigarettes, and use marijuana (α = .67). Responses ranged from 0 (<italic>no</italic>) to 1 (<italic>yes</italic>). Items were standardized, compiled, and then averaged to create the index. All items were coded so that higher values on the index correspond to a greater amount of exposure to delinquent peers.</p>
<p>Finally, measures of supervision from the Add Health data were employed to create a supervision scale for the current analysis. Given that the strains considered in this study could be closely related to family social control, there is a risk that any strain–delinquency relationships observed might be a function of varying levels of familial social control experienced by adolescents. It is therefore important to account for family social control with a variable that does not overlap with the concept of family strain. The Add Health data allowed for this with a 3-item measure of family supervision. Participants were asked how often their mother was home when they leave from school, arrive home from school, and go to bed, with response categories ranging from 0 (<italic>always</italic>) to 5 (<italic>never</italic>). The responses from the 3 items were standardized and summed for each participant to create an index that taps the overall lack of maternal supervision in the youths’ households (α = .33). The low Cronbach’s α is not surprising here, since the 3 items are unlikely to be highly correlated. Mothers who are absent in the morning are not necessarily more likely to be absent at the child’s bedtime than mothers who are not absent in the morning. Thus, despite the low α, the items were coded in such a way that higher values on the measure are indicative of a greater lack of supervision.</p>
<p>While the measure likely reflects a lack of supervision, the possibility exists that adequate supervision exists within the household throughout the day, but that it is not coming from the mother specifically. Nevertheless, the measure of supervision did have acceptable face validity, since the questions refer to a caregiver being home to watch the adolescent. Furthermore, the measure was significantly correlated with measures of familial social control (including parent–child bonding) and Wave 1 delinquency in the expected direction (.113, .083, both significant at the .01 level), as theory would predict. While these correlations are not large, they are statistically significant. Therefore, despite the limitations of the supervision measure, it was included in the analysis in order to account for the independent influence of family social control, as other measures of family social control overlapped with concept of family strain and therefore could not be used as control variables.</p>

<title>Main Effects</title>
<p>The initial focus of the analysis was the main effects of general strain and pubertal development on overall offending and violent offending. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204011427715">Table 1</xref>
 displays the results of four regression equations that estimate the direct effects of both pubertal development and strain on overall offending and violent offending for both males and females. The findings from these regression equations suggest strong support for the main effects of general strain on delinquency and mixed support for the main effects of pubertal development on delinquency. First, the results indicated that general strain had a significant positive effect on both violent and overall delinquency. However, the strongest main effects within each gender emerged when the overall delinquency index was regressed on the general strain index for both males and females (β = .292 for males, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01; β = .380 for females, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01). These results suggest that general strain is a significant predictor of both violent and overall delinquency for males and females, net of controls.</p>

<p>Second, the analysis revealed that pubertal development had differential main effects on delinquency for males and females. Male pubertal development was found to be significantly related to delinquency in the predicted direction; that is, higher scores on the male pubertal development index were associated with greater amounts of violent and overall delinquency, net of controls (β = .104 for violent offending, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01; β = .108 for overall offending, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01). Support for the main effects of female pubertal development on delinquency, however, was lacking. Overall, these results seem to suggest that, in terms of main effects, advanced pubertal development at a relatively early age is more consequential for males than for females in producing deviant behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1541204011427715">
<title>Interactions</title>
<p>Following the exploration of the main effects of pubertal development and strain, the analysis turned to examining interactions. Specifically, the joint effects of pubertal development and strain on delinquent outcomes were examined. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204011427715">Table 2</xref>
 displays the results from four distinct regression equations, which test the interactive effects of general strain and pubertal development on violent and overall offending for both males and females. The results lend support to <italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>, which predicts that early pubertal development will significantly increase the effect of general strain on deviant outcomes. For males, this appears to be the case for both violent and overall delinquency, as both coefficients are statistically significant in the predicted direction (β = .093, significant at <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01; β = .059, significant at <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). In short, the results indicate that advanced pubertal development among males exacerbated the effects of general strain on both violent and overall delinquency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204011427715">Figure 1</xref>
).</p>

<p>However, when examining the interactions between female pubertal development and strain, the results were not uniformly supportive. In particular, the findings revealed that advanced pubertal development in females significantly interacted with general strain to increase violent offending (β = .084, significant at <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) but not overall offending. This outcome suggests that the interactions between strain and pubertal development in the cause of female deviance may be contingent on the type of offense.</p>
<p>In sum, these results are supportive of a criminogenic main effect of general strain for both males and females. In addition, the main effect of pubertal development on delinquent outcomes was significant for males but not for females. Furthermore, significant interactions between pubertal development and strain did emerge on several occasions, lending support to <italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>. However, these interactions were more abundant for males, lending support to <italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>. In particular, general strain interacted with advanced pubertal development to increase violent and overall offending among males, whereas for females, a significant interaction emerged only in the case of violent offending.</p>
<p>Therefore, for both genders, early pubertal development significantly increased the effect of general strain on violent offending in particular. This provides partial support for <italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>. While the interaction between male development and general strain was significantly predictive of violent delinquency, the interaction was also significant in the case of overall offending. Therefore, influential moderating effects of male pubertal development on the strain–crime relationship were not limited to violent offenses, leaving <italic>Hypothesis 3</italic> only partially supported. Moreover, although a significant interaction was found in the case of males, the moderating effect of pubertal development on the relationship between general strain and violent offending may or may not be operating through the hypothesized mechanisms of physical strength and surging testosterone levels, since a similar interaction was found for females who do not experience the same biological changes as a result of puberty.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Agnew’s GST has inspired numerous researchers to test the impact of negative relationships and events on deviant behaviors, with the vast majority finding support for the criminogenic impact of life strains on deviant outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011427715">Broidy, 2001</xref>). However, there is much less empirical clarity regarding the factors that might condition the effects of strain on delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011427715">Botchkovar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011427715">Hoffman &amp; Su, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011427715">Moon et al., 2009</xref>). Agnew himself has emphasized the need for research examining a broader array of moderating factors that influence the way individuals respond to strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al., 2002</xref>). The current study is an attempt to address that gap in the literature. Specifically, the present analysis examines the conditioning effect of a biosocial variable, early physical maturation, in the relationship between general strain and crime. In doing so, four key conclusions emerged. Each of the conclusions is discussed below, along with its implications for future research.</p>
<p>The first key conclusion of the present study was that, consistent with GST and prior research, general strain significantly increased delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011427715">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011427715">Broidy, 2001</xref>). In particular, general strain at Wave 1 increased violent and overall offending at Wave 2 for both males and females, despite controlling for age, race, SES, supervision, and delinquent peers. This finding speaks to the robustness of the effect that general strain has on various delinquent outcomes, as the most well-known correlates of crime, including delinquent peers, were included in the model as control variables.</p>
<p>The second key conclusion of the study was that early pubertal development had differential main effects on male and female delinquency. Specifically, the role of early maturation in the production of deviant behavior was partially supported, with advanced development being generally predictive of deviant outcomes for males only. Therefore, the present study suggests that early maturation may impact males and females differently, and that such differences may be implicated in delinquent behaviors. This particular finding differs from some of the previous research on development and delinquent involvement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011427715">Graber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie (2003)</xref> suggests that the effect of female pubertal development on delinquency may be indirect, being largely mediated by associations with delinquent peers. Therefore, it is possible any indirect effect of female development in the current study may have been attenuated by the inclusion of the delinquent peers control variable.</p>
<p>The third key conclusion of the current study was that advanced pubertal development in males significantly increased the criminogenic effects of general strain. Specifically, general strain interacted with early development in males to produce significant increases in violent offending and overall offending. These findings suggest that, in the presence of an accumulation of strains (i.e., general strain), males who experience puberty early are particularly prone to delinquent coping. Additionally, the findings seem to suggest that early maturing male adolescents who experience greater amounts of strain may be particularly likely to exhibit violent behaviors, as opposed to nonviolent delinquent behaviors, in response to such strain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204011427715">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth key conclusion of the study was that advanced pubertal development in females significantly increased the effects of strain on violent offending only. That is, while strain and advanced development interacted to increase violent and overall offending in males, such effects for females were limited to violent offenses. The exact reasons for this are not clear. However, if both pubertal development and general strain contribute to the accumulation of pervasive negative emotions, anger in particular, then violent behaviors might be especially suited for coping, as they provide an escape from the anger, compensation for the frustration, or the satisfaction of retaliatory desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>). Moreover, while other forms of delinquency may denote externalizations of anger, violent delinquency has most frequently been understood as a product of anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204011427715">Anderson &amp; Bushman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011427715">Mazerolle &amp; Piquero, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1541204011427715">Scarpa &amp; Raine, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In noting these four conclusions, some limitations to the current analyses should be taken into account. First, the present study was not able to consider some forms of deviant coping that may be especially common among females (e.g., self-harm and/or eating disorders). It is possible that female development may play a greater role in forms of deviant coping that were not measured in this study. Therefore, the limited effects of female maturation and its interactive effects with strain may reflect an inability to address the noncriminal forms that their deviant coping may take.</p>
<p>A second limitation of the study was the inability to examine additional strains that might be especially consequential for delinquency. The present analysis may have benefited from supplemental strains, particularly exposure to parental abuse and neglect, homelessness, and abusive peer relations (e.g., bullying; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011427715">Agnew, 2001</xref>). While the limited number of strains is a weakness of the current study, the strains that were employed in the analysis cover several life domains, including both school and home, making them generally well-suited for the analysis.</p>
<p>A third limitation of the study is that it does not explore the various pathways that might better explain <italic>how</italic> early maturation and general strain interact to impact deviant behaviors. Therefore, the interpretation of the results does not, with certainty, provide any information regarding the extent to which the direct effects of development, as well as its interactive effects with strain, are a function of hormonal imbalances, negative emotions, cognitive/neurological factors, or social responses to bodily changes, and whether these intermediary functions differ by gender. The inclusion of such variables would undoubtedly address important unanswered questions about the relationship between early puberty and deviance. Still, this study is the first to test and provide initial support for the interactive effects of strain and early development on crime.</p>
<p>In light of both the findings and the limitations of the present analysis, future research should seek to replicate the current study using different samples of teens and additional measures of strain (e.g., parental abuse, neglect, and homelessness). Moreover, future research must address mediating processes in order to lend more empirical credence to the relationship between early puberty and delinquency. While this study provides support for such theoretical relationships, it does not test them directly. Therefore, even though the findings of the present study provide initial support for the importance of physical development in predicting criminal behavior under strainful conditions, how and why strain and puberty interact to predict offending remains relatively unclear, since very few studies have examined the empirical validity of the hypotheses linking pubertal development to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011427715">Felson &amp; Haynie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011427715">Haynie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011427715">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is vital for future research to examine why and how early development differentially impacts female and male delinquency, both directly and under conditions of general strain.</p>
<p>Additionally, future research could benefit from the examination of other variables that might moderate the relationship between general strain and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011427715">Beaver &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011427715">Caspi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011427715">Piquero &amp; Brezina, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1541204011427715">Smith et al., 1985</xref>). Although this study garnered some support for the role of pubertal development in conditioning the effects of strain on deviance, it is crucial that other variables that have yet to be examined as moderators be considered, in order to increase the explanatory power of GST.</p>
<p>Finally, the present study has notable implications for policy makers, parents of youth, and school administrators, as it clarifies the context in which early maturing youth would be more likely to turn to delinquency. Generally, the current findings support the use of programming to educate school administrators, teachers, staff, and parents on the joint risks of early puberty and strain. Once informed, school employees and parents can find ways to minimize the exposure of early maturing youth to strains in their respective social spheres and provide emotional support to these youth in the wake of strain. Such programs could facilitate discussion between parent and child and allow parents to take steps to regulate the emotional and social turmoil that accompanies the experience of puberty. Moreover, adults who work in school settings could be instructed to be vigilant of youth who both experience puberty early and are exposed to a variety of strains, as these youth may be particularly prone to endanger others by acting out in violent ways. Through effective programming and parent–school cooperation, it may be possible to prevent instances of violent delinquency committed by early maturing youth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all types of people do not invariably react to strain in the same manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011427715">Agnew et al., 2002</xref>). Early pubertal development constitutes a critical individual change that conditions the way individuals respond to their social world, particularly when that world is replete with strainful experiences. This study revealed that individual differences in human development and biology can structure reactions to general strain. In short, the findings of the present study strongly suggest that biological processes, such as puberty, are deeply interconnected with several dimensions of the adolescent social experience and should be more frequently examined to better understand the role of biosocial interactions in the production of deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011427715">Beaver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011427715">Iervolino et al., 2002</xref>). The results also lend additional support and credence to the recent emphasis in criminology on human development and life course processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1541204011427715">Piquero, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1541204011427715">Sampson &amp; Laub, 1993</xref>). The physical and biological changes that occur with the onset of pubertal development may be particularly consequential for delinquency because they invariably occur at some point during adolescence: a time of precariousness and general social turmoil. Furthermore, when these biological changes play out relatively early, they may have more power to engender maladaptive responses to strain in general. The findings of the present study suggest that a continued focus on both biosocial processes and within individual changes in strain at critical periods of the life course is vital in understanding why youth turn to deviance when they do.</p>
