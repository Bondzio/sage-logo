<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore neonatal nurses’and mothers of preterm infants’experiences of daily challenges. Interviews took place asking for good, bad and challenging experiences. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis and findings were clustered in two categories: good and challenging experiences, each containing three themes. The good experiences were: managing with success as a nurse, small things matter for mothers, and a good day anyhow for mothers and nurses. The challenging experiences were: mothering in public, being pulled between responsibilities, and adverse things stick under the nurses’skin. The study shows that small daily clinical matters become big issues and could lead to moral distress, and that nurses integrate ethics of justice and ethics of care while mothers are concerned about health and well-being of their specific infant only. The challenge for nursing to integrate fairness and sensitive care in family-oriented neonatal care is discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the decades, neonatal nursing has developed within a paradigm of caring for ever smaller infants and their parents, most often mothers. In this paradigm, based on developmental and family-oriented care principles,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412101">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011412101">2</xref>

</sup> Mothers greatly participate in the daily care of their neonates,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011412101">6</xref>
</sup> often in crowded environments not always designed to house parents.<sup>

</sup> Nurses know what is appropriate but circumstances might make it hard to do the right thing. Small clinical episodes can become large issues for mothers but be invisible for busy nurses. This article addresses what matters for nurses and mothers of preterm infants in the neonatal ward. We wanted to know about their good, bad and challenging experiences.</p>
<p>Literature documents that neonatal nurses have an ethical demand to attend to the mother-infant dyad through a challenging time,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412101">9</xref>
</sup> but may be more or less morally distressed depending on work environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011412101">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412101">11</xref>
</sup> A major aspect of nursing care is to promote confidence in the mothers for successfully taking over full responsibility of their infant’s care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011412101">12</xref>
</sup> Simultaneously, nurses may perceive themselves as the experts,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011412101">4</xref>
</sup> making the parents feel that the infant belongs to the hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412101">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412101">13</xref>
</sup> Nurses are affected when caring for dying infants,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412101">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412101">15</xref>
</sup> when participating in decision making concerning life and death,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011412101">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011412101">17</xref>
</sup> working with incompetent colleagues,<sup>

</sup> experiencing frequent work alterations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412101">19</xref>
</sup> or balancing boundaries in the mother-nurse relationship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412101">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412101">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Research demonstrates that mothers of preterm infants are often taken by surprise when giving birth; they are overwhelmed in encountering professionals and technology in foreign environments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011412101">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412101"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011412101">22</xref>
</sup> The mothers are uncertain, tired and distressed. They are afraid to lose the infant, balancing between hope and anxiety and pulled between responsibilities in hospital and home.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412101">23</xref>
</sup> In this emotional turmoil, mothers are vigilantly watching over and protecting their baby and they trust in the healthcare professionals that their infants get the very best care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412101">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412101"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011412101">26</xref>
</sup> Thus, research documents that mothers and nurses face considerable ethical challenges in neonatal care. Varied ethical perspectives are at stake in carrying out the best care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412101">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412101">28</xref>
</sup> As nursing care is contextual and little was found about ethical challenges in a Danish neonatal context, a study seemed relevant. To provide quality neonatal nursing care, further knowledge is needed of what seems right for nurses and mothers of preterm infants in family-oriented neonatal care. Making those everyday incidents visible allows development of sensitivity to the variety of ways mothering in neonatal care is perceived. This knowledge might enhance responsiveness to particular urgent everyday needs.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore nurses’and mothers of preterm infants’experiences of daily ethical challenges in neonatal care. The study is part of a comprehensive study concerning nurses’and families’experiences in the neonatal unit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412101">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412101">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412101">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011412101">29</xref>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0969733011412101">
<title>Design and setting</title>
<p>A qualitative descriptive design was chosen using semi-structured interviews.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412101">32</xref>
</sup> The methodology was inspired by Sandelowski who acknowledges the qualitative descriptive approach as comparable to phenomenology, grounded theory and ethnography, but without requiring researchers to move into highly abstract rendering of data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011412101">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The setting was a neonatal ward located at an 18 bed level II–III university hospital in west Denmark. About 60 nurses were employed at the ward. Nurses employed were recently introduced to the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412101">1</xref>
</sup> Mothers were offered to stay in family rooms located close to the ward and were encouraged to have early skin-to-skin contact with their infants. Each patient room had four to eight incubators or cots and appeared quiet in spite of the presence of parents, nurses and other healthcare professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733011412101">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants were five mothers and seven female nurses, all Danish and purposively selected to get a heterogeneous sample.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011412101">34</xref>
</sup> Participant mothers were between 20 and 35 years old, four were married or cohabiting and for four, this was their first baby. The infants were born before 32 gestational weeks due to growth retardation, preeclampsia or spontaneous delivery. One mother had twins of which one died at birth. Participant nurses had a median age of 38 (range 27–52). Four had worked in the unit two years or less, the other three for more than 10 years. All mothers and nurses contacted agreed to participate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733011412101">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Mothers and nurses were interviewed in a conference room at the unit or in the mothers’homes. The interviews lasted for about 60 minutes and followed a semi-structured interview guide containing questions of ethical and existential character. To obtain an in-depth knowledge of the main issue of the study, repeated interviews were planned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412101">32</xref>
</sup> Mothers were to be interviewed twice during the infant’s hospital stay, again three months later and finally when their infant was one year old. Because one mother was discharged after the first interview and then not able to be contacted, and another mother turned down to participate after the third interview, 16 of the planned 20 interviews were completed. Nurses were planned to be interviewed twice, a couple of months apart. Due to extensive workload, the second interview was postponed several times and finally given up for three of the nurses. Thus, 11 of the 14 planned interviews were completed. All interviews were done by the first author who opened each interview asking ‘Tell me what it is/was like to be a mother/a nurse in the neonatal unit’. For the purpose of this study nurses and mothers were asked to narrate good, bad and challenging experiences. During the interview the author consciously created a loving and kind atmosphere, listened sensitively and encouraged the participants to elaborate on their experiences. All interviews were completed with the question, ‘Is there anything more you want to tell?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733011412101">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>To secure integrity of the participants, the study was designed according to Ethical Guidelines for Nursing Research in the Nordic Countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011412101">35</xref>
</sup> The hospital and the unit manager approved the study and information meetings were held with the staff. A third person, not involved in the study, contacted the participants who after agreement were given written and verbal information about the aim of the study, the right to withdraw, and the guarantee of confidentiality of the information given to the researcher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011412101">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>For the purpose of this study we analysed data according to qualitative content analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011412101">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011412101">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011412101">37</xref>
</sup> First, and as a result of earlier readings of the full data material, we pulled out data referring to good, bad and challenging experiences and other ethical matters and repeatedly read those as new data sources. Second, we developed analysis guides to structure the findings containing these experiences focusing on meanings, intentions, consequences and context.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011412101">37</xref>
</sup> We moved back and forth between data and the analysis guides, refining and validating the findings and extracting rich quotes to illustrate the findings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011412101">33</xref>
</sup> In this process we clustered data into two categories, good and challenging experiences, each encompassing three themes. All through this process we were aware of our preunderstanding from being mothers, paediatric nurses and researchers in the field, as prerequisites for the knowledge searched for. We were open and temporarily kept our prerequisites in abeyance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733011412101">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>All participants narrated good and challenging experiences. The good experiences were clustered into the themes ‘managing with success as a nurse’, ‘small things matter for mothers’and ‘a good day anyhow for mothers and nurses’. The challenging experiences were clustered into the themes ‘mothering in public’, ‘being pulled between responsibilities’and ‘adverse things stick under the nurses’skin’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733011412101">
<title>Good experiences</title>
<sec id="section10-0969733011412101">
<title>Managing with success as a nurse</title>
<p>
<bold>‘</bold>Managing with success as a nurse’ refers to the nurses’feelings of adequacy, satisfaction and joy when clinical and ethical decision making turned out well. A good experience for the nurse was to make the mothers feel maternally confident. The nurses knew that when support was given to the mothers, care was indirectly given to the children. Then mothers felt safe and more capable of caring for their child. Likewise, good nursing care for the child translated into good nursing care for the parents. One nurse stated: ‘You are there caring for the child and giving the parents the best start as possible together with this child, even if this [the premature birth] wasn’t exactly what they were planning for’.</p>
<p>A successful good experience for the nurse was when an infant managed to suck at her mother’s breast, recovered from a life-threatening condition, or managed to live, following a special care plan. Nurses likewise felt they made things succeed when they skillfully dealt with worried parents, when they managed to establish partnership with the parents so they could ‘walk together’ giving the parents a dignified stay at the hospital and discharge a healthy mother-infant dyad. Just to get a thank you from the parents gave the nurse a warm feeling; it was a ‘pat on the shoulder’ or a ‘bouquet of flowers’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733011412101">
<title>Small things matter for mothers</title>
<p>‘Small things matter for mothers’means that mothers emphasized how meaningful small everyday matters were in experiencing health and wellbeing for the infant and themselves. Being in a neonatal ward makes me near-sighted, as one mother put it. Their attention was solely on their infant, what happened in the outside world was irrelevant. The mothers were vigilant watching any bit of progress involving the child. Thus, small everyday things became substantive matters for the mothers. Good experiences for a mother could be to make eye contact with the nurse, ‘even on busy days’, or it could be the little time the nurse spent chatting with the mother. One mother stated:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s nice when they take time to sit down and talk to us. There’s time to ask all possible questions that I’m sure we’ve asked a million times. Just that they sit there and talk about our child and us, you feel that they want to. It’s really nice.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The mothers were concerned with how the nurses cared for their child; they appreciated when the nurses talked to the child as to a normal little person and not to a sick baby. One mother described how breastfeeding could be a good experience when a considerate nurse assisted her:<disp-quote>
<p>The nurse said, ‘You know what? I think your daughter is rooting. Have you tried breastfeeding her? You should try that…’ There was something about the way she said it and the way she acted. She was able to convince me. She found pillows and blankets and positioned them for me and told me how I was supposed to do it… She guided me through it without completely taking over. It was just a really great experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The quote illustrates that the nurse was experienced, involved and sensitive. The relationship between the mother and the nurse was harmonious. Thus, a seemingly small thing, such as the caring way the nurse assisted during breastfeeding, was a great experience for the mother. She felt cared for.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733011412101">
<title>A good day anyhow for mothers and nurses</title>
<p>‘A good day anyhow for mothers and nurses’refers to efforts to arrange the day in the best way possible for mothers and nurses confronted with many situations. Two days were never the same and the participants handled these situations in the best way possible. One mother stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Each nurse has her way of doing things. That’s just the way it is, and it can never be 100 per cent the same, because there will always be small gradients in how you do things. When it’s this nurse, then we do it this way, because the other nurse is off today. How you pick up your child depends a little on which nurse is standing beside you. Because they’ll say, ‘I think you should actually do it like this’, and then you do it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Just as the nurse on duty could give the mother a good day, the mother could make the nurse have a good day. The nurses realized that the mothers’good days were meaningful for them too. One nurse described it like this:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s nice to come home and be ‘filled up’, knowing I have seen that the parents have had a good day. Maybe it started out rough, but we were together, or you helped them find a solution that made it a good day after all. Then I feel that I’m going home filled up instead of empty. Sometimes it isn’t the children, but the parents that fill me up.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>During a day in a neonatal ward there are constant changes, big and small, with the children and the parents; some are good changes and some are bad. Each situation might be different from the next and there were many ways to make a day a good experience.</p>

<sec id="section13-0969733011412101">
<title>Challenging experiences</title>
<sec id="section14-0969733011412101">
<title>Being pulled in different directions</title>
<p>‘Being pulled in different directions’refers to mothers’and nurses’feelings of being in a middle position between tasks and responsibilities; they had to choose one or the other and that could be energy draining. A mother of three stated: ‘Something that has given me a surplus was to be allowed to get home to my big children, see that they were doing well and being able to sleep at home. That has given me lots of new strength’. This mother was pulled between the newborn preterm infant and her older children at home who missed her immensely.</p>
<p>In a way, being a new mother and being a newly employed nurse was comparable. Both required adjustments and were experienced as challenging. One nurse told about being newly employed:<disp-quote>
<p>There was lack of structure. No solid guidelines. Lots of the nurses who have been here for years have their own opinion on things… As a new employee it was difficult to know whom to listen to or if you should do what you yourself considered the right things to do.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This novice nurse wanted to do the right thing and felt insecure when clear guidelines were missing, not knowing what rules and routines to follow. More experienced nurses knew that they had to make decisions and reflect on care situations all the time. Being pulled in different directions was a part of nursing you had to learn to accept. The smallest matter could make a difference. One nurse described it like this:<disp-quote>
<p>The small care dilemmas are there all the time. They are small, but become so meaningful because they are so many, so often and so common… It takes time and space to discover the small things that mean so much. There are so many small – seemingly small things – and that’s why it’s so meaningful.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This experienced nurse could not point at a specific challenging experience; she felt that she made ethical decisions every day. The frequency of the small decisions made them so meaningful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0969733011412101">
<title>Mothering in public</title>
<p>‘Mothering in public’ refers to the challenge of being a mother among other mothers and lots of staff. The mothers stayed in parent rooms but felt as though they were mothering their tiny infant in public in the ward. Lack of privacy for crying, being by yourself with the infant, or just being a mother to a frail preterm infant in a ward filled with people could be too much. Feelings were labile and hard to hold back and it felt strange to cry in public. Breastfeeding was a major mothering issue and was a challenge to do in public without support of a considerate nurse. One mother told about such an experience:<disp-quote>
<p>I asked a nurse to help me with breastfeeding. And she said I was just supposed to fold the blanket. I sat there and struggled and had to constantly ask for assistance. Eventually we were able to position my daughter, but I was very uncomfortable, and my daughter was uncomfortable, and no one paid attention to all the wires, so the alarms kept going off, and my daughter started crying, and it was just pathetic, stupid and unnecessary. Then the nurse left to help another mother. So I sat there and struggled and her pacifier fell, then her blanket fell on the floor, and I felt terrible and thought it was obvious that I needed help and support.</p>
</disp-quote>Lack of private moments with their infants likewise could give mothers a feeling that the baby belonged to the hospital. At the interview a year after the birth one mother said: ‘I do not have a clear picture of me and my daughter. Looking back, there are always other people in the picture, never privacy, always someone looking over your shoulder’. Not until she got home did this mother feel as if the baby was hers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0969733011412101">
<title>Adverse things stick under the nurses’skin</title>
<p>‘Adverse things stick under the nurses’skin’ refers to undesirable episodes that happened because of busyness in the ward. One nurse was touched by how lack of care, when transferring a family to a new ward under short notice, was traumatic for the parents even if the infant was stable and the situation was due to an acute shortage of beds in the ward. She stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I think that the soothing they should have had, the care they should have had, empathy for the situation, it just wasn’t there. It was unpleasant to witness something that could have gone so smoothly and quietly. It was just unacceptable. And I used a lot of time afterwards mending the situation. It’s going to make a lasting impression on the parents.</p>
</disp-quote>The nurses were ill at ease when not being able to cooperate properly with colleagues, when the tone in the unit was harsh and unpleasant, when sensing the parents did not confide in them or when being on a side-line in regard to the care of the neonate. It was unpleasant to be behind schedule not managing tasks on time, such as giving medicine or being confronted with troublesome demands. The worst thing, however, was when a baby died; it left a lifetime memory.</p>

<sec id="section17-0969733011412101">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Seven nurses’and five preterm mothers’good and challenging experiences were identified through semi-structured interviews. The findings demonstrated that health and well-being of the infant was a central issue and that nurses and mothers were pulled between responsibilities, and so to speak were living in different worlds. When we talk about ‘world’ here we think of the collected term used by Benner and Wrubel, ‘. . . the fusion of temporality, concerns, and the situation’(p.413).<sup>

</sup> The mothers’world was narrow concerning the here-and-now; the nurses’world was broader involving past, present and future in a more general sense.</p>
<p>From an ethical point of view it was natural that mothers’and nurses’worlds appeared varied. The two had different moral responsibilities; the mothers’responsibility being personal; the nurses’responsibility being professional. Thus, mothers were morally driven by ethics of care while nurses with their professional responsibility were governed by an integration of ethics of justice and ethics of care.</p>
<sec id="section18-0969733011412101">
<title>Ethics of justice and ethics of care</title>
<p>Ethics of justice refers to ethical decision making that builds on fairness and equality based on universal rules and impartiality. In a justice perspective, autonomy, objectivity and a positivistic rationality are guiding norms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011412101">39</xref>
</sup> These norms assert that one considers the needs of others’objectively and that moral agents treat individuals in an institution with equal dignity no matter of one’s relationship to the other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412101">28</xref>
</sup> In the health care context ethics of justice is, or should be, inextricably linked to ethics of care in a constant interaction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011412101">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011412101">41</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ethics of care refers to involvement, empathy and maintaining of harmonious relationships. In an ethics of care perspective, concepts such as holism, context and communicative rationality are defining attributes. The care is particular, taking into consideration the specific needs of a specific patient in a specific situation independent of universal principles and rules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412101">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011412101">39</xref>
</sup> Thus, ethics of care is need-centred and closely related to ethics of proximity, a perspective of ethics in which the caregiver’s emotional capacities of sensitivity, clinical wisdom and moral competency are essential, and moral sensibility is a condition for clinical wisdom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733011412101">42</xref>
</sup> Obligations related to relationships, time and space constitute proximity to patient and relatives. Ethics of proximity belongs to moral philosophy, not as a clear perspective of ethics, rather it builds on several positions and debates in contemporary moral philosophy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733011412101">42</xref>
</sup> Ethics of care and ethics of justice could be seen as two poles but also as two complementary perspectives in ethical decision making in the world of health care. The two ethical perspectives mutually restrict one another and their conflicting moral claims impinge on both mothers and nurses.<sup>

<title>The mother’s narrow world</title>
<p>When staying at the hospital, the mothers’whole world concerned the health and well-being of <italic>their</italic> vulnerable and preterm infant. Their world then was narrow. The world circled around their infant. In previous research parents have called this ‘an alien world’ filled with wilderness and without landmarks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011412101">29</xref>
</sup> In this alien world the mothers of this study saw every reaction of their infant; they were attentive of whatever small thing that happened. According to Watson,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733011412101">43</xref>
</sup> referring to ethics of proximity, caring and love beget caring and compassionate acts of love. In caring moments, caring and love beget healing for self and others. Then, and from an ethic of proximity aspect, the mothers were sensitive and loving, thus demonstrating a genuine caring that could be healing for both themselves and their babies. Likewise, parental love is a basic permanent parental condition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733011412101">44</xref>
</sup> In this study the challenges of parental love was evident with a mother of three who had one child in hospital and two at home. This mother was pulled in different directions, the home and the hospital, wanting to love and care for all of her children simultaneously. The word love (in Danish kærlighed) was not mentioned by mothers or nurses. Rather, parental love was indirectly present when nurses talked about the great experience of discharging a competent mother-infant dyad. The question is, can a mother be competent and vigilant for her infant’s vague signs of well-being and discomfort without loving her child? The parental <italic>role</italic> might be threatened when a child is hospitalized because others temporarily take over tasks of care, but the parental love is present and is reinforced through proximity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733011412101">45</xref>
</sup> The mothers of this study were close to their infants, caring and nurturing them daily.</p>
<p>During the long hospital stay the mothers also learnt that each nurse had a certain way of doing things. When the nurse on duty said ‘I think you should do it like this’the mother did so even if the nurse the day before handled her baby differently. For the mother, the care of the infant took place on the nurses’terms and the mother did not seem to matter. As in previous research,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733011412101">46</xref>
</sup> the mothers felt cared for when nurses took their time, saw them and understood what mattered for them.</p>
<p>The patient rooms were constructed more for surveillance of the infants than for private family moments. Lack of privacy could make a mother feel that the baby was not really hers. Mothering in public was a challenge; it was under surveillance not only from the staff but also from fellow mothers. All mothers were showing themselves and listening to the others’crying, upsets or anger. This finding confirms earlier research that in hospital privacy is a scarce commodity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733011412101">47</xref>
</sup> Privacy as understood outside the hospital is commonly violated. When in hospital, bodies and feelings are exposed, space is shared and information is given in public. As was seen in this study, lack of privacy negatively influenced the proximity between mothers and infants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0969733011412101">
<title>The nurses’broader world</title>
<p>The nurses’world concerned health and well-being in a broad sense. It might be that the nurses attended to the particularities of single mother-infant dyads but their responsibility had a broader focus. The nurses’professional accountability concerned that patients and relatives were treated fairly. It would even be unethical if the nurse favoured one for the other. In a caring way the nurses were affirming parental love when helping mothers nurture their infant; and this caring creates possibilities because it sets up what matters, what counts as stressful and what options are available for coping in the situation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011412101">38</xref>
</sup> However, it seems to us that the nurse, who the mother talks about in the bad experience of breastfeeding, was un-caring. ‘I asked a nurse’ the mother said, just referring to anyone who happened to pass by. This nurse was not involved in the situation; a harmonious relationship between mother and nurse was missing. The nurse’s mind seemed to be somewhere else; she helped a little and then hurried on to the next mother without sensing that this mother still needed help. The sensitive and caring concern was in the background in favour of being fair, dividing time equally between mothers. From an ethics of care perspective the nurse did not respond to this mother’s situational need. It might be that the nurse had an awareness of the meaning of caring and was what Watson calls a ‘caritas nurse’, able to combine caring and love,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733011412101">43</xref>
</sup> but she needed to cultivate her caritas literacy; she needed to develop the ability to read the fields of others, be present and do a little extra for others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733011412101">48</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The nurses narrated that they could be morally distressed. It was distressing to watch a newborn baby die, not being able to prevent anything. It was unpleasant to witness situations that distressed the parents and that could have gone smoothly if caring for the parents had been considered. Nurses felt uneasy when the collaboration among members of the team did not function optimally. Adverse matters were difficult to forget; they were incorporated into the nurses’memory<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011412101">38</xref>
</sup> and created feelings of inadequacy. Theoretically, anything interfering with a nurse’s ability to provide optimal care has the potential to create moral distress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733011412101">49</xref>
</sup> The distress might be due to the fact that nurses as healthcare professionals oscillate between two poles of ethics, ethics of justice and ethics of care trying their best to integrate these ethical perspectives in their daily decision making.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011412101">39</xref>
</sup> Neonatal nurses are accountable in an ethical practice of care and justice; they are accountable for a care that fairly facilitates well-being and alleviates suffering of children and families, and at the same time they are assigned to take special care of some of these children and families. The challenge of integrating these two ethical perspectives was visible also in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The intension of this study was to investigate what is inherent in good, bad and challenging experiences in neonatal care. Important aspects of the study were that mothers and nurses lived in different worlds because the mothers had a personal responsibility and the nurses had a professional responsibility. The mother’s world concerned love and care of <italic>her</italic> infant, she worried about matters, however small, that challenged her child specifically. The nurses’world was broader, encompassing care of the individual as well as fair care for all. The nurses’world integrated ethics of justice and ethics of care, while the mothers’world was based on ethics of care. The nurses worried about both specific and general matters, the mothers about specific personal matters.</p>
<p>Validity of this study was sought through the authors’engagement with the data, presenting the analysis process in detail and attempting to arrange meaningful themes coherently.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412101">32</xref>
</sup> Quotes were used as validity tools to illustrate the findings. Generalization in qualitative studies concerns drawing broad conclusions from particular instances and whether the new knowledge can provide a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon in other contexts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412101">32</xref>
</sup> This study is an example of experiences among some nurses and mothers of preterm infants in a neonatal unit. Generalizing of the findings outside this context should be done with caution. In spite of this the findings have potential to add to the knowledge base of nursing. Categorization and themes contribute to a certain analytical generalization; they might be valid in other Danish nursing contexts and in neonatal cultures where nursing care is similar to what was found in this study. The findings provide support for further research in this area including a deeper knowledge of the ethical climate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733011412101">50</xref>
</sup> in neonatal care. Studying small ethical issues among parents increases nursing knowledge of what matters for parents. Such research can facilitate identification of invisible matters in neonatal care and enhance strategies of interventions to ameliorate their effects.</p>
