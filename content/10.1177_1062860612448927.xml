<abstract>
<p>The goal was to implement and evaluate an experimental and longitudinal team-based curriculum in quality improvement (QI) for pediatric residents that would increase their ability to apply QI methodology while improving clinical processes and outcomes. The curriculum evolved over 3 years based on resident feedback. Working in teams, residents and faculty apply QI principles to systematically design and implement QI projects. Residents increased their level of comfort with key QI concepts. They showed an increase in QI skills by meaningful integration of the following QI concepts into their projects: establishing the magnitude of the problem, developing focused aims for improvement, identifying areas to change, using QI tools, collecting data, and assessing if changes were successful. The 10 resident-led projects conducted over the past 3 years also resulted in improvements in measures of multiple clinical processes and outcomes. This curriculum was effective and feasible within the constraints of residency work hours.</p>

<p>Although quality improvement (QI) is increasingly recognized as integral to better patient outcomes and system improvement, most physicians in the United States lack knowledge and skills in improvement science.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612448927">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612448927">2</xref></sup> Recognizing this gap, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires residency programs to “ensure that residents are integrated and actively participate in interdisciplinary clinical quality improvement and patient safety programs,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612448927">3</xref></sup> so trainees can develop competence in systems-based practice and practice-based learning and improvement. The Institute of Medicine’s report, <italic>Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality</italic>, advocates that health care professionals be proficient in team-based QI and that their competence in this area be adequately evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612448927">2</xref></sup> Graduate medical education program directors are challenged to integrate such training into busy clinical training programs with increasingly restrictive duty hour requirements.</p>
<p>Given the variability in training program structures, a one-size-fits-all approach to integrating QI is inappropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612448927">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612448927"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612448927"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612448927"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612448927">8</xref></sup> Widespread dissemination of QI graduate education models will not only allow residency training programs to share their successes and challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612448927">9</xref></sup> but also will provide a resource for educators to adapt tried and tested QI educational experiences to fit their unique needs, strengths, and focus areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612448927">10</xref></sup> It is also important to evaluate if educational interventions translate into improvements in the rigor of the QI processes as well as improvements in health care delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612448927">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consistent with the experiential focus of residency training and the program’s goal of team-based, experiential, and longitudinal project-based learning, the authors’ goal was to create a curriculum to integrate exposure to the fundamental concepts of improvement with the incorporation of these concepts into a resident’s repertoire of clinical skills. Within the context of overall training program educational requirements and time demands, the authors developed a QI curriculum for pediatric residents to enhance their comfort with applying QI through design and implementation of a feasible, longitudinal, and effective team-based project to improve the quality of care. In this article, the authors share their strategies and outcomes for this successful experiential QI curriculum based on 3 years of evaluation and refinement.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1062860612448927">
<title>Site Description</title>
<p>The University of California Davis pediatric residency training program is a university-based training program with 36 pediatric residents, 12 in each year of training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860612448927">
<title>Curriculum Development</title>
<p>Prior to implementation of the curriculum in 2009, a total of 36 pediatric residents were invited to complete an anonymous Web-based assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612448927">12</xref></sup> Of the 29 responses, the authors found that among the few (11%) trainees who reported prior experience with QI, all gained this experience independent of their formal medical education. Not surprisingly, trainees reported a low level of comfort with applying specific QI concepts to patient care.</p>
<p>Given this gap in experience and comfort, an educational approach was developed that included the following: (1) didactic training on key QI concepts, (2) working in interprofessional teams, (3) faculty and peer mentoring, (4) selecting topics aligned with institutional priorities, (5) designing and implementing QI projects, and (6) dissemination by presenting projects to hospital leadership. The evolution and improvement of the QI curriculum over 3 years in response to resident feedback is described in detail in the following sections as plan-do-study-act cycles.</p>
<sec id="section4-1062860612448927">
<title>Year 1 (2008-2009)</title>
<sec id="section5-1062860612448927">
<title>Plan</title>
<p>The clinical focus area for this pilot year was screening for childhood obesity at every pediatric health care contact during visits to any of 5 patient locations: pediatric primary care clinic, subspecialty clinic, urgent care clinic, emergency department, and inpatient unit. Interprofessional teams consisted of 7 to 8 pediatric residents at all levels of training, including nurses and clinic support staff at these contact locations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612448927">
<title>Do</title>
<p>Residents assigned to the same half-day outpatient continuity clinic participated on the same team. This “built-in” structure provided an opportunity for team members to interact weekly without the challenge of scheduling a meeting. Fundamental QI concepts, such as aim statements, plan-do-study-act cycles, and strategies to measure and track improvement, as well as examples of successful local QI projects were presented during the initial 20 minutes of each monthly session. Teams spent the remaining 40 minutes of each session working on sequential project phases. Five teams, led by a second-year resident, were mentored by the 2 course codirectors as they developed their QI project proposals using a workbook to guide and record progress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612448927">
<title>Study</title>
<p>Teams developed aim statements relevant to their patient contact clinical location, identified stakeholders, analyzed processes, and collected baseline data to inform their aim statement. Teams prioritized potential interventions and formulated a plan for implementation and evaluation. QI projects were not implemented in this first year; however, each team analyzed sample implementation data provided by course faculty. This allowed residents to focus their limited time on gaining experience with fundamental QI skills, such as displaying and analyzing data using run and control charts, without the additional effort needed for data collection. Teams presented their projects to course faculty and other residents at the end of the academic year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1062860612448927">
<title>Act</title>
<p>The curriculum was modified based on feedback provided by residents as part of a questionnaire that they completed at the end of year 1. Residents reported their desire to (1) implement the QI project and (2) move all classroom-based didactic sessions to a Web-based learning format in order to allow additional time for implementation activities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1062860612448927">
<title>Year 2 (2009-2010)</title>
<sec id="section10-1062860612448927">
<title>Plan</title>
<p>Team composition was arranged the same as in year 1. Course codirectors reviewed existing Web-based courses to look for free/low-cost materials that explained QI concepts clearly and concisely. They also presented outcomes of the first year of the QI curriculum at departmental faculty meetings to identify faculty who were interested in volunteering to serve as project mentors. These faculty mentors were not required to be experts in QI. They were informed that they would learn QI methodology by being a part of resident-led project teams under the guidance of course codirectors and at the same time serve as advisors to and role models for residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1062860612448927">
<title>Do</title>
<p>Based on the suggestions solicited from year 1 participants, residents in year 2 completed the following selected free lessons on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School Web site: (1) Changing Systems—how to get here from there, (2) The Model for Improvement, (3) Measuring for Improvement, and (4) Teamwork and Communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612448927">13</xref></sup> At the beginning of the academic year, each team selected QI projects from a list of potential topics provided by course faculty. Teams designed and implemented projects over a 9-month period during monthly 1-hour sessions. Each of the 5 teams was led by a faculty mentor, with additional guidance and training in QI methodology provided by the course codirectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1062860612448927">
<title>Study</title>
<p>At the end of the academic year, teams presented their projects to other residents, faculty members, and departmental leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1062860612448927">
<title>Act</title>
<p>Team composition was modified based on feedback provided by residents as part of a questionnaire at the end of year 2. Residents reported that teams of 7 to 8 residents from different years of training were difficult to coordinate because of off-site rotations and patient care responsibilities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1062860612448927">
<title>Year 3 (2010-2011)</title>
<sec id="section15-1062860612448927">
<title>Plan</title>
<p>To address the issue of difficulty coordinating large multiyear resident teams, in Year 3, six teams of 2 first-year residents were formed. The authors decided to continue providing residents with a list of potential project topics in order to select focus areas aligned with organizational priorities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1062860612448927">
<title>Do</title>
<p>Residents selected QI projects from a list of potential topics provided by course faculty. Similar to year 2, first-year residents completed selected courses on QI on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School Web site: (1) Changing Systems—how to get here from there and (2) The Model for Improvement. Because these courses were completed during the previous academic year, second- and third-year resident coursework focused on patient safety using the following courses: (1) Introduction to Patient Safety, (2) Fundamentals of Patient Safety, and (3) Human Factors and Safety. Teams of first-year residents designed and implemented projects with second- and third-year residents serving as peer mentors. Teams designed and implemented projects along with faculty mentors during monthly 1-hour sessions over a 9-month period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1062860612448927">
<title>Study</title>
<p>At the end of the academic year, teams presented their results to peers, faculty members, and departmental leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1062860612448927">
<title>Act</title>
<p>Based on resident evaluations obtained as part of the postcurricular survey as well as the high quality of projects, the authors determined that team composition and this combination of didactic and hands-on learning was optimal for resident education in QI at their program.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1062860612448927">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>The QI curriculum was evaluated by (1) level of integration of key QI concepts into projects during end-of-the year presentations and (2) the survey of residents’ comfort level with respect to key QI concepts. The University of California Davis Institutional Review Board approved this study.</p>
<sec id="section20-1062860612448927">
<title>Evaluation of QI projects</title>
<p>Teams demonstrated their application of key QI concepts during a 10-minute presentation at the end of each academic year. The degree to which 7 QI concepts were incorporated into projects was rated by faculty with expertise in QI using an existing, validated tool (1 = <italic>needs improvement</italic>, 5 = <italic>exceeds expectations</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612448927">14</xref></sup> Projects were evaluated in the following areas: definition of the problem, identification of key stakeholders, evidence of using QI methods, choice of the QI project, evaluation of potential interventions, strength of the proposed intervention, and implementation and evaluation of the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1062860612448927">
<title>Residents’ comfort level with QI</title>
<p>The authors locally developed a questionnaire by adapting items from existing curricular evaluation instruments to our measure of residents’ self-reported comfort toward applying 10 key QI concepts on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all comfortable</italic>, 5 = <italic>extremely comfortable</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612448927">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612448927">16</xref></sup> The questionnaire was pilot tested for face validity by 3 faculty members and 5 residents at the authors’ institution as well as by 2 faculty members at another institution and was modified based on their feedback. Key QI concepts included in the questionnaire were understanding the Model for Improvement, writing a clear statement of the magnitude or significance of the problem, describing the impact of a QI intervention on key stakeholders, developing a focused aim for improvement, understanding the plan-do-study-act cycle, displaying and analyzing data using run and control charts, using QI tools (eg, flow charts, Pareto diagrams, fishbone diagrams) to understand the process of care, identifying areas to change within a process, developing a feasible data collection plan, and assessing if changes are successful. This questionnaire was administered to all residents prior to the start of the curriculum and at the end of each academic year. Responses were anonymous.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1062860612448927">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Means and ranges were calculated for QI project scores. The authors also assessed the percentage of projects that were given a score of 2 or higher (<italic>met expectations</italic>) on a 5-point scale for all 7 QI concepts.</p>
<p>An “overall comfort score” was calculated by averaging each resident’s response to questions regarding their comfort level with 10 key QI concepts on a 1 to 5 scale and then multiplying the result by 10. The internal consistency of scale items was assessed by using Cronbach’s α. A linear regression model with random effects was used to (1) assess the improvement in comfort level with QI concepts for first-year residents in each year of the curriculum, (2) assess the impact of participating in the curriculum for multiple years, and (3) determine whether any year of the curriculum was significantly more successful at improving comfort level. Estimates from regression models along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are provided. Statistical analyses were performed using R 2.11.0.</p>

<title>Residents’ Comfort Level With QI</title>
<p>Questionnaires were administered at the beginning and end of each academic year and response rates ranged from 72% (26/36) to 81% (29/36). The high Cronbach’s α (.95) supported our use of an overall comfort level score. First-year residents demonstrated a significant improvement in overall comfort level with key QI concepts in all 3 years, which corresponded to a greater than 2 standard deviation improvement (first year, 15.3 point increase [95% CI = 4.1-26.5]; second year: 14.0 point increase [95% CI = 1.8-26.1]; third year: 17.9 point increase [95% CI = 7.2-28.6]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612448927">Figure 1</xref>). Across the 3 years of the curriculum, there was no significant difference in improvement that would favor one year’s teaching strategy over another, although differences could have existed that we were unable to detect given our small sample size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612448927">Figure 2</xref> shows the comfort scores of each group of residents as they progress through the program. In general, residents gain the most comfort in the first year in which they experience the program. Some comfort is lost in the intervening time between the end of one year’s curriculum and the beginning of the next year’s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612448927">Figure 2</xref> also demonstrates that engaging second- and third-year residents in additional years of QI training did not consistently confer additional benefit in increasing their comfort level with applying QI concepts. Specifically, in 2009-2010, participating for the second time improved the comfort level score by 6.8 points (95% CI = 3.8-9.7). However, participating for a third time in 2010-2011 conferred no additional benefit (1.2 points, 95 % CI = −5.5 to 7.9).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We successfully engaged residents in applying QI methodology to systematically identify gaps in clinical practice and to design and implement experiential team-based and longitudinal QI projects to improve the quality of care delivered. Residents selected projects in focus areas aligned with institutional priorities and efforts. Regardless of the specific QI educational intervention implemented, first-year residents increased their overall comfort level with applying QI concepts at the end of the academic year. We found that project-based learning within interdisciplinary teams involving a full range of QI activities can successfully integrate QI into graduate medical education programs.</p>
<p>As anticipated, the highest increase in level of comfort with applying key QI concepts was experienced by residents in their first year of exposure to QI curricula. The largest increase in overall comfort level in first-year residents occurred with the educational intervention implemented in 2010-2011, when teams of first-year residents designed and implemented team-based QI projects, completed courses in QI on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School Web site, and received mentorship from faculty members as well as second- and third-year residents. In the last year of the curriculum, senior residents mentored interns during their second and third years of QI curricula exposure and did not perform their own QI project. Engagement of second-year residents as peer mentors beyond their first year of exposure in 2009-2010 added benefit, likely because this group of residents did not implement a “real” QI project in their first year of training. However, it is important to note that peer mentoring by itself did not provide additional benefit if residents had previously implemented a “real” QI project.</p>
<p>Incorporating the teaching of QI into residency training is challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612448927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612448927">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612448927">15</xref></sup> Scattered lectures providing didactic instruction, or even workshops, imperfectly prepare future physicians to participate in sustained and highly collaborative team-based QI initiatives. Armstrong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612448927">9</xref></sup> describe 4 principles for educational experiences in health care improvement: using a combination of didactic and project-based experiences, linking learning with health system–level improvement work, evaluating educational outcomes, and role modeling QI in educational processes. The curriculum described here successfully implemented all 4 principles, additionally incorporating elements of team practice. Our curriculum also paired faculty members with no prior experience in conducting QI projects with faculty who had expertise in QI, thereby facilitating faculty development. Faculty members were enthusiastic about participating as mentors. We began offering faculty Part 4 Maintenance of Certification credit approved by the American Board of Pediatrics during the 2011-2012 academic year as formal recognition of faculty contributions.</p>
<p>One challenge that we continue to face is irregular house staff attendance at the hour-long noon QI project work sessions. This occurred because of patient care commitments, rotations at sites outside our medical center, as well as night coverage that precluded attendance at sessions the following day. Although at least 1 member from each team was present at most monthly sessions, having most members of the improvement team present at all sessions might have been optimal to keep projects on track. Our residency training program will implement block scheduling for resident educational sessions during 2012-2013. We anticipate that this modification will enhance regular resident attendance at QI curricular sessions.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. With a single residency program, our sample size was small and did not include a control group who were not exposed to the educational intervention. Ideally, a paired analysis would be performed, but both preintervention and postintervention surveys were not available for all residents, and using only the available pairs would have dramatically reduced the sample size. Using a linear regression model with random effects improves the power of the analysis by taking advantage of the complete pairings while still using the data from residents who did not have complete pairings. We assessed self-reported comfort, which is not necessarily an accurate proxy for content knowledge. We did not assess if acquired knowledge and skills were retained or applied in other settings. After the first curricular year, senior residents mentored interns and did not engage in their own QI project. Therefore, it is unknown whether senior residents would receive additional benefit from engaging in QI projects each year of training. However, the magnitude of the benefit from additional independent QI projects would need to be weighed against the benefit gained from other lost educational opportunities.</p>
<p>Given the importance of equipping future physicians with QI skills, curricula such as the one we described can be feasible and effective, even given the current resident work hour restrictions. In addition, because residents play a major role in clinical care within academic health centers, education in QI focused on redesigning care delivery systems may help them understand and support these systems while in residency and beyond.</p>
