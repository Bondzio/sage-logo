<abstract>
<p>Cultural differences in implicit theories and self-perceptions of traitedness were examined in the United States (<italic>N</italic> = 198), Mexico (<italic>N</italic> = 257), the Philippines (<italic>N</italic> = 212), and Japan (<italic>N</italic> = 225). Participants in all four cultures endorsed beliefs about the longitudinal stability, cross-situational consistency, and predictive validity of traits. At the same time, Americans and Mexicans, more than Filipinos and Japanese, endorsed implicit trait or dispositionist perspectives and described their own behavior as traited or consistent (i.e., lower in self-monitoring). Alternative measurement formats were compared and led to the conclusion that forced-choice measures may be advantageous in some cases, particularly when acquiescence bias may impact cross-cultural comparisons. Cultural differences were observed in participants’ perceptions of the individualism-collectivism, dialecticism, and tightness-looseness of their respective cultures and these measures partially mediated some of the cultural differences in traitedness. Overall, the results supported an integration of trait and cultural psychology perspectives, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between culture and personality.</p>

<p>Research on culture and personality has been dominated by two theoretical perspectives—trait psychology and cultural psychology. Although some theorists view these perspectives as incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022022111428514">Shweder, 1991</xref>), we believe an integration is possible and will be important for theoretical and empirical progress in the field. One focus of our integrated approach has been to compare across cultures implicit theories and self-perceptions regarding the “traitedness” versus contextuality of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>). While our previous studies have provided support for an integrated perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111428514">Church, 2009</xref>), we have also considered whether we might obtain even greater support if we resolved certain measurement issues. Accordingly, in the present study, we retested some of our cross-cultural hypotheses using alternative measurement formats and cultural dimensions.</p>
<p>In particular, acquiescence response bias has long been considered a significant problem in cross-cultural research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111428514">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022111428514">Johnson, Kulesa, Choi, &amp; Shavitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111428514">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022022111428514">van de Vijver &amp; Leung, 1997</xref>), and several researchers have recommended forced-choice formats as a possible means to reduce its impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022111428514">Heine, Lehman, Peng, &amp; Greenholtz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111428514">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether forced-choice and Likert-type scale formats lead to different conclusions about cultural differences in traitedness. In addition, because cultural means on self-referent measures of cultural dimensions often diverge from expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022111428514">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>), some researchers have recommended measures of perceived cultural contexts (PCC) as an alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111428514">Chiu, Gelfand, Yamagishi, Shteynberg, &amp; Wan, 2010</xref>). Thus, we also examined the effectiveness of PCC measures as mediators of cultural differences in traitedness.</p>

<title>Implicit theories</title>
<p>From trait theory, we expect that people in all cultures believe that traits underlie a degree of consistency of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428514">Church, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111428514">Funder, 1995</xref>). At the same time, cultural psychologists have deemphasized the importance of traits in collectivistic cultures, where contextual factors are expected to have a greater impact on behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111428514">Heine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022111428514">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111428514">1998</xref>). Accordingly, implicit theories that emphasize the importance of traits are expected to be stronger in individualistic cultures, whereas implicit theories that emphasize contextual factors are expected to be stronger in collectivistic cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428514">Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022111428514">Norenzayan, Choi, &amp; Nisbett, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022022111428514">
<title>Self-perceptions of one’s own traitedness</title>
<p>Another cultural psychology prediction is that people in individualistic cultures will perceive their own behavior to be relatively traited or consistent across situations, whereas people in collectivistic cultures will perceive their behavior to be more adaptive to situational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111428514">Choi &amp; Choi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111428514">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022022111428514">Suh, 2002</xref>). Indeed, some evidence indicates that people in East Asian countries report less trait consistency across contexts than do European Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111428514">English &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022111428514">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022022111428514">Suh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One way we have investigated cultural differences in self-perceptions of one’s own traitedness is to compare self-monitoring scores across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022022111428514">Snyder (1974)</xref> proposed that high self-monitoring individuals are relatively “trait-free” and show considerable cross-situational variability in their behavior. In contrast, low self-monitoring individuals—who are less sensitive to situational cues and more guided in their behavior by internal dispositions—are relatively traited in their behavior and exhibit greater consistency across situations. Combining cultural psychology and self-monitoring theory, we thus anticipate greater self-monitoring in collectivistic cultures than in individualistic cultures.</p>
<p>Cross-cultural studies with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022022111428514">Snyder’s (1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022022111428514">Snyder &amp; Gangestad, 1986</xref>) self-monitoring measures have generally failed to support this hypothesis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111428514">Furnham &amp; Capon, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022111428514">Gudykunst et al., 1989</xref>). However, as discussed in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al. (2006)</xref>, this is probably because Snyder’s measures deviate from his original conception of self-monitoring as adaptation of behavior to be situationally appropriate towards a conception that overemphasizes extraversion. Accordingly, we have adapted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022111428514">Lennox and Wolfe’s (1984)</xref> measures of Self-Monitoring and Concern for Appropriateness in our cross-cultural studies.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we review our previous cross-cultural studies on implicit theories and self-perceptions of traitedness and then discuss some measurement issues that may have impacted our results.</p>

<title>Implicit trait and contextual theories</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111428514">Church et al. (2003)</xref> developed the Personality Beliefs Inventory (PBI), a measure of individuals’ trait and contextual beliefs. Items address the longitudinal stability (vs. instability) of traits, cross-situational consistency (vs. variability) of trait- relevant behavior, the predictive validity (vs. lack thereof) of traits, and the ease (vs. difficulty) of inferring traits from observed behaviors. In each of the six cultural groups investigated thus far—Americans, Australians, Mexicans, Filipinos, Malaysians, and Japanese—distinct trait and contextual beliefs dimensions—rather than a single bipolar dimension—have provided the best representation of the instrument’s structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">2006</xref>). This suggests that, in all cultures, beliefs about the traitedness and contextuality of behavior are relatively independent. This conclusion is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022111428514">Norenzayan et al.’s (2002)</xref> study of Americans and Koreans. In both cultural groups, endorsement of dispositionist and situationist lay philosophies of social behavior were uncorrelated and an interactionist philosophy was most endorsed. We have also found that trait beliefs are endorsed to some extent in all cultural groups sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with trait psychology perspectives and has led us to conclude that lay dispositionism is a cultural universal, rather than unique to individualistic cultures. At the same time, consistent with cultural psychology perspectives, participants in individualistic cultures have generally endorsed trait beliefs more and contextual beliefs less than participants in collectivistic cultures.</p>

<title>Self-perceptions of one’s own traitedness versus contextuality (i.e., self-monitoring)</title>
<p>Our previous cross-cultural study of self-monitoring conformed only partially to expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>). First, items expected to define the negative pole of a self-monitoring dimension exhibited weak bipolarity and instead defined a separate factor that we labeled autonomous self-expression. The self-monitoring items refer to adaptation of one’s behavior to be situationally appropriate, whereas the autonomous self-expression items refer to behaving in a way that is true to one’s personality across situations. Second, cultural differences only partially supported theory. As hypothesized, Americans averaged lower in self-monitoring than did Filipinos, Malaysians, and Japanese. However, the results for Australians and Mexicans did not conform to expectations for individualistic and collectivistic cultures, respectively.</p>

<title>Measurement Issues</title>
<sec id="section8-0022022111428514">
<title>Response styles</title>
<p>It is plausible that implicit trait and contextual beliefs are independent, rather than bipolar opposites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022111428514">Norenzayan et al., 2002</xref>). This might also be the case for self-monitoring and autonomous self-expression items. However, it is also possible that acquiescence bias contributes to the lack of bipolarity, particularly in cultures that are prone to this bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022111428514">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022111428514">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022022111428514">Smith &amp; Fischer, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022022111428514">Smith and Fischer (2008)</xref> noted, acquiescence bias threatens the validity of all measures intended to measure constructs other than acquiescence itself. Indeed, a number of studies have reported cultural differences in acquiescence bias. The most consistent finding is that acquiescence bias is greater in collectivistic cultures than in individualistic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111428514">Grimm &amp; Church, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022111428514">Harzing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022111428514">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022022111428514">Smith &amp; Fischer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022022111428514">van Herk, Poortinga, &amp; Verhallen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Test construction guidelines typically call for a balance of positively keyed and reverse-keyed items to offset the effects of acquiescence bias. However, cross-cultural researchers often ignore this guideline, in part because respondents in some cultures are hesitant to disagree with items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022111428514">Smith, 2004</xref>). Even in Western studies, there is evidence that reverse-keyed items contribute less than positively keyed items to scale reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111428514">Church, 2010</xref>). The problem of reverse-keyed items is even more salient in cross-cultural studies, because some cultural groups may interpret positively keyed and reverse-keyed items differently and not as bipolar opposites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111428514">Hamamura, Heine, &amp; Paulhus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022022111428514">Spencer-Rodgers, Peng, Wang, &amp; Hou, 2004</xref>). This can reduce internal consistency reliability and correlations with external variables.</p>
<p>To address the problem of acquiescence bias, some cross-cultural psychologists have recommended within-individual standardization of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111428514">Fischer, 2004</xref>). It may also be possible to reduce or eliminate acquiescence bias by using alternative item formats. Some researchers have advocated paired-comparison or forced-choice items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022111428514">Heine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111428514">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>), and scenario methods have also been applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022111428514">Peng, Nisbett, &amp; Wong, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022022111428514">Triandis &amp; Gelfand, 1998</xref>). However, we could identify only two studies that directly compared the effect of different measurement formats on cross-cultural differences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022111428514">Peng et al. (1997)</xref> found that a scenario method, as compared to ratings, rankings, and an attitude scale, showed better convergence with experts’ judgments of cultural differences in values between Americans and Chinese. More relevant to the present study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111428514">Oishi et al. (2005)</xref> found that expected cultural differences in values between Americans and Japanese were better supported using a paired-comparison method than Likert-type scale ratings. In the present study, we revisit some of our hypotheses regarding cultural differences in traitedness using alternative item formats, including forced-choice, to determine whether instrument format affects our conclusions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022022111428514">
<title>Self-referent versus culture-referent measures of culture</title>
<p>One disappointment in our previous studies has been the limited success of the mediating variables proposed by cultural psychologists (e.g., self-construals, holistic thinking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111428514">Church, 2009</xref>). Reflecting common practice, we relied on self-referent measures to assess cultural dimensions. Self-referent measures assess respondents’ personal values or beliefs (e.g., “I enjoy being unique and different from others in many respects.”). However, self-referent measures, when aggregated to the cultural level, often fail to exhibit cultural differences that conform to expectations, thus reducing their usefulness as mediating variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022111428514">Matsumoto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022111428514">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>). Recent research suggests that aggregate judgments of perceived cultural contexts (PCC)—which require participants to judge the beliefs and values that are typical in their respective cultures (e.g., “People in this country almost always comply with social norms.”)—may conform better to expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111428514">Chiu et al., 2010</xref>). PCC measures are often minimally correlated with self-referent measures and have successfully predicted or mediated cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111428514">Chiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111428514">Fischer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022111428514">Shteynberg, Gelfand, &amp; Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022022111428514">Zou, Tam, Morris, Lee, Lau, &amp; Chiu, 2009</xref>). PCC measures may also be more consistent with the view of culture as a product of dynamic and collective processes, whereas self-referent measures operationalize culture as an aggregation of individuals’ personal characteristics. Given the limited success of self-referent measures in our previous studies, we sought to determine whether PCC measures would perform better as mediators of cultural differences in traitedness.</p>
<p>We selected cultural dimensions that have been directly linked in cultural psychology theory to the traitedness construct. Most theory regarding differences in traitedness or consistency has been cast in terms of the individualism-collectivism distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111428514">Heine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111428514">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022022111428514">Suh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022022111428514">Triandis, 1995</xref>). More recently, dialecticism has been proposed as a cultural dimension that can lead to reduced traitedness, at least in East Asian cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111428514">Choi &amp; Choi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111428514">English &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022111428514">Peng and Nisbett (1999)</xref> defined dialecticism as a system of thought characterized by acceptance of contradiction, expectations of complexity and change, and holistic thinking. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022111428514">Gelfand, Nishii, and Raver (2006)</xref> defined cultural tightness (vs. looseness) as “the strength of social norms and the degree of sanctioning within societies” (p. 1226). Implicit in this framework is the expectation of reduced traitedness in tight cultures where situational constraints are expected to be greater.</p>

<title>Overview of the Present Study</title>
<p>In the present study, we retested hypotheses regarding cultural differences in implicit theories and self-perceptions of traitedness using alternative measurement formats and cultural dimensions. We sampled university students from four of the six countries in our previous studies—the United States, Mexico, Philippines, and Japan. To measure implicit trait theories and self- monitoring, we converted our previous Likert-type scale measures to forced-choice formats. We also included a scenario-like measure of dispositionist, situationist, and interactionist lay philosophies of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111428514">Bauman &amp; Skitka, 2006</xref>). We administered PCC measures rather than self-referent measures of culture and incorporated additional cultural dimensions as possible mediators of traitedness. Our goals were to replicate or improve on our previous results and to determine which measurement formats lead to results more consistent with theory.</p>
<p>The United States is generally viewed as individualistic and Mexico, the Philippines, and Japan as collectivistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111428514">Church, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111428514">Díaz-Loving &amp; Draguns, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111428514">Hofstede, 1980</xref>). Dialecticism has been attributed primarily to East Asian cultures such as Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022111428514">Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999</xref>). Finally, the United States has been described as a loose culture and Japan as a tight culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022022111428514">Triandis, 1995</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al. (2011)</xref> ranked 33 countries based on a Likert-type scale measure of cultural tightness. Japan was ranked higher in tightness than either Mexico or the United States, while the Philippines was not included in the study. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022111428514">Peabody (1985)</xref> of perceived national characteristics, Filipinos and Americans were judged to be relatively loose in impulse expression, one indicator of cultural tightness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al., 2011</xref>), while Japanese were judged to be tight. Thus, we tentatively predicted that Japan would be perceived as highest in tightness, Mexico and the Philippines intermediate, and the United States lowest in tightness.</p>
<p>Although Mexico has been described as a collectivistic country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111428514">Díaz-Loving &amp; Draguns, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111428514">Hofstede, 1980</xref>), in our previous studies Mexicans have averaged higher than Americans in independent self-construals and lower in interdependent self-construals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">2006</xref>). This may be due to our sampling of university students, who are probably more individualistic than the general population, or our use of self-referrent measures. In the present study, we examined whether Mexican university students perceive the general Mexican culture to be collectivistic when we use a PCC approach to cultural assessment.</p>
<p>Whether or not Mexican students perceive their culture to be collectivistic, there is evidence that they make a distinction between the traitedness of people in general and the traitedness or consistency of their own behavior. In our previous studies, Mexican students have tended to endorse implicit trait beliefs less and contextual beliefs more than Americans students, perhaps because these beliefs refer to <italic>people in general</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111428514">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">2006</xref>). At the same time, Mexican students have reported greater autonomous self-expression and lower self- monitoring than American students, indicating that Mexican students judge their <italic>personal</italic> behavior to be relatively traited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022111428514">Malloy, Albright, Díaz-Loving, Dong, and Lee (2004)</xref>, who found that interobserver agreement in trait ratings across social contexts was higher in Mexican students (and similar to American levels) than in Chinese students. Malloy et al. concluded that (a) Mexicans have general prescriptions for social behavior (rather than dyad-specific prescriptions) that lead to considerable trait consistency, and (b) both Mexicans and Americans are socialized to evaluate others in terms of traits. Given these findings, we hypothesized that Mexican students would resemble American students more than Filipino and Japanese students in their implicit beliefs and self-perceptions of traitedness.</p>

<title>Lay philosophies of social behavior</title>
<p>To measure the extent to which participants endorse dispositionist, situationist, and interactionist philosophies of behavior, we administered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111428514">Bauman and Skitka’s (2006)</xref> abbreviated version of the measure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022111428514">Norenzayan et al. (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>The description of the dispositionist lay philosophy was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>How people behave is mostly determined by their personality. One’s behavior is remarkably stable across time and consistent across situations because it is guided by personality. Therefore, if we know the personality of a person, we can easily predict how the person will behave in the future and explain why that person behaved in the particular way in the past.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The description of the situationist lay philosophy was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>How people behave is mostly determined by the situation in which they find themselves. Often, people in a particular situation behave very similarly, despite large individual differences in personality. Therefore, in order to predict and explain one’s behavior, we have to focus on the situation rather than personality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The description of the interactionist lay philosophy was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>How people behave is always jointly determined by their personality and the situation in which they find themselves. Therefore, we cannot predict and explain how someone will behave by personality or situation alone. To predict behavior, one has to know something about both the situation and the person’s personality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants rated their level of agreement with each lay philosophy on a 6-point agreement scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Participants’ ratings comprised their scores for the three lay philosophies.</p>

<title>Individualism-collectivism</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111428514">Chirkov, Ryan, Kim, and Kaplan (2003)</xref> developed and validated an instrument to assess cultural practices, beliefs, and feelings associated with horizontal individualism (HI), vertical individualism (VI), horizontal collectivism (HC), and vertical collectivism (VC), each measured by 12 items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022022111428514">Triandis &amp; Gelfand, 1998</xref>). For each scale, half of the items assessed the perceived <italic>importance</italic> (1 = <italic>not at all important</italic> to 5 = <italic>extremely important</italic>), and half measured the perceived frequency (1 = <italic>not at all typical</italic> to 5 = <italic>extremely typical</italic>) of the same behaviors in the culture of interest. In all four cultures, principal-axis factor analyses with oblique rotations failed to distinguish separate HI, HC, VI, and VC dimensions. However, in three cultures, two-factor solutions produced clear individualism and collectivism dimensions (in the Mexican sample the two factors were more interpretable as horizontal and vertical dimensions). We scored only individualism and collectivism dimensions by averaging the relevant items. Across the four cultures, internal consistency (α) reliability estimates ranged from .82 to .87 for individualism and from .78 to .87 for collectivism.</p>

<title>Dialecticism</title>

A sample item was: “People in this country often find that their beliefs and attitudes will change under different contexts.” Level of agreement was rated on a 6-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). In one-factor solutions, most positively keyed items had acceptable factor loadings, but reverse-keyed items tended to define additional factors. For this reason, α reliability estimates were marginal in three of the four cultural samples (U.S., .60; Mexico, .54; Philippines, .41; Japan, .74). Nonetheless, to control for acquiescence bias, we retained the reverse-keyed items and scored a single dialecticism dimension by averaging all items, reverse-keying where relevant. Higher scores indicated greater perceived dialecticism of one’s culture.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al. (2011)</xref> validated a six-item measure of cultural tightness (vs. looseness).

In principal-axis factor analyses, one-factor solutions revealed the expected tight versus loose bipolar dimension in the American (α = .60) and Japanese (α = .63) samples. In the Mexican and Filipino samples, bipolarity was weak and the tight and loose items identified separate factors, reducing reliability (Mexican α = .36; Filipino α = .45). Nonetheless, to reduce the impact of acquiescence bias, we scored a single bipolar dimension in all four cultures, by averaging the items, reverse-keying where relevant. Higher scores indicated stronger agreement that their culture is tight, rather than loose. To address the marginal reliability estimates for the dialecticism and tightness measures, we employed mean and covariance structures (MACS) analyses as described in a later section.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In Mexico, the Philippines, and Japan, volunteer participants filled out the instruments in regular class sessions. In Japan, additional participants were recruited in student clubs. In the United States, participants were recruited in regular classes but completed the instruments outside of class and returned them the next week. Alternate participants completed the instruments in Order 1 (PBI, self-monitoring, lay philosophies of social behavior, tightness-looseness, individualism-collectivism, and dialecticism) or Order 2 (tightness-looseness, individualism-collectivism, dialecticism, PBI, self-monitoring, and lay philosophies of social behavior). In a MANOVA, there were no order effects for the measures in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0022022111428514">
<title>Measurement Equivalence Analyses</title>
<p>We used MACS, conducted with AMOS 16.0, to test the cross-cultural scalar equivalence of each measure (with the exception of the lay philosophies instrument, which only has a single indicator for each construct). To conduct the MACS analyses, we distributed the items in each scale into three parcels based on the size of their factor loadings in our exploratory factor analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022111428514">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002</xref>). Grouping the items into parcels improves the reliability of the observed indicators of the latent constructs and is appropriate when one’s primary interest is the latent means rather than the individual items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022111428514">Little et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the MACS analyses provide estimates of construct means and path coefficients that are corrected for internal consistency unreliability, thus addressing the marginal α estimates for the dialecticism and tightness measures in some cultures.</p>
<p>For each instrument, good fit was observed for models with factor loadings constrained to be equal across the four cultures (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> range = .95 to 3.48; GFI range = .95 to .99; CFI range = .94 to 1.00; RMSEA range = .00 to .05). Models in which the intercepts for the item parcels were also constrained to be equal across cultures fit the data well for the PBI (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.82; CFI = .92; RMSEA = .05) and self-monitoring measure (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 5.57; CFI = .92; RMSEA = .07). For the individualism, collectivism, dialecticism, and tightness constructs, it was necessary to unconstrain the intercept for one of the three indicators to obtain good model fit (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.87 to 4.78; CFI = .92 to .93; RMSEA = .05 to .07). In summary, for the PBI and self-monitoring measures, both loading and intercept invariance was demonstrated, indicating full scalar equivalence. For the three cultural measures, complete metric (i.e., loading) invariance and partial scalar (i.e., intercept) invariance was demonstrated. Thus, some caution is warranted in comparing the means of the cultural measures, because full scalar equivalence was not demonstrated.</p>

<title>Implicit Beliefs, Lay Philosophies, and Perceptions of Traitedness</title>
<sec id="section31-0022022111428514">
<title>Convergent and discriminant relationships</title>
<p>Before examining cultural differences, we report the statistically significant Pearson correlations among the traitedness variables. In all four cultures, implicit trait beliefs (PBI) correlated significantly with the dispositionist philosophy (range of <italic>r</italic>s = .19 to .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Although both measures assess the extent to which participants believe that personality is stable, consistent, and predictive of behavior, a few reasons may account for the modest size of these correlations. First, the instruments have very different measurement formats (i.e., 25 forced-choice items vs. a single paragraph rated on a Likert-type scale). Second, the PBI items refer to specific traits and situations, whereas the dispositionist philosophy refers to personality and situations in general. Third, the PBI requires a choice between trait and contextual beliefs options, whereas the dispositionist philosophy refers only to trait beliefs. Thus, it is sensible that these two measures correlate positively, but they are not interchangeable.</p>
<p>The situationist, but not dispositionist, philosophy was modestly related to the interactionist philosophy (range of <italic>r</italic>s = .10 to .33), although the Japanese correlation was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .01). Thus, participants who viewed situations as important determinants of behavior also tended to endorse interactionist perspectives. As in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111428514">Bauman &amp; Skitka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022111428514">Norenzayan et al., 2002</xref>), endorsement of a dispositionist philosophy was independent of endorsement of a situationist philosophy.</p>
<p>Participants’ perceptions of the contextuality of their <italic>own</italic> behavior (i.e., self-monitoring) were not consistently related to their implicit beliefs or lay philosophies about the behavior of <italic>people in general</italic>. The most consistent relationships were found in the Mexican (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and American (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) samples, where participants who endorsed trait beliefs less (<italic>r</italic>s of −.30 and −.16, respectively) and situationist philosophies more (<italic>r</italic>s of .20 and .17, respectively) also tended to describe their own behavior as more adaptive to situations.</p>
<p>In summary, these correlational results provide evidence for (a) the modest convergence, but also distinctiveness, of the implicit trait and dispositionist philosophy measures; (b) the relative independence of dispositionist and situationist philosophies; and (c) the limited relationship between beliefs about the traitedness versus contextuality of people in general versus one’s own behavior.</p>

<title>Cultural mean differences</title>
<p>We examined cultural mean differences in two ways. First, we conducted a MANOVA in which culture and gender were the independent variables and raw scores on the traitedness measures were the dependent variables. Alpha was set at .01. There were no significant gender or Culture × Gender effects, so gender was not considered further. Second, the MACS analyses provided estimates of how much the latent means for each culture differed from the latent mean of the reference culture, which we designated as the United States. These latent mean differences provide estimates of cultural differences that are corrected for internal consistency unreliability.</p>
<p>In the MANOVA, the main effect for culture was statistically significant (Wilks’ Lambda = .60), <italic>F</italic>(15, 2,419) = 32.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Follow-up ANOVAs revealed statistically significant cultural differences for each of the variables except the interactionist lay philosophy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111428514">Table 1</xref> shows the comparison of raw means based on Tukey tests and the latent mean differences based on the MACS analysis. Raw score means that share a subscript were not significantly different. For the MACS results, subscripts indicate those cultural means that were significantly different from the U.S. mean (the MACS analyses do not test for significant differences between the other cultures, unless one re-runs the analyses with different reference groups). Also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111428514">Table 1</xref> are the effect sizes (partial η<sup>2</sup> values) for the culture main effects in the ANOVAs.

<title>Implicit trait beliefs</title>
<p>In Hypothesis 1, we predicted that all cultural groups endorse implicit trait beliefs, but that Americans, followed by Mexicans, do so more than Filipinos and Japanese. Recall that for the forced-choice PBI, trait and contextual beliefs options were scored as 2 and 1, respectively. The average scores for all four cultural groups were significantly greater than 1.5 (one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests with 1.5 as the target value). This indicates that, on average, participants in all four cultures endorsed trait belief options over contextual beliefs options. This finding supports the view that all cultural groups believe that traits have some longitudinal stability, cross-situational consistency, and predictive validity, and can be inferred from behavior. Thus, the results support trait psychology perspectives. The expected cultural differences were also largely supported. In both analyses, the Americans, followed by the Mexicans, averaged higher than the Filipinos and Japanese, although the difference between the Americans and Mexicans was only statistically significant in the MACS analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0022022111428514">
<title>Lay philosophies</title>
<p>In Hypothesis 2, we predicted that Americans, followed by Mexicans, endorse a dispositionist philosophy more and a situationist philosophy less, than do Filipinos and Japanese. The raw score means are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111428514">Table 1</xref> but are best visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111428514">Figure 1</xref>. As seen in the figure, participants in all four cultures endorsed the interactionist philosophy most. This is not surprising, given its more encompassing nature (i.e., it subsumes both dispositionist and situationist beliefs). However, it does indicate that lay people agree with the consensus interactionist perspective held by psychologists. Cultural differences in endorsement of the situationist philosophy were modest; only the Filipino and Mexican means differed significantly. The primary cultural difference involved dispositionist perspectives, which Mexicans endorsed more than Filipinos and Americans, who, in turn, endorsed it substantially more than Japanese.</p>

<p>Each of the lay philosophies was rated on a Likert-type scale and thus may be impacted by cultural differences in acquiescence bias. Therefore, the most meaningful results may involve a comparison of the <italic>relative</italic> endorsement of the three lay philosophies <italic>within</italic> each culture. Paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests revealed that all four cultural groups endorsed interactionist perspectives more than dispositionist and situationist perspectives. The Philippines and especially Japan endorsed dispositionist perspectives less than situationist perspectives (the difference was marginally significant in the Philippines, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .08). In contrast, the Americans did not differ in their endorsement of dispositionist and situationist perspectives and the Mexicans endorsed dispositionist perspectives more than situationist perspectives (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). These results provide partial support for Hypothesis 2 because they show that Americans and Mexicans differed from Filipinos and Japanese in their relative endorsement of dispositionist and situationist philosophies. Only the two Asian cultures, and especially Japan, favored the situationist philosophy over the dispositionist philosophy.</p>

<sec id="section35-0022022111428514">
<title>Self-monitoring</title>
<p>In Hypothesis 3, we predicted that Americans and Mexicans would average lower in self-monitoring than Filipinos and Japanese. This hypothesis was supported. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111428514">Table 1</xref>, the Mexicans averaged the lowest in self-monitoring, followed by the Americans, Filipinos, and Japanese, in that order. These results suggest that individuals in Asian cultures report greater self-monitoring of their behavior than individuals in North American cultures. The lower self-monitoring of the Mexicans, as compared to the Americans, replicates our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>) and indicates that Mexican university students perceive their <italic>own</italic> behavior to be more traited (i.e., low self-monitoring) than adaptive to social situations.</p>

In Panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111428514">Figure 2</xref>, we plot the mean trait and contextual beliefs scores that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al.

Recall that in Panel B means above 1.5 are in the direction of trait beliefs and all four cultural means were significantly greater than 1.5 (one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests).</p>

<p>The results for the United States were consistent across measurement methods, with Americans strongly favoring trait beliefs over contextual beliefs in both studies. In Panel A, Mexicans showed a small (but not statistically significant) preference for trait beliefs over contextual beliefs with the Likert-type scales. With the forced-choice format (Panel B), they exhibited a clearer preference for trait beliefs over contextual beliefs. Filipinos showed equal endorsement of trait and contextual beliefs with the Likert-type scales (Panel A). With the forced-choice method (Panel B), they showed a slight but statistically significant preference for trait (vs. contextual) beliefs. Finally, Japanese showed a statistically significant preference for contextual beliefs over trait beliefs with the Likert-type scales (Panel A). With the forced-choice method (Panel B), they showed a slight preference in the direction of trait beliefs.</p>
<p>Overall, the pattern of results was similar across the two methods. In particular, the greater endorsement of trait beliefs over contextual beliefs for Americans, and to a lesser extent Mexicans, as compared to Filipinos and Japanese, was replicated. However, the Mexican results were more similar to the American results with the forced-choice method (Panel B) than with the Likert-type scales (Panel A). In addition, the greater Japanese endorsement of contextual beliefs over trait beliefs with the Likert-type scales (Panel A), which is consistent with theory, was no longer evident when the forced-choice method was used (Panel B). Thus, the results with the PBI do not provide a strong case for preferring the forced-choice format over the Likert-type scale method.</p>

<p>With both the Likert-type scales (Panel A) and forced-choice format (Panel B), Mexicans reported greater autonomous self-expression than self-monitoring. The forced-choice results for the other cultures in Panel B also generally replicated the findings with the Likert-type scales (Panel A), but for the American sample, the forced-choice results were more consistent with theory. Whereas the American sample unexpectedly reported greater self-monitoring than autonomous self-expression with the Likert-type format (Panel A), they averaged in the autonomous self-expression direction with the forced-choice measure (Panel B). With both formats, and consistent with theory, Filipinos and especially Japanese reported more self-monitoring than autonomous self-expression. In summary, the self-monitoring results were generally replicated across the two methods, but the forced-choice method might be preferred because it led to American results that were more consistent with theory.</p>
<p>We also compared the cultural effect sizes with the two methods.

As a result, even a modest preference for self-monitoring over autonomous self-expression, if consistently reflected across items, could lead to a greater contrast with respondents in other cultures who select the alternative option with some consistency. Consider the following item as an example: “When I know how others want me to act, I prefer to: (a) Behave according to my own feelings; or (b) Change my behavior to fit their desires.” The self-monitoring option “b” was selected by 68% of Japanese, but only 4% to 31% of respondents in the other three cultures. Other items showed similar cultural contrasts.</p>

<title>Convergent relationships</title>
<p>Before examining cultural differences in perceived cultural contexts, we report the statistically significant correlations among the respective scores. In the MACS analysis, we found correlations between the individualism and collectivism scores that ranged from .45 in the American sample to .69 in the Mexican sample (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). These high positive correlations suggest that individual differences in acquiescence bias may be impacting the scores. The only other relationship of note was the significant positive correlations found in three of the four cultures (the exception being the United States) between tightness and collectivism (range of <italic>r</italic>s from .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, to .33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

Participants who view their cultures as more collectivistic or group centered also tended to view their cultures as having stronger social norms and sanctions on behavior (i.e., tightness).

<title>Individualism-collectivism</title>
<p>In Hypothesis 4, we predicted that Americans, more than Mexicans, Filipinos, and Japanese, perceive their culture to be individualistic. Conversely, in Hypothesis 5, we predicted that Mexicans, Filipinos, and Japanese, more than Americans, perceive their culture to be collectivistic. At first glance, this expectation does not appear to be supported, in part because the Filipinos described their culture as both more individualistic and more collectivistic than did participants in the other three cultural groups. However, this instrument contains no reverse-keyed items, making it susceptible to acquiescence bias. Acquiescence bias was also suggested by the high correlations between the individualism and collectivism scores noted earlier. Therefore, we compared difference scores obtained by subtracting the raw collectivism scores from the raw individualism scores. In an ANOVA with the individualism-collectivism (I-C) difference score as the dependent variable, the main effect for culture was statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(3, 884) = 5.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, although the effect size was small (<inline-formula id="inline-formula12-0022022111428514">

The I-C difference score means conformed somewhat better to expectations, with the Americans and Mexicans averaging higher on individualism (vs. collectivism) than the Filipinos and Japanese, although the Filipinos were not significantly lower than the Americans and Mexicans. The relatively high I-C score of the Mexican students indicates that even with a measure of perceived cultural context (rather than a self-referent measure), they perceive Mexican culture to be relatively individualistic, as compared to how Filipinos and especially Japanese perceive their own cultures.</p>

<p>In Hypothesis 6, we predicted that Japanese, more than Americans, Mexicans, and Filipinos, perceive their culture to be dialectical. This prediction was supported.

The greater tightness of the Japanese sample than the American sample was supported in the comparison of raw scores, but not the latent mean differences (MACS). The most salient finding was that Mexicans and Filipinos, as compared to Americans and Japanese, perceived their own cultures to be less tight (i.e., more loose).

<title>Mediation of Cultural Differences in Implicit Theories and Self-Perceptions of Traitedness</title>
<p>In Hypothesis 8, we predicted that cultural differences in traitedness would be partially mediated by the cultural dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022022111428514">4</xref></sup> We conducted mediation analyses in two cultures at a time (e.g., United States vs. Japan) because a cultural dimension might be an effective mediator of differences between some cultures and not others. In addition, the structural equations modeling (SEM) analyses used to test for mediation are more straightforward and interpretable when only one dummy variable is needed to represent culture. Meaningful tests of mediation were possible when (a) a cultural difference consistent with theory was demonstrated for an aspect of traitedness, and (b) there was a significant cultural difference in the expected direction for the mediator variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111428514">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). There were 18 combinations of a traitedness variable and a cultural dimension that met both of these criteria, all involving comparisons of Japan with another culture. Of these 18, partial mediation was demonstrated in 8 (44.4%) of the cases.</p>
<p>The most consistent finding was partial mediation of self-monitoring differences by dialecticism. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022022111428514">Figure 4</xref> shows the SEM results testing these mediation effects (for simplicity, the measurement models are not shown). In each model, culture was represented by a dummy variable in which the United States, Mexico, or the Philippines was coded 0 and Japan was coded 1. In each model, culture predicted dialecticism (range of βs = .42 to .50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which, in turn, predicted self-monitoring (range of βs = .16 to .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022022111428514">Sobel (1982)</xref> tests indicated that the indirect effects were statistically significant in each case (<italic>z</italic> range = 2.98 to 3.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022022111428514">Figure 4</xref> also shows the β weights for culture in predicting self-monitoring (a) when dialecticism was included as a mediator, and (b) when culture was the sole predictor of self-monitoring (shown in parentheses). In each case, the β weights were reduced by a nontrivial amount when dialecticism was introduced as a mediator, although the β weights all remained statistically significant. Thus, partial mediation was demonstrated; that is, cultural differences in dialecticism partially accounted for the cultural differences in self-monitoring.</p>

<p>There were two cultural comparisons in which cultural tightness mediated cultural differences in self-monitoring. Specifically, Japan was higher in tightness than Mexico (β = .51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which, in turn, predicted higher self-monitoring in Japan (β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) (Sobel <italic>z</italic> = 2.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). After the inclusion of tightness as a mediator, the path coefficient (β) relating culture to self-monitoring was reduced from .71 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to .65 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, Japan was higher in tightness than the Philippines (β = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which, in turn, predicted higher self-monitoring in Japan (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) (Sobel <italic>z</italic> = 2.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). After the inclusion of tightness as a mediator, the path coefficient (β) relating culture to self-monitoring was reduced from .41 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to .28 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>The significant differences between Mexicans and Japanese in implicit trait (vs. contextual) beliefs was partially mediated by both dialecticism and the I-C difference score. Specifically, Japan was higher than Mexicans in dialecticism (β = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which, in turn, predicted weaker trait beliefs (β = −.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in Japan (Sobel <italic>z</italic> = −2.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). After the inclusion of dialecticism as a mediator, the path coefficient relating culture to trait beliefs was reduced from −.31 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to −.22 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Also, Mexico was higher than Japan in individualism (i.e., the I-C difference score) (β = −.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which, in turn, led to stronger trait beliefs in Mexico (β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) (Sobel <italic>z</italic> = −2.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). After the inclusion of individualism as a mediator, the path coefficient relating culture to trait beliefs was slightly reduced from −.31 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to −.28 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Finally, modest partial mediation of the differences between Mexicans and Japanese in lay dispositionism was demonstrated. Specifically, Japan was higher than Mexico in dialecticism (β = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which, in turn, modestly predicted reduced dispositionism in Japan (β = −.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) (Sobel <italic>z</italic> = −2.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). After the inclusion of dialecticism as a mediator, the path coefficient relating culture to dispositionism was slightly reduced from −.42 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to −.38 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>In summary, Hypothesis 8 received some support because some of the cultural dimensions partially mediated cultural differences in aspects of traitedness in a manner consistent with cultural psychology theory. Overall, dialecticism was a more consistent mediator than individualism (vs. collectivism) and tightness, and mediation was more successful for self-monitoring than the other aspects of traitedness. Given our use of PCC measures, a sample interpretation of a mediation effect, referring to the top example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022022111428514">Figure 4</xref>, would be as follows: Japanese, more than Americans, perceive their culture to be dialectical and this greater dialecticism of the Japanese culture leads to, or is associated with, greater self-monitoring in Japanese respondents. The validity of this interpretation assumes that the respondents’ perceptions, as assessed with the PCC measures, accurately characterize the dialecticism of the respective cultures and that respondents’ perceptions of their own self-monitoring accurately reflects the extent to which they actually adapt their behavior to be situationally appropriate. Otherwise, the mediation effect merely indicates that respondents who <italic>perceive</italic> their culture as dialectical also <italic>perceive</italic> their behavior as adaptive to the situation, which is not a direct test of the cultural psychology hypothesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We had three goals in this study. First, we wished to replicate or improve on our previous findings regarding cultural differences in implicit theories and self-perceptions of traitedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>). Second, we sought to determine whether measuring these constructs with alternative formats, especially forced choice, would yield results more consistent with theory than obtained with Likert-type scales. Third, we tested additional cultural dimensions, assessed using a PCC approach, as mediators of cultural differences in traitedness.</p>
<sec id="section47-0022022111428514">
<title>Cultural Differences in Implicit Theories and Self-Perceptions of Traitedness</title>
<p>One important finding, consistent with our hypothesis, was that implicit trait beliefs were endorsed by participants in all four cultural groups. This finding is consistent with trait theory and suggests that all cultural groups believe that traits have some longitudinal stability, cross-situational consistency, and predictive validity, and can be inferred from behavior. This finding does not simply follow from the universal existence of trait terms in all languages, because trait terms can be used to label or describe behaviors without necessarily implying that traits are stable, consistent, or predictive of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022111428514">Saucier &amp; Goldberg, 2001</xref>, p. 848). Rather, in our integrated trait and cultural psychology perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428514">Church, 2000</xref>), we have argued that the existence of universal and heritable traits with adaptive significance, combined with an ecological-realist perspective on person perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111428514">Baron &amp; Misovich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111428514">Funder, 1995</xref>), will underlie a degree of traitedness or consistency of behavior in all cultures. Implicit trait beliefs then develop through observation and recognition of this trait-related consistency.</p>
<p>The hypothesized cultural differences were also largely observed. Americans, followed by Mexicans, averaged substantially higher than Filipinos and Japanese in trait beliefs. Participants in the two Asian cultures—the Philippines and especially Japan—endorsed the dispositionist philosophy less than the situationist philosophy, whereas participants in the two North American cultures endorsed the dispositionist philosophy more than, or as much as, the situationist philosophy. Finally, the observed cultural differences in self-monitoring again contrasted the Asian and North American cultures, with Japanese averaging highest in self-monitoring, followed by Filipinos, Americans, and Mexicans, in that order. The lowest self-monitoring of the Mexicans replicates our previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428514">Church et al., 2006</xref>) with a new measurement format (i.e., forced-choice).</p>
<p>The greater similarity of the Mexicans to the Americans, as compared to the Filipinos and Japanese, on all three traitedness measures provides consistent evidence that reduced traitedness may apply more narrowly to Asian cultures than to collectivistic cultures generally. This conclusion is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022111428514">Malloy et al.’s (2004)</xref> contention that one cannot draw conclusions about trait consistency solely from the collectivism of the culture. These researchers noted specifically that Mexicans, unlike Chinese, have general prescriptions for social behavior that lead to considerable trait consistency and that both Mexicans and Americans are socialized to evaluate others in terms of traits. Indeed, Mexican psychologists have expended considerable effort on the construction of trait measures, which may indicate that they view traits as important in understanding Mexican personality and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111428514">Díaz-Loving, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022022111428514">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative possibility—which would preserve the hypothesized link between individualism and traitedness—is that Mexican culture is, in fact, relatively individualistic. Indeed, our Mexican sample did not differ significantly from the American sample on the I-C difference score, despite the fact that participants were asked to judge their culture as a whole rather than their personal individualism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111428514">Hofstede’s (1980)</xref> data suggested that Mexicans were relatively collectivistic (ranked 32nd out of 50 countries on individualism). However, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022022111428514">Schwartz’s (2002)</xref> more recent value data, Mexico is actually slightly above the combined-country means for the Intellectual Autonomy value and the Autonomy-Embeddedness dimension that is most related to individualism-collectivism. In a meta-analytic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022111428514">Morling and Lamoreaux (2008)</xref> found that cultural products (e.g., advertising, popular texts) in the United States were more individualistic than those in several Asian countries but not those in Mexico. Finally, in a recent cross-cultural study of self-concepts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022022111428514">Santamaría, de la Mata, Hansen, and Ruiz (2010)</xref> found that Mexicans, more than Danes, described themselves in terms of personal attributes, including traits, and noted that an autonomous self is emerging from socioeconomic development and urbanization in traditionally collectivistic cultures such as Mexico.</p>
<p>The modest and inconsistent individual-level correlations relating implicit theories and self-monitoring are of interest. The cultural mean differences for these constructs generally conformed to theory or expectations, suggesting that the modest correlations are not due to problems with the measures themselves. To some extent, the modest correlations may reflect the fact that the implicit theory measures are broader in content than the self-monitoring measure. The implicit theory instruments measure not only beliefs about cross-situational consistency—the aspect that is directly related to self-monitoring—but also beliefs about the longitudinal stability and predictive validity of traits, and the ability to infer traits from a few instances of behavior. The modest correlations may also indicate that participants’ beliefs about the traitedness of people in general (presumably in their own cultures) are not a strong predictor of how they perceive the situational adaptability of their own behavior. In future studies, it would be informative to determine whether this finding is more characteristic of college students—who may view themselves as relatively independent of cultural norms—than broader samples in the respective cultures.</p>
<p>In summary, our results provide consistent evidence that Mexicans are more similar to Americans than to Filipinos and Japanese in their levels of traitedness. However, we cannot definitively conclude whether this is due to Mexicans becoming individualistic or—as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022111428514">Malloy et al. (2004)</xref>—that traitedness can be high in collectivistic cultures depending on their prescriptions for social behavior. If the latter is the case, cultural psychology hypotheses linking collectivism to reduced traitedness will need to be revised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section48-0022022111428514">
<title>Alternative Measurement Formats</title>
<p>A significant finding was that our results based on Likert-type scale and forced-choice formats were generally similar and would not have led to substantially different conclusions. The results for the PBI did not provide a definitive case for preferring the forced-choice format over the Likert-type scales, although the Japanese results tended to favor the Likert-type scales. Conversely, the self-monitoring results for the American sample were more consistent with theory using the forced-choice format.</p>
<p>Our comparison of Likert-type and forced-choice formats produced more similar results than did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111428514">Oishi et al.’s (2005)</xref> comparison of Likert-type scales and a paired-comparison format. In their study, the Likert-type scale was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022022111428514">Triandis’s (1995)</xref> measure of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism, while the paired-comparison measure was the PCVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022111428514">Oishi, Schimmack, Diener, &amp; Suh, 1998</xref>), a measure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022022111428514">Schwartz’s (1994)</xref> values. Thus, as acknowledged by Oishi et al., “the divergent findings between these two scales . . . could be due to the difference in the constructs under study rather than method variation per se” (p. 304). In the present study, the item content was largely retained across methods, so the comparison involved primarily method, not content, differences. The generally similar results for the two methods is an encouraging finding for cross-cultural psychologists, who have long noted the potential confounding of cross-cultural mean differences with acquiescence bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022111428514">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022022111428514">van de Vijver &amp; Leung, 1997</xref>). Clearly, however, further studies comparing measurement formats, while holding content constant, are needed.</p>
<p>Our results with the individualism-collectivism measures illustrated a potential advantage of the forced-choice format. We measured perceived individualism and collectivism using Likert-type scales with no reverse-keyed items, making them susceptible to acquiescence bias. Indeed, Filipinos have been shown to be susceptible to this bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111428514">Grimm &amp; Church, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022111428514">Smith, 2004</xref>), and they averaged higher than the other cultural groups on both dimensions. The correlations between the two dimensions were also higher than one would expect, again suggesting the impact of acquiescence bias. For this reason, we focused on the I-C difference score, which conformed somewhat better to expectations. The I-C difference score measures the <italic>relative</italic> extent to which the cultures were perceived as individualistic versus collectivistic, which could be assessed more directly using a forced-choice format.</p>
<p>The forced-choice format can also address the problem of reverse-keyed items. For example, in the cultural tightness-looseness measure, the reverse-keyed (i.e., loose) items showed weak bipolarity in all four cultures. In the dialecticism measure, the reverse-keyed items showed weak bipolarity in the Mexican and Filipino samples. Since there is little conceptual reason to assess tight and loose items as separate dimensions, or dialectical and nondialectical items as separate dimensions, the relevant options could be offered in a forced-choice format.</p>
<p>Of course, there are disadvantages of forced-choice methods. For one, they only enable assessment of the <italic>relative</italic> preference of two alternatives, which is not ideal if the two tendencies can coexist in varying degrees in all individuals. In addition, forced-choice items, because they are dichotomous, contribute less to internal consistency reliability than multipoint Likert-type scale items. This disadvantage could be addressed by using multipoint scales anchored at opposite poles with the forced-choice (e.g., tight versus loose) options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022111428514">Fischer et al., 2009</xref>). It should also be noted that the reliability advantages of multipoint Likert-type scales may be illusory; acquiescence bias can inflate internal consistency reliability by contributing artifactual covariation between items. It should also be acknowledged that not all researchers view weak bipolarity in opposite-keyed items as a methodological artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111428514">Choi &amp; Choi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111428514">Hamamura et al., 2008</xref>). For example, the weak bipolarity of self-esteem items in Asian samples has been attributed to dialecticism, which is thought to make East Asians more likely than Westerners to store contradictory information about the self in their self-concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111428514">Choi &amp; Choi, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in some cases, as observed with the self-monitoring measure, the forced-choice format may accentuate cultural differences and lead to larger effect sizes. Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage is debatable and may depend on the goals of the researcher. On the one hand, Likert-type scales may enable a more graded assessment of respondents’ beliefs or attitudes, presumably leading to a more accurate assessment of the size of cultural differences. On the other hand, this may not hold when respondents’ responses confound actual attitudes and acquiescence. Also, if the researcher’s goal is to obtain a more definitive assessment of a cultural group’s <italic>relative</italic> preference for constructs such as trait versus contextual beliefs or individualism versus collectivism, the forced-choice method may better achieve this goal.</p>
<p>In summary, there are clearly tradeoffs in the use of Likert-type scales versus forced-choice measures. However, given the nontrivial problem of acquiescence bias in some cultures, we anticipate that this tradeoff will in some cases favor the forced-choice option.</p>

<title>Cultural Dimensions as Mediators</title>
<sec id="section50-0022022111428514">
<title>Mean differences</title>
<p>One condition for successful mediation is that the cultures differ in the hypothesized manner on the cultural dimensions used as mediators. Best supported was our hypothesis that Japanese, more than the other cultural groups, would describe their culture as dialectical. This is consistent with the view that dialecticism has its roots in Eastern philosophical traditions, especially Confucianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022111428514">Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022022111428514">Spencer-Rodgers, Williams, &amp; Peng, 2010</xref>). If, as discussed above, the Mexican sample is relatively individualistic, then our findings with the I-C difference score were somewhat supportive of expectations. Finally, consistent with our hypothesis, the Japanese, more than the Mexicans and Filipinos (and the Americans in the raw score comparison), described their culture as tight. However, we did not predict that Mexicans and Filipinos would describe their cultures as less tight than Americans perceived their own culture.</p>
<p>Our Mexican and Filipino results may be sensible. Although Mexicans were slightly above average in tightness in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al.’s (2011)</xref> study of 33 countries, other Latin American countries, including Venezuela and Brazil, were ranked among the most loose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022111428514">Peabody (1985)</xref> found that Filipinos are perceived by themselves, and Chinese and Japanese as relatively loose in impulse expression, one individual-level indicator of cultural looseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al., 2011</xref>). Efficiency, another proposed indicator of tightness, may be lower in Mexico and the Philippines, where the pace of life is slower and punctuality and use of time are treated more liberally than in the United States and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111428514">Andres, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111428514">Church, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022111428514">Levine &amp; Norenzayan, 1999</xref>). Finally, Mexicans and Filipinos may perceive that societal rules and laws are followed less strictly in their countries. For example, Transparency International’s 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index ranks the Philippines (134th) and Mexico (98th) as substantially more corrupt than Japan (17th) and the United States (22nd). Although somewhat speculative, these explanations for the lower perceived tightness of Mexican and Filipino society are plausible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022022111428514">5</xref></sup> In any case, the results reported here can augment the sparse data on tightness-looseness, a construct that has theoretical appeal but limited research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111428514">Carpenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111428514">Gelfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022022111428514">Triandis, 1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section51-0022022111428514">
<title>Mediation</title>
<p>Because many of the hypothesized cultural differences in traitedness and cultural dimensions were confirmed, it was possible to test for mediation in 18 combinations of a traitedness variable and a cultural dimension. Partial mediation was demonstrated for 44% of these cases. All of these cases involved comparisons of Japan with one of the other cultural groups and the majority involved dialecticism as the mediating variable. The greater effectiveness of dialecticism as a mediator, as compared to individualism-collectivism and tightness-looseness, is probably due to two factors. First, the differences between Japan and the other cultures on dialecticism were quite definitive. Second, dialecticism, more than the other two cultural dimensions, addresses inconsistency in behavior more directly. Our results are consistent with other studies involving East Asian cultures that have reported successful mediation of cultural differences using the DSS scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111428514">Boucher, Peng, Shi, &amp; Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111428514">Hamamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022022111428514">Spencer-Rodgers, Boucher, Peng, &amp; Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022022111428514">Spencer-Rodgers, Williams, &amp; Peng, 2010</xref>). Tightness and the I-C difference score also partially mediated cultural differences in some aspects of traitedness in some cultural comparisons, so these cultural dimensions also have some potential as mediators.</p>
<p>We had greater success with the PCC mediators in the present study than with the self-referent measures in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111428514">Church, 2009</xref>). This raises questions about the relative merits of PCC versus self-referent measures. On the one hand, the PCC approach may be less dependent on the representativeness of one’s samples because each participant describes the culture as a whole rather than his or her personal values or beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022022111428514">Wan, Chiu, Tam, Lee, Lau, &amp; Peng, 2007</xref>). In addition, the PCC approach should be less confounded by reference group effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022111428514">Heine et al., 2002</xref>), again because participants describe their cultures rather than their personal values relative to reference groups that may differ across cultures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a disadvantage of PCC measures is that they require more abstract judgments than self-referent measures. In addition, as noted earlier, the interpretation of mediation effects using PCC measures is somewhat indirect or inferential because we need to assume that the respondents’ perception of the culture accurately reflects the culture’s dialecticism, which then in turn impacts self-monitoring behavior. With a self-referent measure, successful mediation would indicate that perceptions of one’s <italic>own</italic> dialecticism predicted one’s self-monitoring behavior. However, using self-referent measures, we need to assume that culture can be measured by aggregating individual-level self-referent scores, which may depend, among other factors, on the representativeness of the samples. In future studies, it would be useful to include both PCC and self-referent measures to determine which type of measure (a) results in cultural mean differences that better conform to expectations and (b) is more successful as a mediator of cultural differences. In the meantime, the current study provides evidence that PCC measures can be effective as mediators.</p>
<p>Finally, cultural differences in traitedness were only partially mediated by the cultural dimensions in this study. This indicates that other cultural factors, perhaps specific to each cultural comparison, need to be identified in future research. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022111428514">Malloy et al. (2004)</xref> suggested that cultures differ in whether their prescriptions for social behavior are specific to particular interpersonal dyads, leading to greater trait variability, or generalize across a variety of interpersonal contexts, leading to greater consistency.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>A limitation of the study was our sampling of university students, limiting the generalizability of the results. A strength was our sampling of four diverse cultures, enabling comparisons beyond the United States versus East Asian contrasts that are typical in cultural psychology studies. The marginal reliability of the tightness and dialecticism measures in some cultures was a limitation but was addressed by our use of MACS analyses to estimate cultural means and path coefficients that are corrected for unreliability. The finding of only partial scalar equivalence for the cultural measures was a limitation. However, this finding resulted from our application of invariance tests that were more rigorous than typically applied in cross-cultural studies. Complete metric (i.e., loading) invariance was demonstrated for all measures. Additional strengths included replication of results using alternative measurement formats and comparison of multiple cultural dimensions as potential mediators.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we replicated, and in some cases improved on, our previous results regarding cultural differences in traitedness, using alternative measurement formats and additional cultural dimensions. Although there are tradeoffs in the use of forced-choice measures, our results suggest that they may be advantageous in some cases, particularly when acquiescence bias may confound cross-cultural comparisons. Overall, however, an important finding was that conclusions regarding cultural differences would not have changed substantially using Likert-type or forced-choice methods. Finally, measures of perceived cultural contexts show promise as an alternative to self-referent measures as mediating variables in cross-cultural studies. Overall, the results provided support for an integration of trait and cultural psychology perspectives, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between culture and personality.</p>

<p>Technically, mediation implies a causal chain from predictor to mediator to outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022111428514">Frazier, Tix, &amp; Barron, 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, many researchers, as we do here, use the mediator terminology in correlational studies in which the direction of causality cannot be definitively demonstrated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111428514">English &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022022111428514">Spencer-Rodgers, Boucher, Mori, Wang, &amp; Peng, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022022111428514">Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2004</xref>). Although we cannot definitively demonstrate the direction of causality in our mediation analyses, the implied causal sequence—culture/country to cultural dimension (e.g., dialecticism) to self-monitoring—is theoretically plausible and comparable to that used in other studies of this type.</p>
