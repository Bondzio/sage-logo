<p>Virtual reality training is well known to military personnel, but as the world becomes more complex and sophisticated, it is also being developed in medicine, sports, and the industrial environment.</p>

<p>The medical industry is changing very quickly, and human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) is playing a major role. HF/E is involved on many fronts, from patient handling to human error to systems design of electronic records, reflecting the spectrum of domains included within our profession.</p>
<p>In the operating room, the design of instruments includes packaging to ensure that the correct selection is made, that instruments can be assembled and removed easily, and that the interface between the surgeon and the instrument is ergonomic. Understanding cognitive processes throughout the system is essential to minimizing human error.</p>
<p>One area of investigation is assessing the surgeon’s workload. Russell Grant, Melody Carswell, Cindy Lio, and Brent Seales have tackled the challenging task of determining a surgeon’s cognitive reserve beyond his or her demanding primary task. The authors describe how they successfully adapted the method of an interval production secondary task, which has been used in other work environments. Furthermore, they provide a procedural approach to the method for application in other work areas.</p>
<p>Virtual reality (VR) training is well known among military personnel, but as the world becomes more complex and sophisticated, it is also being developed in medicine, sports, and the industrial environment. Nirit Gavish, Stas Krupenia, and Daniel Gopher discuss VR training in the industrial maintenance and assembly (IMA) domain. Specifically, they share the task analysis process they used to successfully develop the skills component of VR training within IMA. Contrary to other approaches in which only real-world task analyses were conducted and technological requirements considered, their approach includes a concurrent analysis of the technical and training (skill) requirements in the real-world IMA task, at the same time considering the development of the VR system.</p>
<p>Most of us are personally aware of technological advancement, as we sit all day in front of a computer. The ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard, <italic>Human Factors Engineering of Computer Workstations</italic>, remains influential in computer workstations in office environments. That being noted, however, the standard has not always been considered when designing nonoffice computer workstations. Qaisar Waraich, Thomas Mazzuchi, Shahram Sarkani, and David Rico discuss the high average of 50 mishaps every 100,000 flight hours of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in contrast to the Department of Defense human-operated aircraft average of one mishap in the same number of flight hours. The authors attribute the mishaps to HF/E factors at ground control stations. They propose that people should be assessing UAS workstations using ANSI/HFES 100-2007 as the model to make improvements.</p>
<p>Accident investigation can be highly complex, especially in the area of aircraft incidents. Many factors need to be taken into consideration, such as individual actions, technical failures, local conditions, risk controls, and organizational influences. Accident investigation technologies exist that result in detailed understanding of an incident, but authors Mark Wiggins and Renee Glass suggest the information is difficult to interpret and therefore hinders the outcomes being put into practice. Wiggins and Glass share their approach of using a conceptual technique to develop safety factor maps that visually represent a summary of events associated with accidents and incidents. They also describe how to assess the reliability and validity of the maps and report that safety factor maps are a promising method to improve accessibility of the information and ultimately to improve implementation of preventive measures.</p>
<p>Finally, in keeping with applicability across domains, Thomas Sheridan shares a thought-provoking view about the best model of human response time. He presents the argument that a lognormal probability density distribution, rather than standard normal distribution, provides a better model of human response time. Sheridan supports the discussion with examples and suggests that a lognormal distribution approach is applicable in many situations, including those experienced by air traffic controllers and pilots, as well as some situations in hospital operating rooms and in military operations.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I would like to thank Guest Editor Thomas Smith for his hard work gathering together the outstanding October 2012 special issue, “Globalization of Ergonomics.”</p>
