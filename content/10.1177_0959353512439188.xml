<abstract>
<p>This article examines how women incarcerated in provincial and federal prisons in Canada experience medicalization as the predominant form of correctional psy intervention. In order to privilege the oft ignored and typically silenced voices of incarcerated women, this article draws on life history interviews with 22 formerly incarcerated women who were living in halfway houses and working to transition from prison to the community. The analysis highlights the (over)use of prescription psychotropic medications as a governance strategy and the impact this practice has on women serving time. Participants had limited access to non-medical interventions in general, and no access to counselling services outside the purview of correctional control. The overlapping of correctional and psy interventions in the prison setting transforms psy treatment not only into a mechanism of social control, but also into a punitive and disciplinary enterprise that delegitimizes the women’s self-identified needs.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the carceral enterprise has fiercely supported the human sciences of psychiatry and psychology, largely due to their claims to be able to measure, classify and correct human behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512439188">Foucault, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512439188">Haney, 2005</xref>). As prison philosophies wax and wane between rehabilitation and punishment, psy treatment<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959353512439188">1</xref></sup> has managed to adapt and fit with the broader and ongoing correctional project of fixing/curing criminality and/or punishing wrongful behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512439188">Haney, 2005</xref>). In its current form, psy treatment in prison is primarily practised via cognitive behavioural therapy and the use of prescription psychotropic medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>). The broader societal trend of over-prescribing psychiatric medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439188">Healy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959353512439188">Ussher, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">2010</xref>) to generate a biological fix to the social ills affecting our lives is even more widespread in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353512439188">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439188">Sim, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512439188">Conrad and Schneider (1992: 34)</xref> note that medical jurisdiction has expanded to encompass deviancy:<disp-quote>
<p>When treatment rather than punishment becomes the preferred sanction for deviance, an increasing amount of behaviour is conceptualized in a medical framework as illness … this is not unexpected, since medicine has always functioned as an agent of social control, especially in attempting to ‘normalize’ illness and return people to their functioning capacity in society … In short, the particular, dominant designation of deviance has changed; much of what was badness (i.e., sinful or criminal) is now sickness.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Literally meaning ‘to make medical’, medicalization is a process through which ‘an entity’ that it is not ‘ipso facto a medical problem’, is responded to as a kind of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512439188">Conrad, 2007</xref>: 5–6). The intersection of the medical and prison industrial complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512439188">Christie, 2000</xref>) has effectively fostered what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512439188">Conrad and Schneider (1992)</xref> call ‘the medicalization of deviance’, and thus an increasing reliance on prescription psychotropic medication as the cornerstone psy treatment strategy for prisoners.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the Correctional Service of Canada literature, criminalized women are diagnosed with mental disorders in increasing numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439188">Sapers, 2009</xref>). However, there is very little data on the prescription patterns of correctional doctors and psychiatrists. The only publicly available account of the extent of prescription medication use among women prisoners shows that 87 percent of the women imprisoned in Canadian federal correctional institutions (there are no data for provincial institutions) have medication orders for both prescription and over-the-counter medications. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., (2002)</xref> use the term medication <italic>order</italic> uncritically, it is appropriate because women in prison are often required to take prescription psychiatric medications and may be punished if they refuse, a point discussed in detail below. On average, they are prescribed 4.4 different medications; 42 percent of all of the prescriptions are for psychotropic medications, and 51 percent of the incarcerated women taking psychotropics are taking two or more different types of these prescription medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>). Not only is the rate of medication orders for women prisoners higher than for women in the community, but prescription patterns are regionalized and racialized, with the highest rates of psychotropic medication use found in the Prairies where there is a disproportionate number of Aboriginal women in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>). Given the extent of psychotropic medication prescribed in the carceral setting and to situate the following analysis, I begin this article by providing context from the wider literature on the medicalization of women in prison.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0959353512439188"><title>On the medicalization of women in prison</title>
<p>It is commonly reported that women seek psy treatment more frequently than men, but also that women are more likely to be constructed as mad, irrational and in need of reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439188">Caplan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959353512439188">Ussher, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">2010</xref>). Nowhere is this more evident than the prison. Many factors contribute to the increasing numbers of women receiving psy treatment in the criminal justice system; among them are psychiatric deinstitutionalization, homelessness and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512439188">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512439188">Lamb and Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512439188">Kushel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512439188">Metraux and Culhane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959353512439188">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959353512439188">Sinha, 2009</xref>). With little documentation of mental health problems in prisons before deinstitutionalization, there is debate about the extent to which the movement led to an increase in the number of persons with mental health issues in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353512439188">Diamond et al., 2001</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512439188">Lamb and Weinberger, 2005</xref>). Some scholars argue that after deinstitutionalization prisons became a ‘dumping ground’ for those in need of mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353512439188">Etter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512439188">Metraux and Culhane, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of women diagnosed with a mental disorder in federal prisons rose by 65 percent from 1967 to 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439188">Sapers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959353512439188">Sinha, 2009</xref>). Most relevant to the present discussion is the intersection of marginality, poverty, homelessness and addiction that so many criminalized women in Canada face. With a lack of community services, many of these women engage in a cycle of drug and alcohol use, homelessness, sex work and short terms of incarceration in local jails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512439188">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512439188">Kushel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959353512439188">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>). These jails serve as <italic>de facto</italic> detox centres and shelters for women with few accessible community services and who have little financial or personal means of support. Due to a number of experiences, including but not limited to drug and alcohol use, maltreatment, poverty, human rights abuses and violence, many women experience distress (often conceptualized by psy vocabulary as depression and anxiety) and anger when they enter the system. As a result of these feelings, women are often reconstructed as either difficult to manage or mad, both of which sanction treatment with prescription psychotropic medication in carceral settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>In Canada, provincial institutions have no rehabilitative or educational programming (such as anger management, substance use treatment, parenting or other life skills development) and sparse therapeutic counselling, thus becoming little more than holding cells for women who cycle in and out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006b</xref>). While prisoners can request to see a psychologist (for counselling) or a psychiatrist (for assessment, diagnosis and prescription medication), a lack of provincial funding and an increasing prison population culminate in long wait lists, no continuity of care, and the use of psychotropic medication as the predominant form of psy intervention. The situation is somewhat better in federal institutions because they have more staff and funding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959353512439188">2</xref></sup> the Correctional Service of Canada literature discursively constructs federal programming as a way to rehabilitate, treat or empower women; for example, the federal correctional Mental Health Strategy for Women states:<disp-quote>
<p>Treatment programs and services are designed to meet the specific needs of women offenders while acknowledging personal autonomy, connection to others, and positive mutually respectful relationships; women offenders must be involved in their assessment and mental health treatment such that they play as active a role as possible in their treatment planning and in decision-making. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>: 12)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While the Correctional Service of Canada claims to involve women in treatment planning and decision making, feminist criminologists are critical of prison administrators who endorse medicalization and cognitive-behavioural programming as a way to feminize women by (re)making them into ‘respectable ladies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512439188">Carlen and Worrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>). Federal psy treatment is widely criticized for reconstructing women’s needs (defined in terms of substance use treatment, housing, work skills, education, child care, medical and mental health services, and other social supports) as risk factors for potential recidivism upon release and as resistant or threatening behaviour (to themselves or to others) while in prison. By so doing, the Correctional Service of Canada justifies responding to these behaviours with disciplinary and security measures such as time in segregation or parole refusal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Criminalized women are often described as being high in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>). In order to avoid the conflation of need with risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2006</xref>) we may engage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">Ussher’s (2010)</xref> critical realist epistemological standpoint that acknowledges the reality of women’s emotional distress but rejects the discursive construction of mental illness labels such as depression. Such diagnoses depoliticize and fail to adequately account for the sociopolitical, cultural, and thus structural basis for the distress women experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">Ussher’s (2010)</xref> position warns against pathologizing and medicalizing individual women and their ‘problems in everyday living’ (Currie, 2005 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">Ussher, 2010</xref>), which in the carceral context leads to the potential for psy to be practised in a punitive fashion.</p>
<p>Emotional suffering or distress in the carceral milieu is often related to the trauma associated with the sexual, physical and emotional victimization, poverty and addiction that women in prison have experienced at a higher rate than women in wider society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512439188">Carlen and Worrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">Sim, 2005</xref>). Incarceration also causes distress, as separation from family and especially children exacerbates feelings of loss, grief, shame and, for many women, a sense of failure in their mothering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512439188">Carlen and Worrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006b</xref>). Finally, the prison environment itself causes distress. The deprivation of liberty, constant surveillance, strip and body cavity searching, and the general lack of control over every aspect of one’s life are well documented as generating feelings of despair and hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512439188">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512439188">Rhodes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439188">Sim, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Critically examining the effects of various social and environmental factors that contribute to women’s incarceration and distress allows us to problematize the extensive use of psychotropic medication as the standard form of psy intervention in prison. While correctional discourses suggest psychotropic medications are used to alleviate mental distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>), many feminist criminologists argue that medication functions as a punitive disciplinary strategy and mode of governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512439188">Balfour, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>). Similarly, cognitive-behavioural programming utilized in correctional rehabilitative efforts often fails to change the outcomes of the prison experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439188">Carlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>), which include stigmatization and socio-structural disadvantage, family and personal disruption, disconnection from and loss of custody of children, employment difficulties, poverty and/or homelessness, substance use and criminality. Cognitive-behavioural programming is a key feature of federal corrections and meshes with the current neoliberal criminal justice climate.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512439188">Peterson (1996</xref>: 48) notes, ‘calls upon the individual to enter into the process of their own self-governance through processes of endless self-examination, self-care, and self-improvement’. While correctional discourses suggest that rehabilitative and treatment efforts attempt to manage health through the development of individual responsibility (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>), they actually create new methods of intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512439188">Foucault, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512439188">Peterson, 1996</xref>). In prison, self-governance is a misnomer, as correctional administrators prepare correctional plans that outline the risk management strategy for each prisoner and that invariably include interventions such as medication <italic>orders</italic> or <italic>mandatory</italic> cognitive-behavioural programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>). More precisely, a correctional plan ‘specifies those interventions and monitoring techniques required to address areas associated with the risk to re-offend’ (Correctional Service of Canada, n.d.). The Correctional Service of Canada promotes its programme interventions as ‘inclusive’, ‘empowering’, ‘gender-responsive’ and ‘women-centred’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>). However, the mandatory nature of the correctional plan demonstrates some of the problems with maintaining a therapeutic agenda within such a coercive and disciplinary environment. According to Canadian correctional discourses, self-governance appears to be conceptualized as a prisoner’s willingness and ability to unquestioningly follow correctional directives, including taking prescribed medication and other required psy interventions. My research aims to uncover how women experienced psy care during incarceration and their feelings about the mandatory nature of prescription psychotropics in the carceral environment. Next, I discuss the parameters and methods used to conduct the study.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0959353512439188"><title>The study</title>
<p>The research reported in this article is based on 22 face-to-face life history interviews with formerly incarcerated women in Canada. While I also conducted interviews with four social workers that work with criminalized women in the community, in this article I primarily draw on the data gleaned from the interviews with the 22 former prisoners in order to foreground the women’s voices that are otherwise silenced throughout their engagement with psy treatment in prison. Ethical clearance was provided by Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, where I was a doctoral candidate at the time. Of the 22 participants, eight had served time in federal prison and 14 had served time in provincial prison. Federal prisoners serve two years or more for more serious offences and violent crimes against a person and their care is the responsibility of federal authorities. Provincial prisoners serve up to two years less a day for less serious offences and the Provinces are responsible for their care. All eight women who served federal prison time had also served provincial prison time. Interviews were conducted in the province of Ontario between May and October 2006 and the sample paralleled the overrepresentation of Aboriginal or First Nations women in Canadian prisons (nine were First Nations or Aboriginal and 13 were white).</p>
<p>This article focuses on one component of those interviews, namely participant experiences of psy treatment within the carceral context. I began the project by securing access to a community-based halfway house for criminalized women with the approval of the Executive Director of the agency. I then conducted observational fieldwork for the better part of five months in 2006. I spent approximately 15–20 hours a week in the house, informally meeting with staff and the women and conducting the in-depth interviews. I used journaling as a method of keeping field notes, a daily practice that I maintained throughout the observational fieldwork as well as after conducting each interview. This allowed me to understand the daily practices of the halfway house, the extension of carceral surveillance from the prison to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512439188">Kilty and DeVellis, 2010</xref>) and the lasting impact of incarceration as women reintegrate post-incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353512439188">Shantz et al., 2009</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, my presence in the house helped me to build a sense of rapport and trust with the women I interviewed.</p>
<p>The interviews, ranging in length from one and a half to four and a half hours, were transcribed verbatim and coded using NVivo qualitative analysis software. I followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959353512439188">Strauss and Corbin’s (1998)</xref> flexible coding procedure and conducted four rounds of coding in order to identify the core themes and related subthemes woven throughout participant narratives. The first round of open coding allowed me to organize the data according to line-by-line conceptualizations that, in the second round of coding, were examined so as to note the relationships and contradistinctions between concepts. Once these connections were identified, a third round of coding allowed me to draw out and select core themes to use as the lens through which to code and re-examine the data (interview transcripts, field notes, and memos). The fourth round of coding, described as theoretical coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959353512439188">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>), weaves the different concepts together to formulate more cohesive theoretical explanations of the different themes. Conducting four rounds of coding encouraged constant comparison of the data (themes/concepts and sub-themes/concepts), and allowed me to move back and forth between the data, theme generation and the eventual development of theoretical explanations. By exploring women’s experiences of psy-care in prison, this research came to document their experiences of medicalization and how this practice is used to govern women in prison.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0959353512439188"><title>Power and prescription practices</title>
<p>Women are prescribed more psychotropic medications than men, both in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439188">Caplan, 1995</xref>; Healey, 2003) and in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439188">Sim, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">2005</xref>). Prescribing psychotropic medication in the prison setting is particularly problematic given the hierarchical relationship between psy and correctional mandates – where psy care is executed through a correctional system that inherently prioritizes security and carceral power over therapeutic care. Due to the fact that provincial and federal correctional systems are responsible for providing mental health care to prisoners a power imbalance exists between psy and medical experts and the correctional administrators to whom they are accountable and the prisoner-patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">Sim, 2005</xref>). It is important to remember that a prisoner’s ability to refuse medication is not always guaranteed; medication orders are often written into the prisoner’s correctional plan and thus become compulsory. Moreover, like closed psychiatric facilities, federal and provincial correctional services reserve the right to forcibly inject medication in specific situations, for example when a prisoner-patient is highly resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439188">Sapers, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, the prescription medication most commonly discussed by participants was Seroquel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959353512439188">3</xref></sup> According to the manufacturer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959353512439188">4</xref></sup> Seroquel is anti-psychotic medication, useful as a mono-drug-therapy or as an adjunct to the drugs lithium or divalproex for the treatment of schizophrenia and the acute manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. There are several common and rare side effects recognized and reported by the manufacturer of Seroquel. Some of the more common side effects include: dry mouth, sedation, somnolence, dizziness, constipation, elevated levels of SGPT,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0959353512439188">5</xref></sup> dyspepsia, lethargy and weight gain. Some participants reported negative experiences that they attributed as side effects of the medication, including: dreams of using drugs that caused them to wake up with intense cravings; urinating while they slept due to an inability to wake up; and ‘vivid’ and ‘intense’ nightmares that left them feeling anxious and poorly rested.</p>
<p>The manufacturer recommends that all patients prescribed Seroquel ‘should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for treatment beyond the acute response’. None of the participants noted being reassessed at a later date; in fact, many claimed that they only met with the psychiatrist or prison physician upon entry into prison. Despite this recommendation, 21 of the 22 women participants were prescribed Seroquel while incarcerated, while only one received a psychiatric diagnosis of bipolar disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0959353512439188">6</xref></sup> While off-label prescribing may not be uncommon, lack of reassessment or follow-up is problematic. For example, Cate, who spent over a year and a half in a local jail before pleading guilty<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0959353512439188">7</xref></sup> and being sent to a federal prison, stated:<disp-quote>
<p>[In the local jail] they put us all on medication. Whatever I wanted. I was on so many different kinds of meds in there. They told me I was schizophrenic and they had me on a whole bunch of things for that. I had never been told that before; I’m not schizophrenic, I was just coming down off of crystal meth and morphine and whatever else I was doing on the street. I don’t even know how the psychiatrist diagnosed me because I just saw him for like 10 minutes and he told me he was giving me Seroquel and these other meds. I never saw him again after that.</p></disp-quote>Cate indicated that the doctor did not observe her for any period of time before prescribing Seroquel in conjunction with ‘other med[ication]s’. The doctor’s quick reference to Seroquel conflicts with the drug manufacturer’s instruction to engage in ongoing reassessment and to use the drug to alleviate symptoms associated with acute manic or depressive episodes. Cate’s account corroborated what participants described as a’ more is better’ medication philosophy operating in the federal prison system that is used to sedate women as a way to manage them. Reiterating Cate’s claim that ‘they put us all on medication’, Stacey stated: ‘I was on meds like Seroquel, stuff like that. They gave me so much of that it’s hard to remember things. You’re just so out of it.’ Participants noted that Seroquel left them feeling ‘as though I slept through my time’, ‘dozy’, ‘sleepy’, ‘out of it’ and ‘groggy.’ Darla discussed Seroquel at length, stating:<disp-quote>
<p>When I went inside, they gave me Seroquel because I couldn’t sleep. But how can you sleep in there? It’s loud, it’s cold, you’re scared and depressed and away from your family. I just thought they gave out too much of that shit, you know? They heavily medicate people in prison so you don’t cause any disturbances. Seroquel made me sleep like 10 or 12 hours a day and then when I was awake I was still all groggy and dozy, like out of it. I was like a walking zombie. Which is sometimes good in prison because then you don’t think so much about where you are. When I stopped taking Seroquel on the outside I actually couldn’t sleep, it was like I had to wean myself off it rather than go cold turkey.</p></disp-quote>Interestingly, several participants used the same phrase – ‘walking zombies’ – to describe how they felt after taking Seroquel, with its sedative effect experienced and noted by all of the 21 participants who were prescribed it. Seroquel appears to be the drug of choice not only in federal prison but also in provincial jails and prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512439188">Richardson, 2010</xref>). Dru served nearly two years in Vanier Centre for Women, the Ontario provincial women’s prison, and declared: ‘Yeah, Seroquel is the new med. Ta da! Everybody, here you go! Candy! It’s the culture in there’; and Tammy, who worked as the discharge planner in a provincial detention centre in Ontario, claimed:<disp-quote>
<p>The institution is quick to dispense medication. All it really takes is an appointment with a doctor and you’re prescribed medication. I mean, when I do discharge planning in there and the nurse comes by dispensing meds, I don’t think there is ever one woman in the group I’m seeing that wasn’t getting medication … They keep the women medicated to keep them sedated and less resistant.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Echoing Tammy’s assertion that carceral management uses medication to sedate women in order to more easily govern a population constructed as risky, Jane described her experiences of medical intervention at the detention centre where Tammy worked. She specifically discussed the sedative effects of Seroquel:<disp-quote>
<p>We’re just on a whole bunch of medication. Seroquel is something they use often in there. My cellmate and I would get our Seroquel and then pass out like 10 minutes later – you know, be out for like 12 hours. Just gone. I’d rather be asleep than just sitting there doing nothing. They have nothing for us in there.</p></disp-quote>Jane’s statement that ‘they have nothing for us in there’ refers to the lack of programming in provincial jails. In this particular detention centre, the women were overcrowded to the point of being double and even triple bunked<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0959353512439188">8</xref></sup> in their cells, with no rehabilitative or educational programming or activity. They are permitted to watch one television shared between 50–80 women during restricted and specified hours.</p>
<p>Despite the frequency with which psychotropic medications are prescribed in carceral settings, participants nevertheless noted that some doctors would deny them the medications they were taking in the community, when entering the prison, or following their transfer from a different institution. According to participants, denial of psychotropic medications happened most often in provincial institutions. For example, upon her arrival the medical doctor refused Shannon the anti-anxiety medication (Clonazepam) that she had been taking for the year leading up to her incarceration:<disp-quote>
<p>When I went in I was taking Clonazepam and the doctor took it away from me. He said, ‘you don’t need that’. Well I thought I was going crazy because I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t breathe, things were flashing. I guess I was having withdrawal because I had taken them for so long and they just said automatically, ‘you don’t need them anymore’. I kept saying, ‘I need to see the psychiatrist. The doctor won’t let me see him.’ And she [social worker] goes, ‘well you know if I make an appointment for you to see him, don’t think you’re getting any medication off of him’. I said, ‘I need to talk to somebody, don’t you understand that?’ I kept saying to her, ‘don’t you understand? Look at me, don’t you understand?’</p></disp-quote>Shannon was granted access to the prison psychiatrist only when she ‘became hysterical’ and was unable to calm down. Soon after her arrival in prison, and as a part of her sentence for driving while impaired, Shannon was offered admission to a residential substance abuse treatment centre. At the treatment centre, she was again prescribed the Clonazepam she was taking in the community and continued to take the anti-psychotic drug Seroquel prescribed to her in prison. Upon her transfer back to the prison, she was caught in a prescription battle:<disp-quote>
<p>The social worker kept saying that they were mixing me a cocktail at the treatment centre and that the doctor doesn’t like it. So the doctor took away my medicine and eventually they sent me to the psychiatrist because I was flipping. The psychiatrist said, ‘Obviously you and the doctor have locked horns. I’ll give you your medication and if you don’t have to go to the doctor for anything – don’t.’ The next day the doctor found out that the psychiatrist had given me my medication and it was gone. I put in a request – request after request after request to see the doctor, and he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t answer any of my requests. So I had everything taken away, they took me off everything, cold turkey. There was nothing else for me inside; no counselling, no peer support, no programming. They have more opportunities for that kind of thing in federal.</p></disp-quote>It is notable that so many women are medicalized upon entering the prison system, and yet Shannon, who had a positive and working relationship with a psychiatrist in the community, was denied access to the medications that she and that doctor felt were helpful. Given the subjective nature of medicine, it is unsurprising that Shannon received different prescriptions from four separate medical professionals: the prison medical doctor, the prison psychiatrist, the psychiatrist at the treatment centre, and her psychiatrist or medical doctor in the community.</p>
<p>When reflecting upon her time spent in the same institution, Kellie stated:<disp-quote>
<p>They took me off my scripts that I’d been on for two years! They said it was addictive. I said, ‘excuse me, I’ve been on them for two years, you can’t fucking do this to me!’ And they said, ‘Oh well, we’ll wean you off and put you on something else.’ Bullshit.</p></disp-quote>Kellie noted that the doctor did not take her off the psychotropic medication she was taking because of its addictive nature or because of his desire to remedy over-prescription patterns, but rather because he wished to switch her to a different medication. When asked why she was upset about the change in her medications, Kellie stated that ‘prison doctors just do whatever they want; the opposite of what you were getting before you went in so that they can show you who’s boss. It’s just a way for them to show you how much control they have.’ In this light, it is possible to see how this kind of medical treatment within the prison, which allows more absolute powers to prescribe and control treatment can negatively affect the patient-prisoner by eroding trust in their doctor, which is already limited in the prison context.</p>
<p>Participants noted that changing or denying medication was not limited to psychiatric prescriptions, but extended to blood pressure medication and over-the-counter pain medication as well:<disp-quote>
<p>It was bad, they took me right off my meds and they took me off my blood pressure medicine. Oh no, they were not nice up there at all. They said my blood pressure was fine, that I didn’t need it. I had been on it for years. I even took a packet plus a prescription with me of my blood pressure medicine so that I could continue taking it, and they refused to give it to me. They just said I didn’t need it, they said my blood pressure was normal. I said, ‘Yeah it’s normal, cause I’ve been on this medication for years.’ (Darla)</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s the culture. But the nurses shouldn’t be refusing people Tylenol. Nobody is gonna OD on a few tablets of Tylenol. You know, if somebody has a headache or they have their menses and they can’t get something to deal with the pain, it’s absolutely stupid. (Danielle)</p></disp-quote>In this light, denying medication reflects the culture of control described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353512439188">Garland (2001)</xref>. The ability to allocate medication is a practice that denotes status and power based on psy-medico expertise that prisoners, with their limited rights and criminalized status are discouraged from understanding.</p>
<p>Given the common problems associated with prison overcrowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512439188">Christie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512439188">Human Rights Watch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439188">Langner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512439188">Richardson, 2010</xref>) and the absence of activities to keep prisoners occupied in provincial jails and prisons, it is not surprising that psychotropic medication is used to sedate prisoners to try and maintain a subdued or calm environment within the prison unit. However, prescribing anti-psychotic medication such as Seroquel to sedate women appears to violate not only manufacturer guidelines but also the women’s rights to health care and security. The power to prescribe and deny medication maintains the hierarchy between correctional staff and prisoners that is also exemplified by the fact that prisoners are coerced and even forced to take psychiatric medications; enacted in this way the power to prescribe and deny medication can act as a mechanism of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512439188">Richardson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439188">Rose, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439188">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439188">Sim, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959353512439188">Ussher, 1991</xref>). This coercion runs contrary to the neoliberal correctional discourses that emphasize self-governance and empowered participation in mental health decision making (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec4-0959353512439188"><title>The fallacy of self-governance in prison psy treatment: A brief note on misinformed consent,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0959353512439188">9</xref></sup> and no rights to refuse treatment</title>
<p>The highly governed and isolated nature of the carceral environment can impact how different medical professionals practice medicine in prison. While it is common for doctors to request a new patient’s past medical files, a number of complications arise in prisons that prevent this from happening. Many women who serve short sentences and cycle in and out the system have transient lifestyles and no regular doctor or permanent address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512439188">Kushel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512439188">Metraux and Culhane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959353512439188">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>). This situation makes it difficult, time consuming, and sometimes impossible to transfer their medical records. Nevertheless, women are commonly given psychotropic medication at intake, which suggests that prison doctors and psychiatrists do not utilize the recommended period of observation required to make a psychiatric diagnosis before prescribing psychotropic medication. This fact suggests that the correctional system’s main concern is not mental health care, but institutional security, which largely consists of attempting to eliminate risks of self-harm or harm to others – in ways that are often to the detriment of women’s broader needs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0959353512439188">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 2001</xref>). For example, to prevent women from engaging in self-injurious behaviour, those who cut themselves are strip-searched and segregated, which for many exacerbates rather than eliminates the self-harming behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2006</xref>, in press).</p>
<p>As correctional administrators focus on security, psy professionals end up functioning primarily as agents of correctional control. Participants described the taking of medication as mandatory, lest they be denied privileges or punished with time in segregation. Kellie’s experience of applying for parole demonstrates how imprisoned women have a limited ability or right to refuse treatment:<disp-quote>
<p>I had to go back on all of those meds. They had me on, um, three different prescriptions at the same time. I had to go back on them because after I originally went out I was breached. So they said that if I wanted to go out again [to be released on parole] that I had to go back on my meds.</p></disp-quote>By mandating that she take the prescription psychotropics in order to be released again, correctional discourses are at least partially attributing Kellie’s breach of parole, for being out of the city without the permission of her parole officer, to her failure to continue taking the medication during her initial release. Similarly, when discussing her federal parole requirements, Stacey stated: ‘I wanted to be released, so I took the fucking pills.’ Stacey’s comment shows the systemic constraints on her ability to make an agentic decision about whether to take prescription psychotropics, and how the nature of correctional discourses and practices coerce women into participating in their own medicalization. In these cases, women comply with medication orders to achieve another end – such as parole release, reunification with their children and families, or to be accepted into halfway houses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512439188">Kilty and DeVellis, 2010</xref>). While prisoners can technically refuse medication, this decision may result in being designated as difficult to manage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat and Shaw, 2001</xref>), or subject to institutional sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512439188">Arrigo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512439188">Rhodes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439188">Sapers, 2009</xref>), and can affect their chances of parole or release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512439188">Kilty and DeVellis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the coercive nature of medication orders in prison and the overly large caseloads (typically only one psychologist and/or psychiatrist for the entire prison), it is not surprising that psy professionals often fail to offer adequate health education to prisoner-patients. While doctors have a duty to inform patients about the benefits and potential side effects of the medications they prescribe in order to help the patient make an informed decision about treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512439188">Cloutier-Steele, 2003</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512439188">Peterson, 1996</xref>), this does not seem to happen when the medication is ordered and incorporated into the prisoner’s correctional plan. In practice, this research revealed that little informed individual decision making regarding prescription psychotropic medication or other psy interventions (i.e. programming, counselling) occurs in prison psy treatment. Participants had little knowledge about the medications they were required to take and many felt they were uninformed about their diagnoses. For example, Brooke stated:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like they don’t want you to get better. How do you get better if they won’t even tell you what is wrong with you? All they do is prescribe you some medications and send you on your way. We always felt like we were in the dark about that stuff. And how can you move forward that way? It’s like they treat you like a kid that can’t handle the diagnosis.</p></disp-quote>Brooke’s narrative illustrates the divisive power of psy-expertise and its impact on an individual’s rights. Given the coercive and hierarchical nature of the correctional environment, psy-expertise contributes to the creation of a boundary between doctor and prisoner-patient that is built on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512439188">Cloutier-Steele (2003)</xref> calls ‘misinformed consent’. This leaves prisoners feeling alone and isolated from their treatment or rehabilitation. Ultimately, this approach does not encourage, enable or allow criminalized women to fulfil the correctional goal of becoming self-governing citizens. Despite what the women may want, they are only able to manage their psy-health to the extent that they follow the correctional treatment plan created for them by correctional authorities.</p></sec></sec>

<p>A growing number of individuals are medicalized in the criminal justice system, where the use of psychotropic medication exists as the primary form of psy treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512439188">Arrigo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512439188">Balfour, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512439188">Kendall, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512439188">Rhodes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439188">Sim, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439188">Sapers, 2009</xref>).

<p>While provincial prisons have no substantive rehabilitative or educational programming, federal prisons have cognitive-behavioural programming available for substance use, surviving violence, parenting, education, and employability and social integration. These programmes are designed by correctional researchers and delivered by federal prison staff; this structure fuses treatment goals with the institutional priorities of punishment and security. Treatment, then, becomes interwoven with risk rather than therapeutic discourses. Participants noted that they did not feel comfortable with prison psychologists because they represented and were thus responsible to the prison, not their patient:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t trust them. Prison doctors. Psychologists. They all work for the system. They get paid by the prison. They aren’t there for me and my best interests. How can I talk about things with someone who reports to the system keeping me locked up? I need support but I need it from the other women inside, from my family and friends, but also from counsellors and professional people like that that work outside of the prison and that knows about what us women in prison need, and what we go through. Otherwise I’m just being told to do something or to think some way that the prison wants you to.</p></disp-quote>Participants repeatedly suggested the need for community-based non-medical interventions. Feminist criminologists and psychologists have argued for 20 years for a separation of counselling and treatment from corrections to, among other things, prevent women from being placed in segregation following a self-injurious incident or from receiving institutional charges that lengthen their sentence for swearing, self-harming or resisting carceral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512439188">Heney,1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512439188">Kendall, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439188">Pollack and Kendall (2005: 80)</xref> claim that feminist mental health care that functions outside correctional control:<disp-quote>
<p>acknowledges the reality of the psychological distress and difficulties of women given personality disorder diagnoses, it simultaneously de-privileges psychiatric discourse, concretely deals with issues of power in the therapeutic relationship and within the context of service delivery, and explores the relationship between social inequalities and psychological distress.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With no separation between the carceral system and psy treatment, therapeutic intervention problematically remains based within the realm of, and thus linked to, punishment. It is important to problematize the relationship between corrections and psy because the correctional focus on security limits the prison’s ability to be an efficient arbiter of psy treatment. This inefficiency is partially exemplified by the shortage of counselling services and lengthy periods of time prisoners are made to wait to see a psychologist or psychiatrist (to which they are supposed to have access). A number of participants described their efforts to seek non-therapeutic counselling as a fruitless effort. Laura stated that despite serving time in jail on and off for eight years and submitting countless requests, she never met with a psychologist or a psychiatrist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0959353512439188">11</xref></sup> Kellie stated that it sometimes took so long following her initial request to see a mental health care professional that ‘by the time the request is processed, you no longer feel like speaking to them’. Similarly, Cassie stated, ‘it’s hard to get to see them – sometimes you have to put in like ten requests to get in to see them’. Participants explained that this shift in desire to see a doctor was either because they had learned to cope with the issue or because they now had an aversion to seeing the physician they were made to wait so long to have access to. While non-therapeutic counselling is difficult to access, as aforementioned, participants expressed that this form of care should be removed from the purview of correctional management.</p>
<p>Restricted access is due to the large caseloads of the few psy professionals working in prisons, but it also illustrates the reconstruction of counselling as a privilege rather than a right. Betty, a federally sentenced woman, stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know how they got to the point where they were giving me these meds because I didn’t see no doctor, no shrink. It must be from all the questions they asked me at intake, but really, I’m freaking out because I’m going to the pen and some guy that just met me asks how I am feeling takes that as I must need medication. I wanted to talk to my friends or someone supportive … I didn’t want to talk to someone who was going to put what I said into the computer so it would be used against me later. They read things into what you tell them.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact that incarcerated women find it difficult to meet with psy professionals for counselling, but are given psychotropic medication so prevalently, demonstrates the unbalanced nature of psy treatment in prison. Criminalized women, like women in wider society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439188">Caplan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959353512439188">Ussher, 1991</xref>), cannot contest a clinical diagnosis or prescription because they are treated as inherently lacking the ability to think rationally. In addition to the lack of available counselling services, participants stated that when they could see a psychologist, therapy was off-putting because the doctors failed to engage with them. As Darla indicated, ‘Nobody listened to what I said I needed. I was just given medication. How could I trust a shrink who doesn’t really talk to me or pay attention to me?’ Julie spoke about her experience in federal prison:<disp-quote>
<p>I find that if they are mentally disturbed that they should not be sent to prison though. The only way they deal with them is by medicating them. They are just walking around like zombies. I mean they’ve only got one shrink in the whole place, you know? It took me three months to get to see them. And putting in a request, that’s useless because you don’t get the response. And then you’re waiting, waiting, waiting. They just sit on things. And they got a file on you, that thick, and you know, where did it all come from, you know? It seems like when you’re finally talking to them, they are typing more than what you’re saying.</p></disp-quote>While incarcerated women cannot review their files, Julie stated that the psychiatrist or psychologist would read her file in front of her whenever they met, and that it was approximately two inches thick. The tradition of using private notes to monitor treatment is a common psy and medical practice that maintains a hierarchy between doctor and patient. Comparatively, however, this practice may have a devastating impact in the carceral context. A prisoner’s files contain information on criminal history, psychiatric care, institutional (mis)behaviour, drug use and addiction, and information on their family, friends and criminal associates. These institutional files exist as ‘living documents’ that track, historicize and follow prisoners throughout their engagement with different facets of the criminal justice system, and they may impact correctional governance strategies at different stages of carceral surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512439188">Kilty and DeVellis, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Resisting or refusing to take medication or participate in cognitive-behavioural programming will be noted in the women’s institutional files, which are referred to by correctional authorities when making decisions about institutional infractions, during court sentencing, and by the National Parole Board. Again demonstrating the bleeding of the notions of risk into those of therapy, several participants described their fear of disclosing too much to a psychiatrist or counsellor that works for and is thus responsible to the correctional system. For many women, this fear necessitated self-censorship in their dialogue with therapists, doctors and counsellors. Demonstrating why correctional-based therapy cannot work, Brooke, a former federal prisoner, stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I had to see counsellors and things when I was released, like it’s part of my parole. But it’s hard, I have to be careful what I say to them you know because they work for the prison and I don’t want anything to get misunderstood. You know, like you don’t want to tell someone who can send you back that you are afraid of using or something.</p></disp-quote>The women’s awareness of the impact their files can have in terms of their release does not bode well for a positive therapeutic relationship. Given that prisoners earn parole release more quickly if they participate in rehabilitative programmes, some may be involved with therapy for this reason, rather than for a real desire to attend. Professionals who offer therapeutic services in prison cannot avoid the fact that their ability to help is constrained by their duties as employees of the correctional institution, which invariably affects the degree to which women are able to form trusting relationships with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">2008</xref>). Only by removing psy intervention from the hands of the correctional system can we work to avoid coercion in treatment and work toward providing therapeutic care that more adequately addresses the needs of women prisoners.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0959353512439188"><title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>As the language, discourses, and practices of psy successfully permeate the everyday, and most certainly the domain of corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439188">Rose, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439188">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439188">Sim, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">2005</xref>), increasing numbers of lay persons and experts alike are adopting psy explanations for behaviours rooted in cultural difference and structural disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353512439188">Sim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959353512439188">Ussher, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">2010</xref>). Due mostly to the power they have to prescribe medication, medical doctors in particular have taken up a role in practising psy. The questionable diagnosis and prescription patterns in the carceral context further entrench psy in correctional discourses and undermines calls for feminist and community-based care. Today, neoliberal correctional discourses that emphasize the rational subject reconstruct prisoners as clients of psy treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512439188">Haney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512439188">Peterson, 1996</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439188">Laishes, 2002</xref>). Yet criminalized women fear reprisal should they refuse medications deemed a component of their correctional plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat and Shaw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512439188">Kilty and DeVellis, 2010</xref>). Requiring women to take medication as a component of their correctional and/or parole release plans surreptitiously denies them the agency to participate in their own mental health governance and the ability to provide informed consent free of coercion.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to reject the medical model in the carceral context given the extent to which correctional administrators rely on prescription psychotropic medications to manage prisoners. Subsequently, it is unsurprising that many women embrace, or at least do not openly resist, the psy treatment offered to them. In this study, some participants accepted their diagnoses and treatment plans, others pretended to do so in order to be released, and fewer openly resisted psy intervention. By systematically responding to women’s distress with psychotropic medication and with the few alternative forms of non-medical intervention available, correctional administrators are actively pathologizing criminalized women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006a</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">Ussher, 2010</xref>). This suggests that psy-correctional treatment is operating on women beyond the realm of mental health by medicalizing distress that is related to complex structural disadvantages and the oppressive carceral environment. When women fail to self-govern according to the standards created by correctional demands, more punitive medical and disciplinary regimes are invoked that can violate their human rights and the Correctional Service of Canada’s own mission to ‘provide safe and humane care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439188">Sapers, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The broader trends emerging from this research include the use of medication as a technology of social control (including both prescription and denial of medication), women’s lack of the right to refuse medications, and a lack of access to non-medical therapeutic intervention. Notably, participants discussed their desire to access counsellors who do not work for corrections. It is important to distinguish between community-based initiatives built on feminist principles and those developed by corrections, as feminist forms of intervention re-centre the need for care external to that exercised within the operationalisation of penal power. It should be framed as a governmental and institutional policy issue that the very structure of correctional psy treatment violates the women’s rights not only to accessible care but also to autonomy in determining the counsellor (through corrections or an independent figure) and method of treatment (counselling versus medication).</p>
<p>While some scholars have documented that incarcerated women have never been able to determine their own manner of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat, 2001</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439188">Pollack, 2006</xref>), there is no reason to maintain an unhealthy status quo. Rather than having medical professionals determine what to do to criminalized women, discussions should include the women. Participants in this research rarely considered themselves as having a mental illness; rather, they defined their problems in living more in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353512439188">Ussher’s (2010)</xref> conceptualization of distress, which for them was related to addiction, homelessness and poverty. For these women, the connection between psy treatment and correctional control and punishment adversely affected their well-being and negatively affected their relationship with and trust of corrections and thus the state.</p>
<p>The intersection of addiction, homelessness and the ongoing effects of deinstitutionalization contribute to the growing number of women in prison, yet carceral responses remain firmly entrenched in measures of increased security and risk prediction. With punishment and security as the prison’s primary focus, the very notion of correctional-based therapy is oxymoronic. For example, the simultaneous practice of medicalization and medication denial illustrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439188">Carlen’s (2005: 422)</xref> notion of the layering of seemingly opposed penal disciplinarities (ideologies of governance) that strengthen carceral power, legitimacy, and knowledge in the broader penal body politic; where persons who question these penal disciplinarities are not seen as ‘sound’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439188">Carlen, 2005</xref>:430). Exerting psychiatric power in this way silences women and dismisses their concerns as less important than the will of the doctor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512439188">Conrad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439188">Kendall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439188">Kilty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439188">Maidment, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439188">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439188">Rose, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439188">1999</xref>). At their most dangerous, both medicalization and the denial of medication may cause distress, unnecessary pain, or even undue health risks for a prisoner who has no recourse to alternative care and treatment.</p>
<p>Despite the neoliberal emphasis on empowerment as a way to responsibilize incarcerated women, criminalized women are not truly expected to be responsible, self-governing agents of their own mental health destinies. For as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439188">Hannah-Moffat (2001</xref>: 518) writes, ‘empowerment is connected to the perception that women prisoners, like women generally, lack self-esteem and, as a result they are believed to have little power to direct their lives’. The Correctional Service of Canada considers its role to be one of presenting women with ‘responsible choices’ and of helping direct women to be able to govern themselves. Instead, this research shows how a prisoner’s ability to exercise mental health governance rests on their ability to do one of three things: (1) willingly accept their mandated correctional care; (2) accept the care offered to them in order to be released more quickly and then to take a more involved role in their own mental health decision making when in the community; or (3) resist mandated care and face potential loss of privileges, parole denial, or other penalties. While patients are free to research their own health statuses in order to make educated decisions about treatment, prisoner-patients do not have the opportunity to become so learned. In response, this research re-centered the voices of women prisoners who problematized the correctional reliance on medicalization as the primary mode of psy treatment and the limited agency they had in terms of their mental health governance in prison settings. Ultimately, participants echoed Kathleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512439188">Kendall’s (1994</xref>: 11) question about whether it is possible to have therapy behind prison walls, through their discussion of the benefits of securing support or mental health care outside the parameters of corrections.</p></sec>
