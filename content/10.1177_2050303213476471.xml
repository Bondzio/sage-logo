<p>A series of parallel developments across the world marked the end of the apparently declining significance of religion and its renewed role in the public sphere. Among these are the rise of the religious right in the United States; the demise of secular pan-Arabism and the emergence of Islamism from North and West Africa to the Pacific; the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reemergence of public religion in post-Communist societies; the end of the Cultural Revolution and the emergence of a range of religious movements in the People's Republic of China; and the declining hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America, first through Liberation Theology and then through the growth of Pentecostalism. Both secular and religious intellectuals have been at odds whether to embrace these religious movements with open arms or treat them as atavistic regressions. These conditions create the need for a new journal, which can critically assess the current landscape.</p>
<p>Religion has both positive and negative roles to play. It can galvanize people into social and religious movements or ideologically reinforce systems of domination. It can lead freedom struggles through non-violence or resort to violence and terrorism. It can play one role in opposition, but quite another once it becomes institutionalized. It can be the breeding grounds for revolutions but also the fuel behind the senseless destruction of war.</p>
<p>Social scientists and humanists have lagged behind these developments in their analyses. With religion playing a major role in the Arab Spring, the conflict between Islamists and the West, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the seemingly never-ending conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the intense debate in China over the role of religion in the public sphere, and the cultural wars in the United States between the Christian Right and the not so religious left, <italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> will attend to much of the “spirit” of our times that is too often ignored in progressive scholarship.</p>
<p><italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> is the first of its type - a journal focused exclusively on the development of a critical theoretical framework and its application to research on religion. It will provide a common venue not only to those already doing critical analysis in theology and religious studies but also to those who use critical approaches in the subdisciplines of the other social sciences and humanities which focus on religion. These include philosophy, sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, literature, and related disciplines. The journal will bridge the gap between humanities and social sciences, reaching into all of the disciplines and subdisciplines whose object is religion. It will help take the critical frameworks provided by some disciplines and make them available to others. <italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> will help facilitate communication between scholars using a range of critical approaches in the study of religion, and one of its main tasks is to help them articulate their common interests.</p>
<p>A <italic>critical</italic> approach (from the Greek <italic>kritikos</italic>, able to discern) implies that religious phenomena are examined according to both their positive and negative impacts. A critical approach is not neutral. One engages in the critique of religion based on a set of values- scientific truth, freedom, democracy, equality, etc. While some of the theological tradition is rational and critical, the basis for this broad notion of critique can be traced substantially to the teachings of Immanuel Kant. A critical approach to the scientific study of religion dates at least as far back as the Young Hegelian movement of the 1830s. The Left Hegelian “critical theologians” (David Friedrich Strauss, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Bruno Bauer) engaged in a radical break with the theological tradition, establishing the field of “Biblical Criticism” and influencing the early Marx. An array of scholars including the historical materialists, Nietzsche, Freud, Weber, Troeltsch, and the Frankfurt School, all carried on critical inquiries into religion. Initially deriving from the Frankfurt School, the contemporary critical theory of religion is now enriched and broadened by a host of other methods. These include but are not restricted to post-structuralism, feminism, psychoanalysis, ideological criticism, post-colonialism, Marxism, ecocriticism, and queer studies. Today the basis for the critique of religion is not only historical truth or economic inequality but also inequality of gender and sexual orientation and a range of other fixed collective identities linked to a disparate distribution of power among <italic>homo sapiens</italic>. All of these approaches are characterized by the need to discern what is beneficial and what not, to negate the negative and draw out the positive in any given idea, position or tradition, and to encourage its deployment for the sake of human flourishing.</p>
<p>The journal will not only contain secular perspectives but also give an outlet to those who are critical within their own religious tradition. It will critique religion not only from the outside but also from within (or for that matter from) religious traditions with which they identify. We see the journal as engaged in coalition building- as bringing some closely related perspectives together.</p>
<p>There is both a relatively narrow conception of what constitutes critical research on religion and a much broader one. At one extreme there is a risk of the term “critical” petrifying into doctrinaire orthodoxy; at the other, it may become so general that it does not mean anything at all. A reasoned approach mediates between these two poles. What is critical when it comes to research on religion is open to debate. Since this will be one of the central debates that will take place in the journal, <italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> will help to define the field.</p>
<p>A “critical” approach is not only a methodology; it is also a paradigm. It distinguishes itself from the other major paradigms and methodologies in the study of religion, which may broadly be termed “mainstream” approaches. In sociology and anthropology these include functionalism, interpretive sociology, phenomenology, positivism, and rational choice; in studies of religion they involve positivist claims to ‘scientific objectivity’ over against the perceived bias of theology; in biblical studies the mainstream is ‘historical criticism’. Each of these approaches claims to hold to the canons of modern scholarship but regularly fails to see the structuring ideological assumptions that inform them. That is, none of these mainstream approaches is critical per se. They can nevertheless help inform and be invigorated by critical perspectives. One of the goals of the journal, for example, will be to push positivistic research on religion in more critical directions.</p>
<p>There is a tendency among those who study religion to do so from “overly” empathetic perspectives. This prevents them from rigorously evaluating the religious phenomena with which they are concerned. We are not opposed to the scholarship of those who are empathetic, but rather to dogmatic, accommodationist, or apologetic perspectives. The goal of critique is surely not to diminish or make obsolete “religion” per se. It could even have the opposite effect of helping to strengthen it. Part of what makes religions evolve is criticism and reformation from within. Thus, we do not naïvely confuse critique with emancipation. Rather, we will work toward a language and method for addressing the real world without making easy moral claims. This general task will be one of the goals of CRR.</p>
<p>A critical approach attempts to gain an understanding of how religious institutions and religious thought may simultaneously serve as a source of domination and progressive social change. It seeks to analyze the historical, economic, and social conditions that gave rise to religious belief and practice, while recognizing that religious ideas can be motivational and therefore dialectically related to material conditions. It attempts to understand the role of religion within social and political conflicts. These conflicts are often based on differences conventionally classified as those of race, class, ethnicity, region, gender, and sexual orientation – all of which are linked to political and economic inequity and struggles for greater parity. A critical perspective recognizes its relationship to religious traditions. It does not reject this intellectual heritage but furnishes and fortifies self-reflection on the relation between criticism and religion. In short, the journal will take as a point of departure that religion is both ideological and at the same time rooted in the material conditions of each society and community, in large part explaining the variations of religious life.</p>
<p>Until now, there has been no journal devoted exclusively to a critical approach to the study of religion. This has left no central address for this sort of analysis. Scholars who use critical frames in the analysis of religion have had to publish their research in at least a dozen journals with various foci. Consequently, they have not reached a targeted audience. There has not been one location like <italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> where one could easily locate them. Many of these outlets are not religion journals but rather critical theory journals, whose reviewers and readers are not specialized in religion. Scholars who publish research on religion in the critical theory journals tend to write about “pure” theory, without substantially engaging with empirical research on religion. In contrast, critical researchers on religion who submit their articles to mainstream religion journals need to tone down their critical implications to get them through the review process. The range of publication options for critical studies on religion leads to a situation where the critical edge of excellent work by a wide range of scholars is blunted to enable publication. CRR aims at once to be more forthright than is generally the case with scholarly journals on religion, and to be both more nuanced and focused in its critique of religion than are the critical theory journals.</p>
<p>Those undertaking critical research on religion are located at all types of institutions- from teaching colleges to research universities and institutes located around the globe. They are a disparate group spread out across multiple disciplines and localities, isolated from each other, and often unaware of each other’s existence. This is because there has been no common venue through which to communicate. This is precisely what CRR provides.</p>
<p>Most academic journals remain confined to academia. In contrast, we will publish articles on religion that are relevant to both domestic and foreign policy and thereby attract the attention of those engaged with government policy. <italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> will not just be an academic journal but also a political platform enticing those outside academia to read it. The journal will reach beyond academia into the public sphere. It will reach across borders- not only to theocratic states, where those who are more secular are repressed, but also to secular states, where religion is often at best merely tolerated. <italic>Critical Research on Religion</italic> will provide a voice to both the religious and the secular - and will frequently trouble that very dichotomy.</p>
<p>This inaugural issue is a symposium on what it means to take a critical approach to research on religion. It covers critical approaches in the various subareas/subdisciplines, specialties, and perspectives in the study of religion. It shall lay the groundwork for the direction of the journal and for future issues. Comprising about a dozen shorter articles, it covers more ground. Even so, there are gaps here of which we editors are well aware.</p>
<p>The first few essays focus on the theoretical foundations of a critical approach to research on religion in the work of thinkers such as Marx, Weber, Freud and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School.</p>
<p>Kenneth Surin begins this with a succinct and clear outline of Marxist approaches to religion, arguing that both Marxism and progressive dimensions of religion – so often at loggerheads – find common ground in the constitutive desire for liberation from oppression. Wherever and whenever people find themselves in a situation of exploitation, this desire manifests itself once again.</p>
<p>Basing himself on Max Weber, in “The Gods of Institutional Life,” Roger Friedland argues that institutions are governed by sets of values, which become deified. These values, which are inherently religious, became institutionalized, through which they gain substance as material practice. These institutional values have a tendency to come into conflict with one another. They behave as warring Gods, each afraid of its own mortality. Through this “institutional polytheism,” Friedland enables us to understand capital itself as a hegemonic god at war with the other gods in whose names it is constantly challenged.</p>
<p>Focusing on Freud’s analyses of religious beliefs and experience. Marsha Hewitt calls for “a psychoanalytic, critical theory of religion.” Freud plays a central role within the critical study of religion. His critique of religion was not an attack against religion per se but rather “a highly complex, nuanced and differentiated set of insights.” Religion, according to Freud, arises from the human need to alleviate <italic>angst</italic> and create certainty and security. While religion ameliorates anxiety and offers a consolation for suffering, it prevents human beings from having autonomy and engaging in critical thought.</p>
<p>Rudi Siebert coined the term critical theory of religion and was the first to develop it. His article is coauthored with those he has mentored, Michael Ott and Dustin Byrd. Drawing largely from Marx and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, Benjamin, and Fromm), they bring historical materialism into contact with theologians such as Meister Eckhart. They call for “a new humanistic religiosity,” which is not an attack against traditional religion but an appeal to the Abrahamic faiths to return to their original spirit.</p>
<p>The next two essays both articulate perspectives that arise from inequality based on gender and sexual orientation. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza is a Catholic feminist theologian and holder of an endowed chair at Harvard Divinity School. She articulates the concerns of critical feminist studies in religion, which is informed by the critical theory of the Frankfurt school. She engages with many of those who are on the board of our journal- in particular with Marsha Hewitt. Unlike Hewitt, Schüssler Fiorenza, argues that a feminist critical theory of religion “must remain ‘religious’ or ‘the*logical” in the broadest sense of the word.” Critical feminist studies in religion have a key role to play in social movements demands for emancipation from various forms of domination.</p>
<p>Addressing the intersection between queer theory and religious studies, Kent Brintnall pertinently reminds us that his statement - like any overview - cannot be a masterful document but is instead intended both to invite and to trouble thinking. While he concisely identifies (and criticizes) founding figures of queer theory, he suggests that rather than arguing over what the term “should mean,” our best way forward is to recognize it as more of a common address for shared interests, and to become more specific in our terminologies, critiques, and analyses of case studies.</p>
<p>Rhys Williams and Thomas Josephsohn focus on a discipline in which a critical perspective has been strikingly absent: the sociology of religion. They discuss how sociologists of religion too often focus on the positive aspects of religion while ignoring those that are negative. Williams and Josephsohn call for a critical sociology of religion not narrowly confined to the Frankfurt School. For them, religion is not a simple opiate but it both challenges and reproduces social power.</p>
<p>Randall Styers focuses on cultural theory. His contribution spotlights the way culture and power have shaped and deployed the very concept of “religion.” He illustrates the potential of cultural theory to clarify these effects in central areas of legitimized liberalism today, especially legal and scientific discourse. And he notes an increased interest in religious discourses among cultural theorists themselves, related to the perceived failure of the Western “metanarrative of secularization.”</p>
<p>Vincent Lloyd and David Chidester write on two topics that are historically interwoven with each other: colonialism and racism. Vincent Lloyd starts from the provocative observation that in significant respects, the concepts of religion and race are, from a certain perspective, coeval, both arising “in modernity, or in the colonial encounter.” He argues that perspectives from tradition can be one way to articulate progressive resources couched in religious or racialized idioms. Yet, given the inherent limitations of particular traditions, he suggests that an economic-critical frame may ultimately be more capacious - but since its audience is necessarily limited, perhaps it is most effectively combined with traditional rhetorics.</p>
<p>David Chidester shows us that the colonial legacy remains alive and strong, drawing his key anecdote from the headlines of the sports sections of 2012 - specifically, the pageantry associated with the London Olympics that reiterated the notion of the British Empire as the civilized culmination of history. Far from the Olympics being the secular antithesis of religion, he notes that even for their modern-day founders they were to be a <italic>religio athletae</italic>. Remaining fully attendant to the power disparities that characterize the colonial condition, Chidester asks us to attend as well to the negotiations of power and meaning also at play in colonial religious forms.</p>
<p>As an international journal, our goal is to have a global reach. The last few essays move in that direction by addressing religion in China, Eastern Europe, and Australia.</p>
<p>Michael Puett argues that critical theories of religion have had a tendency to impose their own understanding of the relationship between the divine and the human realm on Chinese religion. There was no need to engage in unmasking like Durkheim since the Chinese knowingly understood the divine realm as a reflection of the human realm. Rituals expressed idealized social relations and there was a disjunction between them and the world of the everyday. The goal of the Mandate of Heaven was not to instill a belief that heaven had given birth to the ruler but rather to promote a proper relationship between heaven, the ruler, and the people. Thus critical theories of religion by imposing their own Western understanding on China, tend to reify these social relations. Puett implores us to utilize indigenous theories of religion from China and elsewhere, which will broaden a critical approach to the study of religion.</p>
<p>Milena Kirova, a literary scholar, tells a narrative critical of religion in post-communist Bulgaria. She traces the reassertion of political power by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, albeit without the much-touted “revival” of religion among the populace. Above all, she criticizes the church for failing to provide a collective home, a sense of connectedness that was lost with the demise of communism in that country. Her article serves as a case study for other countries in the former Eastern Bloc.</p>
<p>Marion Maddox, a political scientist, assesses the appeal of the mega-church phenomenon in Australia. Her contribution deals with the paradoxes of the “prosperity gospel,” by focusing on a neglected feature of that message, namely its emphasis on conspicuous capitalist consumption. Since this example is not unique to Australia, her incisive treatment has relevance to situations around the globe.</p>
