<p>James Curran, professor of communication and director of the Leverhulme Media Research Center at Goldsmith’s, University of London, is editor for the Routledge Communication and Society Series. Both the series and Curran’s recent contribution reflect the broad scope of his longstanding cultural, historical, and theoretical oversight of the field. Although <italic>Media and Democracy</italic> is primarily a collection of previously published essays and research reports, Curran has made an exemplary and quite successful effort to bring them up-to-date with retrospective assessments at the ends of these chapters.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five sections that are devoted to cross-national media comparisons, media and democratic theory, new technology, and historical and cultural frameworks for analysis. Understandably, the book’s attention is concentrated on the media in the United Kingdom and Europe more generally, but the evolution of media systems and institutions in the United States also figures quite prominently.</p>
<p>Indeed, the book begins with a chapter devoted to assessing the contributions that the American media experiment has made to the ways that media and democracy have developed around the world. Curran offers high praise for the leadership role that American prestige journalism has played, not only at home, but also as a standard against which much of the tabloid media and partisan press in Europe and Asia could be compared. Although Curran also credits this journalistic tradition with serving as a model for improving journalism in newly emerging nations, he takes due note of the more recent withering of those standards in the face of increasing commercialization and concern about the performance of media stocks as investments.</p>
<p>On occasion, Curran’s approach to comparative media analysis takes the form of a critical assessment of the cornerstone products of other scholars’ work. One example is his dissection of Daniel Hallin and Paolo Mancini’s erstwhile replacement for <italic>Four Theories of the Press</italic> as “the bible of media studies.” Noting the acclaim that <italic>Comparing Media Systems</italic> has received, Curran then compares its construction of the “Liberal Model” with similar constructions within Harry Potter novels. In his view, both are intellectually creative but convenient fictions nonetheless. His major criticism is a suggestion that Hallin and Mancini overstate the political independence of the US media system, while essentially ignoring the inequality that he sees as characteristic of its unique form of marketplace democracy.</p>
<p>While the delivery of pointed criticism of scholarly reflections is undoubtedly a part of his strength, Curran and his colleagues have provided a number of empirically based assessments of the consequences that flow from trying to make sense of the world through the filtered lenses of different media systems. In one chapter, we are provided with a classic study of the relations between the kinds of media content provided by market-oriented and public service media and the public’s knowledge of the sorts of public affairs information that democracy is assumed to require. This ambitious study compares media content and public knowledge in the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, and Denmark. Not surprisingly, they find that what the public knows reflects what it has been supplied by the media, once you take into account the culturally derived differences in the topics that interest these audiences in the first place. The failure of the US media to supply much in the way of international news is seen to reinforce American ignorance, uninterest, and inequality in knowledge of public affairs.</p>
<p>Curran’s assessment of the performance of US media in particular—and market-oriented media more generally—is not limited to journalism and news and public affairs content. One of the theoretical chapters initiates an engagement with the importance of entertainment media as though the “Cultural Indicators” project of George Gerbner and Larry Gross had never existed. Nevertheless, there is still value to be derived from Curran’s step-by-step dissection of primary claims about the contributions that entertainment media make toward democratic systems. Of course, he concludes that entertainment is never enough. His chapter on the future of journalism combines technology assessment with democratic theory as a basis for issuing an invitation for more active involvement by scholars and activists in the shaping of this future.</p>
<p>Curran’s engagements with media history are, as he notes, a bit selective. However, the comparisons of feminist, radical, populist, and even libertarian narratives provide an entry point through which readers can begin to reassess whether their own historical frameworks do justice to the complexities of the past. Similar statements apply to the chapters on media and culture. The final chapter is framed as an engagement with cultural studies through a multidimensional lens. Again, Curran forthrightly admits that most of his attention has been focused on a single, dominant influence—the rise of market liberalism. Indeed, its influence is readily observed throughout the book, and its overall impact has been enhanced rather than diminished by what might otherwise be seen as a constraint.</p>
<p><italic>Media and Democracy</italic> is presented as a first-year undergraduate text. I suspect that courses on comparative media systems would probably come a bit later for US students, but the writing is clearly accessible, and the assumptions of prior knowledge are relatively few.</p>
