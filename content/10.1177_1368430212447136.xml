<abstract>
<p>While deviance can foster innovation within groups, research does not always find beneficial effects. The current studies provide an information processing account of the influence of deviants in group decision-making. We predicted deviants would undermine decision confidence and promote greater elaboration when tasks were difficult. Study 1 manipulated the strength (systematic cue) and gender (heuristic cue) of a job applicant to investigate the effect of a deviant in a difficult task. As predicted, a deviant was associated with lowered confidence, greater elaboration, and higher decision quality, but also decreased group cohesion and task satisfaction. Study 2 investigated the effect of a deviant during a simple task and found the same decrease in group cohesion and task satisfaction, but this time with no increase in elaboration or improvement in decision outcome quality. Results indicate that deviance, when seen as justified, has the potential to reduce the occurrence of prejudice and produce fairer decision outcomes during decision-making.</p>

<body>
<p>The Bay of Pigs fiasco, escalation of the Vietnam War, and Challenger Space Shuttle disaster exemplify the pitfalls of stifling dissent during decision-making. Research on group conformity, cohesiveness, and groupthink suggests that dissent during group decision-making has a beneficial impact on decision outcomes. Since establishing that the absence of dissent in groups produces inferior decision outcomes, both authentic and contrived deviance have been suggested as ways to improve group decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212447136">Nemeth, Connell, Rogers, &amp; Brown, 2001</xref>). The positive effects of deviance, however, can often go hand-in-hand with a negative impact on the group environment, or fail to occur at all (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212447136">Nemeth, Brown, &amp; Rodgers, 2001</xref>). The current research uses an information processing approach to investigate the level of elaboration engaged in during the decision making process, to determine whether it has the potential to improve decision outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430212447136">
<title>Deviance in group decision-making: The good</title>
<p>Dissent increases innovative thought and unbiased thinking in organizational teams during decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212447136">Nemeth et al., 2001</xref>). Group decision-making can be more effective than individual decision-making because deviance or dissent can occur either through authentic dissent or through the use of contrived techniques, such as the devil’s advocate technique (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212447136">Schwenk, 1990</xref>). This increases the information available to group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212447136">Sargis &amp; Larson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212447136">Schulz-Hardt, Jochims, &amp; Frey, 2002</xref>), and encourages divergent thinking and innovative ideas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212447136">De Dreu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212447136">Hobman &amp; Bordia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212447136">Janis &amp; Mann, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212447136">Nemeth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212447136">Schwenk, 1990</xref>). The sharing of new information during group discussion leads group members to engage more in the discussion and explore all the possible options and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212447136">Nemeth, Personnaz, Personnaz, &amp; Goncalo, 2004</xref>), suggesting solutions that might been overlooked up to that point.</p>
<p>Decision outcomes are not always improved using dissent, however, especially when dissent is contrived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212447136">Greitemeyer, Shultz-Hardt, Brodbeck, &amp; Frey, 2006</xref>). More recent studies suggest that participation influences the relationship between deviance and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212447136">De Dreu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212447136">De Dreu &amp; West, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212447136">De Dreu and West (2001)</xref> surveyed organizational teams working in the area of recruitment and selection, finding that teams with dissenting views were viewed as more innovative only when team members rated themselves as participating actively in the decision making process. The current research aims to investigate the process of increased elaboration to determine whether this can improve decision-making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1368430212447136">
<title>Deviance in group decision-making: The bad</title>
<p>The use of deviance in decision-making can result in negative consequences such as decreased group morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212447136">Nemeth, Brown, &amp; Rodgers, 2001</xref>). Working in groups can be a positive experience for group members, but the presence of a dissident can undermine this. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212447136">Nemeth and Ormiston (2007)</xref> found that group members working as a team across a variety of tasks reported higher group cohesion, innovation, and both group and task satisfaction. When group members were changed between tasks, however, more dissent was introduced into the group environment and as such it was seen as less friendly. This resulted in the group rating itself as less innovative, despite the fact that independent observers actually rated these latter groups as more innovative and higher performing overall.</p>
<p>The higher conflict levels associated with dissent can distract individuals from the task at hand and decrease both information exchange between group members and their motivation to work together again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212447136">De Dreu, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, increased task conflict has been found to correlate with decreased job satisfaction in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212447136">De Dreu &amp; Weingart, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368430212447136">
<title>Deviance in group decision-making: The unknown</title>
<p>The way that deviants affect the decision-making process is poorly understood. There is also relatively little empirical research investigating the effects of deviance on subsequent group tasks. While conflict can have long-term effects on health and well-being at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212447136">De Dreu, Dierendonck, &amp; Dijkstra, 2004</xref>), the link between group deviance and reduced team functioning on subsequent tasks has not been examined. Given the potential impact of deviance on group morale and the fact that teams often are required to work together on repeated tasks, it is important to determine whether the effects of deviance impact on further team tasks and interactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1368430212447136">
<title>Investigating the relationship between deviance and decision-making via information processing</title>
<p>While deviance during the decision-making process can indeed improve decision outcomes, this is not always the case; groups often fail to rely on previously unshared information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212447136">Larson &amp; Harmon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212447136">Van Swol, Savadori, &amp; Sniezek, 2003</xref>), the mechanism by which deviance is thought to improve decision-making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212447136">Greitemeyer et al., 2006</xref>). Other processes may be associated with improvements in decision outcome and affect the amount of new information that is introduced during a group discussion. Given that previous research suggests that participating more in a task leads to increased innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212447136">De Dreu &amp; West, 2001</xref>), one possible process through which deviance may affect decision-making is by influencing the extent to which information is elaborated upon during tasks.</p>
<p>In the last decade, research has begun conceptualizing groups as information-processing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212447136">Kerr, Niedermeier, &amp; Kaplan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212447136">Tindale &amp; Sheffey, 2002</xref>). Dual process models, such as the heuristic-systematic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212447136">Chaiken, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212447136">Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993</xref>), can provide some insight into the extent or depth of information processing occurring in a group task. Such models suggest that systematic processing involves extensive cognitive analysis, whereas heuristic processing involves attending to extraneous information, such as stereotypes, and therefore involves less effortful analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212447136">Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993</xref>). An example of a stereotype that has been shown to influence perceptions in the workplace is sexism. Of additional value, therefore, is the ability for this research to reduce sexism in decision-making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212447136">Foschi and Foddy’s (1988)</xref> research on double standards suggests that females need to work harder than males to provide more evidence of their ability. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212447136">Foschi, Lai, and Sigerson (1994)</xref> found that undergraduates choosing applicants for an engineering position during group decision-making rated male applicants as more competent and better suited for the job even when their qualifications were the same as the female applicants. If deviance can reduce reliance on the heuristic cue of gender, it will be able to reduce prejudice during the decision making process.</p>
<p>The use of systematic processing would reduce reliance on heuristics and improve the overall decision outcome. Both ability and motivation can impact on the mode of processing used. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212447136">Eagly and Chaiken (1993)</xref> suggest that as systematic processing requires higher cognitive ability, it is affected by situational or individual factors that hinder one’s ability during decision-making. The degree of confidence an individual desires to have when making a decision can influence motivation to engage in the task, and therefore the likelihood that individuals will use systematic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212447136">Trumbo, 2002</xref>). Although individuals prefer to exert as little effort as possible, they need to put in as much effort as is required to give them sufficient judgemental confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212447136">Maheswaran &amp; Chaiken, 1991</xref>). This is referred to as the sufficiency principle and suggests that individuals will only engage in systematic processing if heuristic processing produces judgements that are below that confidence threshold. One situation in which this could occur is when a decision is difficult; individuals would be required to engage in more elaboration of the task to meet the desired confidence threshold.</p>
<p>Group consensus has been shown to produce heuristic processing as consensus may imply that the individual’s beliefs are correct, allowing sufficient confidence in judgement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212447136">Maheswaran &amp; Chaiken, 1991</xref>). Dissent, by its very nature, undermines consensus and so may limit an individual’s confidence and ability to reach the sufficiency threshold using heuristic processing. Systematic processing would then be required to meet the sufficiency threshold and arrive at a decision with adequate confidence yet also improve the overall decision quality.</p>
<p>The current study aims to measure the effect of a deviant group member on the depth elaboration by examining the way in which group members process task-related information.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Participants were asked to complete an applicant selection task and were presented with a number of job applications for a position in an engineering firm. The applications varied in terms of relevant central cues (extent of the Curriculum Vitae (CV) strength in the form of previous work experience) and irrelevant peripheral cues (applicant gender). The extent to which participants were influenced by the central cues (CV strength) compared to the peripheral cues (applicant gender) served as a marker of systematic processing.</p>
<p>It was predicted that group members in the deviance present condition would be less confident in their applicant ratings than group members in the deviance absent condition (H1). It was also predicted that group members in the deviance present condition would engage in more elaboration and therefore, more systematic processing to arrive at their decision than group members in the deviance absent condition (H2). It was expected that deviance would moderate the quality of decision outcomes, such that participants exposed to the presence of a deviant during decision making would arrive at a decision based on the strength of the applicant for the position, rather than the irrelevant cue of applicant gender (H3). Lastly, it was expected that group members in the deviance present condition would experience negative effects on team morale, in the form of lowered team cohesion and task satisfaction, and decreased willingness to work together on future tasks, compared to group members in the deviance absent condition (H4).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1368430212447136">
<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>Participants were 46 (30 female, 16 male) psychology undergraduates from the University of Queensland who participated in exchange for course credit (<italic>M</italic> = 20.60 years). There were originally 50 participants but two participants were excluded after they expressed suspicions about the manipulation and two participants were removed for having no experience in a work environment. Participants were randomly assigned to the cells of a 2 (deviance: present or absent) by 2 (CV strength: strong or weak) by 2 (applicant gender: male or female) mixed design. The first factor was manipulated between-groups, the remaining two were repeated measures factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368430212447136">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>The study was run on computers using Revolution Studio version 2.9.0 software. Upon entering the lab, participants were told the cover story that the experiment aimed to examine how computer-mediated communication impacted on the way in which tasks are completed. Participants were then informed that for the duration of the experiment they should imagine they were board members of an engineering firm and were required to work with other participants to complete three tasks via computer. In reality participants were interacting with a computer program, programmed to present various responses based on the study aims and condition. Participants were told that the study was being run across three different rooms, with the experimenter staging phone calls to the other room at the beginning of the session to make it appear as though they were checking that the other rooms were ready to start. This was done to maintain the pretence of working with other participants over the computer. Participants were instructed that they would be allocated in groups of four that would be mixed across all three rooms and would be randomly allocated a participant number. This ensured the believability of the experiment regardless of how many participants turned up to the session. The actual participants were always allocated ‘Participant 1’ and linked to three computerized participants, who they assumed to be fellow students.</p>
<p>For the first task, participants were asked to choose a new logo for the engineering firm from three logos provided. This task, in which all group members were programmed to agree with the actual participant, was designed to establish a team environment to make the task more realistic and ensure participants were familiar with the equipment. Participants were presented with the company brief and the selection of potential new logos. They were asked to discuss the positive and negative qualities of the logos as a group, via a computer chartroom interface. Throughout the discussion the computer participants were programmed to agree with the participant. After the group discussion they were asked to make a group decision. Following the discussion the computer was programmed to have responses from the other team members follow within seconds of the actual participant’s response so it appeared that everyone was responding at the same time and had chosen the same logo. This format was used for all three team tasks.</p>
<sec id="section9-1368430212447136">
<title>Manipulation of CV strength</title>
<p>In the second task, participants were presented with a job description for a position at the engineering firm and provided with the details of four applicants. This allowed for the manipulation of the independent variables of CV strength and applicant gender. CV strength was manipulated by altering the level of applicants’ work experience. In the strong condition, two applicants had work experience in jobs with more responsibility and relevance to the job position advertised, such as an associate engineer and an assistant to senior engineers where they carried out project related duties, whereas in the weak condition, two applicants had previous jobs of less responsibility and relevance, such as assistant and a personal assistant to associate engineers, where they carried out administration related duties. All applicants had the same level of education and jobs with the same number of companies, over the same period of time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1368430212447136">
<title>Manipulation of applicant gender</title>
<p>Applicant gender was manipulated by varying the applicants’ names and the picture attached to each of the CVs. Two applicants, Isabelle Foster and Sophie Rawson, had female names with photos of females attached, whilst the other two applicants, Dominic Reynolds and Craig MacNeill, had male names and photos of males attached. Pilot tests in the form of multivariate and univariate ANOVAs ensured that all the photos were rated the same in terms of being likable, attractive, competent, knowledgeable, honest, and credible, <italic>F</italic> (2, 44) = 2.82, <italic>ns</italic>. An independent groups <italic>T</italic>-tests revealed that there was no significant difference in the ratings of masculinity for males applicants, <italic>t</italic> (44) = .47, <italic>ns</italic>, and femininity for female applicants, <italic>t</italic> (44) = .71, <italic>ns</italic>. The male and female photos were, however, significantly different in terms of their masculine (<italic>F</italic> (2, 44) = 671.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .99) and feminine (<italic>F</italic> (2, 44) = 372.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .99) ratings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1368430212447136">
<title>Manipulation of deviance</title>
<p>In this second task, participants were again led to believe that they were engaging in online discussion with their team members to determine which candidates to select. Deviance was manipulated by varying the statements attributed to one of the group members (‘Participant 3’). Six of these statements expressed clear disagreement in the deviance present condition (e.g., “I don’t agree with the process we used and I’m sure that if we looked at it from different perspectives that we wouldn’t choose those two. I wouldn’t choose those two applicants for the shortlist … ”), or clear agreement in the deviance absent condition (e.g., “Yeah those were my first thoughts. I agree, they had those positives. Yep, I agree those were the top two … ”). As a manipulation check, 8 items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212447136">Jehn’s (1995)</xref> Team Conflict Scale measured the degree of conflict and disagreement within the group during the tasks (e.g., “How much conflict about the work you do is there in your team?”). Responses were scored on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1, none, to 5, a lot, (α = .96).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1368430212447136">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Following the second task participants completed a questionnaire measuring the dependant variables. Group cohesion was measured by adapting items from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212447136">Hogg, Sherman, Dierselhuis, Maitner, and Mofitt (2007)</xref> Cohesion and Entitativity Scale (e.g. “To what extent was the team cohesive?”). Responses were scored on a 9-point rating scale ranging from 1, not at all, to 9, very much (α = .74).</p>
<p>Three items were used to measure the perception of introduction of new information (e.g., “To what extent did other team members mention information during that task that you had not previously given much thought to?”), with responses scored on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1, not at all, to 7, very much.</p>
<p>Decision outcome was measured with 20 items: Five items about each of the four applicants, addressing their education, experience levels, and overall suitability for the job (e.g., “If you had to choose one applicant for the job, how likely is it that you would choose this applicant over the other applicants?”). Responses to items were scored on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1, not at all, to 7, very likely. Participants were also asked to rank the four applicants in order of who they were most likely to choose to who they were least likely to choose for the job.</p>
<p>Decision confidence was measured via the extremity of applicant ratings across conditions, with higher ratings indicating that individuals were more confident in their decision to hire the applicant. Elaboration during the task was measured via content analysis of participants’ comments during the task discussion on the computer program. Comments were counted as being separate if they covered separate content. For example, a statement such as “I like applicant 2, they had a good level of experience”, would count as one comment, however, a statement such as “I like applicant 2, they had a good level of experience … they also had good education levels”, would count as two comments. Comments were rated by two independent raters with an interrater reliability of Kappa = 0.88 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Task satisfaction was measured by items modelled on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212447136">Mason and Griffin (2005)</xref> Task Satisfaction Scale (e.g., “Overall, how satisfied are you with the group’s decision?”). Group satisfaction was measured with 7 novel items developed for the current research. One general item assessed overall satisfaction with the group (e.g., “Overall, how satisfied are you working with this team?”), while 2 items directed at each participants’ three ostensible group members assessed the degree to which participants were satisfied with each of the group member’s contributions and the extent to which they wanted to work with them again (e.g., “To what extent would you like to work with this person again on future tasks?”). Responses to items were scored on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1, not at ll, to 7, very much.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1368430212447136">
<title>Final group task</title>
<p>Participants also completed the third task in which they determined the selection tool they wanted to use to gain further information about their short-listed applicants. The aim of this final task, in which all group members were again programmed to agree with the participant, was to allow participants to experience another task in which the group worked well together to examine whether the deviance experienced in task 2 impacted on how they worked in the final task. They were given a choice of three selection tools (written references, a portfolio item, or an interview transcript) that would typically be used to complete a recruitment process and again asked to make their decision via group discussion over the computer.</p>
<p>After finishing this task, participants completed a second questionnaire, which included all the measures from the first questionnaire, with the exception of the applicant ratings and with the addition of the demographic questions. The CV strength manipulation was assessed by participants rating the applicants’ experience level a on 7-point scale with responses ranging from 1, basic, to 7, advanced. Participants were also asked to indicate their gender, age, current degree enrolled in, current occupation outside studying, and approximate length of time in the workforce. The tasks took participants an average of 45 minutes to complete. The questionnaire had 95 questions in total and took participants an average of 15 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>A mixed deviance by task ANOVA (with repeated measures on task) was conducted to investigate the effect of deviance on team conflict.

<p>The effectiveness of the CV strength manipulation was confirmed in a manipulation check on perceived CV strength.

<title>Decision outcome</title>
<p>A one-way between groups ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of deviance on participants’ decision-making confidence. As predicted (H1), participants in the deviance present condition expressed significantly lower confidence (<italic>M</italic> = 4.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.77) in their decisions than participants in the deviance absent condition (<italic>M</italic> = 5.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85), <italic>F</italic> (1, 44) = 4.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .09. A one-way between groups ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of deviance on elaboration during the decision making process. Also as predicted (H2), participants in the deviance present condition elaborated more during the decision-making process–making significantly more comments about the applicants and the decision (<italic>M</italic> = 6.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.38) than participants in the deviance absent condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.73), <italic>F</italic> (1, 44) = 5.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .12.</p>
<p>To test hypotheses related to decision quality, a 2 (Deviance condition: deviance present and deviance absent) by 2 (Applicant gender: male and female) by 2 (CV strength: strong CV and weak CV) mixed ANOVA was conducted with deviance as a between participants factor and applicant gender and CV strength as a within participants factor. While there was no significant main effect of applicant gender, <italic>F</italic> (1, 44) = 1.90, <italic>ns</italic>, there was a significant main effect of CV strength, <italic>F</italic> (1, 44) = 60.11 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .58, whereby participants preferred the strong applicants (<italic>M</italic> = 5.69, <italic>SD</italic> = .13) over the weak applicants (<italic>M</italic> = 3.97, <italic>SD</italic> = .19) regardless of the deviance condition. This effect was, however, qualified by a significant 3-way interaction between deviance condition, CV strength, and applicant gender, <italic>F</italic> (1, 44) = 5.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .10.</p>
<p>The effects of CV strength and applicant gender were then analysed for each level of deviance. In the deviance absent condition, there were no simple main effects, but there was a significant 2-way interaction between applicant gender and CV strength, <italic>F</italic> (1, 23) = 7.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .24. Our test of simple interaction effects between applicant gender and CV strength for the deviance absent condition revealed that there was a significant gender by strength effect, whereby participants in the deviance absent condition preferred the male applicant over the female applicant when the CVs were strong (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>SM</italic><italic>ale</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 6.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.12; <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>SF</italic><italic>emale</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 5.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.29) <italic>F</italic> (1, 23) = 52.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .69, but there was no difference on gender when the CVs were weak (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>SM</italic><italic>ale</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 4.30, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.33; <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>SFemale</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 4.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.29;), <italic>F</italic> (1, 23) = 3.50, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>
<p>In the deviance present condition there was a significant main effect of CV strength whereby participants preferred the strong applicants regardless of the applicant gender, preferring the strong male and female applicants significantly more than the weak male and female applicants, <italic>F</italic> (1, 22) = 38.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .65. The interaction between CV strength and applicant gender was not significant <italic>F</italic> (1, 21) = .02, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>
<p>These results are in line with our prediction (H3), that participants in the deviance present condition would be less influenced by participant gender when selecting applicants for the engineering position than participants in the deviance absent condition (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430212447136">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the deviance present condition participants had higher confidence in their selection choices and engaged in more elaboration during the decision-making process. Such findings support our first two hypotheses. First, deviance seems to undermine individuals’ confidence in their decision, and second, individuals had to engage in more systematic processing to meet their sufficiency threshold and arrive at their decision.</p>
<p>Participants in the deviance present condition were significantly more likely to use central cues to arrive at a decision, rather than use peripheral cues and rely on the stereotype of applicant gender. As such, the decision outcome was better in the deviance present condition; participants preferred strong applicants to weak applicants, regardless of applicant gender. This demonstrates support for our third hypothesis, which suggested that engaging in systematic processing would improve decision outcome and decrease reliance on heuristics or stereotypes. It also demonstrates the ability of deviance to reduce the occurrence of prejudice during the decision-making process, leading to a fairer outcome.</p>
<p>There was support for our fourth hypothesis; participants in the deviance present condition rated their team cohesion and task satisfaction as significantly lower than those in the deviance absent condition both directly after the second task, and after the final task, in which there was no deviance in either condition. Furthermore, although participants reported not wanting to work with the team member who expressed the dissent on future tasks, they did not express this notion for the other non-dissenting team members. Finally, participants in the deviance present condition reported that more new information was introduced during the group discussion compared to participants in the deviance absent condition, despite the fact that their other team members did not in fact introduce any additional information. This suggests that while dissent may not always increase the amount of new information introduced, it may increase the perception that new information is being shared.</p>

<sec id="section19-1368430212447136">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>If deviance helps people engage in more elaborative thinking, then it follows that the primary benefit of deviance in group decision-making will be under circumstances in which groups may be more prone to using heuristics, such as when tasks are more ambiguous or difficult. It is possible, therefore, that when a task is relatively easy, the benefits of deviance will no longer be apparent as there will be no advantage to engaging in further elaboration. In such simple decision-making tasks, deviance may not be seen to have a beneficial effect but rather may get in the way of the group decision-making process by undermining members’ confidence in their decision. For these types of easily solved tasks, deviance may also be seen by group members as an indicator of dysfunction within that team, similar to how conflict can be viewed as dysfunctional under certain circumstances (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212447136">De Dreu &amp; Beersma, 2005</xref>). Under these circumstances, deviance may not be beneficial to the decision outcome but instead foster more negative consequences.</p>
<p>Study 2 was conducted in order to test the notion that in simple decision-making tasks the strength of CV and the gender of applicant will have the same effect as regardless of whether deviance is experienced during the decision making process as the deviance will be viewed as unnecessary.</p>
<p>It was predicted deviance would reduce group members’ confidence in their decisions (H1). It was also predicted that under low task difficulty, increased elaboration, through exposure to deviance in decision-making, would not be necessary to achieve quality decision outcomes (H2). Finally, it is predicted that due to the aforementioned ‘unnecessary’ deviance, group members in the deviance present condition will rate team and individual variables, such as task satisfaction and group cohesion, as lower than those in the deviance absent condition (H3).</p>

<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>Participants were 53 (36 female, 17 male) psychology undergraduates from the University of Queensland who participated in exchange for course credit (<italic>M</italic> = 19.90 years). One participant was removed after they expressed suspicions about the team interactions and one participant was removed for having no experience in a work environment. Participants were randomly assigned to the cells of a 2 (presence of deviance: present or deviance absent) by 2 (CV strength: strong or weak) by 2 (Applicant gender: male or female) mixed design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1368430212447136">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>The materials from Study 1 were redeveloped for Study 2 to increase task simplicity. Objective cues were enhanced to make the second task easier. The CV strength manipulation was increased by manipulating applicants’ work experience (as done in Study 1) as well as their education level. Strong applicants had undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, whereas weak applicants had only undergraduate degrees. In addition to this change, the photos were removed from the applicant CVs to reduce the applicant gender manipulation to just the names on the CV packages. Pilot tests were conducted to ensure that the decision-making task to be completed in Study 2 was significantly easier and less ambiguous than the task completed in Study 1. Results of the pilot testing showed that participants rated the tasks used in Study 1 as significantly more ambiguous and difficult (<italic>M</italic> = 6.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.61) than the revised tasks planned for Study 2 (<italic>M</italic> = 5.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.81), <italic>t</italic> (92) = 3.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The manipulation was assessed in Questionnaire 2, by asking participants to rate the applicants’ experience and education level a on 7-point scale with responses ranging from 1, basic, to 7, advanced. Apart from these changes, the procedure and dependant variables were the same as that of the Study 1.</p>

To test decision outcome quality, a 2 (deviance condition: deviance present or deviance absent) by 2 (applicant gender: male or female) by 2 (CV strength: strong CV or weak CV) mixed ANOVA was conducted with deviance as a between participants factor and applicant gender and CV strength as a within participants factor. There was a significant main effect of CV strength, <italic>F</italic> (1, 51) = 80.30 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .61, with participants showing preference for the stronger applicants (<italic>M</italic> = 6.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.10), over the weaker applicants (<italic>M</italic> = 3.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.17) regardless of the deviance condition.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Confidence in applicant ratings was higher in the deviance absent condition, showing support for our first hypothesis suggesting that deviance can undermine individuals’ confidence in their decision regardless of the task. Individuals in the deviance present condition did not engage in more elaboration during the decision-making process than those in the deviance absent condition and yet there was no difference in the reliance on CV strength across deviance conditions, suggesting that participants did not have to engage in more systematic processing to meet the sufficiency threshold during a simple task, supporting our second hypothesis. There was no beneficial effect of deviance on the decision outcome in terms of increasing reliance on central cues.</p>
<p>The results suggest that deviance does not improve decision-making during simple tasks. The CV strength manipulation was large in magnitude, and as such the selection task was simpler than the selection task in Study 1. Participants, therefore, did not need to engage in heuristic shortcuts during the decision-making process as the difference in CV strength was more obvious than it was in the Study 1 task—they were therefore able to make a higher quality decision in the absence of dissent. The participants also reported that there was no new information in the deviance present condition, suggesting that dissent was not viewed as contributing to the resolution of the task and as such participants may not have engaged in a more effortful analysis of the decision-making process.</p>
<p>We also found support for our third hypothesis, finding that deviance still results in negative consequences both for the individual and the group when it is not seen as being beneficial to the group, and that these consequences transfer to subsequent tasks. The presence of a deviant served to decrease group cohesion, satisfaction with the task, and the desire to continue working together, and also lowered satisfaction with the group and all the individual group members, not just the deviant member. Such results suggest that individuals view the presence of a deviant in a simple task as unnecessary and dysfunctional. Individuals may question why group members express dissent when the task appears simple and questioning what seems to them to be the obvious answer. If a task is more ambiguous, and group members less certain of the correct answer, however, as in Study 1, they may be more accepting of dissent and view deviance as a useful part of the decision-making process.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>The current research was conducted to examine the way by which deviance affects the group decision-making process and determine when it produces positive outcomes. In Study 1 deviance undermined group members’ confidence, motivating the group members to engage in more systematic thinking and therefore arrive at a less biased decision. To further test this notion, Study 2 investigated the effect of deviance during a simple task. We reasoned that if the primary benefit of deviance in group decision-making was to decrease confidence and therefore increase elaboration and the use of systematic processing, as shown in Study 1, under circumstances in which groups are less prone to using heuristics, such as when tasks are more simple, increased elaboration would not be needed to enable participants to rely on the central cue of CV strength. Study 2 found support for this, demonstrating that in a simple decision-making task, deviance did not increase elaboration nor the use of central cues. In addition to this, there were more negative consequences, in terms of decreased task satisfaction and team cohesion, found in Study 2. This suggests that in simple tasks, deviance is seen as dysfunctional and may get in the way of the group decision-making process. Perhaps the need for deviance throughout the decision-making process is justified when the correct decision is less clear-cut from the beginning, and group members are more likely to engage in the task and share new information. Indeed, results indicated that during the more difficult task in Study 1, group members in the deviance present condition thought more new information was introduced to the discussion than those in the deviance absent condition; there was no such effect during the simple task in Study 2.</p>
<sec id="section29-1368430212447136">
<title>Practical implications and future research</title>
<p>This novel insight into the deviance-group decision-making process could account for the disparity within the literature wherein not all research finds support for the beneficial effects of deviance. It would indeed explain why studies have found that dissent leads to increased innovation and decision outcome quality only when group members are actively participating in the decision-making process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212447136">De Dreu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212447136">De Dreu &amp; West, 2001</xref>). The current study indicates that the key to gaining beneficial outcomes via deviance is promoting elaboration during the task, and that when elaboration is not necessary, deviance is seen as unnecessary and as such produces negative rather than beneficial effects. Elaboration, however, is promoted via factors other than deviance. For example, factors such as accountability for decisions have been found to also produce greater elaboration and motivation to be correct during decision-making tasks. Using such techniques would allow us to harness the benefits of deviance without actually using deviance and therefore avoid undermining the group environment. Such insight has important practical applications: if deviance is able to reduce reliance on the heuristic cue of gender during decision making, it may be able to also reduce the occurrence of prejudice during the decision making process, and therefore eliminate sexism. Furthermore, in situations where deviance may undermine team performance we can use other strategies to promote elaboration and replicate the benefits of deviance without producing the negative effects. Such information is vital for organizations facing one of their most challenging issues, work group diversity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212447136">Christian, Porter, &amp; Moffitt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212447136">Rink &amp; Ellemers, 2010</xref>), and therefore the different opinons that arise in group decision making.</p>
<p>The key to harnessing the benefits of deviance may also lie in our ability to justify the need for deviance in the eyes of the group members. Future research could also investigate how to justify deviance more effectively and alleviate further negative consequences, especially when tasks are less ambiguous.</p>
<p>Although research suggests that the group environment created in computer-mediated tasks allows for the same level of collaboration, decision making quality, and satisfaction with solution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212447136">Ocker &amp; Yaverbaum, 1999</xref>), it would be beneficial to replicate the findings of the current research within face-to-face groups to ensure that the same effects occur under these circumstances. This shortcoming aside, the pilot study demonstrating the different task conditions between the two studies, coupled with the change in participant elaboration and decision outcome between the studies demonstrate that the current research has managed to contribute significantly to our understanding of deviance and group decision-making and explain why previous research has found inconsistent effects.</p>
<p>Such findings have practical applications for educational, organizational, and other settings in which group work is a commonplace. We should not assume that stimulating deviance is going to be beneficial in every circumstance, but instead should consider whether the task needs it. This is not to say that people should discourage deviance and diversity from naturally occurring, but perhaps that using contrived techniques should be used on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with strategies aimed at promoting elaboration and justifying the use of deviance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current paper has provided an information processing account of the mechanism by which deviance improves decision outcomes to explain the disparity in existing deviance literature. Exploring both the negative and positive effects of deviance enabled us to understand what it is about deviance that produces such consequences, and under what decision-making conditions these consequences occur. Deviance is useful for group decision-making when a task is difficult and requires participants to engage in an effortful analysis of the problem. Justifying the use of deviance in this way enables deviance to improve the quality of the decision outcome, and also alleviate some of the negative consequences that occur when deviance is seen as dysfunctional. Insight into the ability of deviance to decrease reliance on heuristic cues, such as gender, may help reduce discrimination based on attributes such as gender and lead to fairer decisions.</p>
