<p>Marginalized and ignored by their better-situated peers, project attorneys slog through documents. Their work is routine, their scope of practice limited, and their options for better employment as attorneys increasingly foreclosed. In <italic>Cheaper by the Hour</italic>, Robert Brooks offers a first-hand account of document review. In Washington, DC, where he conducted field work, law firms and government agencies engage the services of large numbers of lawyers to carry out “due diligence” and “discovery,” both processes involving attorney–client privilege and thus requiring that lawyers perform them. Hired temporarily through staffing agencies, large numbers of project attorneys spend long hours, sometimes in substandard conditions. They represent, Brooks argues, the erosion of professional practice through deskilling, fragmentation, and increasing stratification of the law.</p>
<p>The strength of this book is the author’s participation in the settings he describes. As an attorney, he could gain access not only to practitioners but also to the labor process. His detailed accounts of document review, mostly divorced from the larger context of the legal case, emphasize the routine quality and limited discretion associated with this form of temporary work. His interviews with 20 of his coworkers then elaborate the frustrated aspirations that shape their experiences. Viewed as transitional employment, document review might seem to offer access to potential employers and the possibility of mentoring relationships with senior partners. Yet spatial segregation limits contact with legal staff, and temporary status becomes a stigma that limits access to positions in the internal labor markets of law firms and government agencies. As Brooks argues convincingly, fragmentation of an occupation presumed to be holistic has promoted the expansion of a subordinate segment of practicing attorneys.</p>
<p>Temporary legal employment, Brooks explains, shares many of the characteristics of temporary clerical work. Intermittent and unpredictable, temporary assignments offer no guarantees and little security. With staffing agencies acting as gatekeepers to the labor market, lawyers seeking temp work must navigate a three-way employment relationship fraught with mixed messages and broken promises. To remain employed, therefore, these workers develop multiple strategies: registering with more than one agency, attenuating billable time on the job, and seeking information about prospective new assignments. Here, as Brooks might have acknowledged, legal and clerical temping also differ. Although isolated, project attorneys tend to work together and so at least occasionally experience collegiality. They also retain their status as lawyers, and according to his informants, most seek ways to manage a spoiled identity. Also unlike clerical temps, these workers come with formal credentials, and the staffing industry exerts less direct control over screening and monitoring of individual workers. Although evident, these distinctions remain unexplored.</p>
<p>As Brooks rightly notes, most research on nonstandard, “contingent” work has focused on lower-wage temporary employment, with relatively few studies of professional occupations. He might, however, have enhanced this study with attention to research that has recently expanded the scope of this literature. Comparing across occupations—for example, with studies of technical contracting and adjunct faculty—would have qualified some of his claims about changing conditions of professional employment. Greater attention to work arrangements within the legal profession—for example, part-time work and solo practice—might have helped to identify conditions that promote or impede the processes that he identifies. His analysis does situate project attorneys in the context of larger-scale institutional change, but without reference to a number of studies that might have located this case on a broader occupational landscape. Recent research has pointed to considerable heterogeneity among nonstandard work arrangements. Researchers proposing new policies would do well to take such differences into account.</p>
<p>In his final chapter, Brooks considers the consequences of processes he defines as deprofessionalization. Segmented practice, he suggests, provides possibilities for automating and offshoring the more routine tasks of legal work, and if some no longer require a law degree, global outsourcing is likely to expand. Challenges to the boundaries of legal practice also offer openings for the encroachment of other occupations, which may lay claim to expertise at lower cost for consumers. Brooks thus delineates a potential threat to a segment of attorneys. The practice of law, he argues, may be subject to the same global processes that have affected workers in other occupations, despite legally defined boundaries and the self-regulation of bar associations. Both stratification and ideological divisions within the profession, he argues, are likely to mitigate any efforts to resist these trends.</p>
<p>Brooks depicts document review as a result of dynamic processes that are reconfiguring both the careers of lawyers and the practice of law. As one of a number of studies of workers in nonstandard work arrangements, this book adds to accumulating evidence pointing to a need for new policies and practices to address the various segments of a sizable “contingent” workforce. Placed in this context, this study should further inform both analysts and advocates for change.</p>
