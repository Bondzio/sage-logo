<p>“Whatever government is elected needs to have a serious look at better using pharmacists in the system”</p>
<attrib>—Geraldine Vance, CEO, BC Pharmacy Association</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the lead-up to a hotly contested provincial election, the BC Pharmacy Association (BCPhA) presented MLAs and candidates from all parties with proposals for 7 new clinical services the association would like to see delivered by pharmacists.</p>
<p>As British Columbians prepared to go to the polls on May 15, 2013, the association made the case for significant expansion of pharmacists’ scope of practice—saying the new services would increase access to primary care and reduce the province’s swelling health care budget.</p>
<p>Health care has been one of the key issues in the election campaign; in its February budget, the Liberal government announced plans to curb growth in health care spending to its slowest rate in almost a decade.</p>
<p>“We felt it was essential for pharmacists to be part of the public discussion on health care in a way that we perhaps haven’t been in past campaigns,” says Geraldine Vance, CEO of the BCPhA. “Whatever government is elected needs to have a serious look at better using pharmacists in the system.”</p>
<p>The association argues that the new pharmacist services will be more cost effective, and help the province deal with a shortage of family physicians and unnecessary use of costly resources for less serious health issues. The proposed per-unit fees for the 7 clinical services range from $5 to $70.</p>
<p>The proposed services are modelled after programs that have been successful in other jurisdictions, explains Ms. Vance. They include a minor ailments program similar to the one implemented for pharmacists in Saskatchewan. Based on an estimate of $95 million in BC physician billings for treatment of minor ailments in 2010‒11, the BCPhA says empowering pharmacists to deal with many of these matters could save more than $32 million a year.</p>
<p>“We argue that when dealing with something minor, such as insect bites or your baby’s diaper rash, your first port of call should be your community pharmacist,” says the association CEO. “Instead of ending up in an ER, for example, on a weekend, see your pharmacist, who will be trained to determine the best option for you—taking on a role of community-based triage.”</p>
<p>It is estimated that BC pharmacists delivered around 200,000 flu immunizations during the 2012‒13 influenza season and according to Ms. Vance, that’s a good track record upon which to build.</p>
<p>“Certainly the ease of access for patients has been a big driver in flu immunizations,” she says. “And pharmacists are the low-cost provider of this service—at the end of the day these kinds of economic savings mean there is money in the health care system to meet other needs.”</p>
