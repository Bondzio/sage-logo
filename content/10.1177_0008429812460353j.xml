<p>Paul Meyendorff, a leading Orthodox specialist in the history, theology and practice of the Orthodox liturgy, launched the first book of “The Orthodox Liturgy Series” on the rite of Anointing the Sick. The book’s title bears the name of the rite. Throughout the four chapters of the book, Meyendorff uses his skills and observations as historian, as theologian and as a royal priest of the Orthodox Faith, while he has included both the complete and the abbreviated contemporary rites in two appendices to familiarize the readers with the rubrics of this important rite.</p>
<p>The book is an answer to those who believe that healing should be left to the medical centers alone, and a response to a general observation of the isolation of the sick from their milieu, their treatment as mere broken mechanisms or expired entities, and to the comfort the relatives of the sick find in running away from, instead of facing up to, the consequences of their human nature, which are illness and death. The book was not meant, in any way, to reduce the importance and the value of medical treatment to society, but it complements it with the importance of the spiritual reality that doctors have neglected.  </p>
<p>As an historian, Meyendorff explains to his readers the steps of the development of the rite. The inauguration of the ministry of healing began with the historical presence of the Incarnated Jesus Christ Himself, and continued through the command to the apostles to go preach and heal the sick of the entire nation. This call to go out, preach and heal has established the ministry of the Church, the ministry of caring and, as such, the rite of the Anointing, which has developed through three stages: during the Early Church, the Byzantine tradition, and the contemporary rite.</p>
<p>While references are very rare, and oil was used domestically as the “aspirin of the age” (p. 32) during the era of the newly formed Church, Meyendorff establishes his history with James 5:13–16, which asks the faithful to call upon the elders to anoint the sick with oil in the name of the Lord. However, the first written reference was in the <italic>Apostolic Tradition </italic>of Hippolytus # 5, which dates back to the early 3rd century. The 4th and 5th centuries show similar Egyptian and Syriac manuscripts as well. Meyendorff notes that the priestly role of anointing was not mentioned prior to the 4th century and there was always a connection both between the prayers and repentance and between the prayers and the Eucharist. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the development of the rite in the Byzantine tradition goes back to the 8th century, as formulated in the <italic>Codex Barberini </italic>336, which contains five prayers. The 11th and the 12th centuries brought some significant changes to the rite, in which seven presbyters, seven prayers for the Anointing of the Sick, used to take place accompanied by the Eucharistic liturgy.</p>
<p>Meyendorff states that the contemporary rite, and its reductionist meaning, were settled in the 14th century, when the Eucharistic liturgy ceased to have an important role in the celebration of the rite, and the Anointing of the Sick began to be celebrated independently on Holy Wednesday as a “general service of blessing,” and as a replacement for confession and a preparation for Holy Pascha in the Greek and Antiochian Practices. In the Slavic tradition, the 17th century, under the influence of Metropolitan Peter of Moghila, brought an interesting change and definition, whereby the rite of Anointing began to be performed as the last rite, the “Extreme Unction.”</p>
<p>As a theologian, Meyendorff does not limit himself to the rite alone, but he opens the doors to the entire Orthodox theology, which shines from the rubrics of the rite itself. He roots all healings in the <italic>Theos </italic>whose Son, the Incarnated God, is “The Physician of soul and body.” Jesus Christ has inaugurated the mission of the Church, the mission of healing, and the Church, Christ’s presence in the world, is the means of this ministry. Meyendorff enlightens his readers in explaining that, in the Orthodox Church, the rite of the Anointing of the Sick is but one aspect of the ministry of the Church. It goes along with the daily, weekly and liturgical cycles, along with the sacraments and the entire prayers of blessing from the minute a child is born until after a person’s death. The Church is there accompanying the faithful to their salvation in the Kingdom where there is no sorrow, nor sickness nor death.</p>
<p>The goal of every believer, as Meyendorff points out, is the Kingdom of God, where sickness and death, which entered the world as a result of the original sin of disobedience, have no function, no power and no reality. However, in “the Church, particularly in the liturgy, we get a foretaste of the life of the Kingdom” (p. 66), though first, we should repair the broken communion by rejecting the fallen world and obediently entering into the Church through the sacrament of Baptism, which cleanses our sins and allows us to become, by adoption, children of God and heirs of the Kingdom.  </p>
<p>In order to become heir to the Kingdom, the person should progress through Baptism, Chrismation and Eucharist. Meyendorff calls Baptism “the paradigmatic sacrament of healing” (p. 22). Through Baptism, through the rejection of the earlier man and putting on Christ during the immersion in and arising from the water, a healing of the whole person, body, soul and spirit, is accomplished and, as such, humanity is re-created, healed, and “the brokenness of [the] human existence is abolished” (p. 23).</p>
<p>Then, the person undergoes a “personal Pentecost,” the sacrament of Chrismation, in which a new creation, a new order, will be in control, for after “the destructive spirit … has been expelled, drowned in the waters of baptism … the Holy Spirit is invited to enter and abide in the newly baptized” (p. 22), who becomes Christ. This new man, through the anointing with Chrism, is charged with bringing the healing message to the world, as did the Christ who brought healing to the world through His saving acts on earth.</p>
<p>But yet, the anointed does not become an heir to the Kingdom because he does not get a foretaste of life. He does not become a “partaker of Christ and a sharer in his divine nature” (p. 23). He needs the “medicine of immortality,” which is offered in the Eucharist, the celebration of Christ’s Incarnation. And as such, the communion with God is restored, the process of healing is reinstated and will be maintained, and the way to the Kingdom is established.</p>
<p>However, Meyendorff observes that “every sacramental rite contains an element of healing, [and it] is the continuation of the healing power of Baptism” (p. 26). The rite of the Anointing of the Sick is the same, but it is addressed to those who are suffering. It identifies them with Christ’s suffering and, at the same time, with His Resurrection. At this rite, the wounds and the suffering of the flesh are consecrated and the spiritual suffering is supported by the power of the community and the image of eternal hope. It offers another opportunity for reconciliation between God and humanity, which, in this case, is the sick who are “brought back to the reality they entered at their Baptism: the victory over sin and death” (p. 88). Meyendorff also highlights that, whether the anointed recovers or dies, the rite awakens in the sufferer the purpose of an Orthodox Christian life, <italic>Theosis</italic>, and an awareness that sickness is but a <italic>Martyria</italic>, a witness to and of faith, and that it may lead him or her, sooner or later, to Eternal Life where there is neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor sighing, but life everlasting. The sickness of the believer witnesses to the Victory of the Cross over the power of sickness and death.</p>
<p>Finally, and as an Orthodox royal priest, Meyendorff is very faithful and obedient to the grace of Chrismation that sealed him. He gives few suggestions that accord with his observations of the modern medical system and the contemporary celebration of the rite. He directly and openly recommends that a reactivation of the rite should be undertaken according to its proper understanding. This ministry of healing should be reactivated by the whole Church, the totality of the community, clergy and laity alike, as it was described in the Epistle of James.</p>
<p>Therefore, he suggests that the faithful laity should bring the sick to the Church, get involved in the service, or visit the sick where they are. As such, they fulfill an act of their royal priesthood’s role, which is very important as part of the ministry of the Church, and at the same time, they support the sick by preventing their isolation in their spiritual suffering. This ministry allows them to see the face of Christ in the sick, the true reality of their human nature, to see that Christ is the Physician of the soul and body and that “healing is far too important to be left to the medical professions alone” (p. 12). Then he advises the clergy that they must do their best to encourage and engage all laity in visiting the sick and those who are too ill to leave home, and to mention the names of the sick whenever possible during the various services. However, Meyendorff insists on the rite being brought back to its proper liturgical practice as independent from Holy Week, and that it is to be celebrated as needed, for the service is not a replacement for Confession as it is understood in the Antiochian and Greek churches or as the “Last Rite” in the Slavic tradition, which have altered its true meaning and its true purpose. He says that this is very easily accomplished in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Meyendorff’s book is easy to read, concise and handy. He has included many prayers, the complete and abbreviated rites, and necessary information. He has not limited himself and his readers to the rite alone, but he expands their horizons to the whole Orthodox theology through the explanation of a few Sacraments. I believe that he has directed his book to the general public regardless of their beliefs. However, the book also opens horizons to researchers and theologians, allowing them to delve into the depth of the theology of the various contents of the rite and explore its pearls.</p>
