<p><italic>International Perspectives on Suburbanization: A Post-Suburban World?</italic> brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers who examine new trends and manifestations of suburban development in North and South America, Europe, and East Asia. Several themes animate the volume including whether urban deconcentration trends are novel, whether the rise of new settlement patterns continues to integrate socially and spatially with central cities, and whether there are new actors and processes operating in the production of the built environment. The editors and contributors are correct in putting a question mark after the subtitle. The “post” is a notoriously labyrinthine concept that defines easy categorization and analysis. One unifying feature of the different chapters is that scholars should not uncritically accept “post-suburban” as a periodizing term that signifies the passing of the old and the advent of the new, a view that was popularized by postmodern urban theorists associated with the Los Angeles School. Yet what is novel and breaks with the past versus continuous with longstanding trends is not at all clear and definitive, as the editors and contributors indicate throughout this well written and organized book. The volume highlights the considerable cross-national variation and plurality of suburbanization processes and problematizes simple-minded views that describe the end of the suburban era and advent of a new post-suburban world. The book is organized into four parts: City, Suburb, and Post-suburb; Post-suburbia in the Americas; Post-suburbia and Europe’s Compact Cities; Varieties of Post-suburbia in East Asia. Editors Nicholas Phelps and Fulong Wu do a fine job in their introductory and concluding chapters by offering a big picture analysis that integrates the various chapters.</p>
<p>The book is written in a comparative and national context marked by disagreement over the definitions of post-suburban and tensions over the pursuit of economic growth and environmental conservation, that debate over cross-scale interactions in the development of new patterns and processes of suburbanization. The chapter by Andrew Jonas on North America shows that the distinctive and novel feature of post-suburbs is not their separateness or autonomy but their interlock within regional structures of government relations and political-economic arrangements. The excellent chapter by Roger Keil and Douglas Young uses the metaphor of “in-betweenness” to denote the lack of fixed boundaries defining or separating the urban and suburban. In addition to Keil and Young, other chapters by Dirk Heinrichs, Michael Lukas, and Henning Nuissl on “privatization of the fringes” in Chile’s Santiago, and Tommy Firman’s chapter on the development of Jakarta, argue for the adoption of an explicitly comparative analytical strategy that stresses the path-dependent and place-specific nature of deconcentration and suburban growth processes. This focus directs our attention to the importance of analyzing nationally-specific policies and programs in the constitution, reproduction, and transformation of urban and metropolitan forms.</p>
<p>Much of the book takes the United States as the starting point for conceptualizing and analyzing suburban trends in other nations. While this makes sense, given the long history of research and analysis in the United States, the book adopts a strikingly narrow interpretation of the suburbanization process and misses the centrality of racial discrimination and segregation in the historical development of U.S. metropolitan areas and settlement spaces. More problematic is how the volume does not seriously address the continuing significance of racial discrimination and segregation in contemporary patterns of metropolitan organization and development in the United States. The interlock of the financial crisis, jobs crisis, and the subprime mortgage crisis is altering the pace, trajectory, and patterns of mortgage investment in cities around the world. This book could have been more analytical by dealing explicitly with the implications of the concatenated crises that are affecting cities and suburbs. Attention could have been given to how regional variations in real estate disinvestment are affecting the dynamics of suburban development.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the book provides tremendous insight into the socio-spatial processes and patterns of suburbanization around the world. There are three major merits of this book to be highlighted. First, unlike many edited volumes, the chapters are coherent and well integrated with the book’s overall concerns related to temporal and spatial novelty, and impact of state policies on the suburbanization process. Thus, the chapters add rich case study material to the literature on suburban development. Second, the editors’ nuanced conclusion that post-suburbia is not a prototype of urban development but rather signifies a “variety of processes of potential change at the periphery of our metropolises” (p. 255) is appreciated. Thus, sweeping generalizations and absolute conclusions regarding post-suburbanization are suspect. Rather, we should view “post-suburban” as a heuristic device that can offer us partial answers related to a new era, a new settlement space, and new actors and organized interests in the production of suburban space. Finally, the editors’ concluding chapter does an excellent job bringing together and summing up many aspects of suburbanization found throughout the book. The volume will be great reading for any urban studies course that covers global perspectives on cities and urban development. Comparative-oriented scholars will appreciate the efforts to identify commonalities and variation across cities and regions. <italic>International Perspectives on Suburbanization: A Post-Suburban World?</italic> is a valuable contribution to urban sociology, comparative-historical sociology, and political sociology, among other areas of social and spatial theorization and analysis.</p>
