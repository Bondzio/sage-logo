<abstract>
<p>This article underscores the ethical dimension of collective memory and examines how the advent of digital networked technologies challenges the mechanisms society employs to deny memories of immoral acts. The study will be grounded on an analysis of two organizations’ websites. The first was designed by members of Machsom Watch – an all-female organization whose members monitor the human rights of Palestinians at checkpoints set up by the Israeli Army. The second website was established by Shovrim Shtika – an all-male organization of veteran Israeli soldiers who collect testimonies of their comrades-in-arms who served in the Occupied Territories. The study shows that by producing (web)sites of memory in which members of the organizations store, and by which they disseminate personal memories, they establish a new archival formation that feeds into social practice. The on-line archives they create become an eminently social practice, a space of living memory and a sphere of moral engagement.</p>

<p>The role of different media in shaping, articulating and disseminating collective memories occupies a distinctive place in contemporary media studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811419636">Carey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811419636">Kitch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811419636">Meyers and Zandberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444811419636">Zelizer, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>This article addresses a question that has been virtually ignored in the extensive and growing literature on the media–memory nexus: What should be remembered? I aim to underscore the ethical dimension of collective memory and shed light on the crucial interplay between collective and individual memory. More specifically, my goal is to examine how the advent of digital networked technologies challenges the mechanisms society employs to deny memories of immoral acts and consign them to oblivion.</p>
<sec id="section1-1461444811419636">
<title>The interplay between individual and collective memory</title>
<p>The history of the study of memory could be characterized as a quest for knowledge of how people store information and access past experiences. Memory is usually conceived as individually based, something that goes on ‘inside the heads’ of individuals. Many scholars who study processes of socialization have conceptualized memory as part of the development of the self, with the aim of understanding human behavior and its emotional patterns (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811419636">Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811419636">Katriel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444811419636">Silverstone, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811419636">2004</xref>). On examining the actual content of memories, they tend to focus on personal memories of individuals (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811419636">Zerubavel, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Other critics have concerned themselves with collective memory, namely with the manner in which ‘societies remember’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811419636">Connerton, 1989</xref>). Most collective memory scholars consider their point of departure to be the groundbreaking work of sociologist Maurice Halbwachs. In Halbwachs’ account memory is always group memory, both because the individual is a derivative of some collectivity, family and community and because a group is solidified and becomes aware of itself through continuous reflection on and reconstruction of a distinctive, shared memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811419636">Halbwachs, 1992 [1951]</xref>).</p>
<p>From this perspective, collective memory is a social necessity; neither an individual nor a society can do without it. Significantly, collective memory is transmitted in an ongoing process of public commemoration and through discourses constructed by a particular group, creating social solidarity in the present, as summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811419636">Kansteiner (2002</xref>: 180):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Collective memory is not history, though it is sometimes made from similar material […]. It can take hold of historically and socially remote events but it often privileges the interests of the contemporary. It is as much a result of conscious manipulation as unconscious absorption and it is always mediated.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These assumptions regarding the mediated conscious manipulation inherent in collective memory pertain to another significant aspect of memory, that of collective amnesia. Sigmund Freud’s seminal work has rendered it obvious that failure to work through one’s past may induce symptoms of psychological distress. Freud also revealed how the self relies on a sense of continuity that makes it impossible to repress the past without paying a substantial psychological price. These assumptions, however, are less applicable on a large scale, as nations, for example, may alter or repress collective memories with psychological impunity (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811419636">Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811419636">Kansteiner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811419636">Margalit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811419636">Sturken, 1997</xref>). This important distinction was well summarized by Ernest Renan, who underscored the significance of ‘forgetting’ to the construction of social groups, notably national communities:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>… the essence of a nation is that all individuals have many things in common, and also that they have forgotten many things. No French citizen knows whether he is a Burgundian, an Alan, a Taifale, or a Visigoth, yet every French citizen has to have forgotten the massacre of Saint Bartholomew or the massacres which took place in the Midi in the thirteenth century. (1996 [1882]: 11)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Writing in the late nineteenth century, Renan noted the mechanism by which modern entities (primarily nation-states) construct collective amnesia regarding events they wish to, arguing that this forgetting process is crucial to the construction and survival of modern communities.</p>
<p>Renan’s pioneering conception of the nation as a community of shared memory and shared forgetting was expanded on in more recent studies, in which theorists examined the role of modern devices in the construction of collective memory and collective amnesia. As old affiliations lost their hold on the people, the argument goes, their bond with their past was reconstructed through second-order simulations. Professional agents produced sites of memory in language, monuments, archives, street names and the like, all of which contained one common referent: The community (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811419636">Gillis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811419636">Nora and Kritzman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811419636">Zamponi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811419636">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the vast differences among these studies, it is important to note that they all share a basic supposition, namely that in the modern era, collective memory is built on a division of labor. In his book <italic>The Ethics of Memory</italic>, Avishai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811419636">Margalit (2002)</xref> dwelled on this significant observation by coining two terms: <italic>Common memory</italic> and <italic>shared memory</italic>. A common memory, insofar as Margalit is concerned, is an aggregate notion that refers to a group of people who recall a certain episode that each of them experienced. According to Margalit, if the percentage of those who remember the episode in a given society exceeds a certain threshold, the memory of the episode is common to that society. By contrast, a shared memory is not merely an aggregate of individual memories because it requires communication. A shared memory is thus a calibrated memory in the sense that it integrates the different perspectives of those who remember the episode into one version (or a small number of versions). This standardization process allows other community members who were not there at the time of the event to plug into the experience of those who were via ‘channels of description rather than by direct experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811419636">Margalit, 2002</xref>: 52).</p>
<p>Margalit also points out another fundamental distinction between common and shared memory. While common memory (stored in the memories of numerous individuals) is usually involuntary, shared memory (calibrated memory) is voluntary and thus involves an active presentation and retelling of a story that Margalit termed ‘a division of mnemonic labor’ (2002: 52):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>In modern societies, characterized by an elaborate division of labor, the division of mnemonic labor is elaborate too. In traditional society there is a direct line from the people to their priest or storyteller or shaman. But shared memory in a modern society travels from person to person through institutions, such as archives, and through communal mnemonic devices, such as monuments and the names of streets … Whether good or bad as mnemonic devices, these complicated communal institutions are responsible, to a large extent, for our shared memories. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811419636">Margalit, 2002</xref>: 54)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The term ‘mnemonic labor’ and Margalit’s conceptualization of the role played by modern institutions in the construction of shared memories bring to the fore the responsibility of professional mnemonic agents to create and support the communities’ mnemonic channels. It has been demonstrated that such agents are responsible for constructing and upholding the shared memories of which the community is usually proud, as well as for committing memories of wrongdoing to oblivion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811419636">Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811419636">Hobsbawm and Ranger, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811419636">Renan, 1996 [1882]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811419636">Sturken,1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444811419636">Zelizer, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>It is my contention that this exclusive role of professional mnemonic agents, designated directly or obliquely by the church, state, monarchy and the like, is now being challenged with the advent of digital technologies: Devices that allow individuals to store and disseminate personal histories using accessible and shareable online network archives. This development, I suggest, gives rise to a new veritable living memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811419636">Nora, 1989</xref>) that I call <italic>joint memory</italic>. In contrast to Margalit’s <italic>shared memory</italic>, defined as a calibrated module constructed by professional agents, joint memory is a compilation of personal histories made public for the public. In my conception, joint memory differs from Margalit’s <italic>common memory</italic> (that refers to a group of people who remember a certain event) because it has a social function – to affect the memory of a collective that was absent in time, space or both from the recalled event. Significantly, joint memory is not motivated by personal interests – the desire to tell an interesting story or reveal new information – but is driven by a social purpose: Witnesses who add their recollections to an accessible and shareable compilation of memories attempt to expose events that the default collective (such as the nation) denies or wishes to forget. Therefore, joint memory may be established by networked digital technologies that facilitate direct communication among witnesses who recall an episode they experienced firsthand and mass audiences who consume these memories by operating in comparable technoscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811419636">Appadurai, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Below, I examine the nature of the memories installed in these virtual archives and demonstrate how digital platforms facilitate the emergence of ‘intentional communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811419636">Appadurai, 2003</xref>) comprising mnemonic agents that I call <italic>moral mnemonic agents</italic>. In such situations, the individual agent recalls his/her memories of wrongdoing and transgressions before large audiences with the intention of drawing attention to such occurrences, appealing to those audiences to take responsibility for the realities witnessed and change them.</p>
<p>In highlighting these mnemonic practices, I aim also to consider a somewhat neglected feature of mediated collective memory – the role of the media as a social reminder of the tasks that the collective (as a society) ought to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811419636">Neiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444811419636">Tenenboim-Weinblatt, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>The ‘crisis of witnessing’ and the emergence of the (moral) mnemonic agent</title>
<p>The rise of the moral mnemonic agent who bears witness to evil in and by the media (digital platforms included) is linked directly to the enormous transformation the theoretical and artistic fields have undergone since the Second World War (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811419636">Friedlander, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811419636">Frosh and Pinchevski, 2009</xref>). The horrific events, it is claimed, overwhelm the victims to the point at which they are unable to ‘know’ the occurrences that traumatized them and hence cannot express or document them in and by language. Shoshana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811419636">Felman and Dori Laub (1992)</xref> have dubbed this phenomenon the ‘crisis of witnessing’. Looking especially at representation of the Holocaust, they point out the impossibility of bearing witness to these horrific experiences: The events left survivors speechless, not because they did not witness the traumatic event, but rather because they did so all too overwhelmingly (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811419636">Frosh and Pinchevski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444811419636">Peters, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The Holocaust survivor who bears witness to his or her traumatic experience meets the conditions of the <italic>moral witness</italic> suggested by Avishai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811419636">Margalit (2002)</xref>, attesting to suffering inflicted by evil. Margalit insists that a person who witnesses only one of these elements – evil (e.g. reporting on a vicious plan) or suffering (e.g. surviving a natural disaster) – without the other fails to meet the criteria of a moral witness. In highlighting both these components of witnessing, Margalit touches on a third element that, in contrast to the first two, does not originate in the content of the testimony but in its objective. He argues that the testimony is essentially driven by a moral purpose. It reflects hope for a moral community that will ‘hear’ the cry and acknowledge the pain. He thus perceives the witness to be a social agent who, in testifying to his or her harsh experience, transforms (passive) addressees into active audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811419636">Ashuri, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on such observations, I aim to nuance the category of moral witness who performs memories of suffering experienced in a public space, pointing out the rise of the (moral) mnemonic agent. In my conceptualization, the (moral) mnemonic agent is the one who recalls his or her memories regarding events in which others have suffered and by that act of witnessing renders this suffering visible and hence difficult to marginalize or deny. The moral aspect of this act, in my estimation, derives from the content of the mnemonic text (testimony about suffering inflicted by evil) and from its objective (calling on the audience to shed their observer garb and re-enact the experience of the harsh realities).</p>
<p>Below, I identify the nature and characteristics of (moral) mnemonic agents. The phenomenon is not new, of course, but I focus specifically on its development in the digital era, considering those agents who establish (web)sites of memory in and by which they bear witness to their experiences. This endeavor will be accomplished through an analysis of two organizations’ (web)sites of memory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461444811419636">1</xref></sup> One is a site designed by members of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811419636">Machsom (Checkpoint) Watch (2001)</xref> – an all-female organization whose members call for an end to the Israeli occupation and monitor the human rights of Palestinians at checkpoints set up by the Israeli Army. Members of the group are present on a daily basis at the checkpoints, recording events and then publishing their reports on their website, designed expressly for this purpose.</p>
<p>The second website was established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444811419636">Shovrim Shtika (Breaking the Silence) (2004)</xref> – an all-male organization of veteran Israeli soldiers who collect testimonies of their comrades-in-arms who served in the Occupied Territories during the Second Intifada. Like members of Machsom Watch, these mnemonic agents store and disseminate their memories in and by the organization’s website.</p>
<p>The two organizations were chosen because in both cases, the mnemonic agents bear witness to a similar situation – Israel’s occupation of the West Bank – but their witnessing position in relation to the events is very different: Members of Machsom Watch willingly stand at the checkpoints and testify to what they see as evil committed in their name against the Palestinians at these locations, while members of Shovrim Shtika not only witnessed the events they report about but were also, to some extent, their perpetrators. As members of both organizations do not bear witness to their own suffering and pain, I do not regard them as <italic>moral witnesses</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811419636">Margalit, 2002</xref>), but will argue that there is a moral component to their witnessing that forms the basis of their mnemonic activities: Through the reports posted on their websites, they aim at according visibility to the evil they witnessed and the suffering it causes.</p>
<p>In focusing on two dissident movements that utilize digital platforms in their attempt to contest the national (Israeli) collective memory, my aim is to enrich the somewhat limited body of work devoted to media memory production. The main goal, however, is to probe current trends and changes that pose new challenges for media-memory scholarship: the sharp increase in accessible online archives which offer documentation of the past to mass audiences, the blurring of personal/private memory vs. collective/shared memory, the interactive consumptions of the published recollections, and the ease with which conflicting representations of the past can now be assessed and compared <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811419636">Neiger et al., 2011</xref><bold>).</bold></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1461444811419636">
<title>Attaining a voice</title>
<p>The organizations under investigation – Machsom Watch and Breaking the Silence – gather information about incidents of evil and suffering they themselves witnessed and disseminate their memories regarding the suffering of the Palestinians, through and on their website, to the public responsible (directly or indirectly) for this suffering. The websites of the groups may be regarded as a metaphorical witness stand that the members ascend. I demonstrate that for members of both organizations, this act of taking the witness stand – i.e. being physically present at the site of events and then reporting their memories – is not intended just to recount what went on at the Occupied Territories but also to appeal to their audience and influence it. Put differently, by taking this act of testimony upon themselves, they simultaneously commit themselves to others (to the Palestinians, whose suffering they witness) and give themselves and their memories over to others (to the Israeli public, to which they address their reports). Significantly, these ‘witnesses’ testify to ongoing events that occur under Israel’s longstanding occupation of the Occupied Territories and in this sense privilege the interests of the contemporary, as is often the case in the production of collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811419636">Kansteiner, 2002</xref>: 180). Despite referring to a continuing condition, however, the witnesses reconstruct their experiences and re-present them in their online archives as personal recollections. The online platforms that function both as archives of reconstructed experiences (with emphasis on the past) and as arenas for contemporary public intervention in an ongoing situation (with emphasis on the present and future) prompt and nourish, as I will show, mnemonic activity that both organizations initiate.</p>
<p>The above situation is largely facilitated by internet accessibility. There are fewer entry barriers to the internet than to traditional archives and other official/professional sites of memory. Unlike professional mnemonic agents (such as historians, museum curators, journalist and the like), the agents who use the internet to store and disseminate memories of events they experienced firsthand are not required to have any professional training; distribution of content online requires only minimal skills and the market entry cost is low compared to that of other media. The upshot is that individuals can distribute content directly to their audiences, with no professional mediation, while avoiding any dependence on an organizational hierarchy or the financial interests of official institutions and media moguls. Studies examining online activism show that digital platforms bring a greater variety of voices and testimonies to the representation posted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811419636">Downey and Fenton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811419636">Downing, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811419636">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811419636">Downey and Fenton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811419636">Kahn and Kellner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This basic element becomes prominent in the websites of the two organizations studied here. In the first sentence of the <italic>About Us</italic> section of their website, members of Breaking the Silence (hereinafter: ‘BtS’) introduce their organization, and the nature of the memories they collect in the on-line archive they have created:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><bold>Breaking the Silence</bold> is an organization of veteran Israeli soldiers that collects testimonies of soldiers who served in the Occupied Territories during the Second Intifadah. [bold in original]</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By calling their organization <italic>Breaking the Silence</italic> and by highlighting this name (placing it at the beginning of the first sentence and writing it in bold letters), members of BtS underline the accessibility feature of the digital device they use. The on-line archive they offer facilitates public visibility of their memories of the military activities in which they were engaged. Employing such digital tools, members of BtS may thus break the silence nurtured by army commanders and the Israeli leadership as a whole. For as they stress in the <italic>About Us</italic> section of their website: ‘While this reality is known to Israeli soldiers and commanders, Israeli society continues to turn a blind eye, and to deny that which happens in its name.’</p>
<p>Like them, members of Machsom Watch (hereinafter: ‘MW’) highlight the accessible element of the internet and the crucial role this feature plays in their mnemonic activity. In the <italic>About Us</italic> section of their website they write:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>MachsomWatch, in existence since 2001, is an organisation of peace activist Israeli women against the Israeli Occupation of the territories and the systematic repression of the Palestinian nation.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As activists, members of MW consider the online platform on which they post their testimonies regarding events they experienced in the Occupied Territories to be a vehicle that enables them to shift the power base of collective (national) history and take it away from the traditional and institutional producers of media. The digital platforms become a means through which they represent ‘slices of reality’ that professional agents operating in traditional media (established archives included) tend to deny or commit to oblivion. In other words, the internet becomes home to the alternative discourse both organizations wish to create. While established media operate within the consensus, displaying a clear tendency to adopt the hegemonic-official position on issues (in this case, to ignore or conceal Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories), the online archive posted on the internet allows these users to publicly voice controversial opinions that challenge conformist ideologies and to advocate views held by marginalized groups. In the <italic>About Us</italic> section, BtS members highlight this goal:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Cases of abuse towards Palestinians, looting, and destruction of property have been the norm for years, but are still excused as military necessities, or explained as extreme and unique cases. Our testimonies portray a different, and much grimmer picture.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By creating their own websites at which they post their testimonies regarding marginalized and even denied realities, the organizations under investigation somehow extended the boundaries of the media witnessing ‘field’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811419636">Ashuri and Pinchevski, 2009</xref>) and managed to obtain first agency and then voice in the public domain. Yet, as Ashuri and Pinchevski noted, one essential requirement for agents wishing to enter the media witnessing field is ‘to compel to audience to take notice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811419636">Ashuri and Pinchevski, 2009</xref>: 136). The authors show that even in cases in which agents bear witness in and by traditional aggregative mass media, such as television, their task is far from straightforward. Arguably, when operating in a many-to-many medium, witnessing agents face a greater challenge in the sense that what websites gain in accessibility they may pay for in relative invisibility. Hence the posted utterances regarding denied occurrences can just as easily remain in the dark or lost to public view as exposed and preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811419636">Malin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It becomes apparent that both organizations try to compensate for this noticeable element of the internet by exploiting the advantage of this technology over traditional mass media, namely its constituting a continuous platform for contemporary public visibility. They thus construct ‘lived histories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811419636">Nora, 1989</xref>) at their websites. In contrast to ‘history’ (the intellectual manifestation of past representation), the memories they assemble and disseminate rely on their personal knowledge and experience. As Pierre Nora explained: ‘[…] memory is by nature multiple and yet specific; collective plural, and yet individual. History on the other hand, belongs to everyone and to no one, whence its claim to universal authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811419636">Nora 1989</xref>: 9). MW members underscore this observation in describing the nature of their activities:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Each checkpoint team visits a number of checkpoints, remaining at each one as long as necessary to understand and report on what is happening – usually a couple of hours or longer. […] In cases of seemingly needless or unwarranted delays, and of rude and aggressive behaviors towards those seeking to cross a checkpoint, we intervene …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By using the present tense, ‘first person’ mode (‘Each checkpoint team visits […], We stand […], we intervene […]’), members of MW flag the permanence dimension inherent in their mnemonic activity. As they see it, the group’s activists bear witness to past events that embody presence in social reality – they are still lived. The <italic>About Us</italic> section highlights this element:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Every morning and afternoon, shifts of women go out to some 30 checkpoints within the West Bank and on the seam-line between Israel and Palestine, to monitor and document IDF and Border Police conduct, and safeguard Palestinian human rights.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A clear manifestation of such living personal memories, accumulated ‘every morning and afternoon’ and ‘sent to the website,’ may be found in the testimonies they store on the online platform they established. Here is one example:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444811419636">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Hamra, Ma’ale Efrayim, Tayasir, Thu 19.8.10, Afternoon</p>
<p>Observers: Yif’at D., Dafna B. (reporting)</p>
<p>It’s the hottest day in many years. The temperature is about 48 degrees Celsius. We suffered greatly, but our suffering was nothing compared to that of the Palestinians forced to trudge along while fasting. We saw people drenching kaffiyas and handkerchiefs in water and wrapping the wet rags around their burning bald heads, perspiring faces, eyes dimmed from the heat …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The witnesses here testify to the events they experienced firsthand using their own language and style and in so doing flag the personal dimension of their memories. As the women of MW see it, the accumulation of personal memories and different perspectives and styles only enhances the bigger, complex picture of life at the checkpoints, comprising various testimonies that come together as a whole. Group activists insist, however, that all testimonies will share some basic features. As in the above utterance, the checkpoint’s location and time of observation are listed in the headline, at least one photograph is included and the observer’s first name and initial of surname are provided. But most importantly, as mentioned earlier, the utterance is written in first-person mode, with emphasis on the witness’s own deeds and experience. These choices made by MW members are significant as they underscore the personal and intimate element inherent in the mnemonic activity these agents took upon themselves. In the online representation of what occurs at the checkpoints, they insist on disseminating everyday ‘news of the self’ rather than ‘news of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811419636">Hoskins et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The subjective principle inherent in the digital memories constructed in online archives was doubly noted on BtS’s website:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Since 2004, Breaking the Silence has collected testimonies from over 650 soldiers who have served in the territories since the beginning of the second Intifadah. The collectors of the testimonies are veteran combatants <italic>themselves</italic> […].</p>
<p>The testimonies are published with minimal editing and with complete confidentiality, in order to protect the soldiers and to encourage them to speak. [italics mine]</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The website – a virtual non-bounded space – allows each member of the organization, each witness, to present ‘his own truth,’ with ‘minimal editing,’ while his authority as a witness derives precisely from the ability to describe his experience from his own perspective, using his own style and language. Members of BtS stress this element by indicating on their website: ‘Breaking the Silence’s first priority is towards the soldiers who want to explain to the public about their service.’ The following example of posted utterances – testimony presented on the website by a soldier of the Nahal elite unit – reflects this attitude:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We would put up all kinds of road-blocks following various alerts. I regarded them as random, silly and ineffective security-wise, and terribly disruptive of life in Huwwara, the village/small town directly south of the Huwwara checkpoint, which is huge […]. I see a 23-year old woman from Balata […] I call up my company commander and tell him: listen, something here looks wrong to me. I know that, professionally and all, 23-year old women are supposed to be married. He replied: ‘Okay, hold her up at the roadblock for four hours.’ I said, ‘What? Just check her ID, see if she’s clean or not. If she isn’t, I’ll take her.’ ‘No, no, make her stay for four hours.’ What for? ‘That’s how they’ll learn not to come out of Nablus.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Like this veteran/witness, BtS members post memories of events they have witnessed, adopting and developing a storytelling style that is highly personal in choice of language, length and focus on the witness’s personal experience.</p>
<p>The decision by both organizations studied to adopt a storytelling style, and use the narrative format for their witnessing texts, is not an obvious one. Arguably, an important feature of the internet is its modularity, namely the principle whereby media elements remain independent even when assembled into large-scale objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811419636">Hoskins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811419636">Manovich, 2001</xref>). As demonstrated, the activists indeed employ this characteristic and store their utterances in multiple formats (written texts, audio artifacts, video clips, photographs, maps and the like). Nevertheless, it becomes apparent (see examples above) that the activists also embrace the narrative mode in their joint compilations of memory. The decision to opt for the storytelling format for their utterances is particularly meaningful because this activity constitutes a way in which members of the organizations maintain and develop agency. That is, storytelling is a process that enabled the activists to hold on to a sense of themselves as agents who have some control over the realities to which they testify (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811419636">Couldry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444811419636">Orgad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444811419636">Thompson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>As shown above, the narrative both organizations construct in their joint compilation of memory is that of victimization. MW’s website emphasizes the suffering of the Palestinians, who were victimized directly by Israeli soldiers and indirectly by the Israeli leadership/public. Similarly, the BtS website tells a story of evil committed against the Palestinians by Israeli soldiers and the Israeli public that turns a blind eye to these realities.</p>
<p>Significantly, in employing the storytelling mode – i.e. constructing their witnessing texts as narratives of victimization – both organizations essentially use the technology at hand not only to testify to their experiences or knowledge but also to tell Israeli society a particular story about its immoral behavior and responsibility for the suffering.</p>
<p>Storage and dissemination of personal stories online are of special importance in the situation under examination, in which a mnemonic agent perceives bearing witness as part of a moral mission to publicize realities of wrongdoing and suffering, undermine their exclusion and allow their return to the collective consciousness. As members of BtS elucidate:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><bold>Breaking the Silence</bold> voices the experiences of those soldiers, in order to force Israeli society to address the reality which it created. [bold in original]</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement clarifies that BtS, like MW, employs digital means to promote a moral task: ‘[T]o force Israeli society to address the reality which it created.’ As argued earlier, the (moral) mnemonic agent (members of BtS included) does not set out to expose an objective truth concerning this reality in a public space, but rather to present a personal memory publicly, that is, to expose a personal experience about a harsh reality in which the mnemonic agent partakes. Exposing this personal memory is made possible in part by presenting a story that conveys, through its own uniqueness, the multifaceted reality that is revealed in a particular way to the author who recounts it.</p>
<p>Despite their desire to describe events as accurately as possible, members of BtS realize that the testimony each soldier provides forms only ‘one part’ of the story. Hence activists encourage witnesses to provide elaborate testimonies, believing that the amalgam of utterances will form a more complex picture of events.</p>
<p>Significantly, the BtS website points out a crucial element that characterizes their mnemonic activity and bestows it with meaning:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Soldiers who serve in the Territories are witness to, and participate in military actions which change them immensely.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>BtS makes it clear here that the memories of past events being collected, stored and distributed on and by the website are living memories in a sense that the events experienced <italic>transformed</italic> the witnesses – the soldiers – who recall them.</p>
<p>Interestingly, by acting as (moral) mnemonic agents who publicly recall memories of evil committed against the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, members of BtS are framing themselves as ‘moral witnesses’, i.e. individuals who endured transgressions. The act of posting their memories of the events that harmed them reflects the hope for a collective that will ‘hear’’ their cry and acknowledge their pain and thereby usher in a new reality, as the group’s website indicates:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Discharged soldiers who return to civilian life discover the gap between the reality which they encountered in the Territories, and the silence which they encounter at home. In order to become a civilian again, soldiers are forced to ignore their past experiences. <bold>Breaking the Silence</bold> voices the experiences of those soldiers, in order to force Israeli society to address the reality which it created. (bold in original)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The harsh experience BtS voices here resonates with Judith Lewis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811419636">Herman’s (1997)</xref> observation regarding the complex relationship between the individual who witnessed evil and the community at which his/her testimony is targeted. Herman claimed that the transformation of a passive individual who experienced harsh occurrences firsthand into a witness is by no means straightforward, as testimony to horrendous occurrences bears traces of an event that an entire community wishes to forget. This creates a situation in which the individual, who would perhaps like to forget the event but is unable to do so, faces considerable social pressure and harbors strong (sometimes unconscious) motives for leaving the past behind. Thus, the process of witnessing usually begins when the (potential) witness encounters denial, even when the facts are known and the relevant information is accessible. This process exposes aspects of past events that had been kept in the dark and disavowed, although their emotional hold remains intense and present.</p>
<p>As noted above, the online platform, unlike mass media (e.g. television, radio or print), has few entry barriers and thus may contain memories the targeted community prefers to deny or commit to oblivion. Furthermore, it can be updated by producer/s that control its reciprocal nature, and allows them to disseminate ‘new’ and ‘old’ memories simultaneously. The witness’s ability to provide constant reports of harsh events and the public’s ability to consume the accumulated utterances at all times enable both sides to form a picture of the transformative harsh events that continues to affect the realities of the witness who was transformed by these events. Arguably, this differentiates the mnemonic agent from professional agents who are in most cases external to the memories they construct in and by the media, as the media in which they operate are not universally accessible at all times. Consequently, their accumulated information regarding past events is not lived and is thus alien to the community’s social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811419636">Nora, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In highlighting the importance of testifying to personal living experiences in a public space, members of both organizations perceive the internet as a valuable platform for archiving their documented testimonies, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811419636">Hoskins et al. (2009</xref>: 8) observed:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Like traditional media, history shares a one-to-many approach in disseminating its messages. It is authoritative and institutionalized. […] Memory takes another approach. It is more peer-to-peer (to use digital media terminology) in its dissemination and consumption.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The peer-to-peer feature, digital tools and memory-sharing make the online platform a highly effective space in which to achieve the objectives of both MW and BtS. In particular, it enables these organizations to promote a moral mission, namely to uphold a moral community that acknowledges the suffering and pain of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and thereby to usher in a new order.</p>
<p>Unlike mainstream media that allow for linear (and therefore sequential) reports, the website constitutes a non-linear, timeless archive, a feature that makes it possible to disseminate and consume a routine experience of suffering and wrongdoing at any given time. This element is important, as professional mnemonic agents (such as historians, museum curators and the like) who archive information regarding such occurrences typically collect extraordinary histories that presumably do not exist anywhere else (otherwise, there would be no reason or justification to archive it). In a similar vein, professional mnemonic agents operating in mass media who report on past events in and by them tend to either calibrate the memories of a small number of witnesses who have experienced a certain occurrence firsthand or publish their own memories about their personal experiences, thereby exposing their audiences to new and/or extraordinary events.</p>
<p>In reflecting on their role as mnemonic agents, members of both organizations pointed to the significance of this non-linear website feature in achieving their objective, maintaining that the ability to provide memories about habitual events and to consume the joint memories they construct on a daily basis allows them and their audiences to gain a more complete picture of the harsh day-to-day <italic>routine</italic> of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461444811419636">
<title>Sharing experiences</title>
<p>Significantly, the organizations’ mnemonic activity is not intended merely to accord public exposure to evils committed against the Palestinians by the Israeli ‘occupier’ but also – ultimately – to mobilize the Israeli public, to impel it to action that will bring an end to the occupation and the suffering it causes, as the BtS website declares: ‘We demand accountability regarding Israel’s military actions in the Occupied Territories perpetrated by us and in our name.’ The MW site echoes this sentiment: ‘We call for Palestinian freedom of movement within their own territory and for an end to the Occupation that destroys Palestinian society and inflicts grievous harm on Israeli society.’</p>
<p>These declarations underscore a significant feature of the internet – interactivity – that I described as a catalyst for the emergence of the (moral) mnemonic agent who attempts to mobilize in the process of witnessing a seemingly immoral society. Unlike mainstream media, that are typified by linear representation of symbolic content, the internet allows for interactive consumption of its content. This unique characteristic contributes to the creation of a more active experience of consumption, in which the consumer of ‘joint memories’ posted on digital networks archives also functions as its editor.</p>
<p>The two websites studied here clearly contain common interactive features: Both offer written testimonies at the core of their respective websites, along with audio-visual reports (produced by the organizations themselves or by mass media), photographs taken by the witnesses themselves and media clips (mostly produced by professional journalists) reporting wrongdoings against the Palestinians. The addressee can consume the various items published in any combination desired, as well as to download them and create unique compilations that could be disseminated to others (by digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Flicker and the like).</p>
<p>On the BtS website, personal testimonies are organized around macro themes such as: Killing/murder, house demolition, arrests, routine and the like. The consumer who bears witness to the witnessing agents can navigate among the various topics, as well as between the individual utterances.</p>
<p>MW opted for a somewhat different design with the aim of achieving a similar goal. In its online archive, consumers can look up testimonies by searching multiple fields: Checkpoint name (site of event attested to), date of witnessed occurrence, event context (e.g. conflicts with soldiers, maltreatment, military activity during closure) and the like. The website also offers an interactive map displaying the various checkpoints. At any time, users may click on a selected spot and read testimonies regarding the occurrences that took place there. In addition, a user-friendly <italic>Contact Us</italic> feature enables each user to request and obtain specific information. Both websites invite users to witness the harsh reality in the Occupied Territories firsthand by joining offline location tours in the West Bank, organized by members of the respective organizations.</p>
<p>The consumption pattern that results in interactivity is an essential element in the rise of the (moral) mnemonic agent because in compiling memories about evil, the moral mnemonic agent aims at having the addressees share in the experience of it and the responsibility for it. It is precisely in this interactive process that the passive addressees shed their observer garb and become (moral) mnemonic agents whose use of digital technology re-enacts the harsh realities to which members of both organizations bear witness in and by the digital platform they use.</p>
<p>Significantly, however, while promoting interactivity, both organizations simultaneously sustain and even intensify a sealed ‘witnessing field’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811419636">Ashuri and Pinchevski, 2009</xref>). The internet facilitates attainment of this goal, as it enables members of the organizations to control (and by implication to limit) the reciprocal characteristics of their digital platform. Thus, while each member can store reports on the organization’s website and disseminate them among mass audiences, persons ineligible for membership (men in the case of MW and non-soldiers in the case of BtS) are disinclined to respond regarding the events presented. Significantly, the activists exclude also the Palestinians (the victims) from the archive they establish. This creates a situation in which eyewitnesses to events in the Occupied Territories who cannot join the organizations pose no opposition to the testimonies and views MW and BtS members present in the virtual archives they established.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I explored the construction of joint memories at (web)sites of memory that become spaces of aspiration rather than mere recollections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811419636">Appadurai, 2003</xref>). Examining the website created, I showed how digital platforms facilitate the emergence of mnemonic agents that I called moral mnemonic agents – a condition in which the individual agent recalls his/her memories of wrongdoing and transgressions before large audiences with the intention of drawing attention to such occurrences, appealing to those audiences to take responsibility for and change the realities witnessed.</p>
<p>Following many other scholars, I underscored the <italic>accessibility</italic> element of the internet and suggested that it poses almost no financial/professional barriers, allowing individuals without capital or formal skills access to it. This independence of financing and of mandatory appeal to the broadest possible public makes it possible for internet users to voice controversial opinions regarding marginalized occurrences. This is of special significance when the online mnemonic activity has a moral dimension, as in this case – to expose evil and remind the collective (as a society) that it must prevent it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811419636">Neiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444811419636">Tenenboim-Weinblatt, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>I suggested further that the absence of a professional barrier online also contributes to the emergence of a moral mnemonic agent by allowing for stylistic variety instead of the uniformity that characterizes the professional environment (journalism, for example). In the two cases examined, the activists adopt (and develop) a storytelling style that is highly personal in various ways, including choice of language, length and focus on the witness’s own experiences. This element is of particular importance when the mnemonic agent perceives his/her actions as part a moral mission, as in the case examined. The emphasis in this moral act is not on revealing the ‘objective truth’ but rather on presenting a personal experience in the public sphere – revealing the inner ‘truth’ of the witness.</p>
<p>I argue that the internet has additional features that facilitate the emergence of the moral mnemonic agent on which I focused. One such dominant feature is its asynchronous and continuous nature. The websites studied constitute vast archives that can be updated at any given moment, allowing their producers to store and disseminate ‘new’ and ‘old’ information simultaneously. The <italic>durability</italic> feature of the digital platform makes it possible to represent an ongoing experience of suffering and pain – the core function of organizations seeking to mobilize addressees into changing the realities to which they testified.</p>
<p>One final Internet feature that I described as a catalyst for the emergence of the moral mnemonic agent is <italic>interactivity</italic> that contributes to the creation of a more active experience of consumption in which the consumer of memories also functions as their editor and – as such – as their disseminator. This unique consumption experience is an essential element in the rise of the moral mnemonic agent because in gathering information about injustice and suffering and passing it on to others, the agent seeks to have consumers share in the experience as well as in the responsibility for it. In this process, passive addressees shed their observer garb and become (moral) mnemonic agents whose use of digital technology re-enacts the experience of the harsh realities presented in the web(sites) of memories.</p>
<p>By producing websites in which they store and by which they collectively disseminate their personal memories, mnemonic agents (like members of Machsom Watch and Breaking the Silence), establish new archival formations that feed into social practice. Rather than calcifying memory, the web(sites) of memory they create become an eminently social practice, spaces of veritable living memory and spheres of moral engagement.</p>
