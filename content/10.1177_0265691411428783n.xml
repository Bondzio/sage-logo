<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783n"><title>Daniel A. Crews, <italic>Twilight of the Renaissance: The Life of Juan de Valdés</italic>, University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 2008; xi + 282 pp., 2 maps; 9780802098672, £45.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The Spaniard Juan de Valdés has been traditionally known as a major figure in Italian ‘Evangelism’, the grey area between Catholicism and Protestantism in which Justification and the role of faith therein were central concerns. The members of his circle in Naples and of the successor circle attached to Reginald Pole in Viterbo were known as <italic>i spirituali</italic> and Valdés has figured in the historiography somewhat as a disembodied spirit. Historians have been aware that his brother Alfonso combined the role of servant of Charles V with that of man of letters and polemicist. Crews is the first scholar, however, to show effectively how Juan combined a less formal service function with his own literary and religious engagements. He was one of those <italic>letrados</italic> of <italic>hidalgo</italic> origin whose expertise was essential to the grandees who played the star roles in Spanish policy. Crews reveals Juan as a being of flesh and blood, ‘brilliant, spiritual, sensual, earnest, ambitious, deceptive and egotistical’, who ‘travelled down an amoral career path typical of courtiers of his age’.</p>
<p>J. C. Nieto in 1970 identified the origins of Juan’s religious thought in a Spanish context, specifically with Alumbradism, principally imbibed through the figure of Pedro Ruiz de Alcaraz. In the last two decades there has been a rich scholarly literature, not least in English, on the ferment of religious ideas in early sixteenth-century Spain, in which Alumbradism and Erasmianism mingled with philologically informed biblical studies. Crews consolidates the picture of the Spanish roots of Juan’s religious thought, examining his network of personal relations. Having attracted the unwelcome attentions of the Spanish Inquisition, Juan moved to Italy. Here, as diplomatic agent and gatherer of intelligence, he played a major role in the implementation of Charles V’s policies for the peninsula, first at the court of pope Clement VII, under whose pontificate he held the title of private papal chamberlain while also being officially a member of Charles V’s Spanish secretariat, then, after Clement’s death, as adviser to the Viceroy of Naples, Pedro de Toledo, the key figure in Charles’s Italian diplomacy. Ultimately he was also adviser to Francisco de los Cobos, Charles’s <italic>supremo</italic> for Spanish and Italian affairs. Valdés was financed by ‘special funds’ from the Castilian coffers, as well as an enviable collection of civil offices and church benefices. In Naples he developed ties with the great aristocratic beauty Giulia Gonzaga, first as attorney and then as spiritual counsellor. Juan’s own culture and wealth enabled him, in association with Giulia, to host an informal academy of sociable ladies and gentlemen whose concerns were in the first instance with <italic>belles lettres</italic> and with the celebration of beauty, but which evolved into a circle of <italic>spirituali</italic>. Juan had a mission to promote the claims of Spanish as a literary language in emulation of similar efforts by Bembo and others to define and promote the Italian <italic>volgare</italic>; he accordingly forged amicable links with the Italian literary intelligentsia. This activity, which was a valuable accompaniment to his role as political agent, has hitherto received inadequate attention from historians. The connection with the spiritually tortured Giulia led Juan to recommence writing on spiritual matters, but his role as Charles V’s servant also caused him to engage with the spiritual angst that lay at the core of magisterial Protestantism. In 1541, under pressure from Charles V who desperately needed German support for the war against the Turks, pope Paul III, who in turn needed the support of Spanish troops in his own domain, sent Gasparo Contarini as papal legate to the Diet of Regensberg with authority to promote a colloquy between Catholic and Protestant theologians in the interests of a general conciliation. The Venetian Contarini had affinities with the <italic>spirituali</italic> of Naples and Viterbo and was the sort of eirenicist whom the Imperialists wanted in the post. The ‘double Justification’ formula agreed between Contarini and the theologians was in fact rejected by the papal court, but the Emperor’s immediate political objectives were largely achieved. Valdes’s patron, de Toledo, had been instrumental in manipulating the Pope into appointing Contarini and allowing him a free hand. Valdes’s wrtings on Grace and Justification at this time supported the Emperor’s eirenicist policy in Germany and Contarini certainly studied them. Crew’s book breaks new ground in showing how Valdes’s political, social, literary and religious engagements were all interlinked. It also sheds much new light on the workings of Charles V’s system of alliances in Italy and on the connections between Italian and German affairs during his reign.</p>
