<p>Rates of prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes in adolescents have more than doubled in recent years in spite of stabilized obesity rates in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513475873">May, Kuklina, &amp; Yoon, 2012</xref>). Early recognition of related risk factors and implementation of preventive strategies to address modifiable risk factors is necessary to lessen future prevalence rate increases. It is never too soon to implement such preventive strategies since recent reports indicate one in seven low income, preschoolers is obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513475873">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012</xref>), and acanthosis nigricans (AN) prevalence rate in children is close to 7% in many studies.</p>
<p>Although it has been established that generalized AN screening is a poor discriminator for detecting Type 2 diabetes in children, the presence of AN is an excellent indicator for hyperinsulinemia, an independent risk factor associated with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Determining the presence of AN in children may have a more profound impact on preventive strategies rather than trying to use as an end point indicator for Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, young children are typically capable of maintaining glucose homeostasis in spite of obesity and the presence of AN. However, this does not lessen the importance of early recognition of these modifiable risk factors in children.</p>
<p>While many of the preventive strategies can be generalized to all children, being able to identify those at greatest risk for the development of diabetes may impact the future health of at-risk children. Preventive strategies for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes in children should occur within the various aspects of a child’s environment (home, school, and community) and is not the responsibility of one person or group. Having various tools to combat these risk factors or assist with preventive strategy implementation is important in battling these modifiable risk factors as they occur in children. The acanthosis nigricans screening tool was developed and evaluated as an additional tool to be used in the identification of children at greatest risk. It was categorized according to commonly used descriptors accepted in numerous adult studies assessing AN presence related to glucose homeostasis abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513475873">Venkatswami, 2012</xref>). Having Grade 3 or Grade 4 AN is often demonstrative of the abnormal glucose homeostasis associated with prediabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513475873">Brickman, Huang, Silverman, &amp; Metzger, 2010</xref>). Merely identifying the presence or absence of AN does not give a clear clinical picture of risk in children. As a clinician, having a quantitative measure of AN allows an avenue for discussion of risk reduction, preventive strategies for the family to implement. It can also be a guide for positive reinforcement as changes occur and insulin sensitivity improves, thus lessening the severity of AN.</p>
