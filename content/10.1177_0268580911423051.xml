<abstract>
<p>Using Dutch data (<italic>N</italic> = 6630), this article examines how sibling relationships (including full biological, half- and adopted siblings) differed for persons who experienced a negative life event (divorce, physical illness, psychological problems, addiction, problems with the law, victimization of abuse or financial problems) and those who did not. Results showed that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past often had less active, less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The group that experienced a physical illness formed an exception, showing more supportive and active sibling ties, but also higher levels of conflict. Results suggest inequality between persons who have experienced negative life events and those who have not in terms of access to positive and supportive sibling relationships.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>À partir de données concernant la Hollande (N = 6630), cet article étudie en quoi les rapports entre frères et sœurs (qu’ils aient deux ou un géniteur en commun ou qu’il soient adoptés) étaient différents selon que les personnes ont fait ou non l’expérience d’un évènement de vie négatif (divorce, maladie physique, problèmes psychologiques, toxicomanie, problèmes avec la loi, fait d’avoir été victime d’abus, ou problèmes financiers). Les résultats obtenus ont révélé que les personnes qui ont fait l’expérience par le passé de graves évènements de vie négatifs avaient souvent des liens moins actifs, moins solidaires et plus tendus avec leurs frères et sœurs. Les membres du groupe qui a expérimenté une maladie physique faisaient exception, dans la mesure où ils manifestaient des liens avec leurs frères et sœurs plus solidaires et plus actifs, mais aussi des niveaux de conflit plus élevés. Les résultats de cette recherche semblent indiquer un accès inégal à des rapports positifs et solidaires entre frères et sœurs pour les personnes qui ont vécu des évènements de vie négatifs et celles qui n’en ont pas vécu.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Usando datos holandeses (N = 6630), este artículo examina cómo las relaciones entre hermanos (incluyendo los hermanos biológicos, los hermanastros y los hermanos adoptados) difieren en personas que han experimentado un suceso vital negativo (divorcio, enfermedad física, problemas psicológicos, adiciones, problemas con la ley, haber sido víctimas de abuso o problemas financieros) con respecto a aquellas personas que no han padecido estos sucesos. Los resultados muestran que las personas que han experimentado eventos vitales negativos graves en el pasado tienen a menudo vínculos menos activos, menos solidarios y más tensos con sus hermanos. El grupo que ha experimentado una enfermedad física constituye una excepción, mostrando vínculos más activos y solidarios, pero también niveles más altos de conflicto. Los resultados sugieren que existe una desigualdad en el acceso a relaciones fraternas positivas y solidarias entre las personas que han experimentado eventos vitales negativos y las que no los han experimentado.</p>

<p>More and more researchers have acknowledged the importance of brothers and sisters as a source of comfort and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423051">Eriksen and Gerstel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423051">Voorpostel et al., 2007</xref>), companionship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423051">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>) and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423051">O’Bryant, 1988</xref>). Whereas people generally give prominence to the parent–child relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423051">Knijn and Liefbroer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423051">Rossi and Rossi, 1990</xref>), siblings function as important caregivers when necessary, for instance for ill siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423051">Horwitz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423051">Horwitz et al., 1992</xref>) or in old age when health becomes frail and support networks become smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423051">Cicirelli et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>It is especially insightful to study the involvement of siblings after experiencing adversity, since siblings – typically being the family relationship of the longest duration – tend to be permanent members of people’s social networks and therefore can potentially play an important role in people’s lives after the experience of a negative life event. Moreover, knowledge of the relation between major negative experiences in the past and people’s sibling relationships later in life provides insight into inequality in access to family support: persons who face more adversity in life and who may need family support more than those without these experiences might have more strained family ties rather than more supportive ones. More generally, this study sheds light on the (un)conditional nature of family obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423051">Rossi and Rossi, 1990</xref>) and the limits of and unequal access to family solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423051">Roberts et al., 1991</xref>) in the case of the sibling relationship.</p>
<p>We approach the sibling relationship as an exchange relationship subject to normative obligations in the family and explore positive and negative aspects of the adult sibling relationship (including full biological, half- and adopted siblings) after the experience of negative life events. The research question that guides the study is: to what extent is the experience of a negative life event in the past related to positive and negative aspects of the sibling tie at a later point in time; and does this vary for various negative life events? We include several characteristics of the sibling relationship that together form a general assessment of the tie, including both actual behaviour (contact, giving and receiving support and conflict) as well as the perception and evaluation of the relationship (the perceived balance of giving and taking in the relationship and the perceived quality of the relationship).</p>
<p>Using data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (2004) we examined the experience of divorce, physical and mental illness, criminal behaviour, addiction, financial problems and being a victim of abuse in relation to the aforementioned characteristics of the relationships among 6630 adult siblings (96.6 percent of which concerned full biological siblings and 3.4 percent half- and adopted siblings). Although the Netherlands is characterized by relatively high levels of individualization and low levels of adherence to norms regarding family obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423051">Inglehart and Welzel, 2005</xref>), the family still plays an important role for the provision of support and other forms of solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423051">Dykstra et al., 2006</xref>). The Netherlands as a setting for this study provides insight into how both positive and negative family dynamics are related to negative life events in an individualized context.</p>
<sec id="section1-0268580911423051">
<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0268580911423051">
<title>Sibling relationships as exchange relationships in the context of the family</title>
<p>We approach the sibling relationship as an exchange relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423051">Homans, 1992 [1951]</xref>), in which both material and intangible matters are given and reciprocated. Siblings are suitable exchange partners, because they share the same family context, bringing them together their whole lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423051">Roberts et al., 1991</xref>). Since the sibling bond is embedded in the family network, normative obligations towards the family help govern exchange among siblings. Family members feel obligated to support each other, a feeling that is stronger for closer relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423051">Rossi and Rossi, 1990</xref>). Siblings, too, feel they can rely on each other, even though actual support may be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423051">Cicirelli et al., 1992</xref>). This implies that people are willing to incur high costs in exchanges with their siblings because siblings have a strong normative obligation to return potentially large favours when needed. Whereas the process of exchange is most salient during the experience of a negative life event, also longer-term effects may be expected. This leads us to expect that persons who have experienced a negative life event in the past receive more support and have more contact compared to persons who did not experience a negative life event. Although we do not formulate explicit expectations regarding the amount of support given to a sibling, we include this measure to evaluate both directions of the exchange of support.</p>
<p>When a family member encounters problems or is faced with negative life events, refraining from helping out may be costly because it would go against the normative obligations governing exchange within the family. This could lead to negative aspects of the sibling relationship becoming more salient after the experience of a negative life event. Extensive support provision disturbs the balance of giving and receiving in relationships and can become a burden, leading to difficulties for families in coping with the problems of family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423051">Reiss and Oliveri, 1980</xref>). From this follows our expectation that persons who experienced negative life events are more likely to report higher levels of conflict, and less balanced and lower quality relationships with their siblings.</p>
<p>The extent to which siblings are involved in each other’s lives following negative life events may also be associated with the nature of the event. Following the principle of accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580911423051">Mikula, 2003</xref>), siblings may be more willing to support each other when they feel the other is entitled to their help, which may be dependent on whether one can be held accountable for the problematic situation. When a sibling is not held accountable, negative life events may have a less negative impact on the sibling relationship. For example, one might be held accountable to a lesser extent for a physical illness than for legal problems. Moreover, the extent to which the negative life event is socially acceptable might increase involvement with the sibling. The expectations regarding accountability and social acceptance of the various negative life events are formulated below.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we cannot definitely establish the direction of the causal relation. Potentially, persons who experienced negative life events may have different family relations from the outset. Nonetheless, emerging differences between the groups that experienced different events and the group that experienced no event indicate inequality in access to social support and solidarity in the sibling relationship, regardless of whether this is a cause or a consequence of the negative life events. We also note that we can only provide an approximation of how the events studied herein vary by levels of accountability and social acceptability, as all have their own dynamics and differ in more than one way from each other, even when they may resemble each other in terms of their impact on family ties.</p>

<title>Negative life events and the sibling relationship</title>
<sec id="section4-0268580911423051">
<title>Divorce</title>
<p>Longitudinal studies show that divorce is related to a decrease in happiness and self-acceptance and an increase in symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423051">Amato, 2000</xref>). Some studies indicate solely positive changes of the sibling relationship following divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423051">Connidis, 1992</xref>), whereas others show mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423051">Bedford, 1995</xref>). As divorce is increasingly common, we assume that divorce is more socially acceptable than the other events studied, leading to fewer negative consequences for the sibling relationship compared to the other events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0268580911423051">
<title>Physical illness</title>
<p>Studies on coping with a serious illness show that most of the caregiver burden rests on the shoulders of the family, usually parents, partners or adult children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423051">Bedford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423051">Horwitz, 1994</xref>). Siblings are seen as a caregiving resource but are only rarely called upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423051">Cicirelli et al., 1992</xref>). Yet, when they do provide care, the more non-normative nature of caregiving by siblings increases the experienced burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423051">Reinhard and Horwitz, 1995</xref>). One is less likely to be held accountable for a physical illness, hence we expected the sibling relationship after the experience of physical illness to be of a less negative nature than after the other events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0268580911423051">
<title>Mental illness and addiction</title>
<p>Since the majority of people with a serious mental illness are unmarried, siblings may play a more important role as caregivers than is the case for people with a physical illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423051">Horwitz, 1994</xref>). Conversely, dealing with a sibling with a mental illness (which includes alcohol or drug addiction) might be especially difficult, because mental illness is linked to functional disabilities in the social, emotional and physical domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423051">Bijl and Ravelli, 2000</xref>), inhibiting exchange. As a result we expect these individuals to have more negative or strained sibling ties. Furthermore, addiction, more so than mental illness, may be seen as self-inflicted and may be regarded as less socially acceptable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0268580911423051">
<title>Problems with the law</title>
<p>Studies on the impact of criminal behaviour on families have shown that criminal behaviour of relatives poses serious problems for the family. In the case of incarceration, family life is disrupted and, given that going to jail is socially unacceptable, stress is coped with privately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423051">Arditti, 2005</xref>). On the one hand, normative obligations towards kin may promote solidarity towards siblings in distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423051">Rossi and Rossi, 1990</xref>). On the other hand, feeling obligated to help may enhance conflict, given the culpable nature of these types of negative life events. However, empirical evidence is lacking. In sum, given the strain it puts on families, the socially unacceptable nature of those occurrences, and as we expect that the event might be considered one that is at least partially self-inflicted, we expected more strained sibling relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0268580911423051">
<title>Abuse</title>
<p>To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on support between siblings in relation to sexual or physical abuse by a third person. We include this event in an exploratory way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0268580911423051">
<title>Financial problems</title>
<p>If anyone is helping with financial problems – for instance by lending money – it is often the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423051">Wellman and Wortley, 1990</xref>). Within the family, however, siblings do not feature strongly as financial support providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423051">Felling et al., 1991</xref>). As the extent to which siblings can alleviate stress related to financial adversity remains unknown and the level of accountability is difficult to assess, we do not formulate any specific hypothesis on this event.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0268580911423051">
<title>Other influences</title>
<p>Research has shown that there is some selection according to personality traits that might also affect sibling relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423051">Kreek et al., 2005</xref>). We included extraversion and personal competence to control for the negative association between these personality traits and problem behaviour such as criminal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423051">Egan et al., 2000</xref>), addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423051">Eysenck, 1997</xref>) and depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423051">Jylhä et al., 2009</xref>). We also took into account the extent to which people keep track of their exchanges (having an exchange orientation vs a communal orientation), as this is relevant for the actual exchange people engage in.</p>
<p>The prominence of siblings fluctuates over the life course, with research evidence suggesting a decrease in contact and affectional closeness, which is according to some studies followed by an increase later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423051">Cicirelli, 1995</xref>). Conflict is generally found to decline with age and a greater age difference between siblings is associated with less involved ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423051">Cicirelli, 1995</xref>). Birth order is related to a different function in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423051">Goetting, 1986</xref>), although empirical evidence on the relation between familial sentiment and birth order is somewhat contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423051">Hardman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423051">Salmon and Daly, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Women are generally found to be more central to family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423051">Liebler and Sandefur, 2002</xref>) and tend to have more involved sibling ties than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423051">Voorpostel et al., 2007</xref>). Also, educational attainment is relevant, given that many problems more often occur within families with a low socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423051">Dodge and Pettit, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423051">Shaw et al., 1998</xref>). Living farther away makes supportive behaviour more difficult and is also found to have a negative effect on contact frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423051">Eriksen and Gerstel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423051">White and Riedmann, 1992a</xref>). Since parents, partners and adult children play a major part in the provision of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423051">Cicirelli et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423051">Wellman and Wortley, 1990</xref>) and since siblings play a larger part in the lives of single and childless people than of married and parenting individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423051">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>), the presence of at least one parent and the presence of a partner and of children in the life of both siblings in the dyad is relevant for our study. The size of the sibling group is of importance as well, inasmuch as having to distribute time and energy among more siblings may make solidarity towards any given sibling less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423051">Dykstra and Knipscheer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423051">Erikson and Gerstel, 2002</xref>). Full biological siblings tend to have closer and more supportive relationships than half-siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423051">White and Riedman, 1992b</xref>). Finally, we controlled for whether the siblings – the other end of the dyad - had experienced negative life events.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>We used data from the first wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423051">Dykstra et al., 2005</xref>). The NKPS is a large-scale data collection among a representative sample of the Dutch population on the subject of family solidarity (<italic>N</italic> = 8161). Respondents aged 18–80 were interviewed face-to-face in their homes and additionally filled out a written questionnaire. The overall response rate was 45 percent, which is comparable to those of other Dutch family surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423051">Dykstra et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the interview basic demographic information was collected on the respondent and the respondent’s family members. If the respondent had more than one sibling, the computer selected one sibling randomly about whom the interviewer collected additional information from the respondent. Of all respondents, 90.8 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 7407) had at least one sibling not living in the same household. We excluded respondents who did not fill out the written questionnaire (<italic>n</italic> = 725) and respondents with missing reports of the occurrence of negative life events and the psychological scales (<italic>n</italic> = 52), after which an analytical sample of 6630 respondents remained. Missing values in the data from the written questionnaires were imputed where possible using conditional item mean replacement.</p>

<title>Giving and receiving support in the sibling relationship</title>
<p>Respondents were asked whether they gave to as well as received from the selected sibling in the last three months help with housework, help with practical matters, showing an interest in one’s personal life, counsel or advice. Response categories for all types of support were 0 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 1 = <italic>once or twice</italic> and 2 = <italic>several times</italic>. Answers to these four questions were summed, creating a variable on giving and one on receiving support (range 0–8), with an average score of 1.99 on support given and 1.85 on support received (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>). Questions about support were not asked when there was no contact with the sibling in the past 12 months (<italic>n</italic> = 406, giving and receiving support were set to 0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0268580911423051">
<title>Relationship quality</title>
<p>Relationship quality was measured with the question <italic>How would you describe your relationship with [sibling name]?</italic> Response categories were 1= <italic>not great</italic>, 2 = <italic>reasonable</italic>, 3 = <italic>good</italic> and 4 = <italic>very good</italic>. On average, respondents scored a 2.8 on this variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0268580911423051">
<title>Balance in the sibling relationship</title>
<p>Respondents were asked whether the relationship with the sibling was characterized by equal levels of giving and receiving, by giving more than the other, or by giving less than the other. This was recoded into a yes/no variable, indicating whether the relationship was balanced or not. Of all sibling relationships 75.6 percent were characterized as balanced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>). This question was not asked when there was no contact with the sibling in the past 12 months. The analysis of this dependent variable was run for respondents reporting contact with the sibling only (<italic>n</italic> = 6227).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0268580911423051">
<title>Conflict in the sibling relationship</title>
<p>Respondents were asked whether they had any conflicts, strains or disagreements with their sibling in the last three months. Response categories were 1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>once or twice</italic> and 3 = <italic>several times</italic>. This variable was recoded into a dichotomous variable, indicating the presence or absence of conflicts. In 10.1 percent of the sibling relationships, conflicts had occurred (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>). Again, the question was not asked when there had been no contact with the sibling. As non-contact with a sibling might have resulted from unresolved conflict, we did not set conflict to 0 but ran the analyses only for the group that reported contact with the sibling in the last year.</p>

<sec id="section20-0268580911423051">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<sec id="section21-0268580911423051">
<title>The occurrence of negative life events</title>
<p>In the written questionnaire, respondents reported the occurrence of several negative life events in their lives, including a serious illness or disability, serious mental problems, trouble with the law, conviction in a criminal court, addiction to alcohol or drugs, bankruptcy or serious financial problems and physical or sexual abuse. The occurrence of divorce was assessed in the face-to-face interview. The majority of the events happened longer than a year ago.</p>
<p>Having been in trouble with the law was combined with conviction in a criminal court, since these constituted similar problems, namely encounters with the law. All other negative life events were analysed separately. Respondents reported a large number of events (45.6 percent reported at least one event), which suggested that there was little tendency towards social desirability in answering the questions. Most common was physical and mental illness (22 percent and 20 percent). This high percentage suggests that also (or mainly) mild cases must have been reported. Divorce was experienced by 10.5 percent. Least common was addiction, which was reported by 2.2 percent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Several negative life events were likely to occur together with other issues. Of the respondents reporting financial problems (6 percent), 23 percent also experienced divorce and 46 percent also reported psychological problems. Of the respondents who experienced mental problems (20 percent), 17 percent were divorced or separated and 36.5 percent reported a physical illness. Of those respondents who reported addiction problems, 37 percent had also been in trouble with the law and 54 percent of them experienced serious mental problems.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0268580911423051">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>In the face-to-face interview the occurrence of negative life events in the lives of family members of the respondents was assessed. For each negative life event respondents were asked whether anyone in the family had experienced this event and subsequently they reported the family member who had experienced the event most recently. We included those events where the respondent reported that the randomly selected sibling had experienced it most recently. Because the respondents could mention themselves for all events whereas they could mention only one family member, and because they may have been less informed about events in their siblings’ lives than in their own lives, the percentage of respondents reporting their own problems was much higher than of those reporting their sibling’s negative life events. In the analyses, a dummy variable was included where 1 indicated the occurrence of a negative life event in the life of the sibling.</p>
<p>To approximate personality characteristics of the respondent, several scales were included, all on a five-point scale, with 1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> and 5 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>. First, extraversion was included with four items, such as <italic>I am good at stirring things up</italic> and <italic>I am a talkative person</italic> (α = .84). Second, personal competence was included with four items such as <italic>I am good at getting what I’m entitled to</italic> and <italic>I can cope with anything</italic> (α = .84). Third, exchange-communal orientation was included with three items: <italic>I’d feel used if someone I helped out did not do something in return, I expect people I’ve helped to do something in return</italic> and <italic>I find it worth the effort to keep close track of what I do for others</italic>. Higher scores reflect a stronger exchange orientation. Reliability was adequate (α = .76).</p>
<p>Of all respondents, 59 percent were female (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>). Men reporting on brothers constituted 20.7 percent of the respondents; 20.6 percent of the respondents were men reporting on sisters; 29.7 percent referred to women reporting on brothers; and 20 percent to women reporting on sisters. Educational attainment of the respondent was measured with a variable ranging from 1 = <italic>incomplete elementary education</italic> to 10 = <italic>postgraduate</italic>. Average age of the respondent was 46.6 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>). We also included the absolute age difference in years and a dummy variable indicating the respondent was older than the sibling. Geographical distance between siblings living within the Netherlands ranged from 0 to 279 km. For the group for whom no distance could be calculated (521 siblings lived abroad and for 199 siblings the exact address was unknown), missing values were replaced by the mean value of 39 km to preserve the original distribution. In the analysis, a dummy variable was included indicating whether the distance was missing or not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423051">Table 1</xref>). In the regression analyses, the distance was divided by 100. Further, we included the size of the sibling group, the presence of at least one parent and the presence of a partner and of children in the life of both the respondent and the sibling. The majority of siblings reported on were full biological siblings sharing both parents. A total of 3.4 percent of respondents reported on a half- or adopted sibling, for which a dummy variable was included. There were no step-siblings or twins in the analytical sample. The low percentage of half- and step-siblings reflects that the level of complexity of Dutch kin networks, in terms of divorce and remarriage, is less pronounced than in the United Kingdom and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423051">Dykstra et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>In the following, first, bivariate results for the various life events are presented for all dependent variables. Second, depending on the type of dependent variable, different methods of analysis were chosen for the multivariate analysis. For contact frequency and giving and receiving support, the number of categories was large enough to allow ordinary least squares regression analysis (OLS). The binary dependent variables – balance and conflict – were analysed using logistic regression analysis. The categorical dependent variable of relationship quality was analysed using ordinal regression analysis. For the regressions, age and distance were centred on their means. We subtracted 1 from the number of siblings, so 0 reflects respondents with only one sibling.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423051">Table 2</xref> presents bivariate statistics on the negative life events and the relationship characteristics. Persons who reported no negative events had the highest average contact frequency (7.15), gave most support (6.03), received most support (5.88) and reported the highest relationship quality and lowest levels of conflict. Contact frequency was lowest in the event of financial problems; least support was given when divorce was experienced; respondents reporting addiction received least support, had the poorest relationship quality (with only 47.6 percent reporting a good or very good relationship) and the highest levels of conflict (17.7 percent). The sibling relationship was most likely perceived as balanced in the group that experienced divorce. Overall, the group reporting a physical illness was most similar to the group that reported no events, whereas respondents reporting addiction or financial problems had least involved and least positive sibling relationships. Results displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423051">Table 2</xref> suggest that having experienced negative life events does not go hand in hand with more active sibling relationships, judging from the lower levels of contact and support exchange. To the contrary, the relationship was found to be less involved and more strained, with higher levels of conflict.</p>

<p>We now turn to the multivariate analyses, displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423051">Table 3</xref>. The table shows that – contrary to our expectations – persons who experienced divorce, psychological problems, abuse or financial problems in the past had less rather than more contact with their siblings. There was more contact with siblings only in the group that had experienced a physical illness in the past compared to the rest. No significant differences in contact were found for the group that experienced addiction or problems with the law.</p>

<p>Whereas, as hypothesized, more support was received among the group that experienced a physical illness in the past, we did not find this result for other events: less support was received in the groups that reported a psychological problem, addiction or abuse. For the other negative life events no significant differences were found. Regarding support provision we found that persons who experienced divorce or addiction reported giving less to a sibling, whereas reporting the experience of a physical illness went together with giving more support.</p>
<p>As expected, relationship quality was perceived to be lower for people who experienced a negative life event, with physical illness being the only exception. Only the groups that reported divorce or abuse reported a more imbalanced relationship. For the other negative life events we found no significant differences. Conflict with a sibling, finally, was more likely among the groups that experienced a physical illness or psychological problems.</p>
<p>Overall, only the experience of a physical illness in the past went together with the expected pattern of a more active and supportive relationship and more conflict, although relationship quality was not lower nor was the relationship more likely to be imbalanced. For the other events, patterns point to a less active – in terms of contact (divorce, psychological problems, abuse, financial problems) – and less supportive relationships with siblings (psychological problems, addiction and abuse). Perhaps these less involved relationships explain the absence of more conflict compared to the groups that did not experience these events (all events except physical illness and psychological problems).</p>
<p>We did not find convincing support for our expectation that effects were stronger for addiction than for psychological problems. For both psychological problems and addiction we found lower levels of received support and lower relationship quality. The two groups differed with regard to the other dependent variables: levels of contact were significantly lower and levels of conflict higher when a psychological problem was experienced, whereas there were no significant differences for the group that reported an addiction. This group did, however, report lower levels of support given.</p>
<p>We also suggested that the groups that experienced divorce or a physical illness would have more active and less strained sibling relationships compared to mental illness, addiction and problems with the law. Although we did not strictly test differences between the different events, the coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423051">Table 3</xref> indicate that this is the case for physical illness but not for divorce. The betas and odds ratios suggest that whereas persons who experienced a physical illness in the past had more active and supportive relationships with their siblings, the experience of divorce is associated with less active, less supportive and more strained relationships with siblings, much to the same extent as is the case for psychological problems, addiction and problems with the law.</p>
<p>There was no previous research on which to base expectations regarding abuse or financial problems. Our results show that persons who have been the victim of abuse report sibling relationships that were less active and supportive, more likely to be imbalanced and of lower quality. The group that experienced financial problems only reported less contact with their siblings compared to those who had not experienced this event.</p>
<p>If the respondent reported the sibling had experienced any of the negative events, he or she was more likely to report more support was given to this sibling, that less was received and that relationship quality was lower and imbalance more likely. Additional analyses (not displayed) revealed that when both siblings had experienced negative events at some point in the past sibling relationships were less active and less supportive.</p>
<p>Extraversion was related to lower levels of contact with a sibling, less support given and received and more balance and less conflict. Personal competence was, remarkably, related to lower levels of sibling relationship quality. A stronger focus on reciprocity was positively related to the amount of support that was given and received, to relationship quality and to balance.</p>
<p>The findings for the demographic variables of the respondents and the siblings were mostly in line with other studies: women scored higher than men on all dependent variables (except balance) and more so with sisters than with brothers. A higher educational level was associated with higher levels of contact and support exchange. We found with increasing age that contact frequency, support exchange, relationship quality and likelihood of conflict were lower. A larger age difference decreased contact, support, relationship quality and conflict. More contact with and support given to a younger sibling was reported, together with higher levels of relationship quality. Partnered individuals showed lower levels of contact, support, relationship quality and balance in their sibling relationship. Respondents also reported less contact, more support given, more balance and less conflict when the sibling was partnered. The presence of children was also associated with lower levels of contact, support given and relationship quality. When the sibling had children, less support was given, there was more balance and less conflict. The presence of a parent was associated with less support exchange, lower relationship quality and less conflict with a sibling. Living farther away was associated with lower contact frequency, less support exchange and lower relationship quality, but had no effect on balance or conflict in the relationship. When the distance was missing (this group consisted of mostly siblings living abroad), the effects were similar but much stronger. Persons with more siblings had a less involved relationship to the randomly chosen sibling in terms of contact, support and relationship quality, but the relationships were also more balanced and less prone to conflict. Relationships with half- or adopted siblings were characterized by less conflict and less support, and were perceived as of lower quality.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>We studied the occurrence of a wide variety of negative life events in relation to positive and negative aspects of the adult sibling relationship, to establish to what extent sibling ties might be intensified following negative life events. Whereas the family has been described as a ‘haven in a heartless world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580911423051">Lasch, 1977</xref>), and people generally feel they can count on their siblings in times of need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423051">White and Riedmann, 1992a</xref>), our study suggests that people who have experienced serious adversity in their lives are not the ones with the most intense and positive sibling ties. On the contrary, people who have experienced adversity tend to have less involved sibling ties that are of lower quality and in which conflict is more common.</p>
<p>Although generally people feel a normative obligation to help out their family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423051">Rossi and Rossi, 1990</xref>), costs associated with exchange with a sibling seem high when major adversity is experienced in the past. This was also borne out in another study using the same data, and showing that individuals who experienced personal problems felt less accepted by the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423051">Komter et al., 2011</xref>). Only in the case of physical illness do people report higher levels of support received from a sibling after the event. For persons who experienced abuse, psychological problems or addiction, the amount of social support received from a sibling was low. Remarkably, only after divorce and abuse was the sibling relationship experienced as less balanced and only for physical illness and psychological problems were higher levels of conflict reported. This indicates that after most events siblings are able to maintain a sense of balance in their relationship, although this may be accomplished only by having less involved sibling ties in terms of contact and support.</p>
<p>Events we described as socially less acceptable and for whom one could be held accountable (addiction and problems with the law) had differing associations with the sibling relationship characteristics we studied, with addiction being related to more negative sibling relationships than problems with the law. Whereas both problems with the law and addiction were associated with lower relationship quality, addiction was also related to lower levels of support exchange, suggesting less involvement with siblings.</p>
<p>An interesting finding from this study is that persons who reported a physical illness in the past evaluated their sibling relationships more positively. Even though experiencing serious health problems is stressful and is accompanied by an increased need for support, siblings appear to be able to maintain their relationship in a positive way, without disturbing the balance. After the experience of a physical illness, it may be easier to find a satisfying form of exchange than when the health problem is of a mental nature. Reciprocity is important in sibling relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423051">Horwitz, 1994</xref>), which may be more difficult to accomplish when a sibling is less able to function socially, which is often the case with mental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423051">Bijl and Ravelli, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The negative associations between the occurrence of divorce and contact frequency, support exchange and relationship quality were remarkable as well. As divorce is more and more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423051">Amato, 2000</xref>), it is alarming that it is so strongly associated with negative sibling ties. Whereas qualitative research has shown that support from kin is important after divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423051">Gerstel, 1988</xref>), our results show that this support may not always be available.</p>
<p>This study was a first exploratory study into the link between negative life events and positive and negative sibling relationship characteristics. We were limited by a lack of detailed information on the context and history of these various events. As a result we could not go into much detail as to why there might be differences in sibling ties across the various events. Moreover, we did not have detailed information on the timing of the events. Although most events happened more than a year ago, there was no information on the sibling relationship before the event occurred. Whereas it might be that negative life events strain the relationship, leading to less support and contact, it might also be that persons at risk of experiencing negative life events are more likely to have less involved sibling ties from the outset. To give any definite answers regarding causality, longitudinal data are necessary. The lack of information on the timing of events also prohibited us from assessing whether negative life events occurred simultaneously in both siblings’ lives, perhaps leading to disengagement and dealing with one’s own negative life events, or whether the timing of events allows for the exchange of help.</p>
<p>The topic of this study itself is highly sensitive. Some caution is warranted regarding the report of the respondents on their own and their siblings’ experiences of these events. Yet, many events were reported, suggesting that – at least for some events – respondents were willing to disclose personal information. Nonetheless, respondents might still have underreported more serious events and results therefore might pertain to milder cases. Occurrence of siblings’ experiences of events might be underestimated, because the respondents might not have been aware of the situation of their siblings. Finally, the present research focused on a single family relationship. Our study did not assess whether other family members – especially those family members higher in the hierarchy of normative obligations – gave support instead of siblings. Including other family members, as well as the negative life events they encounter, would make it possible to gain more insight into the limits of family solidarity in the context of the larger family.</p>
<p>To conclude, this first exploration of the link between negative life events and the adult sibling relationship showed that some negative life events, such as illness, may be related to a more active sibling relationship in terms of contact and exchange, but that most negative life events are associated with less involved, less positive and more strained sibling relationships. Whether there is a causal relation between negative events and the nature of sibling relationships or not, inequality exists in access to supportive and intense sibling relationships, with persons who experienced negative life events being at a disadvantage. This brings some nuance to the often emphasized positive and harmonious aspects of family relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423051">Hammarström, 2005</xref>).</p>
