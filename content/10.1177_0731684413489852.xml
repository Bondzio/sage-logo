<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the modification of epoxy resin with a hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene liquid rubber copolymer. The Fourier transform infrared analysis evidenced the occurrence of a chemical reaction between the oxirane ring of epoxy resin and the hydroxyl functional group of hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene using benzyldimethylamine as a catalyst. The mechanical results indicated that the 10 phr hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene-modified epoxy resin exhibited the maximum impact strength of 16.5 J/m<sup>2</sup>, which is about 91.8% higher than that for the neat epoxy; the best mechanical performance in terms of tensile and flexural properties was achieved at 10 phr hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene content; higher concentration of hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene resulted in the cured networks lower impact and strength values. The investigation on the microstructure of hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene–modified epoxy resin showed a two-phase morphology where the hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene domains were uniformly dispersed in epoxy resin matrix. The addition of hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene into epoxy resin reduced the thermal stability, whereas, it obviously improved the volume, surface resistivity; and the dielectric breakdown strength of 20 phr hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene–modified epoxy resin was 36 kV/mm compared to 31.2 kV/mm of the neat epoxy resin.</p>

<p>Unlike CTBN, HTBN and ATBN copolymers, the hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) liquid rubber shows very weak polarity because of its own chemical structure. Indeed, HTPB possesses very high electrical insulating properties and low dielectric permittivity and loss, thus making it a very suitable material for high-voltage electrical insulation occasions. So, the addition of HTPB liquid rubber into Ep can improve the electrical insulating properties of cured network. The studies on the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of HTPB-modified Ep had been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413489852">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413489852">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413489852">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413489852">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413489852"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413489852">23</xref></sup> the results suggested that the addition of HTPB into Ep increased the toughness, volume resistivity, and reduced the dielectric permittivity and loss of cured networks.

<p>One of the obvious characteristics of hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene-butadiene (HTBS) copolymer liquid rubber is its immiscible nature with the Ep resin and hence it stays in a phase separated state from the major Ep matrix throughout the cure reaction due to its weak polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413489852">5</xref></sup> compared to the strong polar liquid rubber such as CTBN, HTBN and ATBN. Just like HTPB, HTBS also possesses high electrical insulation properties, low dielectric permittivity and loss, so, HTBS could improve the electrical insulation of Ep because its structure and polarity are very similar to the HTPB. Until now, very little reports on the modification of Ep with HTBS copolymer liquid rubber have been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to explore the morphology, the mechanical, thermal and the electrical behavior of an anhydride-cured HTBS-modified Ep. Analysis of the structure-property relationship of HTBS-Ep-anhydride cured system is a new endeavor to the best of our knowledge. Based on the investigations on the morphology, the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of HTBS-modified epoxies, the improvements in both the impact strength and the electrical insulating properties of HTBS-modified Ep were observed in this work, which are of great importance to some applications occasions, such as electronic packaging, substrate materials and other highly electrical insulating materials, etc.</p>

<p>To enhance the compatibility between the two components, the HTBS copolymer was pre-reacted with an excess of Ep resin in the presence of BDMA as a catalyst, thus leading to the rubber covalently bonded to the Ep matrix; then, the resulting epoxide-rubber adduct participates in the polymerization reaction with the anhydride hardener.</p>
<p>The synthesis of HTBS-modified Ep pre-polymer was performed by the reaction of Ep with various content of HTBS copolymer in the presence of 0.5 phr BDMA (in comparison to the 100 phr Ep) as a catalyst. The reagents were added into a three-necked reaction flask under nitrogen atmosphere. The flask was placed in an oil bath at about 140℃ and allowed to react under continuous stirring conditions for 1–3 h.</p>
<p>After the reaction was done, the resulting pre-polymer was cooled down to 80℃ and was mixed with the anhydride and the accelerator in a weight ratio of 100:85:1 in mass ratio. Then, the mixture was gently stirred for 10 min to ensure proper dispersion of the hardener and the accelerator, degassed for 10 min in order to get rid of bubbles trapped in the mixture and poured into appropriate stainless steel molds kept at 60℃. Finally, the cure was performed in an oven following the curing procedures: 110℃ for 1 h and 150℃ for 4 h.</p>

<p>Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) was performed on a spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Paragon1000) at a 2 cm<sup>−1</sup> resolution averaged over 20 scans.</p>
<p>Weight loss of the samples upon heating was measured using a thermogravimetric analyzer (model: SDTA851, Swiss). Measurements were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere, from 25℃ to 600℃, at a heating rate of 15℃/min. The observed weight loss was analyzed. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) was performed using a JEOL JSM-7000F SEM Japan). The fractured surfaces were prepared in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and were sputtered with gold in vacuum prior to observation.</p>
<p>The tensile tests were performed in a New SANS ZMGI 250 testing machine at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min according to ASTM D-638. The values were taken from an average of at least five specimens. Flexural tests were also conducted using a New SANS ZMGI 250 testing machine fitted with a three-point bending fixture at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min, according to ASTM D-790. The impact strength of the unnotched specimens was determined by using a SANS ZBC1251 Charpy tester according to ASTM D-256. All the mechanical tests were carried out at room temperature and the values were taken from an average of at least six specimens.</p>
<p>The volume and surface resistivity measurements were performed on an ultrahigh electric resistor (model: ZC-36, China) at room temperature. The dimension of the samples for tests is 80 mm in diameter, ∼1 mm in thickness. The dielectric breakdown strength of the samples was measured using a ball–rod electrode arrangement under a continuous alternating current (AC) voltage loading supplied by a 50 kV, 50 Hz transformer. The arrangement and sample were immerged in insulated oil to prevent surface discharges and flashovers. The test for each sample was performed at room temperature; the sample was placed directly between two copper-ball electrodes opposing each other. The lower electrode was connected to the earth, and an increasing AC voltage with a rate of 2 kV/s was applied to the upper electrode until the sample failed. When the test finished, the ultimate breakdown voltage was recorded. The dielectric breakdown strength of each sample was determined as the average of six tests. The specimens for dielectric breakdown strength were about 1 mm thick.</p>

<p>The terminal hydroxyl group of HTBS copolymer can react with the terminal oxirane group of Ep resin in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst at a temperature greater than 100℃, thus leading to a chemical linkage between the two components.

<p>The pure Ep resin shows the characteristic peaks at about 915 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to the oxirane group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413489852">1</xref></sup> The incorporation of HTBS to Ep caused chemical interaction between the oxirane ring of Ep and hydroxyl functional group of the HTBS and led to a decrease in the peaks at 915 cm<sup>−1</sup> for the 10 phr HTBS-modified Ep as compared to the pure Ep. Moreover, the absorption bands at about 1025 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which can be ascribed to the formed ether bond between the two components, was observed to increase, as expected, in the 10 phr HTBS-modified Ep compared to the neat Ep. Therefore, the result of FT-IR characterization evidenced the occurrence of a chemical reaction between Ep resin and HTBS, which effectively enhanced the compatibility between the two components and remarkably reduced the phase-segregation of the blend before gelling.</p>

A more remarkable decrease was observed in case of modified Ep with 30 and 40 phr HTBS, indicative of a plasticizing effect of the dissolved HTBS that acts as plasticizer with an increase of free volume which conducts to a decrease of Ep resin stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413489852">27</xref></sup> The flexural modulus gradually declined with increasing HTBS loading due to the lower modulus of HTBS, whereas, the flexural strain at break increased to a maximum value at 10 phr HTBS concentration, after that, it began to reduce.

The tensile modulus gradually declined as the HTBS content increased, whereas, the elongation at break continued to increase with HTBS concentration. The addition of HTBS decreased the modulus of the Ep network probably because the HTBS lowered the cross-linking density of cured networks.

<p>The relationship between the concentration of HTBS and impact strength of the modified Ep networks is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413489852">Figure 5</xref>. The impact strength values of the modified Ep samples were higher than that of the unmodified Ep and the values passed through a maximum as the content of HTBS increases. The modified Ep containing 10 phr content of HTBS exhibited the maximum impact strength of 16.5 J/m<sup>2</sup>, which is about 91.8% higher than that for the neat Ep. This is because the HTBS particles act as stress concentrators and induce plastic deformation of a highly brittle matrix to a far lesser extent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413489852">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413489852"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684413489852">29</xref></sup> The impact behavior of the modified Ep network can be explained based on the two-phase nature of the system adopting the following mechanisms such as rubber-bridging, plastic void growth and shear banding.

<p>The best balance mechanical performance was achieved with 10 phr of HTBS, above this optimum HTBS concentration, a fall in the strength and modulus was observed.

<p>The fractured surfaces of the modified epoxies consist of two distinct phases: a continuous Ep matrix and the dispersed HTBS phase. In the case of 10 phr and 20 phr of HTBS-modified Ep, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413489852">Figure 6(b)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413489852">c</xref>), the HTBS rubber particles were uniformly distributed throughout the Ep matrix with a narrow particle size distribution, which is very important for toughening, as it allows the yielding process to operate throughout the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684413489852">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684413489852">31</xref></sup> The fractured surfaces, unlike neat Ep, are very rough, indicative of a ductile manner of fracture. Furthermore, the fractured sections indicate the broken HTBS particles and a stress-whitened zone. Stress whitened is due to the scattering of the visible light from the layer of the scattering centers, which in this case are voids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413489852">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413489852">27</xref></sup> The generation of the voids is due to the cavitation of HTBS particles, which is the most of important energy dissipation mechanism in the case of rubber toughened Ep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413489852">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684413489852">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684413489852"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731684413489852">32</xref></sup> Therefore, the HTBS-Ep exhibited higher impact strength in comparison to the unmodified one.

In higher weight percentage of HTBS-modified samples, say 40 phr which is represented in by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413489852">Figure 6(d)</xref>, a heterogeneous particle size distribution was observed.

Furthermore, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413489852">Figure 7</xref>, we can see that the existence of HTBS hinders the gel and cure reaction of Ep.

The anhydride-cured HTBS-modified Ep network undergoes the degradation mainly as a two-stage process, whereas, the cured pure Ep sample only undergoes a main degradation process.

<p>The effect of HTBS rubber on the electrical insulation properties of modified epoxies are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413489852">Table 3</xref>. It can be observed that both surface resistivity (ρ<sub>s</sub>) and volume resistivity (ρ<sub>v</sub>) markedly increased with an increase in the HTBS concentration. In contrast, the volume resistivity values of the cured Ep containing 10, 20 and 30 phr HTBS rubber were 9.72 × 10<sup>16</sup>, 3.96 × 10<sup>17</sup> and 8.46 × 10<sup>17</sup>, respectively, comparing to 3.72 × 10<sup>16</sup> for the pure Ep. A similar trend to increase the surface resistivity was observed also for the modified networks. The increase in both surface and volume resistivity with addition of the HTBS is ascribed to the excellent volume resistivity and surface resistivity of HTBS rubber. However, as the HTBS content increased to 40 phr, both volume resistivity and surface resistivity descended obviously. The reason might be that at high rubber loading, the HTBS formed bigger particles and caused some defects and voids at the phase interfaces between two components (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413489852">Figure 6(e)</xref>), which lowered the electrical insulation of the bend.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731684413489852">35</xref></sup>

<p>For a dielectric application, the dielectric strength’s ability to withstand a high electric field should be considered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413489852">Figure 9</xref> presents dielectric strength’s dependence on the HTBS concentration. One can see that the dielectric strength increased as the HTBS loading increased. For example, the dielectric breakdown strength increased from 31.2 kV/mm to 36 kV/mm as the HTBS concentration increased from 0 to 20 phr. The reason for the enhancement in dielectric strength may be that the HTBS can inhibit and lessen the space charge accumulation at the phase interface and the formation of electric current inside the blend at applied high electric voltage owing to its non-polar molecular structure and high electrical insulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413489852">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731684413489852">35</xref></sup> As the HTBS loading further increased to 40 phr, the dielectric strength obviously reduced. For example, it decreased to 33.2 kV/mm and 27.3 kV/mm at a HTBS loading of 30 phr and 40 phr, respectively. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413489852">Figure 6(e)</xref>, it can be seen that at high HTBS content there existed some defects or voids at the phase interface, which led to the decrease in dielectric strength. In addition, we can observe larger size HTBS particles dispersed in Ep matrix at a high HTBS loading. Compared to the smaller size rubber particles, these larger size ones could not effectively prevent and lessen the generation and accumulation of spatial charges at the HTBS and Ep interface under the applied electric field, which may cause the dielectric strength decrease.

<p>Therefore, the results demonstrate that the HTBS-modified Ep has obvious higher surface and volume resistivity, and higher dielectric strength as compared to the neat Ep. Generally, the high electrical insulating and dielectric breakdown strength properties are very important for the modified Ep used as plastic packaging and electronic substrate materials because they greatly ensure the safe reliability and prolong the lifespan of electronic devices working under high frequency and high voltage electric field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413489852">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>In this work, Ep was modified with the HTBS copolymer liquid rubber using methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride as a hardener. The FT-IR results confirmed the occurrence of a chemical reaction between the terminal groups of Ep and HTBS in the presence of BDMA as a catalyst under N<sub>2</sub> protection, which enhances the compatibility between the two components. The impact strength and elongation at break of cured HTBS-modified Ep were obviously superior to those for the pure Ep. The incorporation of 10 phr HTBS into the Ep provided the modified networks with the best balance mechanical performance in terms of tensile and flexural properties. A further increase in the concentration of HTBS led to larger rubber particles that lowered the mechanical properties of the modified Ep. The study on the microstructure of modified Ep showed a two-phase morphology where the spherical HTBS rubber domains were uniformly dispersed in Ep matrix. The addition of HTBS to Ep reduced the thermal stability and markedly increased the volume, surface resistivity and dielectric breakdown strength of the modified Ep networks. However, at high HTBS concentration the electrical resistivities and dielectric breakdown strength decreased owing to the formed heterogeneous rubber particle size distribution and the defects at the phase interface between two components.</p>
