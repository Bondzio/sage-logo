<p>Scholars in organizational communication are spending an increased amount of time both working with and doing research on the nonprofit sector. Given their unique organizational structures and practices, nonprofit organizations require some “rethinking” of foundational organizational communication theories that have been developed based primarily on a more for-profit model of organizing (see Koschmann, 2011 [this issue]). Furthermore, working in international nonprofit settings requires even more consideration of the complexities of working across cultures. Our colleagues in intercultural communication are advancing the understanding of the delicate dance that emerges between identity and collaboration in the nonprofit setting. Guided by the belief that the strength of the nonprofit emerges from the intimacy of relationships in multifaceted networks of volunteers, staff, clients, and other stakeholders, scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911424374">Chen (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911424374">Carrillo Rowe (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911424374">Dym and Hutson (2005)</xref> are calling much attention to the interplay between praxis, agency, history, and power in the civil society context. When working in international collaborations, we maintain the position that <italic>we cannot ignore the complex ways in which our social identities intersect, conflict, form, and resist power relationships</italic>.</p>
<p>Our interest and passion regarding the topic of international collaborations within nonprofit organizations emerges from each of our own experiences with African-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Due to the impact that HIV/AIDS has had on impoverished areas of sub-Saharan Africa, thousands of NGOs have emerged dedicated to assisting and improving the lives of those most greatly affected by this global epidemic. They provide medical programs focused on treatment, education programs focused on prevention, and community support (such as building homes, schools, or churches). Relying heavily on international donors, volunteers, and the capacity building alliances that they foster, these nonprofits become stronger, more sustainable, and better able to serve their communities. This essay focuses on our separate (but similar) experiences working as organizational capacity builders with two different nonprofits in Uganda and Kenya.</p>
<p>For Maria, the Ugandan Alliance (UA [name has been changed]) is one of the greatest successes and failures of her 6-year teaching career. Started by a member of her first nonprofit communication class in 2004, UA raised more than US $5 million, built two orphanages for 160 AIDs orphans, provided water for three villages, and created economic development opportunities for more than 80 widows in Northern and Southern Uganda before its founder turned 25 years old. The board of this international NGO with offices in the United States and Uganda grew concerned the young executive director lacked the maturity and intercultural awareness to continue to cultivate strong and trusting relationships with the Ugandan staff, the widows, and the local tribal leaders. In 2009, Maria joined the board as its first African American member <italic>and</italic> donor, with the hopes that she could be its “cultural translator.”</p>
<p>In 2005, Lexa began working with several university colleagues and began an ongoing capacity-building partnership with one of the largest religious institutions in Kenya. The focus of the relationship is to build this organization’s capacity to design, implement, and evaluate school- and family-based curriculum on HIV/AIDS education. The partnership is funded through the President’s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR grants are based on a model of capacity building and volunteerism. Volunteers from institutions in “north” (or resource-rich) countries are partnered (or “twinned”) with institutions in “south” (or resource-poor) countries to help build the organizational capacity for the southern countries, eventually to manage and run their own programs. Currently, the school-based program reaches more than 400,000 pupils between the ages of 10 and 14 and the family-based program has reached more than 1,500 families. It has been written up by the funding agent as the most successful PEPFAR partnership in Kenya.</p>
<p>Both of our experiences invite a number of conceptual lenses for reflection on organizational practice, theory, and communication within nonprofit organizations. In an increasingly global forum, it is no longer unusual to see multicultural and multinational work teams and organizational partnerships in nonprofit organizations like the ones we describe. Yet, in the end, we continually found ourselves back at questions of <italic>power, discourse</italic>, and <italic>identity</italic>. Despite working in neighboring countries with NGOs with similar organizational emphasis, the discourses of our organizing shaped us in unique ways. We share two narratives and analysis as exemplars of these experiences and call for more scholarship in international nonprofit work to address dialectical tensions surrounding social identity and power.</p>

<title>Maria’s Story</title>
<p>I could not believe my ears. Ellie explained that to her UA was not so much about helping the orphans and widows of the villages but it was a place in which young people like her could come and find themselves as they lived and worked in Uganda. “This is not the mission the board agreed to and this is not what we are raising money for,” I replied. “I know but as the founder the mission is whatever I say it is,” Ellie said shifting in her chair. “Ellie, based on that statement, I should go back and change your grade in our nonprofit organizational course. I can’t believe you just said that!” I felt dizzy—was it the fact that I had shifted from Board chair to Professor in a matter of two sentences or was it that I was so angry I was going to have a stroke? “Ellie, there is no way in hell donors are going to give money so that a bunch of wealthy White students can come over to Uganda and plant some gardens, buy some cloth, say some prayers, and take pictures with the poor natives. That’s not why I signed on and that’s not why the United Methodist Church signed on. Our first goal is to fulfill the mission that seeks to create sustainable opportunities for these women not only to survive but to thrive—I hope one day, they are running UA and we are sitting on a board filled with the very women we helped. Ellie laughed. “Running UA? Everybody knows you can’t trust them with the money or the organization.” Feeling the tears burning in my eyes, I looked beyond Ellie to the Nile and replied, “I am THEM. If you can’t trust them with the organization, maybe you can’t trust me as the Chairman of the Board.” Without missing a beat she replied, “I don’t.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911424374">Allen (2011)</xref> draws on theories of social identity and social construction to explore how issues of power and identity are integral to understandings of diversity in organizations. In a more global context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911424374">Broadfoot and Munshi (2007)</xref> state, “The complex intersections between multiple subjectivities of issues of race, gender, class, ethnicity, and language remain underhighlighted in much of organizational communication scholarship and, yet, these are central to becoming sensitive to a postcolonial vision of our disciplinary future” (p. 261). The impact of the intersections of identity, power, and conflict is particularly noteworthy in the example above. Ellie’s “charity model” vision of the relationship of UA to the people it seeks to serve is not uncommon in international nonprofits. The power relationship is dependency based and grounded in those with resources “helping” those without. As Maria challenged this vision with the more postcolonial, capacity-based and self-sustainable model, Ellie responded defensively to maintain dependency by defining the Ugandan people as “the other”; “you can’t trust <italic>them</italic>.” Rather than shift Ellie’s negative perception of “the other,” Maria’s racial and cultural identification as “one of them” collapsed Maria into this category and reinforced an inequitable racial and cultural power relationship.</p>

<title>Lexa’s Story</title>
<p>A week before a scheduled exchange, the agenda is sent from the Kenyan South partners. The communication module has been expanded to three hours and the HIV modules have been eliminated. This is curious as one of the U.S. North partners is an internationally recognized scholar in HIV prevention. He was replaced with a local person with far fewer credentials. Once in country, they learn that “someone complained” when the U.S. North partners were facilitating a conversation about HIV/AIDS in a rural community group. Members of the group were “offended” because the U.S. partners were “promoting teachings against the church” when they taught about the three types of sexual acts that can lead to HIV/AIDS. They wrote “anal,” “oral,” and “vaginal” on the chalk board in the community classroom. Including “anal” as a form of sex was “promoting homosexuality,” something that goes directly against the values of the church and is illegal in Kenya. I look from side to side; two of the members of the U.S. partners are gay men. They remain silent.</p>
<p>In this example, we see the dance between identity, power, and collaboration as the “north” partners invoked a historical pattern affording them the power to speak, given their expert and technical “knowledge.” They learned, however, the consequences of privileging the distribution of public health information without considering the cultural, religious, and social context of the audience. The “south” partners reclaimed a position of power through the systematic silencing of the “north” partners’ technical, public health knowledge. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911424374">Foucault (1972)</xref>, discourse is controlled by objects (what can be spoken of), ritual (where and how one may speak), and the privileged (who may speak; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911424374">Murphy, Eisenberg, Wears, &amp; Perry, 2008</xref>). Two of the U.S. members also suppressed a part of their deepest identity as they chose to remain silent about their sexuality to continue the collaboration. Although such silencing may appear on the surface to be nonsensical and even contrary to the interests of the participants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911424374">Foucault (1988)</xref> argues that within non-task-related pleasurable relationships such as organizational friendships and alliances, we will, to facilitate the success of such relationships, suppress the expression of the deepest desires of our interiority even when those expressions or desires are not in our own best interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911424374">Dixon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Noting the importance of the nonprofit context to the overall organizing of society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911424374">Chen (2010)</xref> argues that while understandable that much of the early scholarship focused on management and leadership, it has led to a tendency to engage in a <italic>description</italic> rather than an <italic>interrogation</italic> of the intercultural partnerships that are central in contemporary nonprofits. As the world continues to become flatter through the use of collaborative relationships across racial, national, and ethnic boundaries, the success of global partnerships depends on the partners’ ability to manage their competing identity needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911424374">Kauser, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911424374">Kauser (2007)</xref> notes that unresolved cultural and identity differences results in a 70% greater chance that an intercultural alliance will dissolve. However, what also becomes clear in reviewing the laudable work of our colleagues in intercultural studies and international management studies is that we cannot limit our interrogations to just the relational aspects of a partnership. In a critique of the overreliance on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911424374">Gudykunst’s (1985)</xref> foundational work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911424374">Chen (2010)</xref> posits that quantitatively examining questions of identity, culture, and structure makes the erroneous assumption that relational participants are equally aware (and self-reflexive) of issues of identity and that such awareness progresses linearly. Consequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911424374">Chen (2010)</xref>, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911424374">Carrillo Rowe (2008)</xref> before her, calls for intercultural scholars to turn their focus to the intersectionality of structure, institution, relationship, and identity by adopting a more critical epistemology.</p>
<p>Critical approaches in organizational communication studies have done much to unveil the political character of organizations, relationships, and identity—but much of that work has been done in a for-profit arena (see also Dempsey, 2011 [this issue]). To understand international work and nonprofit organizations today, we must look at what is going on inside the organization and within the larger culture in which an organization operates: the economy, the current business culture, changing lifestyles and expectations, consumption, and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318911424374">Stohl, 2005</xref>). However, as our own experiences in international nonprofit collaborations remind us, we must also fully interrogate the ways in which partners negotiate their social and cultural identities and how they form, sustain, and resist power relationships. The stories we have shared are different as they are shaped by our own positionalities; yet they converge in remarkable ways when we consider our common political, social, and cultural struggles with our sense of who we are and how we “fit” (or not) into the social communities and cultural relationships within which we are working.</p>
