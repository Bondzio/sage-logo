<abstract>
<p>One of the clearest examples of a technological system, in the sense that Ellul discussed it, is contemporary biomedical health care. The foundation of technological systems is technique: efficient methods for achieving isolated goals. However, the goal of health care should be to achieve health in the full sense of wholeness. Traditional healing systems addressed heath in this sense, but biomedicine cannot; attempting to use the techniques of traditional systems without the accompanying culture ruptures those systems. Using the contemporary epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases as an example, this article attempts to exposes the limitations of a technical approach, as well as the limitations of the methodology of risk analysis.</p>

<title>The Problem of Health Care as Technique</title>
<p>A decade ago, Rustom Roy, cofounding editor with Jacques Ellul of this <italic>Bulletin</italic>, wrote that health care was “the world’s most pervasive technology problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0270467612459925">Roy, 2002a</xref>). That was in an introduction to a special issue of the <italic>Bulletin</italic> on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and whole person healing. Roy then went on to describe, in both that Introduction and in his own contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459925">Roy, 2002b</xref>), what the problem with Western health care was. His critique was reasoned, clear, and mostly not controversial. His “solution” to that problem was to look at the scientific evidence underlying various alternative healing systems.</p>
<p>His brief review is interesting and, if not compelling, at least worthy of serious consideration. He cites scientific studies that show various aspects of ancient healing systems, such as Qigong and Ayurveda, to be effective. To many of us, that would not be surprising. Healing is an ancient endeavor and involves much more than simple return to anatomic or physiologic “normality.” The Western approach, as Roy points out, focuses mostly on the body; the mind is involved peripherally, and the spirit usually not at all. Healing systems that address all aspects would naturally have a better chance at healing.</p>
<p>But is it really possible to transport these entire systems from other cultures into the modern scientific West? Can they really be “the only solution to the world’s most pervasive technology problem”? Part of the wisdom of these traditional systems is that they are rooted in their own culture and beliefs. They are complete natural systems and work because they are part of the larger natural system of their culture, and because the people who employ these systems unconsciously share that worldview and beliefs. When we bring isolated pieces of these healing systems to the West, they become absorbed under the aegis of biomedicine as “CAM.” But the worldview of biomedicine, not the worldview of their origin, holds sway. They become subject to the sort of scientific proofs that Roy details. Biomedicine, by accepting them, co-opts them and makes them part of itself, an artificial healing system.</p>
<p>To elucidate the importance of this difference between artificial and natural healing systems, let us review some of Jacques Ellul’s fundamental assertions about technique and apply them to contemporary medicine. First, Ellul made clear a difference between technique (“the totality of methods . . . having absolute efficiency”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0270467612459925">Ellul, 1964</xref>, p. xxv) and technology (the study or discourse of technique). His three major studies have the word “technology” in the English titles, but the first two are really about technique (<italic>La Technique ou L’enjeu du Siecle</italic> in 1954 and <italic>La Systeme Technicien</italic> in 1977), and only the third (<italic>Le Bluff Technologique</italic> in 1988) is specifically about technology. In this last one he explains the difference. There is no <italic>technica</italic>l bluff, he says; techniques deliver what they promise. However, there is a “gigantic technological bluff in which discourse on techniques envelops us, making us believe anything and, far worse, changing our whole attitude towards techniques” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612459925">Ellul, 1990</xref>, pp. xv-xvi).</p>
<p>The second major assertion—not just about technique but recurring throughout his writings—is the difference between means and ends. He made this clear in <italic>The Presence of the Kingdom</italic>: “everything has become ‘means’; there is no longer an ‘end.’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0270467612459925">Ellul, 1967</xref>, p. 63) All techniques are means; the technological bluff is the proclamation that techniques are all that matter anymore.</p>
<p>Now let us use these insights to examine modern biomedical health care. Modern biomedicine is an artificial system—a system we created—a massive complex system composed entirely of means, of techniques. This is the essence of its problem. Ellul listed many other characteristics of artificial technical systems—autonomy, self-augmentation, universality, totalization, the lack of feedback—and all of these apply exactly to biomedical health care. But the ends-means point is sufficient to start us off making some observations. And to avoid too much abstraction, let us choose an example.</p>
<p>There is a group of noncommunicable chronic diseases—especially cancer, diabetes, heart disease/stroke, and chronic lung diseases—which are now quite common worldwide and used to be called “diseases of civilization,” though diseases of industrialization or technology is more accurate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0270467612459925">1</xref></sup> They are the “leading cause of death and disability in both the developed and developing world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0270467612459925">World Medical Association, 2011</xref>) and account for 87% of the disease burden in high-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0270467612459925">Lopez, Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, &amp; Murray, 2006</xref>) such as the United States. That they have become the leading causes of death on almost all continents might be seen as an indicator of how widely industrialization—or more specifically the technological society—has spread.</p>
<p>Now the “risk factors” for these most common chronic conditions are well known and often interrelated: tobacco use, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol, and physical inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0270467612459925">NCD Alliance, 2011</xref>). Note that this is the way these diseases are discussed: not as consequences of technology or industrialization but occurring more often in certain groups of people, those subject to the “risk factors” listed. This biomedical formula for discussing diseases—locating them in the context of risk factors—is a very effective way to highlight the immediate causes and indicate interventions. It is equally effective in masking the more proximal reasons for these risk factors. Inactivity and eating processed foods may be behaviors that lead to several of these diseases, and they are modifiable. But why do so many people eat processed foods? Why is so much processed food manufactured? Why are so many people inactive? Why do so many people use tobacco and alcohol? It is in asking these deeper questions that we begin to see the link between “risk factors” and the larger technological system that Ellul described so well.</p>
<p>Our technological system does things for us, things that throughout the rest of history we have had to do for ourselves. It prepares our food and propels us, both using complex machines that apparently get the job done better—<italic>or at least more efficiently</italic>—than when we cook and walk. But something is lost when we do not prepare our own food and use our own energy to go places. Furthermore, a system devoted to machine and task efficiency such as ours creates a great deal of stress for the people who live in that system; that stress is also unhealthy, whether on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0270467612459925">Stivers, 2004</xref>) or leading to the other two “risk factors”: increased use of tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>So we approach this “chronic disease” epidemic—even though it is caused ultimately by the technological system—with products of that same technological system: drugs and surgical procedures. And they do work to ameliorate the diseases. In addition, we make clear the need for people, each individual person, to take responsibility for changing how they eat and move. But we “preach” this in a society designed for automatic movement and processed food. We chip away at our epidemics, piece by piece, but peace—<italic>shalom</italic>—eludes us.</p>
<p><italic>Shalom</italic>, besides meaning peace, also means completeness and soundness and includes “health”—a word related to both “whole” and “holy.” This in fact is the “end” we are missing when we focus only on means. We cannot attain partial health (partial wholeness?); disease elimination is not enough. And unfortunately, neither ancient healing traditions nor more recent “complementary and alternative” medical techniques do any better in addressing the technological causes of these diseases.</p>
<p>They cannot. The problem is not simply that technique is the foundation of health care; the problem is that technique is the foundation of our entire technological society. An artificial technical healing system is inimical to a natural healing system. People who live in a technological system—now present in most of the world—must live by the rules of technique, which eventually overshadow the rules of indigenous systems. Furthermore, biomedical techniques are so much more powerful, or at least more dramatic, than natural techniques; they very effectively break bruised reeds and quench dimly burning wicks.</p>
<p>Let us recapitulate:</p>

<list-item><p>Recognizing current scientific evidence for the successes of ancient healing systems, as Roy did a decade ago, highlights some of the deficiencies of Western biomedicine. <italic>These traditional approaches were natural systems at work.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The contemporary chronic diseases epidemic demonstrates a fundamental problem with biomedicine. The technological society is the root cause, which we ignore. We consider the “risk factors” to be the cause, and put the responsibility to avoid them on the patient, a form of victim-blaming. But when that patient does experience symptoms, we employ the methods and products of the same technological society to manage the symptoms. <italic>This is an artificial system at work—the technological system that Ellul described.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Focusing on health (as a health care system must) will never produce health, because ill health does not arise from lack of health care, but rather (in the case of the modern chronic diseases epidemic) from the technological society.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Yet since medical techniques are very effective in ameliorating symptoms and even halting some diseases, we maintain the illusion that we are dealing with the epidemic.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thus health care, as a subsystem of the larger technological system, shares all of its characteristics. It is not only a microcosm of the larger system; it also provides a window into how that larger system deceives us by its very successes. Technique is the means by which modern empire maintains its power.</p></list-item>

<title>Coda: The Problem of Risk as Technique</title>
<p>Come back for a moment to <italic>shalom. Shalom</italic> could be our “end” for which medical techniques would be our “means.” However, <italic>shalom</italic> is not our end. In fact, we do not have an overall end. Instead, we have many small “ends,” ends derived directly from the means we have available to accomplish them: We have painkillers, so we reduce pain; we have antibiotics, so we eliminate some infections; we have drugs to lower blood pressure and blood sugar, so we lower them; we can perform surgery, so we remove tumors.</p>
<p>In this world of multitudinous means—or options, as they might be called today—but without an overarching end, we face a great deal of uncertainty<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0270467612459925">2</xref></sup>: Which means do we use? How well do they work? For which goals? While there is a natural tendency to use all available means, we would still welcome guiding principles to help us make sense of them all. But the uncertainty is profound. We do not know fully why, or even how, some diseases happen, and we certainly do not know which individuals will get them. These uncertainties bother us, because we <italic>want</italic> to know how diseases happen, how to stop them—and even more, who will get them so we can intervene early and prevent them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are flooded with techniques, with means. And since many are quite effective, we end up acting as if our overall end was to predict and eliminate all disease and death. But the gap between that unstated end and what commonsense tells us illustrates, and deepens, our uncertainty. We want to do what is impossible: eliminate death; we want to know what is unknowable: the future. Our techniques, our means, have led us to the brink of a chasm we cannot cross.</p>
<p>But we do not try to cross that chasm, at least not directly. Our profound uncertainty does not paralyze us. We confront the uncertainty head-on: we measure it. Measuring this uncertainty then becomes another technique, another means, a very attractive one. In fact it begins to have a unifying effect on all our means. We use this technique to help us develop and evaluate all our other biomedical techniques: this is called biostatistics, the principle tool of risk analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0270467612459925">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Come back to the group of noncommunicable diseases to illustrate this. With some of these diseases we have a very clear understanding of causes: essentially everyone who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day for 30 years will get some emphysema; everyone who drinks a bottle of whiskey a day for 30 years will get liver damage. Alcohol and tobacco in these situations are not <italic>risks</italic>, they are hazards. But what about a half a pack of cigarettes a day from age 15 to 21? What about three glasses of wine every night for only the last 10 years? We have entered uncertainty.</p>
<p>Likewise with heart disease and many cancers: as shown above, we know the “risk factors” people are exposed to, but we cannot predict with certainty which person will get which disease when, nor which exposed people will <italic>not</italic> get any of the diseases. So we move into the realm of probability: we determine relative and absolute <italic>risk</italic> for getting the diseases, we speak of <italic>confidence intervals</italic>, we calculate <italic>likelihood</italic> ratios and <italic>odds</italic> ratios, and then we perform cost-benefit analyses of the diagnostic processes.</p>
<p>Then we do the same with the treatments we develop. None of the treatments actually eliminate these diseases, but each has some small effect—on <italic>some</italic> of the affected people. So we are back to probability: we speak of the effectiveness of the treatments with likelihood and odds ratios, with calculations of the <italic>Number Needed to Treat</italic> (NTT): the number of patients we need to treat in order to prevent a single disease outcome in a population. These numbers can be quite high, sometimes more than 100—which means that 99 of the 100 people we treat do not benefit, yet we cannot predict the one that will.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0270467612459925">4</xref></sup> And then, again, we do cost-benefit analyses, unabashedly assigning a monetary value to human life.</p>
<p>Now these statistical tools, and this whole concept of risk, have been particularly useful for these noncommunicable chronic diseases: trying to pin down exactly where they come from, what causes them, how to treat them, and how to prevent them. These diseases are more complicated than, for example, a simple pneumonia caused by a bacteria we can eliminate, or a ruptured appendix we can remove surgically. We are now confronting diseases that often do not kill immediately, but also do not go away despite our treatments; diseases that gradually destroy vital organs. Yet our treatments keep these people alive. We have created a whole new category of patients: people alive, but dependent on the medical system to stay alive.</p>
<p>We confront a different conundrum on travelling upstream to try to uncover where these diseases came from. We had become used to “the germ theory of disease,” an approach to disease causation that looked for a single agent—germ, gene, toxin, injury, and so on—that caused a disease. But these single agents were very elusive in the 20th century’s group of chronic diseases. Industrialization (the technological society) may have been the ultimate cause, but it did not kill immediately, like the Black Plague, and there was no single agent or toxin responsible. We had to conclude that many of these diseases had causes that were “multifactorial”—so we began looking for these multiple factors.</p>
<p>Initially, scientists still treated these many factors as part of a single “mass phenomenon, the result of a shift in ‘ways of life’”—that is, the exponential growth of industrialization and the technological society. Consequently “individual responsibility or blame was almost entirely absent from their discussion of risk factors during the 1950s and 1960s” (p. 725, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0270467612459925">Oppenheimer, 2006</xref>). To the epidemiologists then, it was obvious that some of these diseases grew out of that “mass phenomenon” and not from irresponsible individual choices.</p>
<p>However, as we fine-tuned our search, we began to forget about—or was it ignore?—this “mass phenomenon.” By around 1980 we had entered a fundamentally new era. Socialism was dying, unfettered capitalism reigned—and our views toward the public’s health began to follow suit. There was now a “New Public Health,” which, among other things, focused on these chronic diseases and their prevention. In previous epochs, public health addressed community health problems such as sanitation and vector control with collective action. But now even public health was becoming individualized, seduced by the drive to identify and eliminate individual risk factors. Despite the “mass phenomenon” behind the chronic conditions, which made up 87% of our disease burden, our health had become our own responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0270467612459925">Peterson &amp; Lupton, 1996</xref>). Risk had become our pilot; life had become a crapshoot.</p>
<p>We still have not pinned down exactly how these diseases come about, and we still cannot cure most of them. We still live with profound uncertainty. It becomes very clear why we have chosen risk and statistical analyses as our orienting science. There is no technical bluff here. Biostatistics do exactly what they claim—measure probability—and they do it well. Bit by bit (or byte by byte) they help us make incremental changes uncovering the details of how these diseases develop, and how we can live a little bit longer with them.</p>
<p>But is this <italic>shalom</italic>?</p>
