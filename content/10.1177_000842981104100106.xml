<p>This volume offers eleven papers originally presented at the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies’ Travel and Religion in Antiquity sessions which began in 2005. The chapters in this book pause at the intersection of travel and religion, and consider the ways in which the realities and discourses of travel and mobility are interwoven in activities relating to the gods. As with any such collection, the challenge is in presenting the “seminar” with a unified theme rather than simply an assortment of essays devoid of mutual engagement; thus the importance of Philip A. Harland’s introductory chapter “Passing at the Intersection of Religion and Travel”, which successfully places each of the papers into a broader disciplinary context. Harland identifies five noteworthy areas where travel and religion transect, while simultaneously detailing appropriate background material to chart the scholarly landscape. It is these five areas that form the backbone and organizational structure of the remaining entries.</p>
<p>The first four chapters fall within the section “Honouring the Gods.” Steven Muir in “Religion on the Road in Ancient Greece and Rome” assembles evidence relating to “religion on the road,” specifically rituals and episodes undertaken in ancient Greece and Rome to assuage the insecurities of travel. He effectively demonstrates that the gods were encountered or sought whilst traveling not only to provide protection against the practical hazards of travel but also as patron-witnesses from “back-home” who served as identity affirmation. The article by the late Susan Haber entitled “Going Up to Jerusalem: Pilgrimage, Purity, the Historical Jesus” through careful exploration of material and textual evidence, establishes a direct correlation between pilgrimage to festivals for first-century Galileans and Judeans and purity observance. Situating the historical Jesus within this milieu, she outlines purificatory rituals likely undertaken by Jesus prior to entering the Temple. In “Pilgrimage, Place, and Meaning Making by Jews in Greco-Roman Egypt,” Wayne O. McCready concentrates on interdisciplinary studies of space in an exploration of the interrelationship between pilgrims and spatial features. Focusing on Elephantine, he suggests that pilgrims would not only be in a physical place, but would also be “of place” through the intertwining of people, place, and movement. Karljurgen G. Feuerherm’s contribution, “Have Horn, Will Travel: The Journeys of Mesopotamian Deities,” takes a different starting point: travel of the gods forms the crux of analysis, specifically in relation to the first millennium New Year’s celebration in Babylon. In the Mesopotamian worldview, deities were believed to travel in the physical realm, and the <italic>akītu</italic> celebration was a sequence of several divine journeys as well as one human journey embodied in the king.</p>
<p>The following triad of chapters fall within the motivating mobility factor “Promoting a Deity or Way of Life.” Ian W. Scott in “The Divine Wanderer: Travel and Divinization in Late Antiquity” effectively disassembles the scholarly category of the itinerant “divine man” through consideration of four divinized persons as represented in literary sources. Although Scott finds that there is no common paradigm of itinerant activity present, he does elucidate that travel and geography functioned as attestation of superior character and religious authority. In “Journeys in Pursuit of Divine Wisdom: Thessalos and Other Seekers,” Philip A. Harland narrows in on the interplay between travel and the acquisition of divine wisdom as presented in literature with biographical interests, using Thessalos’ letter as an entry point into the discussion. There were common expectations regarding the pursuit of wisdom from divine sources, a shared denominator of which is wandering from one potential solution to the next. Ryan S. Schellenberg’s article, “‘Danger in the wilderness, danger at sea’: Paul and the Perils of Travel” gives voice to the apostle Paul’s own presentation of his travel hardships, descriptions which call into question Luke’s heroic portrait of Paul’s missionary travels. Paul’s activities need to be read in light of the precariousness of his apostolic position and the contingency of his travel, rather than subsuming all of Paul’s travel under the rubric of sustained and conscious “mission.”</p>
<p>James B. Rives’ chapter, “Roman Translation: Tacitus and Ethnographic Interpretation”, encompasses the third motive for traveling, “Encountering Foreign Cultures.” Challenging the opinion that Roman identification of deities from different cultures with their own gods constituted strict cultural imperialism, Rives reflects on the ways Greek and Roman travelers encountered and interpreted foreign deities. He convincingly posits that translation from one culture to another was fluid, multiform, and rarely ever straightforward.</p>
<p>The fourth section of the book encompasses issues of migration, and here Jack N. Lightstone’s article, “Migration and the Emergence of Greco-Roman Diaspora Judaism,” explores relationships between travel and migration on the one hand, and the emergence and persistence of Greco-Roman diaspora Judaism on the other. Examining rabbinic, non-rabbinic, and inscriptional evidence, Lightstone documents how trade, travel, communication, and pilgrimage all played roles in the emergence of a shared model constituting Greco-Roman diaspora Judaism.</p>
<p>The final two chapters fall under the rubric “Making a Living.” Michele Murray’s contribution, “Religion and the Nomadic Lifestyle: The Nabateans,” delves into the semi-nomadic lifestyle of the Nabateans, establishing ways in which their travels were reflected in religious behavior. Not only was there exchange of traditions and styles with the foreign cultures encountered, but itinerancy was also reflected in specific Nabatean customs. Lincoln H. Blumell’s chapter, “Christians on the Move in Late Antique Oxyrhynchus,” contests the dominant picture of Christian travel in late antiquity as revolving predominantly around religious issues. Studying Christian letters from Oxyrhynchus, the image that emerges is of Christian travel for secular purposes, be it for work, social, or legal reasons, thereby contextualizing Christian mobility in late antiquity.</p>
<p>Each contribution offers unique insight into the interplay of mobility and religious expression, covering both wide geographical and temporal scopes. This collection offers a wealth of information for continued conversations pertaining to religion and travel. The chapters presented here are an initial foray into the world of ancient travel, and this volume sets the bar high for future studies.</p>
