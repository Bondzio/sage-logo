<p>Perspective of a Young Exile</p>
<p>We’re packing up everything and going home, or that’s what my Grandfather calls it. Going home to Jerusalem, a city I’ve only ever heard stories about, when Granddad, and Dad, and my uncles sit round the fire in the evenings and talk about Jerusalem and their dreams of going back to our people’s own land. Only, for me, this is home. I was born here in Babylon, and so were my brother and sisters, and my parents, and three of our grandparents. So, how come all of a sudden Jerusalem is ‘home’ and Babylon is not?</p>
<p>It’s not as though Dad even wants to go there, but he’s the youngest of his brothers, and all the older ones are determined, so he says we have to go along with them. Dad says it’s all the fault of that barmy scribe, Ezra, and his friends the poets – they call themselves The School of Isaiah – filling people’s heads with dreams of a land of plenty, telling us God will take special care of us if we trust him. Ezra says we’re called to be a special people, set apart for our God and destined to live a holy life in a holy land. He and the poets are always at the Sabbath gatherings by the river, when we meet to worship, and to study the traditions of our people. They say this is going to be just like when Moses led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, a whole new Exodus and a fresh start in our own place. It’s very exciting, but it is a bit scary too. Dad’s not so keen. He says he’s not a slave, he’s a civil servant, and he doesn’t want to be free if that means not having a steady income or being unable to pay his bills on time, thank you very much. The poets say our God is greater than anything, even mighty empires and their armies. They remind that God brings princes to nothing and makes rulers as nothing too. Mum says: tell that to Cyrus the Persian, who booted Nabonidus out of power here a few years ago.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why Dad thinks we have to go, just because his Dad and brothers and their families are going. I shan’t let my brother tell me what to do when I’m a man myself. Once I’ve had the new ceremony we call Bar Mitzvah, I’ll be a Son of the commandment too, and then I shall decide for myself what I want to do in life. I’d like to be a civil servant, like my Dad, working in the palace and meeting important people from all different places when they come to pay tribute to the emperor. The new emperor, I mean, Cyrus. Dad was lucky to keep his job after Nabonidus went – apparently it’s because we Hebrews are good at reading and writing, generally much better educated than many of the local Babylonians. Uncle Joshua keeps telling me I’m clever enough that I could train to become a scribe, like Ezra, but I’m not sure I want to spend my life studying law (or being called ‘barmy Barney’ behind my back!). The law does get very complicated at times. I’ve heard Ezra answering people’s questions and prompting our local elders when they get stuck – sometimes I even wonder if they might be making it up as they go, so as not to get caught out by difficult questions, but Dad told me to shush when I asked him about that.</p>
<p>I suppose it will be a great adventure. A whole caravan of us, several hundred people, with all our animals and everything else we own, all setting off towards the Promised Land. It will take us almost two months to get there, walking all the way and trying to keep close to rivers so we don’t have to carry water with us. Our teacher made us work out how long the journey would be – almost a thousand miles, going north west along the Euphrates first, and then south through Lebanon and down beside the River Jordan – at a top speed of three miles an hour, walking not more than seven hours a day to allow for time setting up and striking camp every time we stop. No wonder my brother-in-law’s refused to come!</p>
<p>My sister is pregnant, you see. The baby’s due in three months’ time, and I think it would be brilliant if my very own niece or nephew were to be the first child of the new generation to be born in our homeland. But her husband says it’s not safe, and he doesn’t believe the poets when they talk about God taking special care of infants and nursing mothers; he says it’s all poetry and not to be taken literally. Mum cried when they told her my sister wouldn’t be coming too. She’s afraid she may never see her grandchildren, that my sister’s husband will never bring the family to Jerusalem, and I think she could be right. Moshe has a market gardening business, benefiting from the water technology in the palace’s hanging gardens, so he’s not keen on Ezra’s ideas about going back. But Granddad’s told him about how rich and fertile the land of Judah is, how the River Jordan keeps it green and fruitful – it would be a great place for Moshe to grow and sell vegetables! Maybe he and my sister will come later, once we’ve settled down and can write to tell them about how wonderful the place is? I hope so. I’d be sad not to know my little nephew or niece.</p>
<p>A thousand miles is a long way though. How many pairs of sandals will the journey wear out? I’ll be taller by the time we get there too, almost a young man, but I bet I’ll get tired sometimes on the way, especially when it gets hot. The poets will read to us in the evenings, I’m sure, reciting beautiful poems about God’s power to refresh us and give us the energy and strength we’ll need to keep going. It’s not going to be easy, this restoration to Jerusalem and Judah. When we get there, we’ll have to work out who settles where, and clear the land and plant it, and talk to whoever’s living there now, because they might not want us coming home. They might think Judah is their home now, not ours – I wonder if Ezra and his friends have thought about that at all?</p>
<p>We’ll have to be patient and wait to see how God works things out for us. My Dad’s good at negotiating when there’s a disagreement, he’s learned how to deal with people who see things differently through his job, always trying to find a peaceful way to settle an argument. I think his skills are going to be important when we get there, but he’ll have to make a living from the land instead of in the civil service, because no one will be able to pay him for keeping records. He’d rather be a tax collector for the emperor, but Ezra wasn’t keen on that idea and says other people wouldn’t like it either, so farming it will have to be. Dad says I’m not to worry about my future though. Just because we’ll be a long way from Babylon, there’s no reason why I can’t still train to be a civil servant like him. I’m not sure I want to be a tax collector though, if it means my friends won’t like me any more. Maybe I should do as Uncle Joshua says, and become a scribe instead, if they’re going to be more popular in our new place.</p>
<p>It’s not easy, or simple, this liberation thing. It’s full of questions and challenges and difficult decisions. I’m glad God knows where we’re going, that he sees us and keeps us. I hope he can see me and my future too, because at the moment it doesn’t look very clear or straightforward to me, and that does make it scary.</p>

<p>Mark 1: 40-45</p>
<p>Making a Choice</p>
<p>“Oh! There he is. I have heard that Jesus healed many people, I also have heard that he is a man of compassion and a man of power. I believe, I know deep within me that he can. Shall I go and beg? No! Demand! After all I did not deserve this! Or, maybe I will say something completely different….” And so, he approaches Jesus and says, “Lord whatever you choose for my life, so be it”, trusting in Jesus that he will choose the best for him.</p>
<p>This thought came from the leper in our gospel story this morning. It is one of the most interesting passages of scripture because of what it has to offer for us today. The text says, “A leper came to him begging him, and kneeling, he said to him, “If you choose, you can make me clean.” Notice what he said. He said to the Lord, “Lord! If only you choose, you can do this for me.” He did not demand, and although his other communication says that he is pleading because he is on his knees while saying these words, he makes a statement that is alarming. He says, “If you choose, you can make me clean.” Normally, it is possible to ignore someone who is begging, or someone who is demanding, or someone who is annoying, but it’s just not possible to ignore someone who says, “If you choose, you can make the difference in my life.” That surely would make us stop and think. It is fact that Jesus has the ability to make the leper clean, now it is all about making a choice.</p>
<p>The leper is taking a chance with Jesus. Jesus could walk away as the scribes and Pharisees did, or cast stones at him, or taunt him like many people were accustomed to doing, but he knows that Jesus is different.</p>
<p>I met my friend last week and she shared with me her dilemma about whether or not to help her friend who came to her seeking for help. She has a childhood friend who is suffering from a strange disease that the doctors are unable to diagnose. It seems she is losing all her teeth at the age of 35, and has several other abnormal symptoms. This lady has called my friend to seek for help asking her to lend some money or give some support for her treatment. My friend told me that she is in a dilemma, not because she cannot help, not because she has no heart to help, not because the situation is not genuine but because she is not ready to take a risk. Second thoughts in her are warning about risk. She is worrying and thinking, if I gave her a big sum of money what if she cannot repay! A lot of times choices may be risky for us but helpful to others, they may be threatening to us but generous to others, they may be upsetting for us but fulfilling for others. A famous quotation goes, “Our philosophy is not best expressed in our words but in our choices.”</p>
<p>Let us see what Jesus chooses to do for the leper in the text. The text says that Jesus was moved with pity, stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, “I do choose. Be made clean.” What a powerful statement! What a relief to the leper! The leper finally met a person who chooses the best for his life. It says in the text that immediately leprosy left him and he was made clean. Jesus didn’t forsake the man, when he was able, Jesus didn’t turn his back when he was needed, and Jesus didn’t ignore him when he was approached but was moved with pity and reached out to touch this man.</p>
<p>When we hear some sad story, or see someone suffering, no doubt, we too move with pity, feel sympathetic like Jesus did. But do we go as far as Jesus went to make that risky choice, which will put us in an altogether different status? Jesus was not afraid of what would people think if he touched a leper, he was not worried if he would be made unclean because of Jewish customs, nor was he horrified by being around the diseased, but he was moved with pity, stretched out his hand and touched a leper.</p>
<p>How many times are we so status conscious that we avoid giving a hug to someone in despair? How many times are we too conscious of our cleanliness that we refuse to touch someone in need? How many of us are so power conscious that we avert embracing our subordinates even when their hard work paid off and benefited us? Here is Jesus, a Rabbi; a clean Jew who has no second thoughts about touching someone who is unclean, a leper. Jesus could have simply said to the leper “be made clean” and it would have been so according to the other miracle stories in the Bible. But he touched the leper as a sign of acceptance, a sign of approval, a sign of comfort. May be it made a great difference in the life of the leper to be touched by Jesus. All along a leper only experienced people giving him disgusting looks, or people ignoring him because they did not want to have anything to do with this unclean, cursed being. Here is Jesus, putting balm on all that hurt he carried with his gentle touch, that made him clean, not just from leprosy but from the sadness and emptiness that he carried for years within him. How many of us are ready to stretch out our hand and do what is needed. A lot of times we extend our help to the people not really understanding their actual need. We do it because we need satisfaction. It takes much sensitivity to understand the need of a person beyond just the physical need.</p>
<p>Jesus’ touch affirms his sensitivity to the leper to think beyond his physical need. Let us think, how much are we caught up in our professions, in our routines that we can’t think in simple terms, understand the simple needs of people around us, and respond with simple logic. An on-call doctor’s wife, after being alone with her children days and nights, shared with her husband how difficult it is for her, and how depressed she gets these days and how she has no time for anything but parenting. Immediately, the husband’s response is to prescribe what drug would help if she gets depressed. As you can see, he has totally missed the point. He is a doctor, an intellectual, but someone who has no sensitivity to understand what actually is her need, and what he may do to help meet her need. We tend to give to others what we are accustomed to rather than what they really need. Jesus in this story chooses according to the immediate need of the leper. He does not waste time on what else could be the best solution. He is not afraid of risking his reputation by touching the leper if that is what would make the difference in his life. Are we ready to make such a choice?</p>
<p>Sometimes when people come for help we try to give them advice. We do not understand that a person in need must have looked into all possibilities, and came to us trusting that their need will be met here. If only we are in a position to meet the need of a person, is it possible to reach out and stretch out our hands as Jesus did? In a world where there are so many challenges and financial crises, are we abstaining from stretching our hands and instead closing our fists? Jesus challenges us to make a choice that is helpful. He gives us a model of stretching out with the gifts that we have rather than closing our fists. God bless these words! Amen.</p>

<p>Mark 9:2-9</p>
<p>High Moments</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that the Transfiguration story was originally about a post-resurrection experience, an appearance of the Risen Christ to the three disciples, Peter, James and John. But Mark places it in the life of Jesus, and weaves a strong thread through his gospel to hold it there securely. His weaving begins with the story of Jesus’s baptism, a high moment with its vision of a heavenly dove and God’s voice proclaiming Jesus “my Son, the Beloved” (1:10b-11).</p>
<p>Mark’s thread catches up Peter’s Confession of Jesus as Messiah (8:29), and Jesus’s disclosure that being Messiah means suffering. Then this scene: Jesus in dazzling white robes, the prophets Moses and Elijah nearby, and again the call of God “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” (9:7b). Mark weaves on through Jesus’s appearance before Caiaphas, the priests and elders. More voices, though not divine. “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” they demanded and Jesus replied, “I am” (14:61-62). On the thread runs to the crucifixion where Mark knots it off with the pagan Roman centurion staring at the dying Jesus just feet above him on the cross. Awed. Saying, ‘Truly this man was God’s son!’ (15:39). Scene after scene, image after image, of power and glory but also of betrayal and suffering–the lot of the Messiah, the Christ.</p>
<p>No matter when it happened, for Mark, the Transfiguration is God’s revelation of Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah of Jewish tradition. Mark wove the story into his account of Jesus’s life to convince his community that Jesus was the Messiah despite their understanding that the Messiah would come in glory, not die in disgrace. After Jesus’s ignominious death early Christians were anxious that sufferings for their new faith were justified. They wanted assurance that Jesus was The Real Thing, not just another prophet like Moses and Elijah.</p>
<p>For Peter, James and John the Transfiguration experience was a high moment though they didn’t recognise that. Mark shows us them afraid and confused. They hadn’t understood Jesus’s teaching of discipleship as suffering servanthood. Peter had enthusiastically acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah but tried to silence talk of suffering and death; Peter rebuked Jesus and was rebuked in turn (8:32-33). Mark later describes James and John, not discussing how as disciples they would serve the people, but wrangling over who would be the greatest in the expected glorious Messiah’s kingdom (10:35-37). And, finally, Mark tells us, all three fell asleep in the garden at Gethsemane, oblivious to the agony of their friend and teacher while he awaited arrest and execution (14:3-41). And yet these are the three who witnessed the extraordinary high moment of Jesus’s Transfiguration, who heard a voice telling them, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”</p>
<p>High moments and lost opportunities for insight. They are there in all our lives. It is, I think, a rare soul who does not miss these moments, who can look into the face of God in a glimpse of time and be transfigured. There’s an old story of such a soul, a venerable old monk near the end of his days. Death hovered by his bed waiting to gather up the last breath. A young novice sat with the dying man, watching the peace of him. Would he have the strength and courage to live such a life? Or would such commitment be too much for him, bringing him bitterness not grace, denying him peace? Leaning close, he whispered, “Father, what is the secret of your peace?” The old man heard the anxiety of youth and a smile drifted across his dim old eyes. “I met God once,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for another meeting ever since.”</p>
<p>This wise old man had lived his life out of the grace of what some poetic soul called “the shining of remembered days.” Peter, God love him, was not such a rare insightful soul. A high moment of glimpsing the face of God did not transfigure him. He was undone by fear, not transformed by awe. And so he burbled on about how jolly it all was. “Let’s make ourselves comfortable, with tents for you three and so on.” Poor silly Peter. He might have been organising a picnic! “He did not know what to say,” Mark says apologetically, “for they were terrified” (9:6).</p>
<p>Peter was trying to make the shining moment permanent! But when we do that we are not transfigured. We are transfixed. The Transfiguration story reminds me of a favourite childhood game with my much-loved kaleidoscope. I spent hours gazing into it, captivated by the patterns the coloured glass made. With enormous care I would try to recapture patterns. Gently and minutely I’d turn the kaleidoscope back to catch the beauty I had just seen. My child’s mind thought that with time and patience I could recreate a pattern I had particularly loved. Of course I never did but I kept trying.</p>
<p>There are two ways we can react to the high moments. We can live in them. Or we can live out of them. When we live in them we are like Peter and the child-that-was-me experimenting with my kaleidoscope. We hold the image, transfixed by its beauty, trying to control it to make the high moment permanent. That was what Peter’s talk of tents was all about. And it destroyed the moment’s potential and the hope within the vision. On the other hand, when we live out of the high moments we are not enslaved. We can move on to the next moment because of the hope that shone from the first. Then we are like the old monk living out of “the shining of the remembered day” when he had encountered God. Or, like the child-that-was-me when I forgot the game and simply enjoyed each new pattern my kaleidoscope formed.</p>
<p>When we get stuck in the memory of the high moments it isn’t that we are not stirred by God. Often we are and want to shout of it. We speak of wanting to crystallise moments in time but in fact we bury them in blind cement where the flashing lights of crystal do not shine. Then we are frozen like ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. There is a huge danger of this frozenness for Christians. The whole story of who we are is grounded in “the shining of remembered days”–the days of Jesus. Whenever we say “this is our tradition”, or “this is what we believe”, or “this is who we are”, or “this is the way it’s always been done” we are in danger. In danger of locking ourselves into ideas or patterns descended from the shining high moments of remembered days but which might now be outmoded or irrelevant. We stunt ourselves spiritually if fights to retain favoured rituals or practices mean we miss the potential of the future, or fail to hear in the Transfiguration story God’s call to life: This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”</p>
<p>Part of the problem is fear, as it was for Peter. Part is trying to avoid suffering. As it was for the young novice monk. But we can escape neither fear nor suffering. My kaleidoscope has a darkened side these days. I see through a glass darkly, as Paul would say (1 Cor 13:12, AV), although the shapes and colours of the glass are still visible through the shadow. So it is with the cross and its shadow across the world. Mark’s Transfiguration story doesn’t allow us to forget that the glory of the Easter Christ and the suffering of the Good Friday Jesus are inseparable.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to see the face of God in the glory stories of the Risen Christ. Easy to be transfixed. Much tougher to be transfigured by facing the cross’s reminder of how we so often encounter God’s face in the world. As the crucified suffering one in the faces of the lost, despised, homeless and helpless ones. Peter, James and John didn’t want to see that; neither do we. But that’s the task: to gaze on the suffering face of God, the man Jesus, who died on a dark Friday 2000 odd years ago that we might live out of the hope of the high moments. May God’s call “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” come to us from the shining of both a remembered dark day of death and a remembered Easter day of glory. And, like the old monk and the Roman centurion, may we be transfigured.</p>

<p>Mark 1:9-15</p>
<p>What does the wilderness look like?</p>
<p>I remember visiting the desert of Central Australia after rain. Against the background of bright orange sand, flowers bloomed – Sturt desert peas dressed in striking red and black, purple heath, yellow and orange lines of flowers. There were animal tracks zigzagging through the sand. At night we camped in swags under the stars and watched satellites circle the earth.</p>
<p>At Christmas in the Snowy Mountains wilderness I walked with thousands of others in pilgrimage to the top of Mount Kosciuszko. I walked on a raised platform to protect the environment. There were lots of flowers here too, and the beginnings of mountain streams. Eagles soared overhead.</p>
<p>What does the wilderness look like to you?</p>
<p>I visited someone recovering from a stroke, who then had a bad fall. This person was fearful, dependent, determined. Each step to recovery was tiny and painful.</p>
<p>My boyfriend was killed in a car accident when I was 19. The world was bleak shades of grey. I sat by the lake weeping my private tears while trying to study at Uni. I visited a friend in Sydney seeking support – but she hadn’t heard of his death so I ended up comforting her. The blackness and the tears dragged on. Grief was unresolved for 20 years though life continued and grief was only revisited occasionally.</p>
<p>A relationship ends after a bitter wrangle. There is guilt and recrimination, anger and sadness all mixed together, and ongoing custody battles. There is ageing, loss of fertility, loss of memory, aching joints, stiffness, becoming invisible as younger, beautiful people take the stand. Major surgery – a hysterectomy for me. For some there is mental illness, depression, dropping out, voices, mania… and isolation.</p>
<p>What does your wilderness look like?</p>
<p>I take a day out and drive to Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, alone. I walk the lyrebird track. The air is crisp. I eat my packed lunch at a table. I write in my journal, then I walk the sanctuary path, watching water birds play. I sit in the botanic gardens, water dragons looked at me hopefully from my feet. Rosellas squawk… I rest.</p>
<p>The wilderness journey : exotic adventures, time out- or just plain hard work?</p>
<p>We hear in Mark 1 of Jesus’ baptism, where Jesus is named ‘God’s beloved son’. Then he is immediately thrust into the wilderness and tested. After the highlight of baptism down he goes. What does this wilderness look like for Jesus? Spirit, wild beasts, the Tempter, and angels it seems!</p>
<p>We tend to think our deserts are bad places, but could it be the Spirit leads us there to know ourselves better?</p>
<p>Could it be that our deserts are the very places from where we draw our spiritual power like water from a well, where our faith is strengthened and assurance given-that we can, as Jesus did, deliberately choose the good in the face of temptation and conflict? (Joyce Rupp, <italic>God’s Enduring Presence</italic>, John Garrett Publishing, Melbourne, 2008)</p>
<p>The reference to 40 days takes us back to Deuteronomy, one of the primary narratives of Israel’s wilderness traditions. Deuteronomy recalls the time when the Israelites were poised to enter the Land of Promise, and speaks of what it means to be God’s covenant people. Underpinning these traditions is that the 40 years in the wilderness resulted from people’s lack of trust in God. Jesus’ wilderness time, by contrast, is a journey of trust.</p>
<p>When Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness he did not travel alone. He took his relationship to this divine Spirit, the go-between. Not that this made it easy, mind you, but it was to that relationship he clung. In that desert, that wilderness, he also encountered other strange companions: ‘Satan’, real or imagined?; internal or external?; ‘Satan’, real enough to him – a presence, a force, a desire to be reckoned with; wild beasts, real or imagined? internal or external? Powerful yet. And he meets angels who minister to him. Were they real or imagined? Internal or external? Whatever the case, he was not alone.</p>
<p>Joyce Rupp reflects:</p>
<p><italic>This is a spiritual truth. Good and necessary are wise companions to guide us toward prayer: good, too, are the many strange companions that mature our faith through testing. These strange companions prove and improve us. Struggle hardens spiritual muscles. This was true for Jesus in the wilderness beyond the Jordan. And, this is true for us today.</italic></p>
<p><italic>We are conditioned for the work of God through struggle</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Good and wise companions assist us in our journey. Their words comfort and heal and bind up our wounds when life inflicts real hurt. But the “Devils” of the desert – the situations and people who challenge – these strange companions can test whether or not we know the ultimate truth about our life. Only in the shadows of the wilderness, with the wind howling and wolves nipping near, will it become clear:</italic></p>

<p>Esther De Waal (<italic>Lost in Wonder, Rediscovering the Spiritual Art of Attentiveness</italic>, John Garrett Publishing, Melbourne, 2003) tells of Fr Christian, a French Trappist Monk, who features in the movie ‘Of Gods and Men’. She writes:</p>
<p><italic>On the day before Christmas Eve 1979, Fr Christian, the French Trappist abbot, was 1,000 miles south of his monastery Tibhirine, in what is known as the Sinai of Algiers. It was an isolated plateau of windswept cliffs and rocks where once Charles de Foucauld had built a small stone hut in which to spend time in solitude. In this barren mountain of granite rocks he wrote these words:</italic></p>

<p><italic>Nuits de la foie en agonie…</italic></p>
<p><italic>Le doute est la, et la folie</italic></p>
<p><italic>d’aimer tout seul un Dieu absent et captivant</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>… Ce que j’espere, je ne le vois…</italic></p>
<p><italic>C’est mon tourment, tourne vers lui</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Toute souffrance y prend son sens</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>cache en Dieu comme une naissance</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>ma JOIE deja, mais c’est la NUIT</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is paraphrased in her notes as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are nights when I experience faith as anguish;</p>
<p>There is doubt, madness too,</p>
<p>in this solitary love of a God</p>
<p>who is at the same time</p>
<p>absent and absorbing.</p>
<p>… I hope; but what I hope for is out of sight…</p>
<p>That tortures me as I face him.</p>
<p>All the torment has direction and meaning there</p>
<p>where it is hidden in God, as though coming to birth;</p>
<p>JOY yes, but wrapped in NIGHT.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Esther De Waal continues: <italic>The monastery’s journal recorded that he returned smiling, unshaven, emaciated. Fr Christian was now sure of his monastic vocation, counting on the transforming power of prayer to have ‘the courage and the patience to place hope in the accomplishment of small things, each and every day’.</italic></p>
<p>Where does Jesus’ wilderness lead him?</p>
<p>In Mark’s telling, from the wilderness Jesus moves straight into public ministry proclaiming, ‘The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.’ He proclaims, and he calls people to follow Him! He ministers as ‘the Beloved One’ called by God, and One who has lived through wilderness, faced his Demons, and survived. He is clear and focussed on his calling.</p>
<p>Where do you place yourself?</p>
<p>Are you in the wilderness or beyond?</p>
<p>Wherever you are, Lent is an opportunity for reassessment.</p>

<title>Misunderstood Participants in the Jewish Revolt</title>
<p>Mark Andrew Brighton, The Sicarii in Josephus’s Judean War: Rhetorical Analysis and Historical Observations (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2009. £18.99. pp. 184. ISBN: 978-1-58983-406-4). This volume, a revision of Mark Brighton’s Ph.D. dissertation (University of California-Irvine), seeks to ‘provide a holistic study of the Sicarii in The Judean War’ by examining the passages where Josephus either explicitly mentions them or infers their presence and activity in the narrative (p. xiii). Specifically, Brighton’s goals for this study are to determine what rhetorical role the Sicarii play in Josephus’s narrative and to uncover historical details about the Sicarii that may lie behind Josephus’ rhetoric. Brighton accomplishes his objectives in five well-organised and carefully written chapters. Chapter one reviews the limited scholarship on the Sicarii and it is here that the justification for Brighton’s work emerges. As the author notes, no comprehensive study of the Sicarii in War has been attempted previously. Further, Brighton states that his study establishes Josephus’s depiction of the Sicarii in War which, in turn, allows him to shed light on the historical Sicarii by getting behind Josephus’s rhetoric. Chapter two addresses debated issues concerning the various contexts for the writing of War. Brighton concludes that War stands in the Greco-Roman historical tradition focused on stasis and tychē (similar to the work of Thucydides). Brighton adds that War was completed in its entirety by 81 ce and written for both Roman and Jewish readers. Chapters three and four are Brighton’s exegesis of the relevant passages in War with chapter three focusing on War 1-6 and chapter four focusing on War 7. Brighton’s approach to each passage is to explain why it is included in the study (since not every passage explicitly mentions the Sicarii), provide the literary context of the passage, highlight the activity/activities of the Sicarii in the passage, study important words associated with the Sicarii (e.g. stasis, lēstēs, etc.) and situate each passage in the structure of the book as a whole. Chapter five offers both the literary and historical conclusions of the study. At a literary level, Brighton deduces that Josephus utilises the Sicarii as both a positive and negative rhetorical tool that elaborates upon the themes stated in the proem of War and throughout the work (e.g. the crimes of the Sicarii were directed against their own people, the power of the Romans is limited, the Sicarii died in a way that both Jews and Romans would have viewed as noble, etc.). From a historical perspective Brighton’s one firm conclusion is that the Sicarii were not a subgroup of Zealots. Beyond this Brighton claims that there is little historical data to gather from War since Josephus used the epithet ‘Sicarii’ primarily as a broad term describing banditry in general. This book is an important step forward for deepening our understanding of Josephus’s War and the role the Sicarii play in that work. Brighton’s chief contribution is his attention to how the Sicarii serve Josephus’s literary aims in War. Additionally, this work provides a model for studying the roles characters or groups play in Josephus’s works. One lament, through no fault of Brighton, is that if the author’s conclusions are correct then War adds little to our historical understanding of the Sicarii.</p>
