<p>Bleeding disorders associated with trauma are of paramount importance when dealing with the acutely injured individual. Statistically, up to 40% of trauma-related deaths are assumed to be related to massive hemorrhage, and there have been varying positions on the way to handle this entity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253212446994">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212446994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212446994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212446994"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212446994">5</xref></sup> Ironically, it is not always the injury but the physiologic sequelae of that injury that lead to trauma-associated deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212446994">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212446994">7</xref></sup> Over time, newer theories have been developed to help the clinician begin to understand the etiology and treatment of this process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212446994">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253212446994">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212446994">9</xref></sup> The purpose of this article is to review current literature and explain how these new concepts helped change practice in an urban, academic level 1 trauma center.</p>
<p>The field of coagulopathy associated with trauma has exploded over recent years, and our knowledge and insights toward this entity continue to evolve. The theory of coagulation due to a cascade of plasma proteins has been broadened to include a cell-based theory of coagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212446994">10</xref></sup> The complex cascades associated with clotting are themselves stressed during the physiologic imbalance that presents during a trauma. In fact, only now are we beginning to understand the complexity of coagulopathy that presents in patients after acute trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212446994">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212446994">11</xref></sup> Much of this recent understanding about trauma-related coagulopathy has stemmed from knowledge gained in the military theater, and these theories are now being used in civilian anesthesia. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of the military experience for development of treatment algorithms. Yet while civilian injuries can be severe, they rarely compare to the magnitude that is seen from battle. Hence, the protocols for military use may need to be tempered for use in the civilian arena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212446994">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212446994">13</xref></sup> It is a very exciting time in trauma management as new concepts in coagulopathy are developed and new modes to assess the global hemostasis related to the coagulopathy are surfacing together.</p>
<p>The military experience in the United States, as well as the experience in Israel, have fostered the ideas for common massive transfusion protocols (MTPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253212446994">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212446994">15</xref></sup> The advent of the MTP has helped streamline care for the most emergent trauma patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212446994">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253212446994">17</xref></sup> MTPs vary from institution to institution and require dedication from numerous departments. Our experience in developing a MTP required the input and support from the Emergency Department (ED), Pathology, central laboratory, blood bank, Trauma Surgeons, Trauma Anesthesiologists, and Intensivists, not to mention support from the hospital administration.</p>
<p>Our hospital administration has adopted a protocol to streamline work, minimize waste, and improve flow in all areas. This philosophy has become prevalent in many health care systems around the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212446994">18</xref></sup> The principle is based off of the streamlining of work with value to the customer as main priority. While new to health care the idea of this lean thinking came originally from the automaker Toyota.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212446994">19</xref></sup> Questions have been raised about the ability of manufacturing ideals to translate into medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253212446994">20</xref></sup> Our institution has seen benefits from the adoption of these policies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212446994">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Working in a hospital that has adopted a lean paradigm demanded that the advent of an MTP would decrease, not increase, wasted resources or talent while still maintaining state-of-the-art care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212446994">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212446994">21</xref></sup> Our protocol was developed after reviewing the current data and our hospital’s usage. This review fostered the natural progression toward intense analysis of the literature regarding coagulopathy of trauma and the nuances of massive transfusion and its outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253212446994">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253212446994">23</xref></sup> With the aid of thrombelastography (TEG) our institution began to adopt an idea of goal-directed transfusion and resuscitation with great success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212446994">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253212446994">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Coagulopathy</title>
<p>Hemostasis is a complex interaction of 3 major components: vessel wall, plasma proteins, and platelets. The initial injury to the vessel wall causes exposure of the subendothelial matrix, which, along with an activated endothelium, causes platelet aggregation and a prothrombotic state. In normal physiology the procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic pathways all work in balance to maintain hemostasis. Under surgical stress or traumatic stress this balance is lost, leading to either thrombosis or hemorrhage. In massive trauma the endothelial injury may be vast, which greatly impairs the hemostatic balance pushing from a prothrombotic to an anticoagulant pathway. In fact, factors associated with traumatic injury—dilution, hypothermia, factor consumption, acidemia, and hypoperfusion—have been aggregated together when evaluating a endogenous etiology for coagulopathy in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212446994">13</xref></sup> The activation of protein C associated with injury can be associated with a fibrinolytic state, making these patients very difficult to manage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212446994">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many terms have been generated to explain the coagulopathy associated with trauma. These include <italic>acute traumatic coagulopathy, early coagulopathy of trauma, trauma-induced coagulopathy</italic>, and <italic>acute coagulopathy of trauma-shock</italic> (ACoTS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212446994">2</xref></sup> Most authors make sure to explain the difference between trauma-related coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation. More recent work has helped develop a difference between acute coagulopathy of trauma (ACT) and trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212446994">7</xref></sup> Where TIC represents a combination of the endogenous factors of the ACT and added exogenous factors originally linked to the “bloody vicious cycle.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212446994">4</xref></sup> What is important is that no one definition presently stands alone, and at this point no formal consensus of the etiology of these coagulapathies has been agreed on in the published forum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212446994">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253212446994">8</xref></sup> While the ACT seems to stem from trauma to the endothelium, hypoperfusion and associated hemodilution, hypothermia, acidemia, and inflammation, its progression to TIC is insidious as many factors overlap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212446994">2</xref></sup> These later factors are often iatrogenic. What is important is that the ACT may start early after injury and this understanding has helped revolutionize the thinking.</p>
<p>Originally the “bloody vicious cycle” published by Cosgriff et al included a cycle of hemorrhage, resuscitation, hemodilution, coagulopathy, and continued bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212446994">4</xref></sup> This was found in numerous other studies to contribute to the “triad of death”: acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. These original terms and studies helped change the way that the coagulopathy we encounter during trauma is addressed. As previously stated, studies within the past few years have boomed in this arena, including many out of Denver Health Medical Center. As trauma anesthesiologists, we are able to generate a care plan for those critical patients and tie the most current data into the paradigm of our specialty.</p>

<title>Viscoelastic Coagulation Tests</title>
<p>Our trauma care algorithm allows laboratory value triggers the anesthesiologist can use to determine the need for specific products in all patients. In trauma patients, vigorously following these endpoints can help correct the patient’s coagulopathy. In massive transfusion we have found that experience with TEG allows the anesthesiologist to quickly obtain results which will guide therapy.</p>
<p>Viscoelastic coagulation tests, including TEG, have been used to assess coagulopathy for decades after it was introduced by H. Hartert in 1948.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253212446994">26</xref></sup> They have been used in liver transplant and cardiac surgery for quite some time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212446994">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253212446994">28</xref></sup> Recent technological improvements have generated renewed interest in these tests for assessment of global coagulation. The rapid relay of “real-time” information has allowed these tests to begin to find a niche in the trauma room.</p>
<p>Thrombelastography consists of a small sample of blood being placed in a rotating cuvette. A pin is suspended in the middle of the cuvette. As the cuvette rotates, fibrin strands begin to develop between the pin and the wall of the cuvette. This initial fibrin formation is depicted graphically and that tracing continues through fibrin formation, clot formation, and eventual fibrinolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253212446994">Figure 1</xref>). TEG depicts the global development and breakdown of clot and also takes into account the contribution of platelets while standard coagulation tests provide only static information of specific portions of coagulation, not a global assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212446994">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253212446994">29</xref></sup> Work at our institution is continuing regarding the role activated platelets in the trauma patient is ongoing.</p>

<p>In a standard TEG tracing like that provided by our laboratory, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253212446994">Figure 1</xref>, the R value reflects clotting factor activation via initial thrombin generation. The K value is a time interval from R until a predetermined level of clot firmness is reached. The Alpha Angle is generated by a tangential line from horizontal <italic>x</italic>-axis to the point when cross-linking occurs as the tracing begins to flatten out. The larger the Angle the larger the clot formation as the angle reflects the amount of fibrinogen being converted to fibrin. The maximum amplitude (MA) simulates the platelet contribution to the final point of coagulation. This represents platelet function and is not always representative of platelet count. The G value is a calculated value that represents overall clot strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253212446994">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1089253212446994"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253212446994">31</xref></sup> G is derived from the end result of the platelet–fibrin interaction via the GPIIa-IIIb receptors. G = (5000A/100 − A), where A is the amplitude of the curve and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253212446994">Figure 2</xref>. Clinically, our Anesthesiology department has noted that even though one of the other components of the tracing may be out of range the trauma patient may actually be continuing to make clot as noted by an acceptable G value. If the patient is beginning to correct their acidosis and improve hemodynamically, then further transfusion may not need to be as aggressive as the patient may self-correct these values soon.</p>

<p>The tracing above shows a ‘signature thrombelastogram’: prolonged ACT, decreased alpha angle, decreased MA. Together these correlate to a reduction in clot strength depicted as a decreased G value</p>

<p>Rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) is a recent advance that has become recently available in the United States. Addition of tissue factor allows for the clot to form more quickly than conventional TEG. Hence an r-TEG activated clotting time (TEG-ACT) is followed more closely than the r value, which allows us to receive initial information on the coagulation status within 30 to 45 seconds from initiation of the test. Overall, the time for the total test to run is about 20 minutes. A recent study compared delivery of results from 3 coagulation tests in patients with multiple injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253212446994">32</xref></sup> This study noted that the total time to run the r-TEG was 19.2 ±3.1 minutes, whereas the time to run a standard TEG and conventional coagulations tests (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio) were 29.9 ± 4.3 minutes and 34.1 ± 14.5 minutes, respectively. The authors concluded that the speed and reliability of the r-TEG should warrant its use in the trauma arena. Other studies have certainly shown the utility of another viscoelastic coagulation test, the rotational thrombelastography (ROTEM). It also assesses the kinetics and strength of clot formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253212446994">33</xref></sup> Another group did show that the use of the ROTEM viscoelastic test was able to help limit the use of products used and hence drive down costs of cardiac surgical patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253212446994">28</xref></sup> Many ongoing studies are continuing to evaluate this theory regarding these tests.</p>
<p>Initial information from an r-TEG will provide information to the Anesthesiologist within 45 seconds from the lab. While the time line to completion may be 20 to 25 minutes, the information is being relayed visually on a wireless network allowing action to be taken before any standard coagulation assays would be completed. In fact, Davenport and Khan, in a recent publication, describe the “Signature Thromboelastogram”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253212446994">34</xref></sup> for a coagulopathic trauma patient. This is noted by an obvious reduction of clot strength. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253212446994">Figure 2</xref> shows a critically injured patient’s initial r-TEG showing the “Signature Thromboelastogram” from our institution.</p>
<p>Our experiences of employing r-TEG for trauma patients have elucidated numerous insights that have already been published through the surgery department in our facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212446994">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212446994"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212446994">11</xref></sup> Other centers have shown similar success with other forms of viscoelastic coagulation tests such as the ROTEM and Sonoclot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212446994">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253212446994">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253212446994">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>With a renewed interest in the coagulopathy of trauma, numerous novel concepts about its etiology have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212446994">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212446994">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253212446994">8</xref></sup> As alluded to above, recent work suggests the coagulopathy of a trauma patient is present on arrival to the hospital, not necessarily from the attempts at resuscitation due to hemorrhage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212446994">9</xref></sup> Viscoelastic coagulation tests aid in the recognition and treatment of these patients.</p>
<p>Both TEG and ROTEM are viscoelastic coagulation tests. Studies showing the success of both to aid in the treatment of the trauma patient have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212446994">7</xref></sup> While TEG is a rotating cuvette with a piston suspended in the middle to initiate coagulation, ROTEM consists of a rotating piston and a static cuvette. Some studies have postulated that based on their mechanisms the ROTEM may have a lesser incidence of aborted tests due to it being able to withstand surrounding vibrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1089253212446994">35</xref></sup> This seemed mainly important in the mobile labs that might be associated with a military action.</p>
<p>The use of the thromboelastogram has helped provide rapid assessment of a patient’s coagulopathy and has helped guide treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253212446994">34</xref></sup> Traditional central lab testing may take up to 50 minutes to deliver results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253212446994">32</xref></sup> even if ordered STAT, and hence may not show a real-time picture of the patient’s coagulation status. The use of the r-TEG has allowed us to assess the coagulation status at the point of care. Being able to watch the development of the r-TEG tracing live as it develops may even allow the facile anesthesiologist to make assumptions regarding the direction of the resuscitation before the final values are calculated. For the operating room–based anesthesiology staff, this has greatly improved our trauma flow and overall management of massive transfusion. As well as decreasing our reliance on predetermined ratios, this has allowed us to judge each trauma on a case-by-case basis. The use of r-TEG as a point of care test along with an r-TEG-based MTP has allowed the anesthesiologist, trauma surgeon, and intensive care unit attending to maintain a “goal-directed” approach to the resuscitation of the trauma patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1089253212446994">
<title>Fibrinolysis</title>
<p>With the aid of the r-TEG, our trauma services have been able to more quickly recognize the patient who is not only suffering from a TIC but also falling into a state of fibrinolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212446994">9</xref></sup> This state of fibrinolysis can be catastrophic to the patient. As previously stated, newer work on trauma-related coagulopathy has demonstrated that an increase in protein C activity is associated with an increase in fibrinolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212446994">25</xref></sup> Recent work has shown improvement in coagulopathy with the use of the lysine analog tranexamic acid (TXA) in trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1089253212446994">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1089253212446994">37</xref></sup> Work from our institution has shown similar success with the use of another lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA). The BART study is well known for comparing the lysine analogs with aprotinin. This study showed an increased mortality with the use of aprotinin, but found no statistical difference between TXA and EACA regarding death, stroke, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, respiratory failure, and renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1089253212446994">38</xref></sup> The use of the r-TEG allows the anesthesiologist in the operating room to follow the resuscitation and determine when there may be need for antifibrinolytic therapy.</p>
<p>Historically, patients suffering from noncorrectable coagulopathy were faced with ongoing massive transfusion until the coagulopathy began to correct itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212446994">5</xref></sup> Fortunately, with the use of r-TEG in the trauma room, we have been able to generate a protocol to more quickly move onto treatment of the fibrinolysis of trauma by use of antifibrinolytics. This protocol includes the use of a low-dose EACA infusion. Studies have shown that the use of EACA has significantly decreased the need for blood and blood product transfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1089253212446994">39</xref></sup> Also, other studies noted a decrease in mediastinal drainage after coronary artery bypass graft with EACA when compared with other antifibrinolytics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1089253212446994">40</xref></sup> Our success with treatment of these fibrinolytic conditions is shown by the cases at the end of this review. Fortuitously, our interest in the use of r-TEG was surfacing as we began also to evaluate our trauma transfusion practices and develop our own MTP.</p>

<p>The use of r-TEG has been very helpful in our ability to handle all trauma patients. It has been equally useful in determining the need for factor replacement for trauma patients who may not require massive transfusion. The rapid results furnished by the r-TEG have subsequently been instituted into our MTP, allowing for a goal-directed approach to the treatment of the exsanguinating patient. Ongoing work is underway to determine if the r-TEG-guided MTP is helpful in decreasing the incidence of TIC.</p>
<p>The advent of an MTP has been shown to improve survival in those patients requiring massive transfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1089253212446994">41</xref></sup> As the etiology of this complex coagulopathy becomes elucidated, the optimal treatment has not found consensus. The controversy surrounds the optimal ratio of fresh frozen plasma–packed red blood cells (FFP:PRBCs). The military has shown compelling evidence for adopting a 1:1 ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1089253212446994">42</xref></sup> While this has been supported, and included in many MTPs around the country, work from the Surgery Department at this institution has shown improvements in patient survival at a ratio of 1:2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1089253212446994">43</xref></sup> Studies have shown an increase in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome in patients as FFP transfusion increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253212446994">22</xref></sup> This has been supported in other studies investigating the comorbidities associated with massive transfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212446994">5</xref></sup> Still some have argued that the higher FFP:PRBC ratio may actually decrease the usage of blood products overall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1089253212446994">44</xref></sup> Our MTP reflects the changing paradigm in management of the bleeding trauma patient by increasing the percentage of plasma that is given to the trauma patient when compared with trauma management before incorporation of the MTP. However, we also have found success at lower ratios of plasma than is seen at other institutions, via the r-TEG, and our MTP reflects this thinking in an effort to minimize untoward effects from transfusion.</p>
<p>The idea of the MTP has been developed as a natural progression from the idea of damage control surgery and subsequent damage control resuscitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212446994">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1089253212446994">45</xref></sup> Hospitals have been using this information to develop MTPs to fit the type of trauma they encounter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212446994">16</xref></sup> Our MTP is implemented in much the same way as others nationally. The MTP may be initiated by an attending physician (ED, Surgery, Anesthesia), and our predetermined “bundles” are delivered at set intervals of 30 minutes. However, our “bundles” are delivered in an FFP:PRBC ratio of 1:2 not 1:1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1089253212446994">Table 1</xref>). As with other protocols ours can be “doubled up” if requested. It is worth noting that via goal-directed resuscitation the patient will receive what is indicated. As anesthesiology staff we are not bound formally by the MTP, and we are free to work on a case-by-case basis to provide optimum transfusion management. The growing body of literature from this as well as other institutions allows our anesthesia staff the confidence to treat the most critically ill patients in a goal-directed fashion as oftentimes the theories of ratios vanish in the trauma room.</p>

<p>As comfort level with the use of r-TEG has steadily grown, its utility in the arena of massive transfusion has increased. An r-TEG is sent with the patient’s original blood work in the ED and initial information is available as the patient arrives emergently in the operating theatre. The luxury of wireless communication has helped us to allow the r-TEG tracing to be visualized “real time” on a mobile computer that can be used throughout the operating room as well as surgical intensive care unit.</p>
<p>To further help guide the resuscitation, a transfusion service physician is available through the pathology department to aid with evaluating r-TEGs, availability of products, and even as a runner to the lab/blood bank if needed. Working in a level 1 trauma center that adheres to the lean philosophy, again, requires all members of the operating room and lab to work together. The use of the r-TEG has helped closely follow our patients and treat any coagulopathy and/or fibrinolysis rapidly and accordingly.</p>
<p>Along with our MTP we have generated an r-TEG based algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253212446994">Diagram 1</xref>) to help guide transfusion triggers within the MTP. The algorithm calls for 2 units of FFP to be transfused for a TEG-ACT of greater than 110 seconds, cryoprecipitate for an α angle &lt;63°, and platelet transfusion for an MA &lt; 55 mm. This is used as a guide for therapy. The amount of components given must be evaluated along with the r-TEG. Replacement of fibrinogen via cryoprecipitate may not be needed as it is known that 4 units of FFP will contain about 1600 mg of fibrinogen, which is very similar to a 10 pack of cryoprecipitate. The use of r-TEG to enhance our “real-time” knowledge has also helped support the theory of goal-directed massive transfusion.</p>

<p>Per our laboratory, a prior protocol for maintaining large amounts of thawed FFP on hand lead to waste that ranged into the thousands of dollars per year. As previously alluded to, our hospital has made aggressive moves toward eliminating waste. This has helped us stay at the forefront of similar hospitals around the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212446994">21</xref></sup> Recent work has shown that the hemostatic potential of thawed plasma decreases up to 40% over the 5-day shelf life after it is thawed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1089253212446994">46</xref></sup> Hence, decreasing the amount of prethawed FFP and the use of a goal-directed approach has not only saved money but also potentially, improved our transfusion practice overall. Our ability to closely follow an r-TEG has allowed the blood bank to increase the interval before the release of both cryoprecipitate and platelets. Recent and ongoing work through our institution has shown that we had been wasting thawed cryoprecipitate. Our original ratios, which included issuing cryoprecipitate and platelets after 12 units PRBCs and 6 of FFP, are currently being reevaluated. Recently, we have moved the release of those products back to releasing platelets after 16 units of PRBCs and cryoprecipitate nearer to 20 PRBCs. While formal evaluation of this is still ongoing, the use of the r-TEG and the reliance on human talent is beginning to show that goal-directed therapy has potential to be both cost effective and life saving.</p>

<title>Selected Cases</title>
<sec id="section6-1089253212446994">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>This case is of a 58-year-old male suffering from multiple stab wounds to the back, chest, groin, and abdomen whose coagulopathy and resuscitation were managed with r-TEG.</p>
<p>The patient was seen in the ED with noted multiple stab wounds to the aforementioned areas. The patient’s vital signs were significant for mild tachycardia and his “FAST” exam revealed a small amount of fluid in the pelvis from 2 separate exams. The patient remained stable with a left sided chest tube evacuating minimal hemothorax and a nonexpanding left groin hematoma. Nearly 3 hours after arrival, the patient became increasingly tachycardic and hypotensive, with a profound drop in hematocrit.</p>
<p>The patient was rushed to the trauma operating room from the surgical intensive care unit for exploration of the groin hematoma. Immediately posttransfer to the operating room table the patient lost all vital signs. Epinephrine was given and the surgery went quickly from the nonimpressive groin hematoma exploration to an emergent laparotomy. The abdomen was opened and nearly 2 liters of blood and clot poured from the surgical field. Massive transfusion protocol was initiated. The initial r-TEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253212446994">Figure 3</xref>) showed a fibrinolytic pattern with an estimated percent lysis of 18.8%. When evaluating fibrinolysis consider that primary fibrinolysis is a dynamic concept, yet generally any percentage more than 15% is considered primary fibrinolysis. Estimated percent lysis of less than 15% is considered transient. Along with the transfusion of red cells, r-TEG guided resuscitation showed the need for FFP per the prolonged ACT, and platelets as can be seen by the low MA. While the initial standard coagulation tests that had been sent were still pending from the central lab, the r-TEG-based resuscitation was well underway and a follow up r-TEG showed reversal of the early fibrinolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253212446994">Figure 4</xref>). The patient was resuscitated following our MTP with a ratio of 1:2 FFP:PRBCs. The total product given was 23 units PRBC, 11 units FFP, 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and 2 packs of platelets.</p>

<p>Oftentimes the benefit of the r-TEG is that it helps quickly depict when the use of product alone, in any ratio, may not solve the coagulopathy, as can be seen in Case 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1089253212446994">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>The patient was a 51-year-old male, helmeted motorcycle crash victim with massive abdominal bleeding based on ER FAST exam. The patient underwent ED thoracotomy and aortic cross clamping. Although the clot is eventually 100% dissolved, the initial r-TEG shows a slightly prolonged ACT with a consumptive coagulopathy as noted by an estimated percent lysis of 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253212446994">Figure 5</xref>). The patient was treated with large volume transfusion. Still the patient continued to do poorly with estimated percent lysis of 72.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1089253212446994">Figure 6</xref>). The transfusion included a higher ratio of FFP to PRBCS than 1:2. The overall product given included 23 units PRBCs, 14 units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate, and 2 packs of platelets. However, the use of repeated r-TEGs allowed the anesthesiologist to realize that product alone was not going to stop the fibrinolysis, and 5 g of Amicar (EACA) was given to the patient. The final operating room tracing is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253212446994">Figure 7</xref>, with complete reversal of the fibrinolysis.</p>

<title>Case 3</title>
<p>A 38-year-old female victim of an auto versus pedestrian accident in a nearby fast-food parking lot was brought in to the ED. As can be seen by the initial r-TEG the patient is hyperfibrinolytic with an estimated percent lysis of 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1089253212446994">Figure 8</xref>). Her r-TEG ACT was slightly prolonged at 144 seconds. The patient was certain to need factors, yet the invaluable information from the r-TEG shows that the patient may just continue to lyse these products as was seen in the prior case. The patient was treated with 5 g of Amicar (EACA) and continued infusion as her resuscitation continued. Improvement is seen by the second tracing. However, the r-TEG shows continued fibrinolysis as indicated by an estimated percent lysis &gt;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1089253212446994">Figure 9</xref>). Continued therapy via Amicar infusion shows eventual complete reversal of the fibrinolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1089253212446994">Figure 10</xref>). Overall, the patient received 30 units PRBCs, 16 units FFP, 3 units of cryoprecipitate, and 2 packs of platelets.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>It is the understanding the past treatments, both successful and unsuccessful, of the trauma patient that has lead to the most recent evidence-based assessment and treatment plans for the acutely injured trauma patient. The recent exciting theories regarding coagulopathy of the trauma patient have helped members of trauma teams better understand and care for their patients. With that knowledge base and the aid of a renewed interest in the thromboelastogram, our group has been able to help our trauma service greatly improve our perioperative outcomes of the critically injured. In fact, our institution has recently had the lowest mortality rates for academic trauma hospitals in the US University Health System Consortium. The fortuitous timing of our interest in TEG and development of our facilities’ MTP matured hand in hand to provide the anesthesiologist improved tools to work with while in the trauma room. This has shown success and is attributable to the multidepartmental approach and the appropriate use of human talent fostered at our institution. Our decrease in wasted products also fits seamlessly into our institution’s dedication to a lean philosophy. Hopefully, this broad review and explanation of our department’s experience will help foster confidence and improvements in care of the trauma patients cared for at other institutions.</p>
