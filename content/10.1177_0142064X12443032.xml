<abstract>
<p>The Letter to ‘the Hebrews’ is concerned with the ultimate allegiance of its Christian audience. Scholarship on Hebrews, however, is not unanimous regarding the nature of the pressures and temptations which endangered that allegiance. An intertextual examination of many of the septuagintal quotations and allusions used in the warnings against infidelity in Hebrews can provide a fresh perspective on this debate. These quotations and images from the Septuagint draw upon texts that warn against idolatry. Jewish and Christian polemic against idolatry was typically employed to resist compromise with the pagan milieu. This article will argue that by employing these septuagintal texts against idolatry, the author of Hebrews is fortifying his audience against assimilating to its pagan context.</p>

<p>Most interpreters recognize that Hebrews addresses a Christian community under pressure to compromise or give up altogether its exclusive confession and hope in Jesus Christ. Such passages as 2.1-3, 3.6, 12, 6.4-6, 10.25, 32-39, 12.3 and 12.16-17 all point to such pressure. Hebrews 10.25 indicates that at least some in the community have already succumbed. Avoidance of these negative pressures also suggests some positive attraction as an alternative for the Christian community. Thus some have left the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X12443032">1</xref></sup> A rising theory supported by many scholars has identified the negative pressures with the dominant pagan imperial context but the positive attraction with the protection that identifying with non-Christian forms of Judaism afforded the audience of Hebrews.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X12443032">2</xref></sup> This proposal is an interesting reformulation of the traditional relapse theory in which Christian Jews (or Gentiles) are drawn (back) into non-Christian Judaism. In support of this theory, interpreters of Hebrews typically point to the major epideictic syncrises in Hebrews. The comparisons of Jesus to angels, to Moses, and to the old covenant priesthood are thought primarily to have the polemical aim of counteracting the positive attraction of non-Christian Judiasm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X12443032">3</xref></sup> A good argument, however, can be made for understanding these expositional sections as integral to the hortatory sections that follow. Thus they primarily serve the deliberative, not polemical, aims of the letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X12443032">deSilva 2000</xref>: 48-54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X12443032">Guthrie 1994</xref>: 143-44).</p>
<p>The argument in this article is sympathetic with those who see the negative pressures faced by the community addressed in Hebrews as arising from the pagan imperial culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X12443032">4</xref></sup> The major problem emerges when interpreters promote the safe haven that non-Christian Judaism provided persecuted Christians as the attractive alternative. Those who promote this theory often do not recognize that such an option was no solution to the problem for the audience of Hebrews, if we assume a post-70 CE, Roman provenance for Hebrews.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X12443032">5</xref></sup> Non-Christian Jews in the environs of Rome, especially after the first Jewish war, were despised and, at times, persecuted through the aggressive implementation of the <italic>fiscus Judaicus</italic> that led to public exposure, property confiscation, and possibly execution for high-profile proselytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142064X12443032">Heemstra 2010</xref>: 27-32).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X12443032">6</xref></sup> Flavian Rome made central the depiction of the Flavian rulers’ triumph over the Jewish rebellion in Judea and the Jewish god (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0142064X12443032">Millar 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X12443032">Goodman 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X12443032">7</xref></sup> Thus, identification with Jews in Flavian Rome was both shameful and potentially dangerous. Hebrews, in part, addresses the shame that the Christians were experiencing for being a despised, minority, monotheistic culture within a larger polytheistic one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X12443032">deSilva 1995</xref>: 145-208). Such reversion to other forms of Judaism would not have alleviated the shame and disdain they had experienced as Christians in Rome.</p>
<p>A fresh perspective on the attractive pressures faced by the audience of Hebrews can be provided through an analysis of the Old Testament quotations and allusions to the Septuagint in many of the warning passages of Hebrews. These references are made to contexts that warn against idolatry explicitly or implicitly. Furthermore, an examination of Jewish polemic against idolatry can help identify what pressures and temptations the audience of Hebrews faced and thus how the author’s warnings against idolatry functioned. What will be argued here is that idol polemic in Hebrews was employed to resist the attraction of the pagan imperial milieu for its audience. In an effort to develop this thesis, this article will first proceed by examining the function of idol polemic among Jews and Christians. Second, this article will assess those elements in Hebrews that indicate that a polemic against pagan idolatry would have been heard by its audience.</p>
<p>This article may also be seen as an examination of ‘intertextuality’ in Hebrews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142064X12443032">Hays, Alkier and Huizenga 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X12443032">8</xref></sup> While the limited aims of this article prevent me from offering a detailed assessment of the extensive research on this methodological issue, I am working with the basic premise that the author’s allusions to and quotations of warnings from Scripture are shaped by an understanding of the literary contexts from which they are lifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X12443032">Dodd 1952</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X12443032">9</xref></sup> The evidence that will be marshaled from Hebrews below will show this to be the case. When the author chooses texts and images from the Septuagint as warnings, he consistently draws upon texts whose larger literary contexts are warnings against idolatry. This type of hermeneutical theory is central to current studies of intertextuality that examine the use of the Old Testament in New Testament texts. Richard Hays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142064X12443032">1989</xref>: 20), who follows Hollander, states that ‘allusive echo functions to suggest to the reader that text B should be understood in light of a broad interplay with text A, encompassing aspects of A beyond those explicitly cited’. In fact, the most important features for understanding the function of the embedded text in the document under consideration lie in those elements that are muted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X12443032">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Function of Idol Polemic among Early Jews and Christians</title>
<sec id="section2-0142064X12443032">
<title>To Denigrate Other Jewish/Christian Sects: A Secondary Function</title>
<p>The polemic against idolatry among Jews and Christians had two aims. One aim was to denigrate as idolaters those Jewish sects that rejected certain core beliefs of another Jewish sect. This was a <italic>rare use</italic> of idol polemic between Jews of various sects since a monotheistic belief in Yahweh as the one and only God tended to be a common core belief across Jewish sects. We do find, however, this function of idol polemic being used on occasion by the Qumran community<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X12443032">11</xref></sup> and some Christians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X12443032">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regard to early Christian polemic against non-Christian Jewish worship, what appears to be more typical was not to accuse Jews of idolatry (since they worshiped one and the same God), but to castigate their manner of worshiping God—a manner of worshiping that resembled pagans’ worship of their gods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X12443032">13</xref></sup> For example, the Lukan Stephen at the conclusion of his speech in Acts 7 condemns his accusers for limiting divine access and revelation to a temple ‘made with hands’. Elsewhere, a similar accusation is made by the Lukan Paul against the pagan manner of worship. Pagans’ gods are also served in temples ‘made with hands’ (cf. Acts 17.24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142064X12443032">Parsons 2008</xref>: 102). In <italic>Diogn</italic>. 3.2, the Christian apologist states that Jews rightly claim to worship the one God who is over all but wrongly worship him in the manner that pagans worship their gods. Again, a similar accusation in <italic>Barn</italic>. 16.2 states that non-Christian Jews worshiped God in a temple like the Gentiles do for their gods. The author of the <italic>Epistle of Barnabas</italic> attributes this errant worship to the evil one (2.10).</p>

<title>To Prevent Assimilation to the Pagan Milieu: The Primary Function</title>
<sec id="section4-0142064X12443032">
<title>Idolatry as a Pejorative Designation for Pagan Culture</title>
<p>The <italic>most common</italic> aim, however, of idol polemic among Jews and Christians was to prevent the assimilation of Jews and Christians to the larger pagan context in which they lived. In the Septuagint, idol polemic functioned to keep Israel separate from the other nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X12443032">Griffith 2002</xref>: 35). Covenant loyalty to Yahweh required separation from the gods of the nations and the practices of their adherents (cf. Lev. 19.4; 20.22-26).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X12443032">14</xref></sup> εἴδωλα and εἰδωλολατρία become the common designations given to the pagan gods and their worship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X12443032">Griffith 2002</xref>: 33). The declaration of the Chronicler is typical: ‘for all the gods of the nations are idols (εἴδωλα)’ (1 Chron. 16.26). The psalmists write, ‘The idols (εἴδωλα) of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands’ (Pss. 113.2 and 134.15, LXX). Because the idols are things made with human hands (χειροποίητος) <italic>and</italic> are called gods, those who worship them are accursed (Wis. 14.8; cf. Jdt. 8.18). Such demarcation was necessary for Jews and Christians who often comprised a minority monotheistic culture with particular covenant demands within a dominant polytheistic imperial culture. This religious tension is expressed by Philo of Alexandria, who writes that in the cities where Jewish people resided, Jews lived on the border between faith in the supreme God and polytheism (cf. <italic>Praem</italic>. 24-25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142064X12443032">Sandelin 1991</xref>: 110).</p>
<p>For Jews (and Christians), then, idols and idolatry identified pagan culture as life lived in denial of the true God and the covenant life that he stipulated. Consequently, Gentile conversion to covenant life with the God of Israel was depicted as a transition from life lived under idols to life lived under the one God. For instance, Paul contrasts his Gentile converts’ pre-conversion life in idolatry, which is subjected to God’s wrath, with their present loyalty to the living God, which is associated with God’s salvation (2 Cor. 6.16; 1 Thess. 1.9). In <italic>2 Clem</italic>. 17.1, Christians were to draw others away from idols. Paul also warns against continuing participation in idol worship after conversion. Such participation indicated inappropriate affiliation with the pagan milieu (1 Cor. 10.14). Paul points to the divine punishment of the wilderness generation because they became idolaters after God had delivered them (1 Cor. 10.8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142064X12443032">Talbert 2002a</xref>: 80-83). Paul elsewhere employs ‘idols’ as a metonym for the pagan context in his discussion of possible compromises with the pagan culture by the Corinthian church: ‘Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers… [W]hat does a believer share with an unbeliever? What agreement has the temple of God with idols?’ (2 Cor. 6.14, 15b-16a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142064X12443032">Talbert 2002a</xref>: 207-12).</p>
<p>Philo also associates pagan culture with ‘polytheistic opinion’ (πολύθεος δόξα) and points to the draw that pagan culture and religion had on Jews living in Alexandria. He reports that there were those Jews who rejected the exclusive loyalty of their monotheistic faith and adopted ‘polytheistic opinions’ (<italic>Praem</italic>. 162). Moreover, they led fellow Jews to participate in the festal processions to the temples and to adopt the same sacrifices (<italic>Spec</italic>. 1.315-17). Philo wishes to discourage such participation and warns that these ‘deviants’ should (<italic>Spec</italic>. 1.316) and will be punished (<italic>Praem</italic>. 152; cf. Deut. 13.1).</p>
<p>In sum, referring to pagans’ gods as idols and their worship as idolatry became a way of pejoratively characterizing the pagan milieu in order to discourage Jewish and Christian participation in that way of life since idolatry incurred the judgment of God.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0142064X12443032">
<title>Idolatry and the Lure of the Pagan Imperial Milieu</title>
<p>The writings of Philo and Paul (and Dan. 1–6 and 1–2 Maccabees before them) demonstrate the temptations that pagan culture presented to Jews and Christians. Negotiating life in the dominant pagan and imperial culture could prove precarious to the integrity of monotheistic faith and covenant practices of Jews and Christians. For Jews and Christians to participate fully in the civic life of their places of residence often required compromise between the pagan culture and the covenant life required because of exclusive loyalty to God.</p>
<p>Philo is fully aware of the dangers of compromise with the pagan imperial milieu in his depictions of Joseph and Moses. Both Joseph and Moses are Jews who for a time in their lives experienced affluence within Egyptian society. This affluence, however, created the potential for divided loyalties. Philo depicts Joseph living in between the house of his fathers and the house of Pharaoh (<italic>Mig</italic>. 159-62). Joseph, like Moses, knew the favor of Egyptian power and thus experienced tension between loyalty to his monotheistic Hebrew heritage and the pursuit of wealth and power within the idolatrous Egyptian culture (<italic>Jos</italic>. 254; cf. <italic>Mos</italic>. 1.30-31). Joseph, particularly, was thus an example of a Jew who became a politician within a pagan society and was divided in his attention to virtue (loyalty to the one true God) and pleasure (compromise with his polytheistic culture; <italic>Somn</italic>. 2.10-13). In Philo’s context, Jews who were motivated to make a political career in pagan society were typically required to enroll in the encyclical education where they were introduced to polytheistic influences (and, as Philo writes, the love of pleasure, <italic>Leg</italic>. 3.167; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142064X12443032">Sandelin 1991</xref>: 136-42).</p>
<p>Honor, wealth, mixed marriages and safety were all attractions or temptations that compromise with the larger pagan context offered Jews and Christians. Thus, associating idol polemic with the pursuit of wealth or sexual immorality is readily comprehensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142064X12443032">Marcus 2006</xref>: 154-57). Concerning the pursuit of wealth, Philo writes that those who sought patrons who had gold were like those who went to the temples and prayed to the gods and thus committed idolatry, since they served the creation over the creator (<italic>Spec</italic>. 1.21-26, 31). Philo, elsewhere, states that the hope for honor and wealth often proves irresistible, a conclusion he draws from Gen. 31.35 (LXX) where Rachel sits upon her idols (εἴδωλα) and is unable to arise (<italic>Ebr</italic>. 54-58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142064X12443032">Sandelin 1991</xref>: 120-22). Likewise, Col. 3.15 identifies greed as idolatry and Mt. 6.24 (cf. Lk. 16.13) sets service to God in opposition to service to Mammon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X12443032">15</xref></sup> Joel Marcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142064X12443032">2006</xref>: 156) notes that the early church possibly left the word ‘Mammon’ untranslated ‘thus sounding like a proper name, partly in order to bring out the implication that wealth quickly becomes an idol, an alternate lord who demands subservience in an almost personal way’. The picture given of the churches in Rev. 2–3 indicates that compromise with the Empire and with wealth were ‘a backdoor to idolatry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X12443032">Hays 1996</xref>: 77).</p>
<p>Idolatry was also associated with sexual immorality. Hosea 1–4 and Ezek. 16 and 23 speak of Israel’s idolatry under the metaphor of sexual immorality in order to represent faithlessness to God and to his covenant. Similarly, the author of Revelation links together eating food sacrificed to idols and the practice of fornication in his admonitions to the churches of Pergamum and Thyatira (2.14, 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X12443032">Beale 1999</xref>: 250, 261).</p>
<p>Actual sexual deviance was connected to idolatry as well. The main threat appears to be mixed marriages with pagans. Deuteronomy 7.3-4 explicitly forbids intermarriage with the sons and daughters of the Canaanites because such marriages might turn the Israelites away from Yahweh to serve other gods. In Ezra 9.1-2, Ezra is informed that the people of Israel have intermarried with the peoples in the land and thus ‘have not separated themselves from the [pagan] peoples’ abominations’. Ezra laments that the people of Israel now stand under the judgment of God for this covenant violation. <italic>Jubilees</italic> 30.7-17 commands the death of any father who gives his daughter to a Gentile for marriage as well as the death of the woman who marries the Gentile. Likewise, the one who marries a Gentile woman brings God’s judgment upon the people. Tobit exhorts his son, ‘First of all, marry a woman from among the descendants of your ancestors; do not marry a foreign woman’ (Tob. 4.12 NRSV). Joseph will not marry Aseneth because she worships dumb idols and he worships the living God (<italic>Jos. Asen</italic>. 8.5). Only after her conversion to God and rejection of her idols does she become a suitable wife for Joseph (<italic>Jos. Asen</italic>. 19.5). In their recounting of the incident from Num. 25, both Josephus (<italic>Ant</italic>. 4.145-46) and Philo (<italic>Mos</italic>. 1.295-305) represent intermarriage with pagan women as the gateway to apostasy through idolatry. Paul advises that, for those Christians who wish to marry, they must avoid mixed marriages and marry ‘only in the Lord’ (1 Cor. 7.39). All of these examples demonstrate that fear of abandoning covenant life through idolatry made Jews and Christians wary of mixed marriages and sexual unions with pagans.</p>
<p>More generally, Wis. 14.12 states that the making of idols was the beginning of fornication (πορνεία). Paul in Rom. 1.24-27 connects being controlled by lusts and passions exemplified by sexual immorality (degrading of the body) with idol worship in 1.23. Philo also broadly connects idolatry with being given over to one’s passions. For example, he interprets the grinding of the golden calf in Exod. 32.30 as the destruction of bodily pleasures (<italic>Post</italic>. 158-64). This broader identification of idolatry with the passions and not just sexual sin, literally or metaphorically, reflected the notion that for Jews and Christians all evil has its source in idolatry (cf. Wis. 14.27; Rom. 1.18-32). Life lived in idolatry was the gateway to all other sins and covenant violations.</p>
<p>Christians also sought to identify with their pagan milieu and its idolatry out of a desire for safety. Fear of reprisal because of conversion to the Christian faith was a powerful deterrent for those pagans contemplating becoming Christians. The promise of safety and security was also a powerful incentive for converts to abandon their Christian confession. For example, Pliny’s fear tactics in dealing with obstinate Christians who refused to curse Christ appear to have had their desired effect by restoring devotion to the traditional polytheistic religion. Pliny writes, ‘For there is no doubt people have begun to throng to the temples… The sacred rites which had been allowed to lapse are being performed again’ (<italic>Ep</italic>. 10.96.10 [Radice, LCL]). From the <italic>Martyrdom of Polycarp</italic>, the overzealous, would-be-martyr Quintus is censured for his cowardice and subsequent identification with the pagan imperial milieu because ‘after he saw the wild beasts…the proconsul convinced him to take the oath and offer sacrifice’ (<italic>Mart. Pol</italic>. 4 [Ehrman, LCL]). Such hostility from imperial pagan authorities helps us understand how Hermas can describe some Christians as those who worship idols because of cowardice (<italic>Sim</italic>. 9.21.3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0142064X12443032">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In sum, idol polemic primarily served to demarcate the monotheistic covenantal communities of Jews and Christians from the pagan polytheistic culture. The polemic was especially concerned with those aspects of pagan culture that would lead to a rejection of covenant life under God. Idol polemic, then, resists the lures of honor, wealth, mixed marriages and safety that identification with the pagan milieu and its gods offered.</p>

<title>Assessing Idol Polemic in Hebrews</title>
<p>Before examining idol polemic in Hebrews, there are two initial observations to consider. First, Hebrews does not employ its idol polemic against the defective temple worship of the Jews. The focus of Hebrews is on the tabernacle worship as it is set forth in the Septuagint. That worship is not repudiated because of any semblance to pagan worship. Rather, from the perspective of Hebrews it is incomplete but anticipatory of the heavenly realities fulfilled by Jesus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X12443032">D’Angelo 1979</xref>: 248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142064X12443032">Koester 2001</xref>: 414).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X12443032">16</xref></sup> Second, Hebrews is not a polemic against defection to another non-Christian Jewish sect. As seen above, this type of polemic is a rare use of Jewish idol polemic, and such a defection would not have solved the problems the community seemed to be facing. What will be demonstrated is that idol polemic in Hebrews can be understood according to its primary use—namely, to demarcate the pagan milieu and to resist the pressures and temptations it presented to the Christian congregation.</p>
<sec id="section8-0142064X12443032">
<title>‘Living God’ and ‘Dead Works’</title>
<p>There are two typical textual indicators in Hebrews that, as some interpreters of Hebrews have argued, attempt to demarcate the pagan context of the audience: (1) the description of God as ‘living’ and (2) the reference to ‘dead works’.</p>
<p>First, the author of Hebrews uses the designation ‘living God’ (ζω̑ν θεός) in Heb. 3.12, 10.31 and 12.22. In Jewish literature, the designation ‘living God’ is often set over against the pagan nations who threaten God’s people and the dead idols that these nations worshiped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X12443032">17</xref></sup> Worship of the living God was the ultimate distinction between the Jews and the nations in which they lived. In <italic>Jos. Asen</italic>. 8.5, the ‘living God’ of Joseph is contrasted with the ‘dumb idols’ of Aseneth and her family. Aseneth’s idolatry is the reason Joseph will not greet her with a kiss or consider her for a wife. Paul uses the designation ‘living God’ in connection with Gentile conversion from a pagan polytheistic context to faith in Jesus Christ and worship of the one God of Israel (2 Cor. 6.16; 1 Thess. 1.9). The Lukan Paul calls his Gentile audience in Lystra to turn from their vain idols to serve the living God (Acts 14.15). The use of this repeated designation in Hebrews likely indicates the demarcation of the Christian audience from its pagan imperial context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X12443032">Backhaus 2009</xref>: 152-53). As we will see below, such a conclusion is strengthened by the recognition that one of its uses is embedded in an admonition that implicitly warns against idolatry in 10.26-31.</p>
<p>Second, the enigmatic reference to ‘dead works’ (νεκρὰ ἔργα) occurs in Heb. 6.1 and 9.14. These ‘dead works’ are those from which the audience has repented (6.1) or has been cleansed (9.14). In both cases the likely referent is to idols and idolatry. While ‘dead works’ is a unique designation for idols, it has some strong affinities with Wis. 13.10 and 15.17. In Wis. 13.10, pagans are those who put their hope in ‘dead things’ (νεκρά), and they call gods what are really the ‘works of human hands’ (ἔργα χειρω̑ν ἀνθρώπων). Again in Wis. 15.17 we read that a mortal (one subjected to death) ‘makes a dead thing with lawless hands’ (νεκρὸν ἐργάζεται χερσὶν ἀνόμοις). By combining ‘dead things’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X12443032">18</xref></sup> and ‘works of human hands’ (both common designations for pagan idols), describing idols as ‘dead works’ is understandable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X12443032">deSilva 2000</xref>: 216-17). This language also has some interesting parallels with Hermas’s description of the doubleminded in <italic>Sim</italic>. 9.21. In the parable, Hermas relates that the doubleminded are those whose ‘works are dead’ (τὸ δὲ ἔργα αὐτω̑ν νεκρά ἐστιν; <italic>Sim</italic>. 9.21.2). Hermas (<italic>Sim</italic>. 9.21.3-4) goes on to identify these doubleminded as those who commit idolatry out of fear because they are ashamed of their Lord and, thus, must repent quickly.</p>
<p>While these considerations favor understanding ‘dead works’ in 6.1 and 9.14 as a reference to pagan idols, the association of this phrase in Hebrews with idols and idolatry is even stronger when we examine the phrases with which it is paired. In 6.1, ‘repentance from dead works’ is paired with ‘faith in God’ (πίστις ἐπὶ θεόν). Such a pairing, again, reminds us of Christian preaching to the Gentiles (Acts 14.15; 1 Thess. 1.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X12443032">19</xref></sup> Philo also speaks about how Abraham turned from the idols and astrology of his father and chose instead ‘faith in God’ (ἡ πρὸς θεὸν πίστις) as his reward (<italic>Praem</italic>. 27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X12443032">20</xref></sup> In Heb. 9.14, cleansing the conscience from ‘dead works’ is paired with service to the ‘living God’. In light of the discussion above on ‘living God’, such a pairing is appropriate if dead works is a reference to idols. Based on these considerations, the use of ‘dead works’ in Hebrews has in view the pagan context of the audience.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, both ‘living God’ and ‘dead works’ derive their significance in Jewish and Christian parlance from their relationship to pagan idolatry. More specifically, their significance is tied to the Jewish polemic that the gods of the nations are idols and thus dead. Again, these are the two elements that are commonly noted by interpreters of Hebrews for their connection to the pagan milieu. When considered separately, these elements might appear as anomalies in the discourse of Hebrews that seem to have little overt concern for its pagan imperial context. If, however, the warnings drawn from the Septuagint in the latter half of Hebrews are examined, we will discover that the literary contexts from which these references are drawn bring pagan idolatry to the fore.</p>

<title>Septuagintal Warnings against Idolatry</title>
<sec id="section10-0142064X12443032">
<title>Hebrews 10.28 and 10.30</title>
<p>There are five septuagintal references that will be considered from the warnings and exhortations in the hortatory sections of Hebrews in the latter part of its discourse. Two references of interest from the Septuagint occur in Heb. 10.26-31. This passage warns against the danger of unfaithfulness to God and his son Jesus. The first of these two septuagintal references is found in Heb. 10.28, which states that the one who violates the law ‘dies without mercy upon the testimony of two or three witnesses’ (χωρὶς οἰκτιρμω̑ν ἐπὶ δυσὶν ἢ τρισὶν μάρτυσιν ἀποθνῄσκει). The quotation is a reference to Deut. 17.6 (ἐπὶ δυσὶν μάρτυσιν ἢ ἐπὶ τρισὶν μάρτυσιν ἀποθανει̑ται, LXX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X12443032">Backhaus 2009</xref>: 367). The immediate context of this quotation (Deut. 17.2-3) refers to the covenant violation of serving and worshiping other gods. Such a violation warrants death on the testimony of two or three witnesses. χωρὶς οἰκτιρμω̑ν in the warning of Hebrews does not occur in the Septuagint. Luke Johnson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142064X12443032">2006</xref>: 264), however, believes that this phrase is a possible allusion to Deut. 13.6-10, where the Israelite community is commanded to put to death those who tempt others towards idolatry, even if these people are among a person’s most intimate relationships.</p>
<p>The second septuagintal warning occurs at the end of the admonition in 10.30, which quotes Deut. 32.35 and 36: ‘On the day of vengeance I will repay’ (ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀνταποδώσω, LXX)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X12443032">21</xref></sup> and ‘the Lord will judge his people’ (κρινει̑ κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτου̑, LXX). These warnings are drawn from the Song of Moses, where the Lord foretells Israel’s future idolatry and thus unfaithfulness to the covenant (cf. Deut. 32.21), his judgment against such unfaithfulness, and his future victory over his people’s idolatry—a victory that brings about their deliverance (cf. Deut. 32.36-38).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X12443032">22</xref></sup> ‘The Lord will judge his people’ is also found in Ps. 134.14 (LXX; κρινει̑ κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτου̑).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X12443032">23</xref></sup> The verses (8-11) that precede this statement in the psalm declare God’s defeat of the pagan nations who were the enemies of his people. The verses (15-18) that follow are a condemnation of the idols of the pagan nations.</p>
<p>If we take our cue from the septuagintal references in the admonition against apostasy in Heb. 10.26-31, then the unfaithfulness in view (‘willfully persisting in sin’ in 10.26) would be the ongoing identification with the pagan context, just as Israel’s identification with the other nations and their idols was in view in the quotations from Deut. 17 and 32 as well as Ps. 134 (LXX). The concluding reference in Heb. 10.31 to the ‘living God’, who is to be feared, is an apt phrase when it is considered alongside the warnings against idolatry that the quotations from the Septuagint assume. As indicated above, such a descriptor was used to demarcate the God of Jews and Christians from the dead gods of their pagan neighbors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X12443032">24</xref></sup> This reference to the ‘living God’ also indicates that the larger literary contexts assumed by the quotations are at work here in this admonition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X12443032">25</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0142064X12443032">
<title>Hebrews 10.37-38</title>
<p>The third quotation that serves as both a warning and exhortation is found in Heb. 10.32-39. The author draws upon the hearers’ past demonstration of solidarity and faithfulness in order to exhort them to present perseverance. In vv. 37-38, there are two passages from the Septuagint that have been blended together into one quotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142064X12443032">Lewis 1975</xref>: 88-94).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X12443032">26</xref></sup> The major part of the quotation is taken from Hab. 2.3-4: ‘The one who is coming will come and not delay. My righteous one will live by faith, but if he shrinks back, my soul will not take pleasure in him’ (ἐρχόμενος ἥξει καὶ οὐ μὴ χρονίσῃ͘ ἐὰν ὑποστεί—ληται οὐκ εὐδοκει̑ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῳ̑͘ ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεώς μου ζήσεται, LXX).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X12443032">27</xref></sup> The quotation from Habakkuk is part of God’s response to the prophet who learns of God’s plan to judge his people by raising up Babylon against them (cf. 1.6). God goes on to tell the prophet of his coming judgment against Babylon (2.5-17) and against all those who identify with that city, including those who have turned to its idols (2.18-19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X12443032">28</xref></sup> This concluding woe oracle against idols in Hab. 2.18-19 then provides a fitting antithesis to the one whose confidence is in Yahweh in v. 4 at the beginning of the chapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X12443032">Anderson 2001</xref>: 257).</p>
<p>In the literary context of the quotation from Habakkuk, the writer of Habakkuk speaks of pagan imperial power that rules oppressively over God’s people but will be subjected to God’s coming judgment. Such a situation mirrors well in Hebrews the community’s past and ongoing trials in Rome, where they have been shamed, plundered and imprisoned (10.32-34). The connection is even stronger when one notes from the literary context of Habakkuk that God speaks against imperial power that accumulates wealth by despoiling other nations (cf. Hab. 2.8) and subjects them to public shame (cf. Hab. 2.15).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X12443032">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0142064X12443032">
<title>Hebrews 12.15</title>
<p>The fourth reference is a septuagintal allusion found in Heb. 12.15 that warns the community against allowing ‘any root of bitterness which grows up (τις ῥίζα πικρίας ἄνω ϕύουσα)’ to defile many. This imagery is taken from Deut. 28.17 (LXX), where the people are warned not to turn away from God to serve the gods of the nations lest there is among them ‘any root which grows up in gall and bitterness (τίς…ῥίζα ἄνω ϕύουσα ἐν χολῃ̑ καὶ πικρίᾳ)’. The author of Hebrews goes on to cite the example of the sexually immoral and worldly (πόρνος ἢ βέβηλος) Esau who sold his birthright for a single meal. The reference to fornication or adultery here strengthens the tie with this warning against idolatry, as we will see below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0142064X12443032">
<title>Hebrews 12.29</title>
<p>Finally, Heb. 12.29 concludes the exhortation/warning at the close of the discourse by reminding the audience that God is a consuming fire (πυ̑ρ καταναλίσκον). The allusion here is to two passages from Deuteronomy. In Deut. 4.24, the people are warned against idolatry and reminded that God is a consuming fire (πυ̑ρ καταναλίσκον), a jealous God. In Deut. 9.3, the imagery of a consuming fire (πυ̑ρ καταναλίσκον) is associated with God who goes forth in judgment against the nations in Canaan so that Israel may inherit the land God promised. Both passages serve, either explicitly or implicitly, to warn against identifying with the polytheistic peoples and their idols in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>In Heb. 12.29, the two Deuteronomic descriptions of God as a consuming fire are possibly at work here. The author of Hebrews has just declared that God will shake the heavens and earth once more so as to remove all that is mortal and establish that which is immortal—a kingdom that cannot be shaken (12.26-27). Such a picture of judgment most assuredly involves God’s victory over the nations and their idols. This victory will usher God’s faithful people into his promised rest (cf. 4.1). One encounters a similar picture when considering the larger contexts of Deut. 4.24 and 9.3, in which the Israelites are warned against participating in the idolatry of the surrounding nations who are about to suffer God’s judgment as he brings his people into the promised land.</p>

<sec id="section14-0142064X12443032">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In sum, these five quotations that occur as warnings and exhortations in the latter part of Hebrews are all taken from literary contexts that warn against idolatry or against identifying with pagan nations. The cumulative effect of these passages and their literary contexts is that the audience of Hebrews is consistently, though implicitly, being warned against idolatry. Consequently, idol polemic in Hebrews functions, as it most commonly does among Jews and Christians, to warn its audience against assimilating to the pagan imperial context.</p>

<sec id="section15-0142064X12443032">
<title>Warnings against Wealth and Sexual Immorality</title>
<p>Other factors in Hebrews appear to point to the dangerous draw of the pagan milieu. First, the discourse of Hebrews reflects concern over the attraction of wealth and glory (a topic associated with idol polemic). For the audience of Hebrews, who had suffered privation of status and possessions (Heb. 10.32-34) for its confession of Jesus Christ, the denial of such a confession and of the Christian community in order to pursue wealth and status in the pagan milieu might have proven too great for some of its members (Heb. 10.25). Thus the concluding exhortation in Heb. 13.5 is for the audience to keep itself free from the love of money and to be content with its possessions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Moses’ own circumstances in Heb. 11 are depicted as a choice between the wealth and status derived from identification with Egyptian imperial culture and the suffering anticipated by identification with Christ and God’s people (vv. 24-26). The reference to the Maccabean martyrs in 11.35 (‘Others were tortured and did not accept release in order that they might obtain a better resurrection’) possibly relates to this same tension. In 2 Macc. 7, Antiochus tempts the seventh and youngest brother, offering him affluence in Antiochus’s kingdom if the brother will give up his allegiance to God, but threatening torture and death (the fate of the previous six brothers) if he remains obstinate (vv. 24-29). These examples not only point to the attractions of wealth and affluence that siding with the pagan context presented to the audience of Hebrews, but also point to the repercussions arising from the failure to give up its Christian identification. Members of the community of Hebrews had already experienced being plundered and imprisoned (possibly even martyred, cf. 13.7). Thus, the author exhorts them not to shrink back from their confession of Christ and identification with their community (10.39). As we have seen, resisting these types of attractions and fears arising from the pagan milieu was associated with idol polemic in order to preserve covenant loyalty to God.</p>
<p>We also see a concern for sexual morality in Hebrews. The audience is warned in 12.16 not to be ‘sexually immoral’ (πόρνος) like Esau. Esau’s sexual immorality can be understood metaphorically in this passage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X12443032">30</xref></sup> It represents the rejection of his birthright (i.e., future inheritance) in order to achieve temporary relief of his suffering (i.e., hunger). Sexual immorality was also used metaphorically in the idol polemic of the prophets noted above. If we connect Esau’s sexual immorality with the idol polemic of the prophets, then Esau’s sexual immorality points to the danger of compromise with the audience’s pagan context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X12443032">31</xref></sup> Such an interpretation of Esau’s sexual immorality is further suggested by the presence of idol polemic in the preceding verse. In 12.15, the audience had just been warned not to let ‘a root of bitterness’ (i.e., defection to the pagan milieu and its idols) grow up among them. The audience is then warned not to follow Esau’s example when he gave up his birthright for food. The idol polemic assumed in Heb. 12.15 and the dangerous attraction to the pagan imperial milieu it resists have then shaped the following description of Esau as ‘sexually immoral and godless’ in 12.16.</p>
<p>The presence of these thematic issues in Hebrews, deeply rooted in Jewish idol polemic, strengthens the notion that idol polemic, which is part of the intertext of the septuagintal warnings surveyed above, is at play in Hebrews. Moreover, the presence of these thematic elements lends further support to the claim that the function of idol polemic in Hebrews is to counteract the attraction of the pagan imperial milieu.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What then does this evidence and argument mean for the study of Hebrews? First, this article has attempted to argue that, in light of the septuagintal warnings against idolatry in Hebrews, the <italic>attractive</italic> pressures facing the audience of Hebrews should be associated with its pagan imperial context. The temptation to identify with the pagan imperial culture because of the affluence and safety it offered seems to have been the attractive element drawing the audience away from its exclusive loyalty to God and his son, Jesus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X12443032">deSilva 1995</xref>: 163; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142064X12443032">Koester 2001</xref>: 71-72). The depictions of Abraham, Moses and Esau in Hebrews all point to the presence of these attractive pressures facing the community.</p>
<p>The depiction of Moses, especially, in Heb. 11.24-27, puts the audience’s pagan context in the forefront. The author has selectively and creatively retold the story of Moses in surprising ways. The author presents Moses’ primary struggle as one between his identification with Christ and God’s people and his identification with his pagan Egyptian context. His story is shaped in such a way so as to mirror explicitly the past life of the community (Heb. 10.32-39) and, one supposes, its ongoing present struggles. Like Moses, the community faced suffering and deprivation from its surrounding culture because of its identification with Jesus and his followers. Like Moses, it experienced the displeasure of its culture. Like Moses, it was looking forward to its reward from God. As discussed above, Moses’ struggle is specifically related to the temptations of temporary prosperity in Egypt and of fearing the king’s anger. To imagine similar temptations and struggles among the audience of Hebrews living in Rome with its pagan imperial culture is not difficult. As we have seen, the affluence and mobility that identification with pagan culture offered Jews and Christians was a powerful incentive to compromise their Jewish and Christian covenant loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142064X12443032">Kraybill 1996</xref>). Such attraction was even stronger in light of the negative pressures the pagan culture placed upon those who maintained exclusive covenant loyalty to God and his people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X12443032">32</xref></sup> Idol polemic was specifically employed to resist this dangerous attraction. The author of Hebrews uses the warning against idolatry implied in several of his septuagintal warnings to tarnish the luster of such an attractive alternative.</p>
<p>Second, in light of these observations, we might be able to say something about the identity of the audience of Hebrews. Scholarship on Hebrews has long been split on whether Hebrews addresses a Jewish Christian audience or a primarily Gentile Christian audience. The recognition of idol polemic in the septuagintal warnings of Hebrews does not decide this issue by itself. We have seen such a polemic used by Jews, like Philo, to warn fellow Jews from forsaking their covenant life under God to identify with their pagan context. Idol polemic, however, fits well with a Gentile Christian audience and the temptations they faced. The warnings in parts of the New Testament and other early Christian texts for Gentile Christians to abstain from eating meat offered to idols point to the ongoing temptations for Gentile Christians to maintain their identification with the pagan milieu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X12443032">33</xref></sup> When we combine this polemic with statements such as Heb. 6.1-2, where the elementary teachings about Christ seem to point to foundational Jewish affirmations that a Gentile, coming out of idolatry, would need to accept before embracing Christ, then the identity of the audience as Gentile becomes stronger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X12443032">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, idol worship distinguished the pagan world from the Jewish and Christian world. In the Septuagint, moving from the exclusive worship of Yahweh to the worship of the idols of the nations was the supreme act of apostasy. Idol worship violated the covenant stipulations laid out in the first two commands of the Decalogue. While idol worship was the supreme covenant violation, it was also associated with an inordinate identification with pagan culture that entailed compromises with ‘lesser’ aspects of covenant life stipulated by God. The author of Hebrews, then, attempts to strengthen the community’s allegiance to the God of Jesus Christ and to resist the attraction of assimilating to the pagan imperial culture by consistently employing warnings against idolatry that are implied from several septuagintal references. The conclusions of this article challenge such statements as those put forward by Marius Heemstra recently and by John Dunnill, among others. Commenting on 1 Peter and Rev. 2–3, Heemstra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142064X12443032">2010</xref>: 150) has written that ‘there are strong exhortations to guard boundaries with the pagan and polytheistic environment’. He goes on to conclude that such exhortations are ‘totally lacking in Hebrews’. Dunnill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X12443032">1992</xref>: 24) has stated that the alternative identity base of the Christian audience addressed by Hebrews is not Paganism but Judaism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X12443032">35</xref></sup> The argument and evidence of this article invites a serious reconsideration of such conclusions.</p>

<p>While present studies of the use of the Old Testament in the New that follow Hays typically rely on modern literary theory, I believe the ancient authors and audiences tended to write and hear texts with this type of expectation for quoted and allusive references. For example, figured speech was a commonly employed ancient rhetorical form that left unspoken but implicit what was primary or most important (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12443032">Ahl 1984</xref>). Additionally, Plato in his ‘Allegory of the Cave’ provides an interesting test case. At one point (<italic>Rep</italic>. 516D) he quotes Achilles’ famous statement from Hades in <italic>Od</italic>. 11.488-91. Plato does not explicitly identify the speaker or the context of the quotation. Once one understands the larger, implied context of the quotation from the <italic>Odyssey</italic>, he or she is able to see that Achilles’ own experience is similar to that of the person who leaves the cave and then reenters, thus making the limited quotation more significant for Plato’s purposes.</p></fn>

<p>Cf. 1 Jn 5.21, ‘children, keep yourselves from idols’. Many interpreters have argued that this statement is a warning to reject the defective Christology of those who have left the community (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X12443032">Griffith 2002</xref>: 14-17). Some have understood this, however, as a warning against compromise with the pagan context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X12443032">Griffith 2002</xref>: 19-20). Justin, in <italic>Dial</italic>. 93, accuses non-believing Jews of being idolaters because they reject Jesus as the Christ. This is the only explicit reference in his <italic>Dialogue</italic> where he accuses his Jewish contemporaries of being idolaters, though twice he quotes Jeremiah’s polemic against idolatry (Jer. 2.13) to talk about how non-believing Jews have forsaken God by rejecting Jesus as the Christ (<italic>Dial</italic>. 19.114). All other references to idolatry in the <italic>Dialogue</italic> are references to the scriptural narrative and prophetic accusations of idolatry related to Israel’s past (e.g., 46, 92, 102, 130, 133).</p></fn>

<p>A similar conclusion can perhaps be drawn from the quotation of Ps. 95 in Heb. 3. In the second major hortatory section in Hebrews (3.7–4.16), the audience of Hebrews is warned against forsaking their confession and hope in Jesus Christ. The wilderness generation is brought forth as the primary illustration of the negative consequences that result from turning away from God and rejecting the gospel. Psalm 95.7-11 is the featured septuagintal text at the beginning of this hortatory section. It illustrates for the author that infidelity because of unbelief kept the wilderness generation from entering God’s rest. If we look at the beginning of Ps. 95, we will find that it starts with a declaration of worship and a confession that God is the ‘rock of our salvation’ (v. 1), ‘king above all gods’ (v. 3), and the sea and dry land are his creations (v. 4). Thus, in Ps. 95, the invective against the wilderness generation functions as a warning against forsaking God who is both creator and savior. Consequently, the exhortation not to turn away from the ‘living God’ that follows the quotation from Ps. 95 in Heb. 3.12 is fitting in light of these observations.

<p>The author of Hebrews has apparently modified this quotation from Hab. 2.4 by inverting the order of the latter part of the quotation—ὁ ἐρχόμɛνοϛ ἥξɛɩ καɩ οὐ χρονίσῃ ὁ δɛ δίκαɩοϛ ἐκ πίστɛωϛ μου ζήσɛταɩ καὶ ἐὰν ὑποστɛίληταɩ οὐκ ɛὐδοκɛɩ̑ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῳ̑.</p></fn>

<p>The sexual immorality of Esau could be taken in two ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142064X12443032">Johnson 2006</xref>: 324-25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X12443032">O’Brien 2010</xref>: 374-75). It can be taken metaphorically as Esau’s rejection of his birthright (the option preferred above). It was also related in some Jewish traditions to Esau’s marriage to two Canaanite women (cf. Gen. 26.34-35; <italic>Jub</italic>. 25.1, 7-8; 26.34; 35.13-14). If the second option is inferred, then the audience of Hebrews is implicitly warned against entering into marriages with pagans that would lead to covenant infidelity. If this is the case, then such a warning against mixed marriages might also stand behind the exhortation in 13.4 to keep the marriage bed undefiled (i.e., not to enter into mixed marriages). Either interpretive option sees attraction to the pagan context as the threat to the covenant loyalty of the audience of Hebrews.</p></fn>

<p>A further point of interest is that Esau, who is associated with Edom (Gen. 25.30), might figuratively represent the Roman imperial context. Edom was a figured reference for Rome in rabbinic literature, e.g., <italic>Gen. Rab</italic>. 6.3; 34.13.</p></fn>
