<abstract>
<p>Since practical application of the recently developed CIE mesopic system assumes the development of new measurement devices, recommendations and software for road lighting design, this paper presents a corrected photopic luminance table, which enables lighting designers to use the existing design procedures and measurement methods until all of these tasks are accomplished. It is also shown that there are numerous reasons for the practical application of the CIE mesopic system, although only photopic vision is involved in on-axis object recognition. Using the corrected photopic luminance table, an analysis is conducted regarding the potential electricity and cost savings when applying white light sources, which are more visually effective in the mesopic range.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153511426743" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The well-known photopic luminous efficiency function V(λ) represents the response of the cone receptors located on the axis of the eye at high light levels. The scotopic function V′(λ) shows the response of the rod receptors and applies to off-axis vision at low light levels. The twilight zone which lies between the photopic and scotopic regions is called mesopic. Through the mesopic range the eye response is dependent on the luminance level (which is not the case in the photopic and scotopic regions). With the reduction of the luminance level, the eye sensitivity to bluish lights increases, while decreasing to yellowish and reddish lights. This is why, under mesopic conditions photopic lumens, officially declared by lamp manufacturers (determined using the function V(λ)), are not well correlated with the produced visual sensation.</p>
<p>Attempts to quantify this effect have lasted for decades. Until the mid 1990s most of the research in this area was based on a brightness matching criterion. A summary of the previous mesopic models is given in Rea <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511426743">1</xref></sup> concluding that seven of the nine models employ methodology based on this criterion. During the second half of the 1990s research based on visual task performance started to prevail, due to an increased awareness within the lighting community that the detection and recognition of moving objects (cars, cyclists, pedestrians, etc.) are more relevant than the comparative brightness between such objects and their adjacent surfaces. First, research was carried out by He <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153511426743">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153511426743">3</xref></sup> calling for subjects to use reaction time as an indicator of visual performance (it should be noted that the subjects were asked only to notice the target, and not to recognise it). He <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153511426743">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153511426743">3</xref></sup> contain the first two mesopic models based on visual performance, showing that under low light levels off-axis reaction times depend on the lamp spectrum, while on-axis reaction times do not practically depend on the lamp type.</p>
<p>Lewis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153511426743">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153511426743">5</xref></sup> also investigated mesopic spectral effects testing observer reaction times. Observers were asked to react to a simulated road hazard set slightly off-axis. Their task was to respond whether the grating was horizontal or vertical, as well as to identify if the pedestrian (shown on a slide) was facing towards or away from the road. The results showed that the same observer reaction time is achieved at considerably lower photopic light levels when metal-halide (MH) lamps are used than when high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps are used. For example, under the particular conditions set in Lewis’s experiments a photopic light level of 1 cd/m<sup>2</sup> produced using an HPS lamp was six times higher than the photopic light level produced by an MH lamp for an identical reaction time of 800 ms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511426743">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bullough and Rea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153511426743">7</xref></sup> and Lingard and Rea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153511426743">8</xref></sup> employed simulated driving tasks to investigate the influence of spectrum on driving and peripheral detection performance at mesopic light levels. They found a strong spectral effect in the detection of an off-axis target. Their results indicated that under the employed experimental conditions the effectiveness of an MH lamp could be more than 30 times greater than that of an HPS lamp.</p>
<p>Rea <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511426743">1</xref></sup> proposed a unified system of photometry (the USP system) based on the approach of He <italic>et al.</italic>, with reaction time as the criterion. The system was only focused on achromatic tasks. A table was given containing unified luminances as a function of the corresponding photopic luminances (up to 0.55 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) and the ratio of scotopic/photopic (S/P) values of the background luminance, which is equal to the ratio of the lamp scotopic/photopic lumens.</p>
<p>The objective of a comprehensive project realised by the MOVE consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153511426743">9</xref></sup> was to determine spectral sensitivity functions for the luminance range of 0.01–10 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, based on visual performance. Since visual performance during driving consists of an initial searching, seeing and recognition process, emphasis was placed on experimental methods which are linked to contrast threshold, reaction time and recognition threshold. The considered visual tasks included both chromatic and achromatic tasks, with the former dominating. The final results were presented in a table similar in shape to that presented in Rea <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511426743">1</xref></sup> which contains mesopic luminances as a function of the corresponding photopic luminances (up to 10 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) and the S/P ratio.</p>
<p>The similarity of Rea’s table with unified luminance levels (derived from the USP system) and the table with mesopic luminance levels (derived from the MOVE system), with different values related to the same photopic luminance and the same S/P ratio, initiated further research conducted by CIE Technical Committee 1–58. The CIE mesopic spectral sensitivity functions, that is, the CIE mesopic system, had to have the following attributes:
<list id="list1-1477153511426743" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To tend to V(λ) at the upper end of the mesopic region, and to V′(λ) at its lower end.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To preserve the basic requirement of photometry – additivity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To relate to visual performance under a range of different visual conditions considered in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511426743">10</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Considering the USP and MOVE systems as two extremes, CIE TC 1–58 developed two versions of an intermediate system (designated by MES1 and MES2). Then, all of the candidate systems (USP, MOVE, MES1 and MES2) were tested with independent visual performance data sets. The outcome of the tests was represented by the ability of each system to provide correlation with visual performance over a broad range of visual conditions. It was concluded within TC 1–58 that one of the two versions of the intermediate system should be recommended. Since the MES2 system showed a slightly better performance than the MES1 system in the majority of the conducted tests, the MES2 system was selected as the CIE mesopic system.</p>
<p>The most important result of the CIE mesopic system is represented by the CIE mesopic table<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511426743">10</xref></sup> containing the values of mesopic luminances (<italic>L</italic><sub>mes</sub>) which correspond to selected photopic luminances (within the range of 0.01–4.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) for all relevant lamp S/P ratios. Although the CIE mesopic table is of enormous importance, the reference Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511426743">10</xref></sup> does not contain clear instructions for its practical application. The aim of this paper is to help lighting practitioners by offering another table, derived from the CIE mesopic table, which can easily be used. Although only photopic vision is involved with on-axis object recognition, this paper also offers a few important reasons for the practical application of the CIE mesopic system. The paper also presents some important effects of the application of the CIE mesopic system in street and roadway lighting, obtained as a result of an analysis of the potential electricity and cost savings when applying white light sources, which are more visually effective in the mesopic range.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1477153511426743"><title>2.1 Modification of the CIE mesopic table</title>
<p>The following three actions are needed to make the CIE mesopic system usable:
<list id="list2-1477153511426743" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Construction of a new measurement device able to measure mesopic luminances.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Development of new recommendations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Development of new professional software for road lighting design.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Meanwhile, lighting designers could continue to use the existing design procedures and measurement methods based on photopic luminances, emphasising that a new table is needed (let us call it the corrected photopic luminance (CPL) table) to take mesopic effects into account. For each of the relevant photopic luminances determined by CIE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511426743">11</xref></sup> CEN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153511426743">12</xref></sup> and IESNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153511426743">13</xref></sup> which will remain valid when the standard light source is used, the CPL table should contain photopic luminances for all relevant S/P ratios which create equivalent visual performance to the one created by the photopic luminance produced by the standard light source. Since the most common light source in road lighting is a high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamp, this lamp type will be used as standard (as proposed in Lewin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511426743">6</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>In order to produce the CPL table which can be applied by road lighting designers in all countries where CIE, CEN or IESNA documents are used, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153511426743">Table 1</xref> had to be previously prepared containing columns with <italic>L</italic><sub>mes</sub> values related to all of the photopic luminances existing in these documents, belonging to the range of 0.3–2 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153511426743">Table 1</xref> is made by applying the iterative procedure on which the CIE mesopic system is based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511426743">10</xref></sup> (luminance levels of 0.1 and 3 cd/m<sup>2</sup> were included because they were needed in order to calculate some of the values in the CPL table).

<sec id="sec4-1477153511426743"><title>2.2 Applying the CIE mesopic system</title>
<p>Since only photopic lumens are involved with on-axis object recognition, there are opinions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153511426743">14</xref></sup> that the minimum amount of photopic lumens, determined by CIE, CEN or IESNA specifications, is required for safety in situations such as when a pedestrian is crossing a street or road. Such opinions discourage the use of any mesopic system. Fortunately, there are some facts (presented below) in favour of the practical use of the CIE mesopic system.</p>
<p>The luminance levels required in the relevant specifications are not determined taking only on-axis vision into account (the influence of peripheral vision was also included). In fact, safe driving involves both on- and off-axis vision, usually off-axis detection followed by on-axis identification. The CIE mesopic system took this fact into account, ensuring that the reduction of the recommended photopic luminance level when using a light source which gives higher mesopic luminances does not seriously affect on-axis visual performance.</p>
<p>Although in the research presented in Lewis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153511426743">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153511426743">5</xref></sup> observers were asked to identify the onset of a slightly off-axis potential hazard, the results showed a considerable effect of the lamp spectrum on visual performance (the observers’ reaction time).</p>
<p>The detection of movement while driving is performed best by the rods, which significantly contribute to the mesopic luminances presented in the CIE mesopic table.</p>
<p>There are many references showing that peripheral vision is highly responsible for accident avoidance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153511426743">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153511426743">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>On-axis vision, represented by the V(λ) curve, assumes the use of the central ±1° of the eye’s field of view. This means that a driver will only view a pedestrian crossing a street or road by cones densely situated in his fovea if the distance between the pedestrian and the driver’s eye axis is up to 1 m for all longitudinal distances between the pedestrian and driver shorter than 60 m. It is expected that after detecting the pedestrian the driver will immediately direct his eyes towards him, passing from peripheral to central vision. However, the detection process itself, which is most important for the avoidance of an accident, occurs in the driver’s peripheral field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511426743">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477153511426743">Table 3</xref>, based on mesopic effects, was presented in Kostic <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153511426743">17</xref></sup> containing photopic luminance levels requested when HPS and MH lamps are installed. This table was made taking into account the results of Adrian,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153511426743">18</xref></sup> He<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153511426743">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153511426743">3</xref></sup> and Lewis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153511426743">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153511426743">5</xref></sup> Comparing the values from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref> for S/P = 1.55 (MH lamps)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511426743">1</xref></sup> with the corresponding values from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477153511426743">Table 3</xref>, it can be concluded that <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref>, derived from the CIE mesopic table, contains higher photopic luminances requested for MH lamps.

<sec id="sec6-1477153511426743"><title>3.1 Electricity consumption with MH lamps</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref> enables the evaluation of possible energy savings when standard MH lamps or MH lamps with a ceramic discharge tube (the former of neutral white and the latter of warm white colour, characterised by S/P = 1.55<sup>1</sup> and S/P = 1.25,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511426743">10</xref></sup> respectively) are used instead of standard HPS lamps. The reduction in the required luminance level amounts to 5.0 – 16.7% for neutral white MH lamps, and 3.0 – 13.3% for warm white MH lamps. Since the reductions in electricity consumption are lower than the corresponding reductions in luminance level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511426743">19</xref></sup> and the (photopic) luminous efficacy of an HPS lamp is up to 50% higher than that of an MH lamp, HPS road lighting solutions are more energy efficient even when the mesopic effects are taken into account. In addition, HPS lamps, characterised by considerably longer life (100% longer than that of MH lamps) and significantly lower price, undoubtedly represent a better solution for road lighting. However, it should be emphasised that the efficiency, as well as the maintenance and financial aspects, must not represent decisive criteria when illuminating places where people gather or places with intensive pedestrian activity. Such places should be illuminated by white lamps characterised by excellent colour rendering, MH lamps representing one of the best possible solutions.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1477153511426743"><title>3.2 Electricity consumption with white HPS lamps</title>
<p>In some countries standard HPS lamps are being replaced with colour-improved and colour-corrected HPS lamps (so-called white HPS lamps, available with a colour rendering index (CRI) ≥60). However, the photopic luminous efficacy of the latter is up to 20% lower than that of standard HPS lamps (for the same lamp wattage the road luminance level is reduced accordingly). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref> shows that the reduction in the required luminance level when white HPS lamps (S/P = 1.15)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153511426743">20</xref></sup> are used amounts to 2.5–10.0%. It can, therefore, be concluded that standard HPS lamps are more efficient even when the mesopic effects are taken into consideration. In addition, white HPS lamps are twice as expensive as the corresponding standard ones. Since both types of HPS lamps have the same lifetime, the maintenance cost is considerably higher in the case of white HPS lamps.</p>
<p>The above analysis has shown that white HPS lamps lie between standard HPS and MH lamps – they are more efficient and characterised by lower maintenance cost than MH lamps, but the visual effects achieved by MH lamps are definitely better (CRI<sub>WHPS</sub>:CRI<sub>MH</sub> ≈ 60:80).</p>

<sec id="sec8-1477153511426743"><title>3.3 Electricity consumption with LEDs</title>
<p>An aggressive promotion of LED technology, organised by leading manufacturers of LED luminaires intended for public lighting, reached its peak during 2010. The manufacturers not only emphasise the very long life of LEDs (50,000 hours is usually declared) and the very good colour rendering of white LED chips, but also attempt to convince the lighting fraternity that LED luminaires are significantly more efficient than the conventional (high-pressure mercury (HPM), HPS and MH) ones. Their ‘conclusions’ are usually based on overall effects of mesopic vision and the high luminous efficacy of LED luminaires.</p>
<p>In this analysis neutral white LEDs (with a correlated colour temperature of <italic>T</italic> ≈ 4000 K), adequate for street and roadway lighting and more effective than warm white LEDs (<italic>T</italic> ≈ 3000 K), will be compared with HPS lamps, while warm white LEDs will be compared with warm white MH lamps (<italic>T</italic> = 3000 K) – both are intended and adequate for ambient lighting. Let us note that the most efficient, cool white, LEDs (<italic>T</italic> &gt; 5500 K) are not appropriate for general public lighting.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref> shows that the reduction in the luminance level when neutral white LEDs (S/P ≈ 2.05)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511426743">10</xref></sup> are applied instead of HPS lamps amounts up to 23.3%, and up to 7.7% when warm white LEDs (S/P ≈ 1.65)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153511426743">14</xref></sup> are used instead of warm white MH lamps (S/P = 1.25). The corresponding reductions in electricity consumption equal 18% and 7%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511426743">19</xref></sup> Since HPM luminaires are inefficient (their replacement with HPS or MH lamps has been occurring all over the world for years), they were not included in this analysis.</p>
<p>In order to compare luminous efficacy of HPS and neutral white LED luminaires, let us start from the value of the luminous efficacy of commercially available HPS lamps of around 110 lm/W, and of commercially available neutral white LED lamps of about 100 lm/W (pessimistic for the majority of HPS lamps (especially those of higher wattages) and optimistic for the majority of LED lamps).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153511426743">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is shown in the reference ILE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153511426743">22</xref></sup> that during the declared LED life of 50 000 hours a lamp lumen depreciation factor of 80% (considered as standard at present) can only be achieved if the junction temperature does not exceed 70°C. Therefore, the white LED luminous efficacy, declared by the manufacturers for the junction temperature of 25°C, should be reduced by 10%, amounting to 90 lm/W, if the junction temperature of 70°C is assumed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153511426743">21</xref></sup> Note that very often it is above this value, causing a greater reduction in LED luminous efficacy.</p>
<p>It is well known that the losses of high quality LED drivers amount to 10%, and of high quality electromagnetic ballasts, which are generally used in conventional luminaires, to 15% of the lamp wattage.</p>
<p>Since the losses in LED secondary optics equal 10–15%, and in a high quality LED luminaire projector about 8%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153511426743">23</xref></sup> an overall efficiency of LED optical systems (luminaire light output ratio) amounts to around 80%. Since the optical efficiency of high performance luminaires with HPS lamps, including losses in both reflector and protector, equals 0.80–0.85,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477153511426743">24</xref></sup> an average value of 0.82 was used in this analysis.</p>
<p>The above presented data enable the calculation of the luminous efficacy of both LED and HPS luminaires:
<list id="list3-1477153511426743" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>LED luminaires: 90 lm/W × 0.80/1.10 = 65.5 lm/W.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HPS luminaires: 110 lm/W × 0.82/1.15 = 78.4 lm/W.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>However, more important information on the optical efficiency of a road lighting luminaire is represented by its utilisation efficiency, defined as the percentage of the lamp luminous flux which falls on the road surface. According to the reference Beka,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153511426743">23</xref></sup> where the k-curves of LED and HPS luminaires were analysed, almost 70% of the LED lamp luminous flux reaches the road surface, and only 50% of the HPS lamp luminous flux (it should be noted that at present the constructors of LED luminaires are requested to prevent a sharp cut-off (in order to increase vertical illuminances), which will cause a decrease of the utilisation efficiency of LED luminaires).</p>
<p>According to the above, the utilisation luminous efficacy of high performance LED and HPS luminaires (the ratio between the luminous flux reaching the road surface and the wattage of the luminaire), representing the best indicator of the luminaire effectiveness, equals:
<list id="list4-1477153511426743" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>LED luminaires: 90 lm/W × 0.70/1.10 = 57.3 lm/W.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HPS luminaires: 110 lm/W × 0.50/1.15 = 47.8 lm/W.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>However, there is another factor that should be taken into account: the luminaire maintenance factor, because the maintained values of the utilisation luminous efficacy of LED and HPS luminaires are directly proportional to the maintained values of the luminance level, which are (and not the initial values) what is requested by the relevant standards.</p>
<p>The luminaire maintenance factor is equal to the lamp lumen depreciation (LLD) factor multiplied by the luminaire dirt depreciation (LDD) factor. While the LLD factor for LED lamps is adopted to be 0.80, the LLD factor for high performance HPS lamps, determined assuming their usual lifetime of 16 000 hours (4 years), amounts to 0.94.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511426743">19</xref></sup> For a luminaire degree of protection of IP6X, which is (or is becoming) most frequently requested in urban lighting, and assuming a medium atmospheric pollution and a cleaning period of 4 years, the LDD factor for both LED and HPS luminaires equals 0.85.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477153511426743">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The maintained value of the utilisation luminous efficacy amounts to:
<list id="list5-1477153511426743" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>LED luminaires: 57.3 lm/W × 0.80 × 0.85 = 39.0 lm/W.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HPS luminaires: 47.8 lm/W × 0.94 × 0.85 = 38.2 lm/W.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The conducted analysis, although general and simplified, has showed that the possible energy savings when using LED instead of HPS luminaires, without taking into account mesopic effects, are negligible. The inclusion of mesopic effects proves that the maximum of the total energy savings in case LED:HPS amounts to 20%, showing that statements of LED manufacturers, such as: ‘only 25 W LED Street Light Cobrahead Module replaces 70 W to 100 W HPS’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477153511426743">26</xref></sup> cannot be considered realistic.</p>
<p>The following results, not deviating much from those presented above, were obtained by the National Lighting Product Information Program (NLPIP):<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477153511426743">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477153511426743">28</xref></sup>
<list id="list6-1477153511426743" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For collector roads (<italic>L</italic><sub>av</sub> = 0.6 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), on average, the LED streetlights require 1% (a staggered layout) and 10% (a single-sided layout) less power than the HPS streetlights, and for local roads (<italic>L</italic><sub>av</sub> = 0.3 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), on average, the LED streetlights require 6% (a staggered layout) and 24% (a single-sided layout) less power than the HPS streetlights.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Additional power reductions of up to 15% are possible for the LED streetlights under the CIE mesopic system.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Note that a similar analysis regarding the comparison of warm white MH and warm white LED luminaires (both convenient for ambient lighting) showed that the maximum energy savings when using LED luminaires, again without taking into consideration mesopic effects, amount to 10.7%.</p>
<p>The maintained value of the utilisation uminous efficacy:
<list id="list7-1477153511426743" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>LED luminaires: (80 lm/W × 0.90) × 0.70 × (0.80 × 0.85)/1.10 = 31.2 lm/W.</p>
<p>amounts to</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>MH luminaires: 90 lm/W × 0.50 × (0.84 × 0.85)/1.15 = 27.9 lm/W.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It can be noticed that in this case the energy savings are mostly caused by the fact that the LLD factor for MH lamps is lower than the one for HPS lamps (0.84 vs. 0.94).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511426743">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The inclusion of mesopic effects shows that the maximum of the total energy savings in the case of LED:MH amounts to 17%.</p>

<p>Until the mid 1990s most of the research in the field of mesopic vision was based on brightness matching. Since then the detection and recognition of moving objects has become more relevant. A lot of work based on a visual task performance resulted in the USP and MOVE photometric systems predominantly intended for street and roadway lighting. Considering these systems as two extremes, the CIE developed two versions of an intermediate system and, after broad testing, selected one of them as the CIE mesopic system. Its most important result is represented by the CIE mesopic table, containing mesopic luminances, which correspond to the selected photopic luminances for all relevant lamp S/P ratios. Since the practical application of the CIE mesopic table assumes new measurement devices, recommendations and professional software for street lighting design, this paper presents the corrected photopic luminance table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref>), which enables lighting designers to use the existing design procedures and measurement methods until all of these tasks are completed (only the requested photopic luminance level should be taken from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref>, where a high-pressure sodium lamp with a S/P ratio of 0.65 is used as standard).</p>
<p>Since only photopic vision is involved with on-axis object recognition, the applicability of the CIE mesopic system, which includes the effects of the peripheral vision, is discussed. A few important reasons in favour of the practical application of the CIE mesopic system are given. The system ensured that the reduction of the recommended photopic luminance level when using a light source that provides higher mesopic luminances would not seriously affect on-axis visual performance.</p>
<p>Using the data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511426743">Table 2</xref>, with an intention to help in the decision-making process, comparisons between HPS and MH lamps, standard and white HPS lamps, HPS and LED lamps, as well as MH and LED lamps, based on their effectiveness in street and roadway lighting, were carried out. The results, although based on a simplified analysis, showed that the possible energy savings when LEDs are used amounts to in street lighting are considerable lower than those declared by LED manufacturers. Therefore, the data regarding LED efficiency which can be found in their advertising material should not be taken for granted. Instead, when designing street lighting a techno-economic analysis is needed in each considered case.</p>
