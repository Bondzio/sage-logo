<p><bold>Background</bold>: In this study, we assessed clinical results by using a minimal extracorporeal circuit (MECC) and compared it to a conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures.</p>
<p><bold>Methods and Materials</bold>: From August to October 2006, forty consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG procedures were randomly assigned to either a miniaturized closed circuit CPB with the Maquet-Cardiopulmonary MECC system (Group M, <italic>n</italic>=20) or to a conventional CPB system (Group C, <italic>n</italic>=20). Clinical outcomes were observed before, during and after the operation. Besides evaluating the perioperative clinical data, serial blood venous samples were obtained after induction, 30 minutes after CPB initiation, 2h, 6h, 12h, and 24h post-CPB. The focus of our study was on myocardial damage (cTnI), neutrophil and platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and free hemoglobin.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Both the transfusion of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were significantly lower in Group M compared to Group C (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The levels of cTnI were lower in Group M at 2h, 6h and 12h post-CPB than in Group C (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). The values of aPTT in Group M recovered to normal levels after surgery, but were prolonged in Group C at early post-CPB and were statistically longer than Group M at 2h, 6h, and 12h post-CPB (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The concentrations of free hemoglobin in Group C were higher than in Group M during and post-CPB, and there was a statistical difference at 2h post-CPB (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: In conclusion, the MECC system is a safe alternative for patients who undertake extracorporeal circulation (ECC) for CABG surgery. Lower transfusion requirements and less damage to red cells may further promote the use of MECC systems, especially in higher risk patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite improvements in perfusion and cardiac surgery techniques, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is still a major cause of triggering the whole body inflammatory response and deteriorated coagulation that may lead to organ injury postoperatively due to blood-artificial material surface and blood-air contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111424636">1</xref></sup>. Since the 1990s, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) has been advocated widely in place of CPB and has achieved better clinical results. Early reports in the literature suggested that, compared with on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), OPCABG could preserve the left ventricular contractility and reduce the incidence of perioperative infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111424636">3</xref></sup>. However, more recent research demonstrated explicitly that the graft patency rate was significantly lower at three months in the OPCABG group than in the on-pump CABG group and that this difference might have implications with respect to the long-term outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111424636">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, a CPB technique based on minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) was successfully used in CABG and aortic valve replacements to minimize the detrimental effects of extracorporeal circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111424636">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659111424636">8</xref></sup>. Minimal extracorporeal circulation was shown to provide hemodynamic stability, together with an extensive biocompatibility ensured by the complete coating of the CPB system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111424636">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111424636">10</xref></sup>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effects of the MECC system in higher risk patients versus standard CPB in lower risk patients undergoing CABG procedures.</p>

<title>Patient selection</title>
<p>From August to October 2006, forty consecutive patients referred to our institution for a CABG procedure were randomized either to the standard CPB (Group C, n=20) or to the MECC system (Group M, n=20). Before surgery, all patients were evaluated by the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital. Written consent of the patients to be included in the study was obtained. Exclusion criteria included emergency operation, redo procedure, combined procedure (double valve surgery, or vascular surgery), and interatrial or interventricular septal defect. Demographic data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111424636">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Anesthesia</title>
<p>The anesthesia protocol was standardized for all patients. It consisted of intravenous anesthesia with a propofol infusion at 3 mg/kg/h combined with remifentanylat 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/min. Skeletal muscle relaxation was achieved by 0.1–0.15 mg/kg pancuronium, and the lungs were ventilated to normocapnia with air and oxygen. Standard monitoring was established. In addition to peripheral venous lines, all patients received a central venous line and a radial artery line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267659111424636">
<title>CPB setup and surgery procedure</title>
<p>The patients were randomly divided into two groups according to the different CPB setup and operative technique employed:</p>
<p>(1) CABG with conventional CPB (Group C, n=20).</p>
<p>The extracorporeal circuit of the conventional ECC consisted of an open, hard reservoir (an oxygenator system coated with trillium (Affinity<sup>@</sup> NT 541T, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), an arterial filter (Flyer, Ningbo, China) (filter surface area 840cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup>) and a table line (3/8 in: 200 cm) with a non-heparin-coated tubing system. A two-staged cannula (Medtronic Inc.) to drain the venous blood from the right atrium, and a DLP 77424 24 F aortic cannula (Medtronic Inc.) for the distal ascending aorta were used. The open oxygenator system was primed with 1000 ml Plasma-Lyte A (Baxter, Shanghai, China) and 500 ml hydroxyethyl starch (Fresenius Kabi, Beijing, China). Heparin (4000 unit) was added to the prime volume. A non-pulsatile roller pump (Stockert-Shiley, Munich, Germany) established a blood flow of 2.4-2.6 L/min/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup>. Minimal rectal temperature was 29-30°C. The left and right heart blood was withdrawn by the left vent and the right vent and collected into a reservoir. During aorta cross-clamping, patients in Group C had cardioplegia arrest induced by 32°C blood cardioplegia and maintained by intermittent high-potassium ([K<sup>+</sup>]=20mol/L), cold (4°C) blood institutional cardioplegia without any enrichment that was reinfused every 30 minutes. The route of delivery was exclusively antegrade. The initial dose of cardioplegia was 15ml/kg of body weight and each subsequent dose was half of the initial dose. Blood was saved and collected in an open cardiotomy reservoir and transfused back to the patient. The shed mediastinal blood was processed by a cell saver (Jingjing 2000, Beijing, China) for all the patients. Heparin was administrated (400 u/kg) after harvesting the bypass grafts (activated clotting time (ACT) &gt;750s). The reason for maintaining ACT&gt;750 is the use of a high-dose antifibrinolytic treatment with aprotinin (5million KIU) during CPB.</p>
<p>(2) CABG with MECC-system (Group M, n=20).</p>
<p>The MECC is a closed oxygenator system without contact of blood with air. The components of the system included a coated membrane oxygenator (Quadrox D, Maquet, Hirrlingen, Germany), a centrifugal pump (Rotaflow, Maquet), an arterial filter (Maquet) (filter surface area 580cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup>), a table line (3/8 in: 180 cm), a venous two-stage cannula (32-40 F), and an aortic cannula (21 F), as well as a 1000-ml closed bag with sodium chloride. The bag was used to prime the whole system and to substitute volume during CPB. No venous open reservoir was used. The left vent was used only when the heart was completely closed, while the right vent was used during the cross-clamp time. The left and right heart blood was withdrawn via the left vent and the right vent and collected into a cell-saver and a vacuum bag, respectively. Then it was directly reinfused into the patient through the venous cannula. Clamping off the vacuum bag also was used to deair when air was in the venous line. A left ventricular vent was implanted into the ascending aorta. A pO<sub>2</sub> sensor was integrated into the arterial line. The tubing set was pre-connected and completely coated with heparin. Therefore, the dose of heparin was reduced to 150u/kg and an ACT of 250-300s was deemed sufficient. The MECC system was primed with 300 ml of Plasma-Lyte A and 300 ml hydroxyethyl starch. No heparin was added to the prime volume. Minimal rectal temperature was 32-33°C. The patients in Group M had their cardioplegia arrest maintained by intermittent high-potassium ([K<sup>+</sup>] =20mol/L), warm (32°C) blood institutional cardioplegia that was reinfused every 20 minutes. The route of delivery was exclusively antegrade. The initial dose of cardioplegia was 15ml/kg of body weight and each subsequent dose was half of the initial dose. Blood was preserved only with a cell saver.</p>

<title>Blood sampling and biochemical measurements</title>
<p>Clinical outcomes were observed before and during the operation and postoperatively. Besides evaluation of perioperative clinical data, serial blood venous samples were retrieved for both groups after induction, thirty minutes after CPB initiation, 2h, 6h, 12h, and 24h post-CPB. The focus of our study was on myocardial damage (cTnI), neutrophil and platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and free hemoglobin.</p>

<sec id="section7-0267659111424636">
<title>Statistic data analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Normal distribution was assessed by Lilliefors Modification of the Kolmogorov—Smirnov test.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Routine CABG surgery with CPB is widely accepted as an established, safe and effective procedure for coronary revascularization. However, CPB triggers whole body systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to contact between blood and artificial surfaces, leading to complement activation and the release of several cytokines and vasoactive substances that consecutively promote bleeding, thromboembolism, and endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111424636">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111424636">12</xref></sup>. The principle reason for the development of SIRS is the contact between blood and the artificial surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111424636">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659111424636">14</xref></sup>. Various anti-SIRS strategies have been utilized during CPB without discovering an ideal option. Theoretically, the best way to achieve improved clinical results is by avoiding or minimizing CPB circuits. The MECC system may provide a possible option for clinicians to minimize surface contact between blood and artificial products, resulting in better clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>In this prospective and randomized study, we found that cTnI levels were significantly lower in Group M at 2h, 6h and 12h post-CPB than in Group C. This may indicate that use of the MECC system may result in less myocardial injury compared to the regular CPB system. Our results agree with other clinical studies testifying that the MECC system could decrease myocardial tissue injury during bypass surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424636">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111424636">16</xref></sup>. However, the strategies of myocardial protection in the two groups were different: in the M group, we used 32<sup>o</sup>C blood cardioplegia; in the C group, we used the 32<sup>o</sup>C blood cardioplegia induced and cooled blood cardioplegia maintained. The temperature of the blood cardioplegia was changed, so it may have impact on the cTnI results. In the clinical outcome, we also found that postoperative acute lung injury and donor blood requirement were lower than in the C group, even though we used aprotinin in the C group. As one of the most prominent adverse effects of CPB, it is well known that inflammatory cytokines are being activated when circulating blood leaves the vessel lumen and flows along foreign surfaces. During CPB, high inflammatory factor levels have been associated with ischemia reperfusion injury and may cause myocardial injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111424636">17</xref></sup>. By using the MECC system, the area of foreign surfaces is decreased in Group M compared to Group C; first, the significant reduction in the artificial surface area in the two oxygenators: (Affinity 2.5m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup> in the CECC group versus Quadrox 1.8m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup> in the MECC group), and the arterial filter surface area (Flyer 840cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup> in the CECC group versus Quadrox 580cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424636">2</xref></sup> in the MECC group). Also, the length of tubing is shorter in the MECC group, and there is no venous reservoir in the M group; the inflammatory effect could be lowered, causing less injury to the major organs. Further modifications concern the decreased need in priming volume, resulting in lower hemodilution. The cardiotomy suction reservoir reinforces the inflammatory response, not only by its additional artificial surface, but also by introduction of a blood-air interface. Finally, the pump type might also influence blood cell homeostasis. Several studies revealed advantages of centrifugal over roller pumps concerning red blood cell preservation and platelet activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659111424636">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659111424636">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Obviously, less hemodilution, less cardioplegia, less heparin, less red cell damage and thrombocyte function, along with blood cell preservation, may all play a key role in the reversal of anticoagulation following CABG and patient transfer to the ICU, where less blood products are needed to supplement blood volume. However, due to the small number of patients in each group, we could not find a significant difference between the two groups in the post operative results. Further research will focus on larger groups of patients using MECC compared to OPCABG and CECC.</p>

<title>Limitation</title>
<p>In this pilot study, with the small number patients involved and the use of different myocardial protection strategies in the two groups, this may have impacted on the results of myocardial enzyme leakage.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the MECC system is a safe alternative for patients who undertake ECC for CABG surgery. Lower transfusion requirements and less damage to red cells may further promote the use of MECC systems, especially in higher risk patients.</p>
