<p>This is a survey of recent approaches to eight different aspects of ongoing Pauline scholarship that will prove valuable to advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students and their teachers, indeed to anyone who wishes to keep up with the continually expanding world of Pauline scholarship. The areas surveyed are Paul and the Roman Empire, some perspectives on the Jerusalem collection drawn from a consideration of the economic world of the first-century Mediterranean, the opponents of Paul, Paul and ethnicity, the Law and Judaism, Paul and women, and finally, Paul and rhetoric.</p>
<p>Many of these areas will be familiar to those who have attempted to keep in step with advances in Pauline research, yet each of these fields of research is so extensive that there will probably be much to be learned by anyone from a careful survey article such as those in this volume. Warren Carter, in the opening essay of the collection (‘Paul and the Roman Empire: Recent Perspectives’) notes that impetus for his survey is due to the work of the ‘Paul and Politics’ group of the SBL which published its papers in three collections edited by Richard Horsley between 1997 and 2004, as well as the writings of other researchers. Awareness of the collocation of the Pauline mission within the world of the Roman Empire is not exactly a new discovery: one might cite as a pioneering example in the field the work of William Ramsey, British archaeologist and New Testament scholar, who published <italic>The Church in the Roman Empire</italic> and <italic>St Paul the Traveller and the Roman Citizen</italic> in 1893 and 1895, respectively. What may be of greater interest in the new perspective described here is both the contributions drawn from the wider field of classical studies and the sharper hermeneutical insights of post-colonial literary criticism to widening a perspective that invites the reader to understand Paul from a more directly political perspective than has been the norm in classical Pauline scholarship.</p>
<p>Steven J. Friesen (‘Paul and Economics: The Jerusalem Collection as an Alternative to Patronage’) draws attention to the relative scarcity of studies of Paul’s economic world (Justin Meggitt’s <italic>Paul, Poverty and Survival</italic>, 1998, being an honourable exception). An online catalogue trawl of books on Paul published since 1995 brought 250 titles to the author’s attention, but none included words like economics or money in their titles. Friesen sets himself three tasks in his chapter: firstly, to explore how New Testament scholarship ignores economic inequality, secondly, to assess the extent of poverty in the empire, and finally to consider the Jerusalem collection from an economic perspective, as an alternative to the model of patronage common in the Roman world. He suggests that the tendency of New Testament scholarship to ignore economic questions or to settle for a staid scholarly consensus is, in fact, ‘a sign that we seem to be dealing with an ideological orientation in our discipline that I call “capitalist criticism”’ (p. 30) which considers poverty as irrelevant to the interpretation of Christian origins. The author’s own work, neatly summarized in a series of tables, invites future interpreters of Paul to take greater account of his economic world when trying to understand his ongoing relevance for the contemporary reader, and perhaps even more especially for the contemporary Church. Jerry Sumney’s contribution (‘Paul and his Opponents: The Search’) traces the history of attempts to identify the opponents of Paul from FC Bauer in the mid-19th century to the present. It might be a limitation of this chapter in a collection devoted to Paul that most of the argument is based on Colossians, a letter whose Pauline authenticity is disputed. Even if he comes to no clear conclusions himself, Sumney highlights some methodological weaknesses in earlier attempts to identify the opponents. Warren Carter (‘Paul and Ethnicity: A Selective History of Interpretation’) notes how Paul has been claimed both by those who advocate ‘a new humanity’ and by those who try to stake out (for whatever motive) a Christian position on race and ethnicity. What is interesting about this study is how it uses the voices of Afro-American preachers and scholars as well as the commentary on Romans of Bishop John William Colenso, a 19th-century English missionary in South Africa. The question of Paul’s Jewish ethnicity and how it has been read by generations of interpreters is even more painfully foregrounded in the aftermath of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>No survey of Pauline research would be complete without some consideration of Paul and the Law. Andrew Das (‘Paul and the Law: Pressure Points in the Debate’) delivers it here. In his chapter, he isolates seven ‘pressure points.’ The first and perhaps foundational to the whole debate is the continuing relevance of E.P. Sanders’s ground-breaking thesis that Second Temple Judaism was founded on ‘covenantal nomism’ (observance of the Law is a response to the gracious offer of God’s grace in the covenant) rather than a fear-filled legalism. Associated with this are related issues—was Paul’s main argument with Judaism about legalism? What is the meaning of the ‘works of the Law’? And indeed, what is the range of semantic meanings of the Greek term <italic>nomos</italic> (usually translated, but not always correctly, as ‘law’)? This in turn raises the question, still based on Sanders’s seminal work, of how best to construe Paul’s relationship to Judaism. It is here addressed by Mark D. Nanos (‘Paul and Judaism: Why Not Paul’s Judaism?’). Deborah Krause takes up the now familiar topic of ‘Paul and Women: Telling Women to Shut Up is More Complicated than You Think.’ She begins with the observation that this most important development in critical Pauline scholarship ‘is defunct.’ Elizabeth Schüssler-Forenza’s pioneering study (<italic>In Memory of Her</italic>, 1983) reset the agenda by calling for critical scholarship’s reclaiming of the hidden history of women. Having sketched some of the main contributions to the debate, Krause then sets out to explore the question of women’s speech in 1 Corinthians 14:34–36 and in the post-Pauline 1 Timothy 2: 8–15. She approaches the question initially from the perspective of classical studies and what can be found there about a common assumption in the broad Graeco-Roman cultural world that women’s religious experience was prone to excess and hysteria, and that early Christianity showed some evidence that it shared such a perspective. Deeper grappling with these texts requires the application of a rhetorical methodology that might enable the real agenda to emerge. Our two texts may be addressing quite different issues. Corinthians reveals less the prohibition of women’s speech and more the tense negotiation of women’s leadership and presence within the church, while Timothy is about a leader of the church attempting to constrain an activity that is already on the loose and reveals not women cowering submissively at home, but a contentious community with competing claims to leadership and religious authority of which women were a vital part (p. 172).</p>
<p>As Krause’s chapter has shown, the study of New Testament rhetoric has passed beyond the mere application of models and methods of discourse to New Testament texts to an engagement with the more explicit concerns of post-modern literary theory. This tension is central to the chapter by Mark Given (‘Paul and Rhetoric: A <italic>Sophos</italic> in the Kingdom of God’). Given is also the general editor of the volume. Pauline rhetoric has been a concern, if more understated, in several chapters in this collection, often using post-modern rhetorical criticism as an adjunct to their principal methodology. Given begins by tracing the history of the method from Hans-Dieter Betz’s application of the rules and forms of classical rhetoric in his pioneering commentary on Galatians (ET 1979) and George Kennedy’s handbook <italic>New Testament Interpretation through Rhetorical Criticism</italic> (1984). He then applies it to a surface reading of 1 Corinthians as a rhetorical unit. He concludes that Paul, in his ‘gospel of the cross,’ was a dispenser of mysterious knowledge and power of the benefit of humankind, but ‘his true identity has often been bound by theological, academic and rhetorical restraints: Paul was a <italic>sophos</italic> in the kingdom of God’ (p. 198).</p>
