<p>Büchler and Frey described the single dorsal middle phalangeal finger flap (DMF) flap in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469754">1988</xref>, to avoid the sacrifice of palmar skin associated with previous neurovascular island flap techniques. It still requires sacrifice of a digital artery, but only divides the dorsal branches of the digital nerve, preserving the main digital nerve, both to maintain sensibility and reduce cold sensitivity in the donor finger. Leupin et al. published a series of 43 DMF flaps in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469754">1997</xref>, describing functional results and donor site morbidity in detail. The largest flap measured 4 × 4 cm, with narrower flaps up to 6.5 cm in length, mostly confining the donor site to the dorsum of the middle phalanx, only occasionally encroaching on the skin over the proximal interphalangeal joint. They describe the DMF flap as versatile, reaching defects on the palmar or dorsal aspect of the hand from the wrist to the fingertip, and an ‘excellent’ option for degloved amputation stumps. They also comment that it is technically sophisticated, only to be performed by those versed in similar techniques, and that the donor morbidity should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>In this article, Qi and Chen have combined twin DMF flaps from adjacent middle and ring fingers, both supplied by a common digital artery, in a series of nine patients with injuries to the thumb (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and index finger (<italic>n</italic> = 3). This concept is not novel, and was first described by Hirase et al. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469754">1992</xref> (referenced by Leupin in their <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469754">1997</xref> series). The authors report good functional outcomes in the reconstructed digits, and low morbidity in the donor fingers, with a mean follow-up of 20 months. They took larger flaps (5.7 × 4.0 cm in the middle finger and 5.5 × 4.0 cm in the ring finger) than in Leupin’s series, creating very significant donor sites spanning the middle and proximal phalanges.</p>
<p>This is not a technique for the inexperienced; these are large flaps, creating significant defects on the dorsum of two otherwise uninjured digits, potentially compromising their vascular supply, and with a lot of dissection into the palm. The price of flap loss is therefore very high. There is also the possibility of creating scar contracture across the third web space unless the incisions are designed very carefully. The advantages of twin DMF flaps are that they can be performed under regional anaesthesia, and should require fewer secondary procedures than more bulky alternatives.</p>
<p>An injured index finger will often be excluded from a patient’s normal pattern of hand use, transferring immediately to a thumb to middle finger pinch grip. Many Hand Surgeons would consider amputation, rather than reconstruction, of a short, degloved index finger. Conversely, the need to preserve thumb length following injury is accepted widely; this is reflected by the variety of techniques available for thumb reconstruction, and there are many alternative reliable techniques that do not require microvascular skills, such as the pedicled groin flap. The use of twin DMF flaps to reconstruct a degloved thumb may rarely be indicated, but I feel that the donor site morbidity is unjustified in order to preserve a degloved, shortened index finger.</p>
