<abstract>
<p>Previous research has suggested that firms need to balance exploitation and exploration. Acquisitions can be used as a way to explore (i.e., develop new areas of technological expertise) or exploit (i.e., reinforce existing technological capabilities). This article examines acquisitions in the semiconductor industry to answer the following question: Under what conditions do acquisitions facilitate exploitation and/or exploratory activity by the acquirer firm? The authors posit that an acquirer firm’s ability to develop such exploratory innovation is a function of three key factors: opportunity available to the acquirer firm for exploration, ability of the acquirer firm to effectively assimilate and establish innovations in new technologies, and extent of control of target firm postacquisition. The results demonstrate strong support for the hypotheses indicating the benefits of target technological uniqueness and for the moderating effects of commonality between acquirer and target firms in geographic bases for exploration. However, the findings contradict expectations about the effects of mergers and suggest that merger enables the acquirer to engage in effective exploration. For exploitation, the authors find negative effects of target technological uniqueness and positive effects of commonality of geographic bases.</p>

<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310369939">March’s seminal work (1991)</xref>, strategy scholars have recognized that the exploitation of existing knowledge and the exploration for new knowledge are important activities for a firm. To successfully compete over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310369939">Abernathy, 1978</xref>), firms need to master alignment between the ability to exploit the value from their proprietary assets and the ability to adapt quickly to new opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310369939">Gibson &amp; Birkinshaw, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310369939">Huber (1991)</xref> said that long-term survival requires adaptation to the firm’s niche and adaptability in finding new niches for the firm; indeed, the case has often been made for a balance between exploration and exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206310369939">Levinthal &amp; March, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In the knowledge and innovation arena, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310369939">Benner and Tushman (2003)</xref> defined exploitative innovation as improving existing components and building on existing technological trajectories, whereas exploratory innovation involves a shift to a different technological trajectory. Firms pursue exploitation by learning from their experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310369939">Baum, Li, &amp; Usher, 2000</xref>) or by investing in internal research and development (R&amp;D). Exploration is pursued through investment in new external relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310369939">Beckman, Haunschild, &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>) and accessing ideas and knowledge from outside the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf &amp; Almeida, 2003</xref>) to complement internal R&amp;D efforts, a role in which acquisitions can be useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310369939">Ahuja &amp; Katila, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310369939">Bertrand, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a significant literature points to the use of acquisitions for exploration, they are used to further exploitation and to supplement internal R&amp;D efforts. Acquisitions of closely related firms may be intended to improve economies of scale in R&amp;D and, hence, innovativeness along existing trajectories. Furthermore, the selection of targets for acquisitions may be vulnerable to the same pressures for conformity that drive firms toward exploitative behavior. Firms typically recognize and absorb external knowledge close to their existing knowledge base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310369939">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>). Hence, even as firms may seek to expand their knowledge stocks by looking externally, the resultant search processes may be restricted to familiar and proximate areas. Thus, a combination of local search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310369939">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>) and historical capability endowments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310369939">Penrose, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310369939">Winter, 1987</xref>) may predispose managers to choose targets that are similar to their own firms and thereby reinforce exploitation.</p>
<p>So, are acquisitions a way to explore (i.e., an initial step toward developing new areas of technological expertise in the organization) or exploit (i.e., reinforce the existing technological and organizational capabilities)? Acquisitions can probably be utilized to both ends, so perhaps the more relevant question is as follows: Under what conditions do acquisitions facilitate exploitation and/or exploratory activity? Our article builds on previous research that suggests that acquisitions can enhance a firm’s innovative activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310369939">Ahuja &amp; Katila, 2001</xref>) by (a) distinguishing between the types of innovation—exploitation and exploration—that result from acquisitions and by (b) examining the conditions that facilitate successful exploratory and/or exploitative innovation.</p>
<p>From a learning theory perspective, we posit that an acquiring firm’s ability to demonstrate exploratory or exploitative innovation is a function of three key factors: First is the opportunity available to the acquirer firm, as determined by the uniqueness of the technological knowledge resources of the target firm. Second is the ability of the acquirer firm to effectively assimilate and establish knowledge, or its absorptive capacity, as characterized by the common knowledge shared by the acquirer and the target firms. Third is the effective control that the acquirer possesses to gain synergies and permit flexibility, as demonstrated by the mode of acquisition.</p>
<p>If exploratory strategies are intended to enhance competitiveness by extending the firm’s existing areas of expertise, then exploratory acquisitions should result in the acquiring firm’s developing innovative strength in new technological fields—specifically, those in which the target firm is focused subsequent to acquiring another firm. However, exploitative strategies should result in a strengthening of innovative performance along already-established technological trajectories. Our research evaluates these hypotheses by examining acquisitions made by semiconductor firms within their industry. We find that few firms are successful in pursuing exploration after an acquisition and that many pursue exploitation. Our results demonstrate strong support for our hypotheses indicating the benefits of target technological uniqueness and for the moderating effects of commonality between acquirer and target firms in geographic bases for exploration. Our findings contradict our expectations about the effects of mergers and suggest that merger enables the acquirer to engage in effective exploration. In the case of exploitation, our models demonstrate limited explanatory power, and we find negative effects on exploitative innovation from target technological uniqueness and positive effects from commonality of geographic bases.</p>

<title>Technological Exploration and Exploitation</title>
<p>Since Nelson and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310369939">Winter’s early work (1982)</xref> in the area of evolutionary economics, strategy scholars have accepted the view that innovation within a firm is often path dependent. An organization’s existing expertise is embedded in its past experiences and its resulting managerial processes, systems, people, and routines. These factors in turn tend to limit the direction and scope of the search for new knowledge. Firms exhibiting local search behavior will therefore tend to encourage exploitative innovation or build on established knowledge bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310369939">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>). Local search, of course, has advantages in enhancing the efficiency with which new knowledge can be identified, absorbed, and utilized, leading to some success for exploitation-oriented innovation strategies. Thus, if firms concentrate on doing better what they already do well, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310369939">Prahalad and Hamel (1990)</xref>, they are likely to innovate in the neighborhood of their existing competencies.</p>
<p>But what if a firm perceives a need for more distant or exploratory search? The path-dependent nature of a firm’s innovative processes, though enhancing exploitative innovation, may impede exploratory innovation. The development of organizational routines, dedicated resources, and capabilities appropriate for a firm’s existing technological trajectory tends to inhibit firms from seeking, recognizing, and assimilating knowledge that is technologically or managerially distant to the firm. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206310369939">Levinthal and March (1993)</xref> pointed out, innovation in the neighborhood of one’s area of expertise can lead to greater experiential learning while having “its own traps.” Local search may be preferred to more distant search not just when it is more productive but even when it is not, merely because it reinforces existing organizational power structures and managerial relationships, resources, and capabilities. Given an organization’s structural inertia, knowledge close to existing technological and market conditions will be highly valued, whereas more distant knowledge, though essential for exploratory strategies in search of new organizational direction, may lack salience and significance. Levinthal and March called this failure to access and utilize more distant knowledge “the myopia of learning.” Firms that wish to pursue technological innovation in support of exploratory strategies need to overcome this myopia.</p>
<p>Our evaluation of exploration and exploitation is based on the analysis of a firm’s core technological areas. The notion that firms have core areas of expertise or competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310369939">Prahalad &amp; Hamel, 1990</xref>) is well accepted. These areas of competence need to be built on and exploited to ensure the firm’s future success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310369939">Grant, 1996</xref>). The idea of core competency can be extended to the area of technology. After all, firms tend to concentrate innovation in relatively few technological areas, and it is generally accepted that technological expertise in these focal areas is important for firm success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310369939">Granstrand, Patel, &amp; Pavitt, 1997</xref>). In line with this thinking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310369939">Duysters and Hagedoorn (1998)</xref> examined areas of firm-specific expertise by identifying technological cores reflected by own industry patents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310369939">Song, Almeida, and Wu (2003)</xref> determined core technology areas for semiconductor firms when assessing the relationship of path dependence to learning through the hiring of experts.</p>
<p>Although researchers have utilized the concept of technological distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf &amp; Almeida, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310369939">Song &amp; Shin, 2008</xref>), our use of core technology areas unpacks the technological portfolio of acquirer and target firms and focuses attention on those areas most critical to their innovation agenda. These areas, by virtue of their significant contribution to firm innovation, represent a key resource commitment by the firm. Our study complements the literature that evaluates technological distance by examining these critical areas rather than overall technological profile. The next section suggests that acquisitions may help facilitate exploration and exploitation by acquirer firms.</p>

<title>Acquisition as a Mechanism for Exploration and Exploitation</title>
<p>Although firms internally develop much of the knowledge that they use to generate innovation, few firms possess all the inputs required for successful and continuous technological development. Organizations often turn to external sources to further fill their knowledge requirements. However, mere recognition of the importance of outside knowledge does not permit a firm to access and assimilate it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310369939">Cohen and Levinthal (1990)</xref> described the concept of absorptive capacity: the relative ability of a firm to recognize, absorb, and utilize outside sources of knowledge. More recent literature has shown that the effects of absorptive capacity vary. Investment in internal R&amp;D and development of absorptive capacity allows for the exploitation of internal knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310369939">Rosenberg, 1990</xref>). Absorptive capacity also permits better identification and harnessing of external knowledge through mechanisms such as acquisitions, alliances, and overseas R&amp;D labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310369939">Arora &amp; Gambardella, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310369939">Nicholls-Nixon &amp; Woo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310369939">Song &amp; Shin, 2008</xref>), thereby facilitating exploration. Initial approaches to absorptive capacity primarily relied on R&amp;D investment as a proxy; however, more recent research has offered different manifestations reflecting its dyadic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310369939">Lane &amp; Lubatkin, 1998</xref>), internal information provisioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310369939">Lenox &amp; King, 2004</xref>), or breadth of firm R&amp;D activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310369939">Nicholls-Nixon &amp; Woo, 2003</xref>). Supporting the effects of absorptive capacity on exploration and exploitation is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206310369939">Zahra and George’s (2002)</xref> characterization of the components of absorptive capacity—namely, potential capacity (encompassing acquisition and assimilation of new knowledge) and realized capacity (reflecting exploitation). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310369939">Rothaermel and Alexandre (2009)</xref> concluded that absorptive capacity enables firms to balance the contradictory pressures of exploration and exploitation and leverage ambidexterity.</p>
<p>Absorptive capacity influences acquisitions and innovations. Competitors often hold knowledge important for innovative activity, and a key mechanism that firms employ to obtain new knowledge and enhance innovative capacity is the acquisition of other firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310369939">Ahuja &amp; Katila, 2001</xref>). The path dependency of routines and capabilities tends to force internal development efforts into existing trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310369939">Dosi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310369939">Teece, 1986</xref>), and the difficulties of valuation and risks of opportunism make markets for discrete resources uncertain at best. Therefore, acquisitions of businesses are made to obtain entire capability sets that are relevant to exploratory and exploitative strategies. It is easy to understand how acquisitions can be used to reinforce existing technological expertise when the acquired firm possesses resources complementary to the acquiring firm. Furthermore, managers may choose to acquire firms that are similar because of a better ability to assess the value of the firm and the potential ease in merging the two businesses and achieving synergies. Managerial choice of target may also be subject to the myopia-of-learning traps observed in internal R&amp;D. Consequently, a firm’s acquisitions can easily become technologically similar to the firm itself, thereby facilitating exploitation.</p>
<p>How can acquisitions be used for exploration? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206310369939">Capron, Dussauge, and Mitchell (1998)</xref> showed how, in technology-intensive industries, firms use acquisitions within their industry to obtain resources to reconfigure their existing businesses. This result has interesting implications for the role of acquisitions in facilitating the exploration for new knowledge in an innovation-driven industry. The advantage of acquisitions in enhancing innovation derives from the fact that they can bring complete new routines into the acquiring firm, as well as the people with the technological and managerial skills to implement and incorporate these systems and processes into the organization. Hence, if planned carefully, acquisitions can help to overcome some myopia of learning and facilitate exploratory innovation by the acquirer firm in target firm areas.</p>
<p>When do acquisitions facilitate exploratory or exploitative innovation? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310369939">Almeida, Phene, and Grant (2003)</xref> suggested that the knowledge management process can be best understood by unbundling it into three distinct stages: The first involves the search for and identification of useful external knowledge; the second consists of the transfer of this knowledge to the firm; and the third culminates in the combination of the imported knowledge with existing firm knowledge. We posit that these stages have important implications and thus map to the three factors of opportunity, ability, and control by acquirer firms.</p>
<p>Effective search and identification of external knowledge in acquisitions is contingent on the opportunity made available by the target firm. The opportunity for exploration is demonstrated in the target firm’s technological uniqueness. Greater uniqueness will lead to more exploratory space and is therefore conducive to acquirer firm exploration. However, this uniqueness is likely to impede acquirer firm exploitation. The ability to transfer knowledge from the target firm to the acquirer firm will be influenced by the common knowledge base shared by the two firms. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310369939">Lane and Lubatkin (1998)</xref> suggested, a firm’s ability to learn from another firm is best understood at a dyadic level and is contingent on the similarity of the two firms. Greater common knowledge between the acquirer and the target firm will lead to better ability on the part of the acquirer to absorb the target’s knowledge, leading to acquirer exploitation. Ability will also act as a positive moderator on the effects of technological uniqueness on acquirer exploration. Finally, to enable effective combinations of new knowledge with existing knowledge and to lay the foundations for exploration by the acquirer, it is necessary to evaluate the extent of control that an acquirer can wield in the acquisition. Given the inclination of managers to search locally, lower levels of control are likely to be beneficial in facilitating exploration, whereas higher levels of control are likely to enable exploitation. We now present our hypotheses regarding the effects of opportunity, ability, and control on acquirer firm exploration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0149206310369939">
<title>Opportunity: Target Technological Uniqueness</title>
<p>An acquiring firm can alter its innovation trajectory, overcome the myopia of learning, and move toward exploring technologies that it has not pursued so far. However, these outcomes are functions of the nature of innovation conducted by the target firm and the consequent opportunity offered for exploration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310369939">Gupta and Govindrajan (2000)</xref> posited that the attractiveness of a source unit’s knowledge to other units within the firm is partially determined by the existence of nonduplicative knowledge. In the case of acquisitions, we expect nonduplication or uniqueness of knowledge in the target to be important in enabling exploration by the acquirer. If the acquiring firm is looking for a new strategic direction or an opportunity to find a new technological niche, it would be expected to acquire a target firm with one or more core technological areas that the acquirer does not possess or that were previously peripheral to its strategic focus and, hence, not part of the acquirer’s core. Only by providing access to largely unfamiliar knowledge resources and capabilities for the acquirer does the acquisition open up new technological directions for exploration. If the target firm offers relatively little technological uniqueness, the likely outcome of the acquisition will be a reinforcement of existing innovation trajectories. The acquirer firm may still gain new knowledge about better ways of pursuing existing technological agendas, but it is unlikely to broaden or diversify its competency range. We therefore expect target technological uniqueness to lead to greater technological exploration by the acquirer firm.</p>
<p>Target technological uniqueness can detract from the firm’s ability to engage in exploitation. A diversity of research agendas introduced by target uniqueness can dilute acquirer firm focus on existing technological trajectories. It can also lead to a reduction of R&amp;D funding for existing technological projects. Firms often face resource constraints that require managers to make trade-offs when allocating scarce resources to exploration and exploitation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310369939">Rothaermel &amp; Alexandre, 2009</xref>). Therefore, acquisition of a target with greater technological uniqueness is likely to result in limited resources for continued exploitation. We therefore expect target technological uniqueness to have a negative relationship to exploitation by the acquirer firm.</p>

<sec id="section5-0149206310369939">
<title>Ability: Common Knowledge Between Acquirer and Target Firms</title>
<p>Another factor influencing exploration or exploitation is the ability of the acquirer to assimilate knowledge from the target. We expect this to be represented by the common knowledge shared by the acquirer and the target firm. Research on interfirm learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310369939">Lane &amp; Lubatkin, 1998</xref>) suggests that common ground is necessary for firms to engage in interorganizational learning. Prior research on patterns of firm innovative behavior and interfirm knowledge flows has identified the important role of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310369939">Fleming, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001</xref>) and geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310369939">Jaffe, Trajtenberg, &amp; Henderson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310369939">Song et al., 2003</xref>). Firm ability to utilize valuable knowledge from external contexts depends on the context in which the knowledge is located—particularly, its technological and geographic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310369939">Phene, Fladmoe-Lindquist, &amp; Marsh, 2006</xref>). Technological proximity enables greater knowledge access and learning in alliances in the semiconductor industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf &amp; Almeida, 2003</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310369939">Tallman and Phene (2007)</xref> demonstrated that firms are likely to engage in greater knowledge exchanges when they are geographically proximate. Therefore, proximity on technological and geographic dimensions provides a degree of commonality between firms, permits better coordination, and appears to facilitate interfirm learning.</p>
<p>We expect these implications to apply to the relationship between the target and acquirer firm as well. Exploitative innovation is likely to be facilitated when the acquiring firm and target firm have overlaps of their technological cores. An increase in overlap of core technology areas between the acquiring firm and the target firm suggests a commonality in technological capabilities and understanding between the two firms. Greater technological overlap also raises the likelihood of a common technological mind-set of the engineers who innovate in these firms and similarities in the organizational systems and processes that support technological innovation and expertise. Common skills, shared languages, and similar cognitive structures enable technical communication and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310369939">Ahuja &amp; Katila, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310369939">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310369939">Lane &amp; Lubatkin, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, as firm experience and competence accumulate in a specific set of technologies, firms cease pursuit of new architectural knowledge, creating stable architectural knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206310369939">Henderson &amp; Clark, 1990</xref>). Overlap in technological cores between acquirer and target firms creates common ground on multiple dimensions—technological capabilities, mind-sets, and architectural knowledge. These commonalities are likely to improve the ability of the acquiring firm to incorporate the knowledge stocks of the acquired company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310369939">Grant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310369939">Kogut &amp; Zander, 1993</xref>), leading to exploitation.</p>
<p>How does overlap influence exploration? Studies on interfirm learning have pointed to interesting effects of overlap. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310369939">Ahuja and Katila (2001)</xref> find that postacquisition firms are more likely to have increased numbers of patents if the knowledge bases of the two firms are moderately different, neither very similar nor extremely divergent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf and Almeida’s study (2003)</xref> of learning through alliances in the semiconductor industry found that firms in general tend to access knowledge more from technologically proximate firms. However, when they use alliances, they learn more from technologically distant firms. These results suggest that overlap is useful to exploration but only in the presence of technological uniqueness—which offers the opportunity for exploratory learning. When the two firms have overlapping core technological areas (technological areas in which most of their innovative activity is concentrated), the target firm’s unique knowledge is more likely to be recognized as being valuable and more easily assimilated by the acquirer—its ability to learn is enhanced—than if the two firms did not have overlaps. We therefore propose that common technological knowledge serves as a moderator and positively influences the effects of target uniqueness on acquirer exploration.</p>

<p>The importance of geographic regions to local knowledge sharing is well documented. Localized knowledge sharing was common among geographically clustered firms in the steel industry in nineteenth-century England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310369939">Allen, 1983</xref>) and is common today in high-technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310369939">Saxenian, 1994</xref>) and more traditional industries throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310369939">Herrigel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310369939">Piore &amp; Sabel, 1984</xref>). Geography enhances the development of local networks that facilitate the transfer of knowledge from one firm to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310369939">Saxenian, 1994</xref>). One of the advantages of regional networks is that locational proximity reduces the cost, increases the frequency of personal contacts, and serves to build social relations. Professional relationships are often embedded in these social networks, which decreases the uncertainty and costs associated with acquiring knowledge. Given the presence of regional social networks, we expect that geographically overlapping firms will have similar knowledge bases (not just in terms of technology but also managerial, market, and operational know-how), making knowledge absorption and integration between the two easier, similar to the effect of common technological bases. The intraregional informal flow of information serves to build a common stock of knowledge in the region for innovations and sets the foundations for exploration through acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206310369939">Tallman, Jenkins, Henry, &amp; Pinch, 2004</xref>). The greater the geographic overlap between two firms, the greater the potential for existing informal knowledge flow and common understanding between the two firms, thereby facilitating better absorption of target knowledge and therefore enhanced exploitation activity subsequent to the acquisition. We expect the common geographic bases to facilitate better absorption of unique knowledge and therefore moderate the effects of target technological uniqueness on exploration.</p>

<title>Level of Control: Mode of Acquisition</title>
<p>Acquisitions typically involve differing levels of control, with acquirer firms taking different shares of equity and assets in the target firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310369939">Balakrishna &amp; Koza, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310369939">Chari &amp; Chang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310369939">Reuer &amp; Koza, 2000</xref>). This was evident in our study, with firms choosing to exert three different levels of control—acquisition of assets, acquisition of partial interest, and acquisition of majority interest or a merger. The level of control has differing implications for the potential to bring from the target firm not just tacit and codified knowledge but also physical assets, firm-specific systems and processes, and people with technological and managerial skills to incorporate these systems and processes into the new organization. There is evidence of a pattern in the level of control, with firms resorting to less commitment (through acquisition of assets or partial interest) in situations fraught with uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310369939">Hennart &amp; Reddy, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310369939">Reuer and Tong (2007)</xref> found that firms choose to make limited or toehold investments in uncertain situations and that these serve as a precursor to full investment once the uncertainty is resolved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310369939">Xu, Xhou, and Phan (2010)</xref> similarly demonstrated that when acquirers venture into new areas, they are likely to make toehold investments.</p>
<p>What are the implications of this level of control for the ability of the acquirer to engage in exploration or exploitation? Evidence points to the destruction of the innovative capabilities of the target firm in the postacquisition period in technological acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310369939">Birkinshaw, Bresman, &amp; Hakanson, 2000</xref>). A key reason for the loss of innovative capabilities is a loss of autonomy for the target firm, which results in lower motivation and productivity and a disruption of routines in the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310369939">Puranam, Singh, &amp; Chaudhuri, 2009</xref>). We expect the loss of autonomy to be directly correlated to the level of control exerted by the acquirer firm. The effects of significant control are most likely to have negative repercussions in the case of acquisitions for exploration. Because these targets firms offer unique capabilities, the acquirer firm faces greater uncertainty in enabling effective combination of knowledge. In such instances, reliance on levels of control that confer greater power for the acquirer and correspondingly lower autonomy for the target firm are more likely to damage the capabilities and routines that support innovation in the target firm. This in turn is likely to have negative repercussions for exploration. We therefore expect the use of mergers (and majority interest) to have a negative effect on exploration by the acquirer firm. In contrast, less complete firms of control, such as acquisition of partial interest and acquisition of certain discrete assets, will often serve as a toehold investment with lower loss of autonomy for the target firm and are therefore more likely to be conducive to exploration. For exploitation, similarity between the target and the acquirer creates less divergence in innovation routines and capabilities. In this case, greater control for the acquirer and lower autonomy for the target are less likely to create negative effects, owing to greater familiarity, similarity, and understanding on the part of the acquirer firm and, thus, fewer shocks and disruption of routines. In such situations, greater control may facilitate better coordination and knowledge combinations because the acquirer firm has access to the necessary knowledge assets. We therefore expect the use of more complete forms of control, such as mergers and acquisition of majority interest, to have a positive effect in exploitation whereas lesser forms of control, such as partial interest and acquisition of assets, to have a negative effect on exploitation.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses in the context of the semiconductor industry. This setting is ideal because it is an innovation-intensive industry and firms in the industry regularly pursue external linkages to bolster their technological capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206310369939">Stuart, 2000</xref>). Our sample of acquirers and acquired firms was compiled from the Securities Data Company’s Database on Mergers and Acquisitions, which offers a comprehensive listing of worldwide merger and acquisition activity since 1985<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206310369939">1</xref></sup> and has been extensively used in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310369939">Jensen &amp; Zajac, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310369939">Reuer, Shenkar, &amp; Ragozzino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206310369939">Villalonga, 2004</xref>). We compiled a list of every completed acquisition by semiconductor firms (henceforth, acquirer firms)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206310369939">2</xref></sup> of any U.S. firms (henceforth, target firms) from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2002.</p>
<p>Our choice of this period was determined by several factors. Trends in technological development of the semiconductor industry point to waves of start-up activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310369939">Saxenian, 1990</xref>) over different periods, with the second wave of activity beginning in the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf &amp; Almeida, 2003</xref>). The late 1980s also demonstrated a flood of equity investments by foreign firms in U.S. semiconductor firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310369939">Almeida, 1996</xref>) and the beginning of a tumultuous period of merger and acquisition activity by semiconductor firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310369939">Vanhaverbeke, Duysters, &amp; Noorderhaven, 2002</xref>) as established firms acquired stakes in innovative start-ups. January 1, 1987, therefore seemed like an ideal point to start our study of the effects of acquisitions on exploration and exploitation by semiconductor firms. Analysis of start-up activity demonstrates that although start-ups emerged around the world, 88% of the activity was concentrated in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310369939">Almeida &amp; Kogut, 1999</xref>). Our evaluation of U.S. targets therefore covers a large portion of the population of targets.</p>
<p>We use information on patent stocks and filings to measure knowledge stocks and flows. To do this, we examine the patenting profile of acquiring firms, pre- and postacquisition, not just in terms of the number of patents produced but also by their distribution in core technological areas. We define exploratory innovation as an increase in patenting activity by the acquirer, postacquisition, into technological fields not core to the acquirer but for the target firm. We define exploitative innovation as an increase in patenting activity by the acquirer, postacquisition, in its core technologies. Our study uses information on patents filed by the acquirer in the 5 years subsequent to the date of acquisition. Typically, the mean lag between patent application and patent grant is 28 months, or just over 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310369939">Popp, Juhl, &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>), which implies a required period of about 7 years between the last acquisition and the present date (5 years to observe postacquisition patent portfolio and 2 years to allow for the lag between application and grant). If we work backward from the current date, we can get an accurate representation of the patent portfolio of the acquirer firms by considering acquisitions completed up to December 31, 2002 (i.e., 7 years before December 2009). Because we use patent information to study innovative activity, we included only acquisitions where (a) the acquirer and the target had filed at least one patent in the 5 years prior to the acquisition and (b) the acquirer had filed at least one patent in 5 years after the acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0149206310369939">3</xref></sup> This resulted in a sample of 141 acquisitions.</p>
<p>To track innovative activity, we use patent data<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0149206310369939">4</xref></sup> from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database. We cross-verified these data with the National Bureau of Economic Research’s patent database. Patent documents provide data on the originating firm, geographic location of the invention, and technology of innovation. We use patent data to measure exploration by acquirers and develop measures of uniqueness and common knowledge. To ensure accurate assignment of patents to acquirer and target firms, we used information from Dataquest, a private research firm doing semiconductor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310369939">Almeida &amp; Kogut, 1999</xref>). Dataquest provides information on semiconductor industry firms and start-ups owned by larger firms and enables us to accurately trace and assign patents to firms. There are, of course, limitations to using patent data. Patents are only a partial measure of the production of organization knowledge. Thus, our measures of exploration reflect these behaviors within only the realm of articulated technological knowledge. Another potential drawback in the use of patent data is that patenting is itself a strategic choice; hence, all technological innovations may not be patented. However, patenting is actively pursued in the semiconductor industry—that is, every major firm in the semiconductor industry, regardless of national origin, has an extensive portfolio of U.S. patents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310369939">Almeida &amp; Kogut, 1999</xref>). Thus, patent portfolios, though not perfect indicators of the innovative activity of semiconductor firms, can be useful in tracking the innovation profiles of semiconductor firms. Our article also uses financial data on acquirer firms, as derived from the Compustat North America and Compustat Global databases, relating to assets, sales, and R&amp;D expenditures.</p>

<sec id="section9-0149206310369939">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>We constructed our dependent variables by comparing the patent portfolios of the acquirer in two periods, the first 5 years preacquisition and the second 5 years postacquisition, and noting the extent and direction of changes in patenting activity in their core technological areas. The first step in this process was the identification of core semiconductor technology areas for the acquirer and target firms. We compiled information on patents filed by the acquirer and target firms in the 5 years before acquisition, identifying the number of patents filed in each of the 20 semiconductor technology classes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0149206310369939">5</xref></sup> and the total number of patents filed by each of the firms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310369939">Granstrand et al. (1997)</xref> used a 3% cutoff (percentage of patents in a particular technical field to total firm patents) to determine above-average or core technological competence. Following this, we use a 3% cutoff to determine (one or more) core technology classes for the acquiring firms at the three-digit technology class level. We therefore identified core technology classes for acquirer firms as those classes that contributed more than 3% of total patents filed by the acquirer firm in the 5-year period prior to acquisition. Acquirer firms in our sample had multiple core technology areas, with an average of 3.59 core technologies. For the target firms, which are typically smaller firms with lower levels of patenting,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0149206310369939">6</xref></sup> we use a 20% cutoff to determine above-average or core technological competence. Thus, we identified core technology areas for targets as those classes that contributed more than 20% of the total patents filed by the target firm in the 5 years prior to acquisition. Target firms demonstrated lower core technology areas, with an average of 0.59; some target firms demonstrated no core areas, with diffuse patenting across multiple technology areas. However, many demonstrated a focus on a single technology area. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206310369939">Table 1</xref>, we present a description of the core technology areas observed in our sample for acquirers and targets.</p>

<p>To control for changes in acquirer innovation that could be attributed to general increases in semiconductor patenting activity over time, we follow the approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310369939">Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001)</xref>, who suggested rescaling patent counts to separate real increases from mere artifacts of inflationary tendencies in patenting activity. For each acquisition year in our sample, we calculated the total population of patents filed in the semiconductor technology classes in the 5 years prior to the acquisition and 5 years after the acquisition. The deflator index was then calculated as the population of semiconductor patents filed in the 5 years postacquisition, divided by the population of semiconductor patents filed in the 5 years preacquisition. Our index is similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310369939">Almeida and Phene (2004)</xref>; it deflates later levels of patenting and allows us to control for observed increases potentially due to the industry’s increased propensity to patent. Our dependent variables are constructed by dividing the change in patenting activity by the deflator index for the respective acquisition year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206310369939">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0149206310369939">7</xref></sup></p>

<p><italic>Exploration by the acquirer</italic> is defined as a shift postacquisition by the acquirer into technological fields not core to the acquirer but to the target firm.

Exploration by the acquirer was then calculated as the increase in the number of patents filed by the acquirer postacquisition (comparing 5-year post- and preacquisition patenting) in the target’s unique core technology areas, divided by the deflator index. A decrease in the number of patents is given a value of 0.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0149206310369939">8</xref></sup> Thus, exploration is captured by increased patenting activity by the acquirer, postacquisition, in what were the target firm’s unique core semiconductor technology areas.</p>

<title>Common geographic bases between acquirer and target</title>
<p>We first identified core geographic locations for both the acquirer and the target in the 5 years prior to acquisition. A location was identified as a core location<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0149206310369939">9</xref></sup> for an acquirer and a target if it had, respectively, greater than a 3% share of the acquirer firm’s total patents and more than 20% of target firm’s total patents during the 5 years prior to acquisition. We then used a count of the core locations that were common to both acquirer and target.</p>

<sec id="section14-0149206310369939">
<title>Level of control</title>
<p>Our sample demonstrated acquirers with different levels of control—acquisition of assets, acquisition of partial interest, acquisition of majority interest (more than 50%), and mergers. We had only one instance of acquisition of a majority interest in the entire sample and aggregated this with the merger group. Acquisition of assets was used as the base category, and two dummy variables were created: the first for acquisition of partial interest, assuming a value of 1 for acquisitions with partial interest; the second for merger, assuming a value of 1 for acquisitions involving mergers or acquisition of a majority interest. This variable is similar to part of the categorization used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310369939">Villalonga and McGahan (2005)</xref> in their analysis of alliances, acquisitions, and divestitures.</p>

<title>Controls</title>
<p>We controlled for other acquirer and target characteristics that may influence exploration and exploitation by the acquirer. Acquirer knowledge stock measures the total number of patents filed by the acquirer in the 5 years prior to acquisition. Target knowledge stock similarly reflects the total number of patents filed by the target firm in the 5 years prior to acquisition. Firm knowledge stock has been used as an indicator of firm innovative ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310369939">Oettl &amp; Agrawal, 2008</xref>). Because prior innovative ability is likely indicative of postacquisition innovativeness, size of the knowledge stock is expected to have a positive influence on exploitation and exploration. We controlled for six other characteristics of the acquirer that reflect a firm’s strategic position and inclination to pursue exploration and exploitation from acquisitions. We incorporated a dummy variable for foreign acquirers (1 if the acquirer was a foreign firm, 0 if it was a U.S. firm). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310369939">Almeida (1996)</xref> showed that foreign firms are more likely to learn from local firms. We expect this finding to hold in the case of acquisitions resulting in greater exploration. We also controlled for acquirer size, measured as a log of total assets in the year prior to acquisition, given that it may influence firm levels of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310369939">Phene &amp; Almeida, 2008</xref>). We incorporated a control for acquirer R&amp;D intensity, measured as the percentage of R&amp;D expenditure to sales in the year prior to acquisition. Larger and more R&amp;D-intensive acquirers are expected to be more able to explore because of the availability of financial and knowledge resources. Research demonstrates that R&amp;D expenditures are significantly correlated with patent output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310369939">Hall et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310369939">Mueller, 1966</xref>), thereby influencing both exploration and exploitation. We measured acquirer performance, the percentage of operating profit to sales in the year prior to acquisition. We expect this measure to proxy for the ability and intent of the acquirer to use the acquisition for exploration or exploitation. Poor performance may limit the ability of the firm to engage in exploration, given that it may not possess the necessary slack resources. Furthermore, in an effort to improve performance, firms may redirect limited resources to existing directions and engage in exploitation. Other acquisitions and alliances made by the acquirer firm offer avenues for exploration and exploitation; therefore, we control for the number of prior acquisitions as well as the number of prior alliances made by the acquirer in the 2 years before the date of acquisition. Because our study examines acquisitions over a number of years, we incorporated year dummies to control for possible unobserved time-specific effects and the effects of serial correlation. We created dummies based on blocks of 4 years: 1987-1990 (the base), 1991-1994, 1995-1998, and 1999-2002.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0149206310369939">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section16-0149206310369939">
<title>Estimation</title>
<p>Our dependent variables measuring extent of exploration and exploitation were constructed as count variables, constrained to assume only nonnegative integer values. Acquirer firms in our sample typically found it difficult to pursue exploratory innovation, as reflected in their limited movement into the targets’ unique core technologies and the small mean of the dependent variable. Poisson and negative binomial models are a well-accepted method of modeling discrete rare events, such as those observed in our sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310369939">Vogt &amp; Bared, 1998</xref>). In addition, these models are suited to studies involving patents and their citations, but they pose a number of econometric and measurement issues that primarily stem from the count nature of the dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310369939">Hausman, Hall, &amp; Griliches, 1984</xref>). Negative binomial models present an advantage over Poisson models owing to their ability to correct for overdispersion. In Poisson models, unobserved heterogeneity in the sample may result in a case of overdispersion, a situation where the variance exceeds the mean, causing underestimation of standard errors and an inflation of significance levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310369939">Hausman et al. (1984)</xref> therefore suggested using the negative binomial regression in the presence of overdispersion. We ran tests for the estimate of the degree of overdispersion (α) in each of our models and found that overdispersion was present in most of our models. These tests are provided for each model and discussed under the Findings section. We follow the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310369939">Almeida and Phene (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310369939">Beckman et al. (2004)</xref> and present the more conservative negative binomial results. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206310369939">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206310369939">4</xref> presents the summary statistics for our sample.</p>

<p>Our acquirers included firms with large knowledge stocks, such as Intel, Molex, National Semiconductors, Micron Technology, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, as well as smaller players, such as Xilinx, Zilog, Microsemi, and 3Dlabs. Most acquirers in the sample were extremely innovative, as indicated by the large average number of patents: 1,254. The targets included firms such as Broadband Technologies, QuickLogic, Wavephore, Paradigm Technology, and Comlinear and were typically those with smaller knowledge stocks of around 7 patents. Target firms in our sample typically demonstrated a small amount of exploratory space, with technological uniqueness averaging at 0.19. Acquirer–target dyads were more likely to share common knowledge based on geography (0.63) than on technologies (0.22). Many of the acquisitions in our sample represented acquisition of assets, with fewer instances of acquisition of partial interest (27%) and merger (17%). Symptomatic of the industry emphasis on innovation is the finding that acquirers had operating profit margins averaging 18% of sales,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0149206310369939">11</xref></sup> from which they invested 14% into R&amp;D. Only 8% of our acquirers were foreign firms, but all acquirers in our sample showed a reliance on acquisitions and alliances, with averages of 2 acquisitions and 10 alliances in the prior 2 years.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206310369939">Table 5</xref> presents our findings regarding the conditions that enhance exploration by the acquirer firm. Model 1 indicates the effects of our control variables on exploration; Models 2 to 5 incorporate the effects of each independent variable; and Model 6 represents the comprehensive model. The addition of each independent variable contributes toward increasing the explanatory power of our model. The comprehensive model has a pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .45, in contrast to the baseline model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .08). An examination of α and the associated likelihood ratio points to the existence of overdispersion in Models 1 to 5. The comprehensive model (Model 6) suggests that overdispersion is not an issue. We also ran a Poisson regression for Model 6 and found extremely high levels of significance for each variable, with an inflated pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .93—outcomes associated with overdispersion. We therefore present the negative binomial regression with its more conservative estimates for all models.</p>

<p>We find support for Hypothesis 1A in Models 2 and 6, suggesting that when the target firm has a greater number of unique areas of technological expertise, exploratory innovation is enhanced in the merged firm. Greater target technological uniqueness leads to an increase in available exploratory space, providing more opportunities to engage in exploration by the acquirer postacquisition. The findings are mixed regarding the effects of knowledge commonalities. The moderating effects of common technological knowledge (Hypothesis 2A) are not significant in Model 3. This result appears to substantiate evidence from studies of other interfirm learning mechanisms in the semiconductor industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf &amp; Almeida, 2003</xref>) that demonstrate that firms learn more from technologically distant firms in alliances.</p>
<p>However, common geographic bases (Hypothesis 3A) operate as a moderator and have a positive significant impact on the effects of target technological uniqueness on exploration in Models 4 and 6. Commonality of geography appears to facilitate the assimilation of unique knowledge from the target. Our hypotheses regarding extent of control are not supported. A complete acquisition of the target facilitates greater exploration than does an acquisition of a partial interest or an acquisition of assets, contrary to our hypotheses. Because we focus on exploration in new technologies within a particular industry, perhaps the extent of control exerted by the acquirer does not create detrimental effects. In summary, our results indicate that exploration may be facilitated by a foundation of technological uniqueness in the target, by geographic commonality between the acquirer and target, and by greater level of control represented in a merger.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0149206310369939">Table 6</xref> presents our results for exploitation by the acquirer firm—including the model with controls (Model 7), the models with each independent variable (Models 8 to 11), and the comprehensive model (Model 12). Our models demonstrate lower explanatory power for exploitation in contrast to exploration with pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of about .06. We find that technological uniqueness of the target firm has a negative and significant effect on exploitation by the acquirer firm, supporting Hypothesis 1B in Models 8 and 12. Greater unique knowledge at the target firm appears to detract from the acquirer focus on existing technological areas and so limits exploitation. The findings regarding the direct effects of common knowledge demonstrate mixed effects similar to the moderator effects for exploration. A common geographic base between the acquirer and target firms (Hypothesis 3B) has a positive effect on exploitation (Models 10 and 12).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, common technological areas (Hypothesis 2B) do not appear to facilitate exploitation. A possible explanation for the lack of support for Hypothesis 2B may be that acquisitions of firms with common technologies may be pursued with the motivation of eliminating competition rather than enabling exploitation. Another possibility is that because all firms are in the semiconductor industry, the underlying technologies in different sectors are similar enough that this measure fails to differentiate cases. Exploitation does not appear to be sensitive to the level of control, with limited differential effects of acquisition of majority interest or merger compared to acquisition of minority interest or acquisition of assets. Acquisition of partial interest is weakly significant (<italic>p</italic> = .08), suggesting that in exploitation, partial control may afford a slight edge in contrast to complete acquisition or majority interest. We find support for some of our control variables; for instance, targets with larger knowledge stocks significantly facilitate exploitation. This finding, assuming high levels of general absorptive capacity for knowledge across the industry, might describe the preferred target for exploitative learning—one that is generally strong but not necessarily similar. Acquirers that are larger and have better performance tend to be more prone to exploitation. The findings regarding target knowledge stocks and acquirer size lend credence to the arguments for a positive impact owing to scale economies in R&amp;D and scope economies based on complementarities between innovation and other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310369939">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>).The findings may also indicate that larger and more profitable firms have established innovation trajectories and so demonstrate a reluctance to deviate from them, a competency trap that leads to more exploitation.</p>
<p>We conducted several additional tests to determine the robustness of our findings for exploration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0149206310369939">Table 7</xref>) and exploitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0149206310369939">Table 8</xref>; specifically, three sets of robustness checks in each table). First, we dropped certain variables that demonstrated significant correlations with our independent variables and controls—namely, acquirer size, acquirer performance, and prior alliances of acquirer. We ran our regressions without these variables and present our findings for exploration in Model 13 and for exploitation in Model 16. Second, we ran the regressions without acquirer and target knowledge stocks because they may influence the effects of our independent variables of unique target knowledge, common technological knowledge, and common geographic bases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0149206310369939">12</xref></sup> We present these results in Models 14 and 17. Third, our sample consisted of 12 observations where acquirer firms had a net operating loss in the year prior to acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0149206310369939">13</xref></sup> An evaluation of the data revealed that these firms demonstrated a sales drop in the year of the loss but maintained their high R&amp;D investment, thus resulting in misleading figures for R&amp;D as a percentage of sales—in some cases exceeding 100% of sales revenues. We therefore ran our regressions without these 12 observations and present the results in Models 15 and 18.</p>

<p>Our results for exploration are robust across the three tests conducted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0149206310369939">Table 7</xref>, with consistent effects of the independent variables and the controls. Most of the results for exploitation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0149206310369939">Table 8</xref> are robust, despite some exceptions. Whereas the effects of target technological uniqueness (Hypothesis 1B), common technological knowledge (Hypothesis 2B), and common geographic knowledge (Hypothesis 3B) are robust, the effects of level of control (Hypotheses 4B and 5B) are less so. For Hypothesis 5B, acquisition of partial interest becomes more significant from its weak effect in Model 13, suggesting that it provides an advantage in comparison to pure acquisition of assets. Acquisition of complete interest or merger (Hypothesis 4B) achieves significance in Model 17, when acquirer and target knowledge stocks are not included. Knowledge stocks of acquirer and target are correlated with level of control (partial interest) and seem to suggest a predisposition for acquisition of partial interest versus majority interest or just assets. In the complete model, Model 13, target patents had a significant and positive effect on exploitation. Omitted variable bias—specifically target firm knowledge stock—may explain the significance of acquisition of complete interest in Model 17. The positive and significant effect of target firm knowledge stock merely shifts to acquisition of complete interest because of underspecification of the model. In general, our results demonstrate robustness for the effects of our variables on exploration and exploitation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data and findings reveal several interesting facts about how firms use acquisitions for technological exploration and exploitation. A review of our sample suggests that acquisitions are more likely to be tied to an exploitation strategy. Of the 141 observations, 77 instances resulted in only exploitation by acquirer firms, 6 resulted in only exploration, and 8 in both exploration and exploitation; the remaining 50 did not demonstrate either exploration or exploitation. Our findings regarding exploitation as a predominant outcome after acquisition contradict the current perceptions of acquisitions as a window to new knowledge and exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310369939">Benson &amp; Ziedonis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310369939">Ranft &amp; Lord, 2002</xref>); rather, they suggest a persistence of the myopia of learning through path dependence. Firms are more likely to innovate cumulatively—that is, in existing areas already engaging in exploitation. They are less likely to direct resources to take initial steps in exploration of new technological agendas, and they appear hesitant to move away from significant investments in established core technologies that have been cumulatively developed.</p>
<p>These findings may also be due to our empirical measures that compare acquirers with large patent stocks to targets with much smaller knowledge stocks, making it difficult to find evidence for exploration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0149206310369939">14</xref></sup> The limited number of acquisitions resulting in both exploitation and exploration suggest that the acquirers in our sample did not demonstrate ambidexterity in their acquisitions. Of course, they may have achieved the necessary balance by using other market mechanisms—for example, by hiring scientists and engineers to pursue exploration. The findings also suggest that acquisitions may be motivated by factors other than technological learning, as represented in the 50 observations that enhanced neither exploration nor exploitation for the acquirer firm. These acquisitions may have been pursued with a view to improving the market share of the firm or with the objective of gaining access to specific components.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0149206310369939">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results suggest that the independent variables contribute significantly toward explaining firm exploration but are less relevant to exploitation, after controlling for traditional variables such as size and R&amp;D intensity. We do note that the overall stock of patents belonging to the target firm is significantly related to exploitative learning; so, whereas our measure of overlap of knowledge may be less than successful, the overall innovative capacity of the target appears to be an important consideration in this case. Understanding how firm knowledge stocks influence successful exploration and exploitation requires a close look at the elements of opportunity, ability, and control highlighted in this study. Managers seeking to employ a strategy of exploration need to take into account these factors to maximize their chances for success.</p>
<p>A key feature of our findings is as follows: Not only is exploratory innovation enhanced by technological uniqueness of the target firm, but this relationship is also moderated by the sharing of geographic bases by the acquirer and the target. In contrast, exploitative innovation is directly impeded by technological uniqueness but still enhanced by common geography. Our findings substantiate prior research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310369939">Lane and Lubatkin (1998)</xref>, Mowery, Oxley, and Silverman (1998), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310369939">Keil, Maula, Schildt, and Zahra (2008)</xref> on the contribution of common knowledge and relatedness to effective learning in acquisitions and alliances. The moderation effect suggests that to successfully explore new technological knowledge, the ability to absorb and integrate innovative knowledge must be present, in addition to opportunity or access to innovation. These findings are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310369939">Ruckman’s research (2008)</xref> on acquisitions, which suggests that preacquisition research relatedness between acquirer and target supplements internal research, whereas unrelated research substitutes for internal research, although both have beneficial effects on postacquisition profits.</p>
<p>The importance of control in influencing exploration complements existing research that posits that postacquisition outcomes are driven by the choice of the governance mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310369939">Folta, 1998</xref>). However, the effects of control in our study are contrary to our expectations, suggesting that greater control is more important for exploration. They also appear to contradict research suggesting that control or integration may not be necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310369939">Puranam et al., 2009</xref>) and that market mechanisms may suffice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310369939">Gupta, Smith, &amp; Shalley, 2006</xref>) in place of acquisitions. Part of the explanation may be that we examined exploration within the confines of a single industry. Exploration in this study refers to the pursuit of new technologies within the semiconductor context. The arguments for greater autonomy and loose structures may be more relevant to even more distant exploration. Another reason for this finding could be that the level of control is an imperfect proxy; thus, it may be necessary to examine knowledge integration and transfer directly.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous studies, ours does not suggest that overall technological closeness (or distance) is the key to explaining interfirm learning. Research relating acquisitions (and other mechanisms, such as alliances) to innovation has typically examined a firm’s general technological stance. Our focus on innovation within the core technology areas of the firm adds an innovative dimension to the existing research, suggesting that similarities in areas of importance may be relevant to enhancing absorptive capacities. This study focuses on exploration that is interpreted as a shift in expertise toward the target’s core technology areas. Exploration of the first order suggests movement of the acquirer into new areas in the target’s domain. There may also exist a second order of exploration—namely, the movement of the integrated firm into technology areas not in the domain of either the original acquirer or the target. This may be possible through the unique combination of knowledge from the acquirer and the target, resulting in innovations in areas in which neither had previous expertise. We do not address this type of exploration in our research, but a possible extension of this project would be to determine the factors that contribute to second-order exploration. Another research issue not addressed here is that certain technological subfields in semiconductors may lend themselves to exploration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310369939">Kim and Kogut (1996)</xref> suggested that certain subfields are technological “dead ends” whereas others act as “platforms” for the movement into new fields. An extension to this study could be an analysis of specific technologies within semiconductors and their influence on exploration.</p>
<p>Our study has a number of limitations. Our focus on the semiconductor industry limits the generalizability of our findings on technological exploration and exploitation to other industries. However, this limitation and focus on a single industry may be appropriate given that we use patent data to determine exploration and exploitation. Industries vary in their reliance on patents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310369939">Levin, Klevorick, Nelson, &amp; Winter, 1987</xref>), and our measures, though appropriate for semiconductors, may not provide an accurate representation of other industries. Our reliance on patent data to construct our independent and dependent variables resulted in a sample that did not include any firms for which no patents were present either pre- or postacquisition. However, in the semiconductor industry, patenting is actively pursued by all firms to protect and demonstrate intellectual property, and firms that do not file patents are unlikely to have an innovative presence. Acquisitions of targets that do not have any patents in the 5-year pre- or postacquisition period may be for the purpose of manufacturing or marketing. A quick scan of the remaining observations provides face validity for this idea. We set decreases in exploration and exploitation to zero in our analysis given that our conceptual focus was the evaluation of supplements to innovative activity of acquirer firms. In a future extension of this research, we propose to evaluate the contraction experienced by acquirer firms in their innovation. Our study examined only U.S. targets acquired by semiconductor firms. An interesting line of inquiry could examine the acquisitions of worldwide targets and compare and contrast them with the U.S. findings. We use acquirer performance as a proxy for strategic factors that may influence the acquirer firm’s choice to engage in exploration or exploitation subsequent to the acquisition. However, these are imperfect proxies, and an extension of the study would be an evaluation of the content of public announcements of acquisitions and the inclusion of strategic factors constructed from this information.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>One of the frequent findings of research on acquisitions is that they are often unsuccessful. Studies show that an acquiring firm’s profitability is most likely to decline after an acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310369939">Ravenscraft &amp; Scherer, 1987</xref>) and that a large percentage of acquired firms are subsequently divested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310369939">Porter, 1987</xref>). Researchers have suggested one of the primary reasons for the poor performance of acquisitions—namely, the difficulty of integrating the two firms, including the challenge of merging distinct cultures and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310369939">Chatterjee, Lubatkin, Schweiger, &amp; Weber, 1992</xref>). Although organizational similarities may ease the process of postacquisition integration, organizational differences provide opportunities for learning and exploration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310369939">Puranam, Singh, and Zollo (2006)</xref> suggested that in acquisitions motivated by a desire to obtain knowledge assets, a high degree of postdeal integration may be needed. Integration helps acquirers use the acquired firm’s knowledge as an input to their innovation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310369939">Puranam &amp; Srikanth, 2007</xref>). Our study reinforces this notion. Common geographic knowledge and complete acquisition contribute to easier integration, whereas technological uniqueness provides the opportunity for exploratory learning. Although comprehension is necessary for exploitation through acquisitions, novelty and comprehension are needed to truly benefit from acquisitions in pursuing exploration.</p>

<p>Thus, acquirer firms were restricted to those whose primary line of business was reflected by a semiconductor Standard Industrial Classification code (including Codes 3671-3679).</p>

<p>We collected a population of 929 completed acquisitions by semiconductor firms of U.S. targets during the 1987-2002 period. For an acquisition to be included in our sample, both the acquirer and the target firm had to have at least one patent in the 5 years prior to the acquisition, and the acquirer firm had to have at least one patent in the 5 years after acquisition. In most instances in our population, the acquirer firm had patenting activity; however, many of the targets had none.</p>

<p>A patent is the grant of a property right to an inventor for an invention conferred by the government. It establishes the “right to exclude others from making, using or selling the invention” for a period of up to 17 years. A U.S. patent is granted for an invention that is “useful,” “novel,” and “non-obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206310369939">U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310369939">Almeida and Phene (2004)</xref>, we use U.S. Patent and Trademark Office technology class information to classify patents to semiconductors. The U.S. patent system classifies patents into broad technology classes that do not map easily onto Standard Industrial Classification codes. There are approximately 400 broad technology classes at the three-digit level. Our discussion with patent examiners indicated that 20 broad technology classes, encompassing hundreds of nine-digit technology classes, covered the entire spectrum of semiconductor knowledge and contributed to 95% of the innovatory activity in the semiconductor industry.</p>

<p>For example, if a firm acquired a target in 1995 and we observed an increase of 20 patents filed by the acquirer in the exclusive core technology class of the target, the exploration variable would assume a value of 20/1.94, which would be 10 patents (rounded to the nearest integer to enable us to use the negative binomial regression for patent data).</p>
</fn>

<label>8.</label>
<p>We chose to assign values of 0 for decreases in exploration and exploitation for two reasons. First, in conceptual terms, we are interested in how acquisitions add to the innovative capabilities of firms either through exploration or exploitation. Second, in terms of methodology, patent data are best modeled by negative binomial regression where the dependent variables can accommodate only nonnegative integer values.</p>

<p>Inventor locations were used to determine geographic location. Locations were identified at the state level in the United States and at the country level elsewhere. Our measure of same state/country as an indicator of physical proximity aims to reflect regions whose underlying sociology helps to explain interfirm knowledge flows. Of course, these regions may not naturally map onto political and administrative boundaries. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310369939">Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson (1993)</xref> demonstrated localization of knowledge flows at the state level and country level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310369939">Rosenkopf and Almeida (2003)</xref> posited that geographic proximity at the state level facilitates interfirm knowledge flows by reducing costs and increasing personal contacts. We therefore conclude that the state and national boundaries are a reasonable approximation for physical proximity.</p>
