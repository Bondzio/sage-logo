<title>American Fire Sprinkler Association (AFSA) Scholarship Program</title>
<p>AFSA was organized in 1981 and is a nonprofit, international association that represents open shop fire sprinkler contractors. It represents approximately 750 companies and individuals in the United States and other countries. AFSA promotes the educational advancement of its members, and wants to educate the public about the dangers of fire and encourage the use of automatic fire sprinkler systems. AFSA believes that thousands of lives and billions of dollars could be saved with the installation of fire sprinklers each year. Membership in AFSA is open to contractors, manufacturers, suppliers, and designers. AFSA supports a scholarship contest for high school seniors who are U.S. citizens or legal residents. Home-schooled seniors are welcome to apply. Students should fill out the registration form, read the “Fire Sprinkler Essay” about automatic fire sprinklers, and take the 10-question multiple-choice test (the number of questions answered correctly is the number of times the student will be entered into a drawing for a US$2,000 scholarship). A total of 10 winners will receive a scholarship of US$2,000. The scholarship will be paid directly to the student’s educational institution to be used for tuition and/or books for the fall 2012 semester. Winners will be contacted within 7 business days of the contest ending date and will have 10 days to respond and verify that they meet the scholarship contest eligibility requirements. Winners’ names will be posted on the contest website in May 2012. Entries are due by April 5, 2012.

Students may use books, calculators, computers, but all the work must be their own. Student solutions to the USAMTS problems are graded by mathematicians and comments are returned to the students. Participants in the USAMTS are eligible for various prizes, such as books and software. Students who score well on the USAMTS are invited to take the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), which is the second step in the process of selecting the USA Mathematical Olympiad Team.
