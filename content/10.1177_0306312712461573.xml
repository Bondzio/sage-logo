<p>This article explains how regulators use categorization, quantification, and labeling to change how corporations manufacture commercial products. The Food and Drug Administration wanted to create an incentive for manufacturers to replace trans fats by requiring food labels to disclose trans fat content. The Food and Drug Administration initially proposed categorizing trans fats as saturated fats and quantifying both substances with one number on labels, but industry actors largely favored quantifying trans fats separately from saturated fats. Industry actors argued that such an approach would show consumers which products had been reformulated to contain 0 g of trans fats, thus allowing manufacturers to market reformulated products as ‘healthier’ and rewarding investments in alternative technologies. The Food and Drug Administration ultimately decided to categorize and quantify the two fats separately, specifically designing the disclosure of quantitative information in order to encourage technological change. Thus, I argue that quantifying information on commercial product labels was not only intended to govern individual consumption but was also intended to govern production in anticipation of individuals governing their consumption. Regulators used their capacity to quantify as a means to govern industrial production.</p>

<p>This article explains how regulators use categorization, quantification, and labeling to govern how corporations manufacture commercial products. In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized rules mandating that packaged food manufacturers must disclose trans fat content on their product labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA, 2003</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312712461573">1</xref></sup> but by the time the labeling rules took effect in 2006, many manufacturers had already replaced trans fats. Many others did so soon thereafter. The major packaged food trade association estimated that 10,000 American food products were reformulated to replace trans fats from 2002 to 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0306312712461573">Progressive Grocer, 2010</xref>). Kraft, for example, reported that it spent more than 2 years conducting 125 plant trials just to reformulate Oreos and ‘invested’ more than ‘100,000 people-hours’ to reformulate 650 other products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306312712461573">Kraft, 2005</xref>: not paginated; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0306312712461573">Shelke, 2006</xref>). A Frito-Lay executive stated that reformulation efforts affected 187 product lines in 45 factories, cost over US$25m and required 7200 worker-hours, 243 analytical tests, and 25 consumer panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712461573">Eckel et al., 2007</xref>). Other manufacturers that replaced trans fats include Campbell’s Soup, ConAgra, Gorton’s, Heinz, Hershey, Land O’Lakes, McKee Foods, Nestlé, Ore-Ida, Pepperidge Farm, Sara Lee, Schwan Food, and Tyson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312712461573">Associated Press, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312712461573">Heinz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306312712461573">Land O’Lakes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0306312712461573">Nestlé, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0306312712461573">Severson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0306312712461573">Sosland, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The FDA only required manufacturers to list trans fat content on labels. The FDA never considered banning partially hydrogenated oils, the major source of trans fats, but it specifically wanted labeling to create an incentive for manufacturers to reformulate their products. Industry agreed that labeling could have this effect, but the key question became how to categorize and quantify fats on labels.</p>
<p>At first, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA (1999)</xref> proposed categorizing trans fats and saturated fats as a single substance and quantifying them with one number on labels. But manufacturers, suppliers, and trade associations argued in letters to the FDA that trans fats and saturated fats should be categorized and quantified separately. They insisted that the two fats had different chemical structures and different physiological effects. Moreover, these industry actors maintained that if the two fats were categorized and quantified separately, then labels would show consumers whether or not foods contained trans fats. Industry actors were already working on their costly and complex reformulation projects and argued that labeling the two fats separately would reward their investments by making the absence of trans fats visible to consumers.</p>
<p>The FDA ultimately decided to categorize and quantify trans fats separately from saturated fats. Manufacturers that invested in alternative oils could label reformulated foods as containing 0 g of trans fats. Thus, I argue that quantifying information on commercial product labels was not only intended to govern individual consumption but was also intended to govern production in anticipation of how individuals would govern their own consumption. Regulators designed quantification to govern production by creating a marketing claim that would highlight technological change.</p>

<title>Government quantification and government marketing</title>
<p>Quantification depends upon categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306312712461573">Busch, 2011</xref>). Categorical distinctions determine what will be counted or measured and are thus fundamental to ‘setting up the rationality … ascribed to quantified information in science, law, and politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0306312712461573">Martin and Lynch, 2009</xref>: 262). Government quantification and categorization projects can have substantial economic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312712461573">Bowker and Star, 1999</xref>). Examples abound: The metric system was crafted after the French Revolution as a means of regulating commercial exchanges, gradually expanding the reach of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312712461573">Alder, 1995</xref>). Sugar tariffs in the United States were the largest single contributor to the federal budget until the introduction of income taxes. Different categories of sugar were tariffed at different rates, so categorizing sugar became tremendously important to manufacturers and to the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0306312712461573">Warner, 2011</xref>). More recently, following the human displacements associated with Hurricane Katrina in 2005, local Louisiana politicians sought to certify higher population counts in order to qualify for more federal funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306312712461573">Fussell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312712461573">Krupa, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the consequences of categorizing, counting, and measuring, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0306312712461573">Theodore Porter (1995</xref>: 8) argues that quantification ‘lends authority’ to otherwise weak government officials. But how does quantification lend authority, particularly over manufacturing? I suggest that marketing is one mechanism by which quantification can extend the reach of government to encompass commercial products. Marketing shapes commercial interactions beyond the one-way distribution of information to consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312712461573">Barrey, 2007</xref>). Marketing, packaging, grading, and sizing make products comparable to each other, allow them to circulate, and create geographically dispersed markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712461573">Callon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712461573">Callon et al., 2002</xref>). Marketing allows firms to understand their products in light of those of their competitors and is therefore instrumental to product development, pricing, and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712461573">Cochoy, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306312712461573">Cochoy (1998)</xref> thus describes marketing as ‘the unseen spirit of both the market economy and economics’ (p. 218).</p>
<p>But marketing is not carried out solely by industry. Governments engage in marketing in many ways. Government actors regulate advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712461573">Cross, 2000</xref>), but they also act directly as marketers by publicizing policies, campaigning against unhealthy behaviors, branding cities, and selling candidates in elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312712461573">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312712461573">Buurma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312712461573">Harris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306312712461573">Johansson, 2012</xref>). Governments also engage in marketing by compelling the disclosure of information in advertisements and on packaging. The 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which laid the groundwork for the FDA, required the labeling of certain ingredients on packaged foods, a space not previously subject to American government intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312712461573">Carpenter, 2010</xref>). Government messages on consumer products are now routine – and routinely controversial – on items ranging from pharmaceuticals to credit cards to dishwashers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312712461573">Government Accountability Office, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712461573">Cochoy and Grandclément-Chaffy (2005)</xref> discuss the example of a French cigarette package, more than 50 percent of which is taken up by a government warning. They liken product packages to little parliaments where various entities, including government regulators, vie for consumers’ attention.</p>
<p>The communication of health information through government marketing – such as safer sex campaigns or the disclosure of nutrition information on product packages – appears to confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712461573">Foucault’s (1991 [1978]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312712461573">1982</xref>) idea that governance works by compelling individuals to govern themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0306312712461573">O’Malley (1996)</xref> calls this ‘prudentialism’: a mode of governance through which individuals are expected to responsibly manage risks to their health based on scientific facts. Federal nutrition information campaigns, for example, have been described as efforts to construct individual consumers as rational agents of their own health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0306312712461573">Mudry, 2006</xref>). Whether and how consumers actually use nutrition information on food labels is an open question that is continually investigated by market researchers and academic social scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306312712461573">Saulais et al., 2012</xref>). But the communication of information about ‘healthy lifestyles’ and ‘hazardous habits’ has been critiqued for devolving responsibility onto individuals, creating what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306312712461573">Greco (1993)</xref> describes as a duty to be well (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0306312712461573">Leichter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306312712461573">Michailakis and Schirmer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, I maintain that focusing only on manifest efforts by the government to distribute health information to individuals overlooks the other intended effects of those campaigns. American food labeling, for example, has historically aimed to shame corporations into manufacturing products differently by defining certain ingredients as adulterants and revealing their use to consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0306312712461573">National Archives, 2011–2012</xref>). The major packaged food trade association specifically described trans fat labeling as a way ‘to enable consumers to make [healthy] dietary choices … and to give manufacturers an incentive to offer those choices to consumers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312712461573">Grocery Manufacturers of America, 2001</xref>: 2). The FDA indeed wanted labeling to create an incentive for manufacturers to replace trans fats. But in order for labeling to have that effect, labeling also had to show consumers which products had been reformulated.</p>

<title>Empirical organization and methods</title>
<p>The empirical sections of this article are organized as follows: First, I discuss the 1994 petition for trans fat labeling submitted to the FDA by a health activist group called the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). Second, I explain the 1999 labeling proposal that the FDA produced in response to CSPI’s petition. Third, I analyze letters submitted by industry to the FDA in response to labeling proposal. My analysis of these letters examines industry actors’ views on the two parts of the label: the Nutrition Facts panels on the backs and sides of food packages and the nutrient content claims on the fronts of packages. My discussion of the letters follows the packaged food supply chain, including seed companies, oil suppliers, trade associations for oil and seeds, and manufacturers. I also consider some letters from academic scientists. Finally, I discuss the labeling rule that the FDA finalized in 2003.</p>
<p>Regarding the letters from industry, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA (2003)</xref> reported receiving 1720 letters about trans fat regulation. I retrieved disks containing those letters from the FDA’s Rockville, Maryland, offices. I read and coded all the letters and associated documents. As the FDA noted, most letters were from consumers, and most of those appeared to be form letters provided by CSPI. I counted 273 letters from industry actors, a category in which I include trade associations, oil companies and other ingredient suppliers, seed companies, manufacturers, retailers, and restaurants. I also counted 37 letters sent by academic scientists. I discuss the methodological limitations of these letters below. I supplement my analysis with findings from my interviews with a snowball sample of 40 industry professionals, health activists, academic and government scientists, trade journalists, and investors involved in trans fat research and replacement technology.</p>

<sec id="section3-0306312712461573">
<title>The activists’ petition: categorize trans fats and saturated fats together</title>
<p>Questions about labeling trans fats arise within the complex history of dietary fats in the United States. Roughly starting in the 1950s, medical authorities began to view saturated fats as harmful because they raised ‘bad’ low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312712461573">La Berge, 2008</xref>). Activist organizations in the 1980s, particularly CSPI, targeted food corporations for using saturated fats. CSPI and others endorsed trans fats as a benign alternative, a view shared by many contemporaneous public health and medical authorities. Nearly, all corporations targeted by CSPI responded in the late 1980s by replacing saturated fats with partially hydrogenated oils. Partially hydrogenated oils were not only free of saturated fats but were also a readily available alternative technology that fit easily into manufacturers’ existing products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0306312712461573">Schleifer, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>However, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a few academic scientists claimed that trans fats were actually more harmful than saturated fats. Oil manufacturers and trade associations vociferously disputed those claims, as did CSPI, but in 1990, a well-publicized study in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> demonstrated that trans fats too raise LDL cholesterol and also lower ‘good’ high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0306312712461573">Mensink and Katan, 1990</xref>). Trade associations and ingredient suppliers responded by funding a counterstudy at a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) laboratory that they expected would exonerate trans fats. But the industry-funded USDA study, published in 1994, also indicated that trans fats raised risk factors for heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312712461573">Judd et al., 1994</xref>). This industry ‘meddling’ in scientific research appears to have been a turning point, after which corporations began to abandon their defense of trans fats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0306312712461573">Schleifer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Citing an advance copy of the industry-funded USDA study, CSPI changed its stance on trans fats and petitioned the FDA for labeling in February 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712461573">CSPI, 1994</xref>). New federal food labeling rules were scheduled to take effect 3 months later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712461573">FDA, 1990</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306312712461573">Frohlich, 2011</xref>). The new rules, part of the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), created the now-familiar ‘Nutrition Facts’ labels on packaged foods. Under the initial NLEA rules, quantities of trans fats were not going to be listed separately on Nutrition Facts labels; instead, they would be categorized and counted as part of the ‘total fat’ quantity.</p>
<p>In its petition, however, CSPI argued that trans fats should be categorized as a saturated fat. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712461573">CSPI (1994)</xref> acknowledged that trans fats are chemically distinct from saturated fats, with different numbers of atoms arranged differently on their molecules, but emphasized that the two fats ‘share in common the important physiologic effect of increasing the risk of coronary heart disease’ (p. 4). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712461573">CSPI (1994)</xref> therefore proposed that ‘trans fat and saturated fat should be combined and labeled together in the category “saturated fat”’ (p. 4). Specifically, CSPI wanted manufacturers to measure the weight (in grams) of saturated fat and trans fats in their products, add those numbers together, and list the combined total as ‘saturated fat’ on Nutrition Facts panels.</p>
<p>CSPI’s petition also addressed nutrient content claims. Nutrient content claims are statements defined by the FDA that allow manufacturers to label a product as ‘free of’ or ‘low in’ nutrients such as saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, or sugar if the product has been specially processed to reduce or remove those nutrients. Under the initial NLEA rules, the FDA already limited trans fat content for products that made a ‘saturated fat free’ claim, perhaps indicating some incipient concerns about trans fats’ physiological effects. The FDA maintained that foods must contain less than 0.5 g of trans fats and less than 0.5 g of saturated fat <italic>each</italic>, per serving, in order to be labeled ‘saturated fat free’. CSPI’s petition argued that trans fats and saturated fats should be treated as a single substance for nutrient content claims and proposed that foods labeled ‘saturated fat free’ should contain less than 0.5 g of saturated plus trans fats <italic>combined</italic> per serving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712461573">CSPI, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>CSPI amended its petition in 1998 by offering two alternative ways to list trans fats on Nutrition Facts panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712461573">CSPI, 1998</xref>). The first was to add grams of trans fat plus grams of saturated fats and list that number as ‘saturated fat*’. The asterisk would refer to a footnote indicating how many grams of trans fats were included in the ‘saturated fat’ figure. CSPI’s second option was to combine the number of grams of trans fat and saturated fats and list that total as ‘saturated + trans fats’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712461573">CSPI (1998)</xref> argued that both alternatives recognized the chemical differences between trans and saturated fats but still categorized the two ostensibly harmful substances together, which they maintained would be easier for consumers to understand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306312712461573">
<title>The FDA’s 1999 labeling proposal: incentives to reformulate</title>
<p>CSPI’s petition did not suggest that labeling could encourage manufacturers to replace trans fats, but the FDA saw things differently. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA (1999)</xref> responded to CSPI’s petition with a proposed labeling rule. The proposal explicitly described labeling as a way to encourage producers to reformulate their products. How did the FDA envision that labeling could produce these effects? The agency wrote, ‘[i]f producers perceive that consumers will respond more negatively’ to the revelation that foods contain trans fats, ‘then the actual number of products reformulated will be greater’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA, 1999</xref>: 62782).</p>
<p>How exactly did the FDA want labels to display information about trans fats? The regulators rejected CSPI’s original 1994 proposal to redefine trans fats as saturated fat, describing that approach as ‘scientifically inaccurate because <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids are not saturated, i.e. they do not contain double bonds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA, 1999</xref>: 62755). The FDA instead favored CSPI’s 1998 amended petition: to add up grams of saturated fat plus grams of trans fats and identify the combined total as saturated fat*, with the asterisk referring to a footnote indicating the quantity of trans fat contained in the ‘saturated fat’ number. The agency illustrated the proposal with the following sample label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306312712461573">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>However, the authors of the proposed rule repeatedly noted their misgivings about categorizing two chemically distinct substances together. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306312712461573">Hawthorne’s (2005)</xref> observation that FDA staff pride themselves on being good scientists. The authors of the rule repeatedly requested comments on what they called their ‘tentative conclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA, 1999</xref>: 62755).</p>
<p>The FDA’s labeling proposal did endorse CSPI’s idea of grouping trans and saturated fats together for nutrient content claims. The FDA proposed that products claiming to be either ‘trans fat free’ or ‘saturated fat free’ would have to have less than 0.5 g of saturated plus trans fats combined per serving. The FDA maintained that this was justified based on the two fats’ ostensibly similar physiological effects. But, again, the authors of the rule strongly emphasized that their proposal was tentative, and they requested comments on whether it would ‘provide an incentive to the food industry to remove <italic>trans</italic> fats from foods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA, 1999</xref>: 62759).</p>
<p>In order to predict the effects of their labeling proposal, the FDA constructed models of how consumers and producers would respond to the new rules, including the various possible interactions between consumer and producer responses. Among the sources used to construct those models, the FDA mentioned Frito-Lay’s response to a request for information about reformulation. The FDA had asked Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo and America’s largest manufacturer of salty snacks, to provide a prediction about how they would replace trans fats in chips and how much it would cost. This consultation with technical professionals at a major firm, initiated by the FDA, indicates that regulators anticipated that labeling would change food production but believed that they needed advice from regulated entities.</p>

<title>Industry responds: make our reformulation efforts visible on labels</title>
<p>In this section, I discuss how industry actors responded to the FDA’s proposals for including trans fats on Nutrition Facts panels and in nutrient content claims. The FDA reported that after CSPI initially petitioned for labeling in 1994, most letters from industry opposed labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712461573">FDA, 1999</xref>). But corporate interests change: of the approximately 273 letters that industry actors sent in response to the FDA’s labeling proposal, only 6 opposed labeling entirely and the authors of several of those opposing letters subsequently wrote in support of labeling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0306312712461573">Schot and De la Bruhèze (2003)</xref> describe how producers redesign products in response to users’ behavior. Similarly, producers can redesign their products concurrently with the design of regulations. Although the FDA was not considering a ban, several industry professionals told me in interviews that by the mid-1990s, they felt that they would have to find some way to replace trans fat. One trade association leader told me, ‘we did not have any real problems going forward with a regulation that would put trans on the label just like saturates were on the label’. Specifically, he wanted trans fats categorized as a separate substance, just like saturated fats were.</p>
<p>Industry letters to the FDA show that actors throughout the supply chain were very concerned about how fats would be categorized. Of 273 letters from industry, I counted 175 that discussed how to categorize trans fats, including 164 that favored categorizing and quantifying trans fats separately from saturated fats. They reasoned that if trans fats were categorized separately from saturated fats, then labeling would create incentives for manufacturers to reformulate their products. Only 11 industry letters favored categorizing the fats together, and 1 letter discussed the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306312712461573">Grocery Manufacturers of America, 2000</xref>). Fifty-eight letters from industry specifically discussed product reformulation, but only seven discussed laboratory methods for measuring the amount of trans fats in foods.</p>
<p>I do not mean to overstate the significance of my tabulations of these letters. Some industry actors wrote more than once, and obviously many did not write at all. Trade associations represent multiple firms, but I do not know how accurately their letters represent the views of their members. I also do not know what happened behind closed doors, although the documents I retrieved from the FDA include minutes of several meetings with industry. Nor do I mean to imply that there was unanimity among industry actors. Trans fat labeling could be expected to benefit bigger manufacturers more than their smaller competitors. Several of my interviewees said that smaller food manufacturers tend to be more innovative, but that bigger firms have larger research and development budgets and more purchasing power to secure specialty ingredients like trans fat free oils. But the letters unfortunately do not reveal much about differences between large and small or public and private firms. Nor are they particularly telling about retailers, since only one wrote to the FDA about trans fat labeling.</p>
<p>However, the letters show how ingredient suppliers and ingredient trade associations tried to create markets for trans fat alternatives. Oilseed trade associations and seed companies had begun working on trans fat alternative crop varieties almost as soon as CSPI submitted its 1994 petition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312712461573">Gupta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0306312712461573">National Sunflower Association, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0306312712461573">United Soybean Board, 2009</xref>). Despite such efforts, there was no guarantee that growers and suppliers would plant and process those new crops or that manufacturers would buy the resulting oils. In fact, trade associations and seed companies had previously created prototypes of those very crop varieties but had failed to commercialize them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312712461573">Fehr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0306312712461573">Tarrago-Trani et al., 2006</xref>). Recall that manufacturers had been publicly chastised for their use of saturated fats in the late 1980s and probably did not want to get in trouble again over trans fats, but there was no guarantee that they would risk changing the formulation of valuable, established brands. In interviews, industry professionals told me that in the absence of labeling, they doubted that many consumers would be aware of or worried about trans fats. As one industry professional told me in an interview, ‘you’ve got a product that is selling well and people aren’t complaining about it, the last thing you want to do is make any changes’. The question, especially for suppliers, became how to design labels so that manufacturers would choose to invest in replacing trans fats.</p>

<title>Categorize fats separately on nutrition facts labels</title>
<p>Industry actors consistently argued that trans fats should be listed separately from saturated fats on Nutrition Facts panels on food packages. Few letters expressed doubt that trans fats had harmful physiological effects, but many raised questions about whether trans fats raised risk factors for heart disease more than, less than or the same as saturated fats. Only five industry letters explicitly doubted that trans fat were harmful. Three of those letters were from the major edible oil trade association, the Institute of Shortenings and Edible Oils (ISEO). However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712461573">ISEO (2000)</xref> argued that because of uncertainty about the physiological effects of trans fats relative to saturated fats, ‘there is only one rational approach that can be taken, and that is to define <italic>trans</italic> fat by chemical identity’ (p. 10). Moreover, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712461573">ISEO (2000)</xref> argued that the FDA’s proposal to categorize trans fat and saturated fat together ‘destroys the incentives needed to encourage healthful product reformulation’ (p. 17).</p>
<p>By the time the FDA issued its 1999 labeling proposal, Monsanto and other seed companies were already working on trans fat alternatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0306312712461573">Monsanto (2000)</xref> noted that ‘it would be scientifically incorrect to classify [trans fats] with saturated fat in labeling’, because trans fats ‘are not, by chemical definition, saturated fat’ (p. 1). Monsanto instead supported labeling that would allow manufacturers to market reformulated products as healthier, which they argued would encourage farmers to plant crops designed as trans fat alternatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0306312712461573">Monsanto (2000)</xref> wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>The food production and food processing industries have a significant interest in labeling of fatty acids with positive nutritional attributes, as new plant varieties and food formulations are developed. … In order for the industry to pursue these technologies, it is desirable that labeling options be available to allow recognition of nutritional advantages of food products offered in the marketplace. There must be an incentive for the investment in this type of development. (p. 2)</p>

<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312712461573">American Bakers Association (2000)</xref> offered a similar proposal for the Nutrition Facts panels, arguing that ‘nutrition labeling requirements which present trans fat as the “same” as saturated fat will … eliminate the existing incentives that have encouraged the substitution of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils’ (p. 4). Many other industry actors such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306312712461573">National Cottonseed Products Association (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0306312712461573">National Frozen Pizza Institute (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312712461573">DuPont (2002)</xref>, proposed virtually identical approaches. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0306312712461573">National Association of Margarine Manufacturers (2000)</xref> discussed its members’ ongoing efforts to replace trans fats but emphasized ‘the need to keep incentives in place for margarine manufacturers to continue to commit resources toward new technologies’ (p. 11).</p>
<p>Soybeans are by far the dominant oilseed in the United States, in terms of acreage and economic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312712461573">Economic Research Service, 2010</xref>). Of the two national soybean trade associations, both favored labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312712461573">American Soybean Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0306312712461573">United Soybean Board, 2000</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0306312712461573">United Soybean Board (2000)</xref> maintained that ‘one of the primary purposes’ of labeling is to ‘permit food manufacturers … to educate consumers about healthy dietary practices both through the nutrition label, the principal display panel <underline>and</underline> advertising’ (p. 2, underlining in the original). The United Soybean Board argued that trans fats had different physiological effects relative to saturated fats. They therefore objected to the FDA’s proposal to categorize the two fats together. ‘The proposed rule does not permit the consumer to readily identify that difference; does not permit manufacturers to educate consumers about this difference; and, will require a whole new re-proposal when the difference is, in fact, quantified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0306312712461573">United Soybean Board, 2000</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Palm and cottonseed trade associations and suppliers argued in letters to the FDA that trans fats were more harmful than saturated fats. The palm, cottonseed, and canola associations all wrote to favor categorizing trans fats separately from saturated fats in order to increase incentives for reformulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312712461573">Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0306312712461573">Malaysian Palm Oil Council of America, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306312712461573">National Cottonseed Products Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0306312712461573">US Canola Association, 2003</xref>). Palm oil has textural and structural properties that made it an especially likely alternative to partially hydrogenated soybean oil.</p>
<p>Walter Willett and a team of colleagues from the Harvard School of Public Health published the first epidemiological articles linking trans fats consumption to an increased risk of heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0306312712461573">Willett and Ascherio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0306312712461573">Willett et al., 1993</xref>). The Harvard team wrote several letters to the FDA arguing that trans and saturated fats should be categorized and quantified separately. They insisted that saturated fats have desirable physiological effects like increasing HDL cholesterol and rejected the implication that they should be grouped together with trans fats, which they viewed as completely unhealthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0306312712461573">Stampfer et al., 2002</xref>). Several of the Harvard team’s letters argued that categorizing the fats separately would create incentives for manufacturers to reformulate. However, ‘Combining <italic>trans</italic> and saturated fat on the label could well lead producers to abandon the attempt to rid their products of <italic>trans</italic>, opting instead to treat it as the same as saturated fat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0306312712461573">Stampfer et al., 2002</xref>: 1).</p>

<title>Disaggregate trans fats from saturated fats in nutrient content claims</title>
<p>Seventy-seven industry letters discussed whether and how to define a ‘trans fat free’ nutrient content claim that manufacturers could place on the front of food packages. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306312712461573">National Food Processors Association (2001)</xref> maintained that creating a ‘trans fat free’ claim would be ‘essential … to allow food processors to modify their food products and inform consumers of the improved nutritional characteristics’ (p. 2). However, the FDA had proposed grouping trans and saturated fats together in nutrient content claims. In order to make either a ‘trans fat free’ or ‘saturated fat free’ claim, products would have to contain less than 0.5 g of saturated fat plus trans fat combined per serving.</p>
<p>Many industry letters argued that if trans and saturated fats were grouped together in nutrient content claims, then products containing even trace amounts of saturated fat would be unable to make ‘trans fat free’ claims, and manufacturers would therefore be discouraged from reformulating their products. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712461573">ISEO (2000)</xref> maintained that a properly designed ‘trans fat free’ claim could ‘encourage reformulations’ (p. 19) but argued that the FDA’s proposed criteria would be too hard for any product to meet. The National Sunflower Association exemplified suppliers’ views on the ‘trans fat free’ proposal. Almost as soon as CSPI petitioned the FDA for labeling, the National Sunflower Association began coordinating growers’ and processors’ efforts to create a trans fat alternative called NuSun. The association maintained that ‘the domestic sunflower oil industry hinges on … NuSun and the importance of the availability of non-hydrogenated oil to the food industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0306312712461573">National Sunflower Association, 2000</xref>: 1). Sunflower oil is very low in saturated fat but not low enough to meet the FDA’s proposed criteria for ‘trans fat free’ claims. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0306312712461573">National Sunflower Association (2000)</xref> wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Removing the incentive of being able to make the <italic>trans</italic> fat free claim may discourage companies from even trying to alter their products to truly make them trans fat free. If they can’t make the claim, why bother? At the recent annual exhibit of the Snack Food Association, many snack food manufacturers visiting with [National Sunflower Association] staff referenced the proposed labeling and were interested in the benefits of NuSun because they thought it would help them make a claim. Under the proposed definition, that would not be possible. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0306312712461573">National Sunlower Association (2000)</xref> argued that properly designed nutrient content claims could ‘encourage the use of healthy oils in food processors formulations’ (p. 2). They favored ‘trans fat free’ claims that would be independent of saturated fats content.</p>
<p>Cargill staff met with FDA staff in 2003. At that meeting, Cargill reported market research findings that ‘consumers would pay more and perceive a product as healthy … when that product is labeled with a <italic>trans</italic> fat free, saturated fat free and no cholesterol nutrient content claim on the package front’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0306312712461573">Schrimpf, 2003</xref>: 1). Cargill also discussed the company’s efforts to develop canola seeds that would both replace trans fat and reduce saturated fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0306312712461573">Schrimpf, 2003</xref>: 1). Canola is very low in saturated fat, but Cargill noted that it nonetheless contains about 1 g of saturated fat per serving. The company therefore maintained that under the FDA’s proposal for nutrient content claims, manufacturers that replaced partially hydrogenated soybean oil with canola oil would be unable to make a ‘trans fat free’ claim. This would provide ‘very little incentive for companies making these types of foods to reformulate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312712461573">Cargill, 2000</xref>: 3). The Harvard group similarly maintained that limiting saturated fat content for foods claiming to be ‘trans fat free’ would ‘reduce the incentive to produce and market healthier’ products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0306312712461573">Willett et al., 2000</xref>: 1). They noted that olive, corn, and soybean oils all contain enough saturated fat that any food made with them would ‘be restricted from using the “trans fat free” claim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0306312712461573">Willett et al., 2000</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>In 2003, a small health activist organization sued Kraft, then the largest food company headquartered in the United States, for manufacturing products containing trans fats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312712461573">BanTransFats.com v. Kraft Foods North America, 2003</xref>). In 2003, the organization wrote, ‘As a result of the lawsuit, Kraft announced that almost across the board, it would eliminate trans fat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712461573">BanTransFats.com, 2003</xref>: 1). But Kraft’s letters to the FDA show that it had been considering reformulation at least since 2000. Kraft argued that trans fat content should not affect a firm’s ability to make ‘saturated fat free’ claims and that, vice versa, saturated fat content should not affect a firm’s ability to make ‘trans fat free’ claims. Kraft completed reformulating its products in 2005, a year before labeling took effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306312712461573">Kraft, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Limits to the visibility of trans fats</title>
<p>There were limits to the extent to which industry actors sought visibility for trans fats on labels. When the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312712461573">FDA (2002)</xref> proposed including a cautionary footnote on labels that would have read ‘Intake of <italic>trans</italic> fats should be as low as possible’ (p. 69172), only two industry actors favored it: the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712461573">American Palm Oil Council (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312712461573">DuPont (2002)</xref>, whose seed division was developing a soybean variety to be used as a trans fat alternative. All others strongly opposed it. As the Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturers’ Association wrote, the cautionary footnote would create a ‘disincentive for manufacturers to make incremental changes in formulation to lower trans fat content’. They reasoned that ‘Manufacturers may conclude that if they cannot eliminate the footnote from the label’ by removing trans fats completely, then ‘there is no point in reformulating the product’ to partially reduce trans fats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312712461573">Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturers’ Association, 2002</xref>: 2).</p>

<sec id="section9-0306312712461573">
<title>Should ‘healthy’ types of trans and saturated fats be visible?</title>
<p>Industry actors who did not necessarily produce or use partially hydrogenated oils also articulated interests in how trans fats were categorized on labels. Twenty-four industry letters suggested that if the FDA planned to categorize trans fats with saturated fats according to their ostensibly similar physiological effects, then the agency would also have to categorize other types of fats according to their physiological effects. These letters generally came from chocolate, beef, pork, and dairy trade associations and companies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306312712461573">Hershey Foods, 2000</xref>). They asserted that stearic acid, the type of saturated fat found in their products, had no effect on ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol and actually raised ‘good’ HDL cholesterol. They therefore maintained that if the FDA were going to categorize trans fats with saturated fats, then they should not categorize stearic acid with the ‘unhealthy’ fats but should instead quantify it separately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 18 letters from dairy and cattle industry actors noted that two types of trans fats – vaccenic acid and conjugated linolenic acids (CLAs) – are ‘naturally occurring’ in meat, dairy products, and human breast milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0306312712461573">National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, 2004</xref>: 2). They maintained that these ‘natural’ trans fats have ‘health promoting effects’ as well as different molecular structures from the trans fats produced through the industrial partial hydrogenation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306312712461573">International Dairy Foods Association, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0306312712461573">National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, 2004</xref>: 2). They therefore wanted vaccenic acid and CLAs to be excluded from the FDA’s definition of ‘trans fats’ on the basis of their different chemical structures and different physiological effects.</p>

<title>The FDA’s final labeling rule: getting to 0 g trans fats</title>
<p>In 2001, the Office of Management and Budget sent a letter encouraging the FDA to finalize its trans fat labeling rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306312712461573">Graham, 2007</xref>). The letter maintained that labeling would affect both consumers and producers. Labeling would ‘assist consumers in their efforts to reduce their risk of [heart disease] and provide incentives to producers to reformulate food products to reduce the trans fat content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312712461573">Graham, 2001</xref>: 1). The FDA finalized labeling in 2003 and scheduled it to take effect on 1 January 2006. The agency expected that labeling would ‘prompt … the food industry to reformulate some of their products to offer lower <italic>trans</italic> fat alternatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA, 2003</xref>: 41457). The final labeling rule contended that the ‘increased consumer attention to <italic>trans</italic> fat content’ would ‘provide an incentive to food manufacturers to reduce the amount of <italic>trans</italic> fat in their products’ (p. 41467). Similarly, the FDA cited research showing that after the initial implementation of nutrition labeling in 1993, ‘the industry reformulated many foods … to reduce levels of nutrients about which consumers were concerned’ (p. 41457).</p>
<p>How did the FDA decide to categorize and quantify fats in order to persuade manufacturers to reformulate? The FDA’s final rule noted the preponderance of letters from industry arguing that ‘the private benefits of reformulation would not exceed private costs unless the declaration of <italic>trans</italic> fat on the food label was on a separate line on the Nutrition Facts panel’ (p. 41473). The FDA decided that trans fats would be listed on labels separately from saturated fat. The final rule provided a sample, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0306312712461573">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Regulators expressed uncertainty about whether trans fats raised heart disease risk more than, less than, or the same as saturated fats. But finalizing labeling rules did not require resolving the question of trans fats’ physiological effects relative to saturated fats. Epistemic closure is not a precondition to making quantification or other technoscientific projects work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312712461573">Callon, 1999 [1986]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306312712461573">Latour, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0306312712461573">Schaffer, 1995</xref>). Instead, the FDA argued that listing the fats separately reflected their chemical differences, sidestepping the question of their relative physiological effects. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA (2003)</xref> withdrew its proposal to warn consumers that ‘intake of <italic>trans</italic> fats should be as low as possible’ (p. 41434). Products with less than 0.5 g of trans fat per serving would be allowed to list trans fat content as 0 g.</p>
<p>However, the FDA decided that the vaccenic acid in meat and dairy products would be categorized as a trans fat along with the trans fats found in partially hydrogenated oils. Although vaccenic acid has molecular bonds in different locations from those in partially hydrogenated oils, both have nonconjugated bonds in the trans configuration, which the FDA decided made them chemically similar enough to categorize them as one substance. But CLAs, the other ‘naturally occurring’ trans fat, would be excluded from the definition of trans fats. The FDA noted that although CLAs do have bonds in the transverse position, those bonds are conjugated, meaning that they share atoms differently from the trans fats found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Because the FDA decided that the definition of trans fats would only include nonconjugated trans fatty acids, CLAs would be categorized and counted as part of the total fat content of foods and not as trans fats. The FDA noted that this chemical definition of trans fats actually differed from the Institute of Medicine’s definition, which included CLAs as a trans fat, but the agency justified its decision as being consistent with its own nomenclature for other fats. Moreover, the FDA repeatedly noted that they were defining fats by chemistry and not by physiological effects, meaning that ‘natural’ origins or potential health benefits were immaterial. The final labeling rule did not address whether ostensibly healthful stearic acid should be recategorized separately from the other saturated fats.</p>
<p>The final rule noted that many industry letters asked the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA (2003)</xref> to authorize a ‘trans fat free’ claim in order to ‘encourage more reformulation’ (p. 41464). However, the FDA ultimately decided not to allow manufacturers to make any ‘trans fat free’ claims at all. Why? The FDA noted that it bases such claims on recommended daily intake values of nutrients but could not find any ‘quantitative information from authoritative scientific groups’ on which to base a recommended daily intake for trans fats (p. 41465). Without that daily intake value, they could find no justification for defining ‘low trans fat’ or ‘reduced trans fat’ and therefore could not justify defining ‘trans fat free’. Manufacturers would, however, be permitted to state on the fronts of packages that a product contains ‘0 g trans fat per serving’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312712461573">Frito-Lay (2004)</xref> had written to the FDA that this type of ‘amount claim’, though not as powerful an incentive as a ‘trans fat free’ claim, would nonetheless create some ‘incentive for industry to undertake major formulation changes’ by informing consumers about ‘these important efforts’ to reformulate (pp. 1–2). The definition of ‘saturated fat free’ would not change from the FDA’s original definition under the initial NLEA rules. ‘Saturated fat free’ foods would still have to contain less than 0.5 g of trans fats and less than 0.5 g of saturated fat per serving.</p>
<p>The 2003 final rule again projected the possible interactions among changes in individual consumption and changes in industrial production in an effort to predict the effects of labeling. ‘Taken together, changes in food purchases by consumers and reformulation by producers in response to this rule will result in an overall decrease in <italic>trans</italic> fat intake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA, 2003</xref>: 41468). The authors of the rule stated that they could not estimate the costs of alternative oils but predicted that ‘as the demand for such ingredients increases, producers will have more incentive to increase capacity and the prices of these ingredients will fall’ (p. 41478). The FDA cited reports about new technologies, new crop varieties, margarine reformulation efforts, and Frito-Lay’s announcement that it had replaced trans fats a year before labeling was finalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306312712461573">Fischer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312712461573">Frito-Lay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312712461573">Haumann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312712461573">Inform Editors, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312712461573">Kocchhar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0306312712461573">List et al., 2000</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712461573">FDA (2003)</xref> does not regulate restaurants, but the final rule cited reports that McDonald’s and the Legal Sea Food chain had announced their intentions to reformulate, ‘using the absence of <italic>trans</italic> fats as a marketing device to gain competitive advantage’ (p. 41473).</p>

<title>Conclusion: using consumers to govern corporations</title>
<p>I have tried to show how quantitative information conveyed through consumer product labeling can be used as a technique to govern corporations. At a political level, it is reasonable to expect that an industry would resist labeling that could cast its products in a negative light. In the case of genetically modified (GM) food crops, for example, European activists fought against considerable industry resistance in order to institute labeling rules, among other restrictions, but GM food labeling remains voluntary in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0306312712461573">Schurman and Munro, 2009</xref>). However, the trans fat case demonstrates that industries do not necessarily resist labeling, because they do not necessarily resist changing their products. Instead, corporations and the various actors that constitute industries may believe that they can gain strength by changing their products, particularly if they can market those changes to consumers as positive developments. As a noted public health advocacy lawyer has argued, ‘the food industry is very good at taking criticism and turning it into a marketing opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0306312712461573">Simon, 2010</xref>). A former president of the Institute of Food Technologists, acknowledging criticism of the industry’s apparent contributions to obesity and chronic disease, also has argued that producing healthier food is ‘an ethical reality as well as a business opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312712461573">Gillette, 2010</xref>: 9). In the trans fat case, suppliers and supply trade associations were especially eager for manufacturers to purchase alternative technologies so that they could market and manufacture ‘healthier’ food. They favored labeling that would show consumers which products had been reformulated. Manufacturers were apparently willing to act in anticipation of how consumers might respond to those labels.</p>
<p>At a theoretical level, the major implication of this case is that labeling is not just about disciplining individuals. Individuals may be the manifest targets of standardized health information like labeling. But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312712461573">Martha Lampland (2010)</xref> argues, ‘[a]ttending merely to the spare features of formalized procedures means we overlook the dynamic social processes by which rationalization actually occurs’ (p. 378). The dissemination of standardized information to, or about, individuals can have a range of strategic goals. The FDA conveyed quantitative information about trans fats to individuals through labeling in order to encourage corporations to change their products. There are other instances in which standardized information seemingly directed at individual consumers can be designed to achieve effects on organizations. For example, professional medical associations publish standardized treatment guidelines that are arguably more about rationalizing health-care research and administration than about disciplining physicians or stipulating particular forms of patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0306312712461573">Weisz et al., 2007</xref>). Online forums for sharing information shape individual interactions with friends, but corporations also encourage us to produce information in standardized formats that they can mine for trends and monetize in advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0306312712461573">Netzer et al., 2012</xref>). Standardization may involve individuals, but it may ultimately be intended to govern, change, enlarge, or enrich organizational actors.</p>
<p>This practice of moving corporations through product labeling does not mean that consumers are mere epiphenomena or afterthoughts. Regulators used projected changes in consumer behavior to produce effects on corporations. Thus, a second implication of this case is that consumers (as ‘users’ of technological products) are useful in reaching other targets. This notion of users as useful echoes the significant literature showing how users are configured and how users configure technologies and scientific projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0306312712461573">Oudshoorn and Pinch, 2008</xref>). Users can be useful in pursuit of various goals. Activist organizations routinely threaten corporations with changes in individual consumption in the form of consumer boycotts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306312712461573">Glickman, 2009</xref>). Patient organizations build networks of individuals affected by diseases, which they use as resources to influence scientists’ research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0306312712461573">Panofsky, 2011</xref>). Market research firms identify and produce individual opinions, which corporations use as rationales to create or change products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0306312712461573">Lezaun, 2007</xref>). By labeling trans fats, the FDA used the possibility that individuals would change their consumption in order to encourage corporations to change their products. I am not, however, suggesting that consumers did not want trans fats. On the contrary, I suspect that most consumers did not know about trans fats until manufacturers started marketing products to them labeled ‘0 g trans fats’. But regulators, industry, and academic scientists all apparently agreed that manufacturers would reformulate if they could market products to consumers as ‘healthier’. Moreover, regardless of consumers’ actual perceptions of products, corporations believe that their apparent concern for consumers can burnish their reputations with investors. The Kellogg Company, General Mills, and PepsiCo were among the firms that boasted of replacing trans fats in their annual shareholders reports or corporate social responsibility reports, lauding their own efforts to protect public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306312712461573">General Mills, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312712461573">Kellogg Company, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0306312712461573">PepsiCo, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There certainly are limits to the effectiveness of using consumers’ projected behaviors as incentives to govern corporations. Replacing trans fats ultimately was a voluntary action by packaged food manufacturers. By contrast, reformulation in restaurants was mandated in several US jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312712461573">DeSoucey and Schleifer, 2010</xref>). Because manufacturers were free to choose whether or not to discipline their own technologies, some readers may wonder if this approach to governance represents weakness on the part of the FDA or even regulatory capture of the agency. If that were the question, then the response might be that, first, industry objected to labeling after CSPI’s 1994 petition, but that the FDA pursued it anyway. Second, industry actors did not get everything that they wanted, namely – authorization to make ‘trans fat free’ nutrient content claims. Rather than indicating regulatory weakness, the picture that emerges is that corporations believe that government-approved marketing messages matter to consumers. Many claims on consumer product packages, like fair trade or forest stewardship certifications, are created and monitored by civil society and trade organizations rather than by governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312712461573">Bartley, 2007</xref>). Corporations may believe that government-approved marketing claims are actually stronger than third-party certifications.</p>
<p>The FDA categorized and quantified fats so that manufacturers could label and market their products in a new way. Industry actors changed their products accordingly. This indicates that marketing claims are not necessarily created after products are manufactured. Instead, marketing can determine how products will be made. Research on finance has argued that economics does not just describe the economy, but that producing economic knowledge constitutes activity in what is called “the economy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312712461573">Callon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0306312712461573">MacKenzie, 2006</xref>). Similarly, I have tried to show how marketing claims can also be ‘engines’, crafted to change the products that circulate in the economy. In marketing, as in economics, the way in which something is quantified can be designed to change the market.</p>

<p>According to scientific convention, ‘<italic>trans</italic>’ is italicized. However, to reduce visual distraction, I italicize ‘trans’ only when the texts I am quoting from do so. Note that restaurants are largely regulated by states and municipalities and are not subject to these federal labeling rules for packaged foods. Restaurants have been restricted from using trans fats in at least 13 US jurisdictions, including New York City and California, since 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312712461573">DeSoucey and Schleifer, 2010</xref>).</p></fn>
