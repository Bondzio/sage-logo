<abstract>
<p>This article reviews findings from 38 rigorous studies published in the peer-reviewed literature of the impact of the Medicaid/Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expansions on children. There is strong evidence for increases in enrollment in public programs and reductions in uninsurance following eligibility expansions. Medicaid enrollment continued to increase during the CHIP era (a “spillover effect”). Evidence for improved access to and use of services, particularly for dental care, is also very strong. There are fewer studies of health status impacts, and the evidence is mixed. There is a very wide range in the size of effects estimated in the studies reviewed because of the methods used and the populations studied. The review identifies several important research gaps on this topic, particularly the small number of studies of the effects on health status. Both research methods and findings from the child expansions can provide insights for evaluating the coming expansions for adults under the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the major policy initiatives aimed at improving children’s lives over the past two and a half decades has been the expansion of eligibility for public health insurance coverage. Beginning with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, the federal government enacted Medicaid coverage (at states’ option) of children younger than 6 years in families with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL), regardless of family composition or welfare receipt. This was followed by new legislation each year from 1987 to 1990 that expanded eligibility to more children. Through these legislative actions, the United States eventually mandated Medicaid eligibility for children younger than 6 years with incomes below 133% FPL and phased in an expansion of Medicaid eligibility for older children with incomes below 100% of the FPL.</p>
<p>The passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP as it is now known, in 1997, was designed to fill coverage gaps that had grown among children whose families had incomes that were too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford private coverage. With CHIP came focused policy attention on outreach and enrollment efforts, which spilled over into Medicaid and aimed to increase participation of low-income children in both programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712437245">Kenney &amp; Chang, 2004</xref>). CHIP was renewed in 2009 under the CHIP Reauthorization Act and extended through FY 2015 in March 2010, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As a result of these expansions, public health insurance enrollment for children grew from just less than 10 million children in 1989 to close to 30 million in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712437245">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712437245">U.S. Census Bureau, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been several evaluations of the CHIP program, two by the federal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712437245">Rosenbach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077558712437245">Wooldridge et al., 2005</xref>); a foundation-funded study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712437245">Dubay, Hill, Kenney, &amp; Leibovitz, 2002</xref>); the Child Health Insurance Research Initiative, sponsored by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077558712437245">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2007</xref>); and numerous other studies of the program. These studies show the challenges of implementing outreach and enrollment, such as frequent enrollment turnover; highlight the gaps in coverage (e.g., for undocumented children); and provide other important lessons learned from the first decade of the CHIP program.</p>
<p>While both Medicaid and CHIP are jointly financed by the federal government and the states, states have latitude over numerous aspects of their programs, within a set of parameters set down under federal law. Under CHIP, states have the option to expand eligibility to children using either an expansion of their existing Medicaid program, a separate non-Medicaid program, or a combination of the two. In addition, under both Medicaid and CHIP, states set income thresholds and asset tests that determine eligibility for coverage. States also design their enrollment and retention processes, including whether to require in-person interviews at initial application and renewal and the types of documentation that are needed. Under CHIP, a number of states with separate programs have established provisions to discourage families from dropping employer coverage in order to enroll their children in CHIP. States also decide whether to use a managed care program, for example, health maintenance organizations or primary care case management, and are free to set provider payment rates with some restrictions. CHIP programs have more flexibility than Medicaid in terms of benefits and cost-sharing requirements. For example, the Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment program is mandatory under Medicaid—providing preventive care, screening, and referral services—but it is not required for CHIP.</p>
<p>Prior to the expansions in eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP, Medicaid coverage for children had been primarily limited to children whose families received welfare assistance (usually at incomes well below the FPL) and to disabled children. Following the Medicaid and CHIP expansions for children, all but four states—Oklahoma, North Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska—implemented eligibility thresholds for children who are above 200% FPL, with fully half the states having thresholds that are 250% of the FPL or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712437245">Heberlein, Brooks, Guyer, Artiga, &amp; Stephens, 2011</xref>). In addition to variation in eligibility thresholds, state programs also vary with respect to their enrollment, retention, service delivery, payment, cost sharing, and benefit policies. Given the implementation differences across states, the Medicaid and CHIP eligibility expansions for children can be thought of as 51 separate policy changes.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712437245">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>The Medicaid and CHIP expansions for children affect millions of lives and incur billions of public expenditures. Numerous studies have examined the impacts of the Medicaid and CHIP eligibility expansions for children, but the results from this expansive literature have never been thoroughly examined critically or synthesized. While individual authors of research papers have provided literature reviews of the effects, none have been comprehensive or systematic. In particular, no one has ever assessed the magnitude of the effects found across the different studies of the expansions on coverage, access to care, or health status. Such a stock-taking is important given the sizeable public funding commitment to Medicaid and CHIP, as well as the variation in state policy choices leading to potentially differential impacts of the programs. This article provides such an examination, to distill what is known and what remains to be learned about the effects of expanding health insurance for children.</p>
<p>Documenting the effects of Medicaid and CHIP expansions is challenging because the expansions did not occur in the context of a randomized trial. Consequently, studies of the effects of the expansions on access to care and health outcomes are at high risk of confounding from selection, whereby children who enroll in coverage are different from those who do not. In addition, studies of the effects of the expansions on coverage are at risk of bias because of changes in access to employer-sponsored insurance coverage (e.g., increases in employee contributions toward family coverage) that were occurring at the same time as eligibility for public coverage was expanding. As a consequence, to evaluate the soundness of the estimates that derive from a particular study, it is necessary to include in the review only studies with a methodological approach that addresses these issues.</p>
<p>Understanding how successful the prior eligibility expansions have been at reducing uninsurance and increasing access to needed care and ultimately improving the health of children is critical, given that the nation is set to embark on a major expansion of Medicaid coverage for adults in 2014. As the nation enters this new era of health insurance expansions, which are primarily targeted at adults, it is especially important to examine what has been learned from the era of child health insurance expansions. An additional important contribution of this article is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the research methods used in the earlier studies, so that studies of the Medicaid adult expansions under the ACA can build on and improve on those methods.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of this article is to synthesize across the vast literature that has emerged on Medicaid and CHIP expansions, in order to provide a critical summary of these important impacts. This review builds on reviews of the Medicaid expansions for pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712437245">Howell, 2001</xref>) and of health insurance’s impact on children for the Institute of Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712437245">Kenney &amp; Howell, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1077558712437245">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>This review draws on a long-standing framework for examining health insurance and its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712437245">Aday &amp; Anderson, 1974</xref>). The framework posits that health insurance coverage can remove financial barriers and thus lead to improved access to care. This improved access will then lead to increased use of appropriate services. In the case of children, improved use of preventive and primary care (both medical and dental care) is particularly appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally, use of such services may lead to improved health status among those who are newly covered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077558712437245" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The review was conducted using guidelines for rigorous literature syntheses from several sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712437245">Campbell Collaboration, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712437245">Institute of Medicine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077558712437245">Shea et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, this review (a) has clearly stated research questions, (b) uses a wide search with prespecified inclusion criteria, (c) uses multiple reviewers, (d) extracts common prespecified data from studies, (e) involves authors in reviewing extracted findings, (f) excludes poor-quality studies, and (g) examines and states conflicts of interest.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077558712437245">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Building on the conceptual framework described above, the synthesis addresses the following principal research questions: (a) Did the Medicaid/CHIP expansions increase enrollment in public health insurance coverage, reduce private insurance coverage, and/or reduce the rate of uninsurance, and if so by how much? (b) Did the Medicaid/CHIP expansions for children lead to improved access to care and use of services, and if so, how much improvement? (c) Did the Medicaid/CHIP expansions for children lead to improved health status among low income children?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558712437245">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>There are six inclusion criteria used to identify studies for review: (a) studies that focus on children ages 1 to 18 (thus excluding, for example, studies of infants or parents), (b) studies that focus on Medicaid or CHIP expansions (thus excluding, e.g., studies of local programs that expand coverage for undocumented children), (c) studies that focus on the quantitative effects of the programs (thus excluding, e.g., studies that describe programs qualitatively), (d) studies that examine selected impact measures (described further below) and provide the size of effects,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077558712437245">1</xref></sup> (e) studies that control for selection bias and other confounding changes (as described further below), and (f) studies published in the formal peer reviewed literature.</p>
<p>To assure comparability across studies of access and use, we focus the synthesis on studies providing the following measures: having a usual source of medical care, having any medical visit in the past year (or past 6 months depending on the study), having any preventive visit in the past year (or past 6 months), having a usual source of dental care, having any dental visit in the past year (or past 6 months), and having an unmet need for dental care in the past year (or past 6 months). These measures were covered by the majority of studies reviewed. The hypothesized direction of impact was positive for all measures, except for unmet need, where the hypothesized direction was negative.</p>
<p>Similarly, for the synthesis of impacts on health status, we examine only studies that provide impacts for at least one of the following four measures: perceived health status, restricted activity days, avoidable hospital admissions, or mortality. The definitions of these measures are identical or very similar across the included studies. The hypothesized direction of the impact is positive for the first measure and negative for the other three.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558712437245">
<title>Search Approach</title>
<p>We used multiple methods to identify the studies included in the synthesis. First we performed a search of the literature using the National Library of Medicine’s Medline and the American Economic Association’s EconLit databases via the OVID search engine. The searches were limited to studies that included children aged 1 to 18 years. The Medical Subject Heading terms included <italic>health insurance, medically uninsured, medical indigency, SCHIP or CHIP</italic>, and <italic>uncompensated care</italic>. This resulted in more than 1,000 citations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712437245">
<title>Review and Data Extraction</title>
<p>A senior researcher and research assistant reviewed the citations and associated abstracts to identify those that potentially met the inclusion criteria and obtained the full-text articles. We then reviewed reference lists of key articles and added any citations that were missed. Finally, these citations were augmented through contacts with key researchers to identify any new studies in press. As a result, 231 papers received a full review.</p>
<p>Each article was scrutinized using the criteria outlined above. As a result, 193 articles are excluded from the synthesis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712437245">Table 1</xref> shows the reasons for exclusion. Just more than 15% of reviewed papers are excluded because they include a different population from the focus of this synthesis (i.e., children affected by the Medicaid/CHIP expansions), and almost 20% are excluded because the focus of the paper is not the effect of the expansions. About 15% are excluded because they do not provide outcomes (or effect sizes) for the measures covered by this review. For example, they provide outcomes such as employer offers of health insurance, mental health service use, provider communication styles, or cost. While all these are important outcomes, none are available in a consistent manner across multiple studies allowing for a systematic review. By far the largest category, encompassing 76 papers or 39.4%, are excluded because of a serious methodological flaw (discussed further below). Finally, a small number of nonquantitative studies and studies that repeat findings from another paper are excluded.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The remaining 38 papers are included in the final synthesis, divided approximately equally across studies of the effects of the expansions on enrollment and on access/use, with somewhat fewer papers addressing health status impacts. The studies included in the review differ along a number of different dimensions, including methodological approach; data source; whether the focus is on Medicaid, CHIP, or both; whether the study is state specific or national in scope; the time frame; and the outcomes studied. An abstract<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077558712437245">2</xref></sup> of each study provides the citation, the date of the study, the population, the data source, the methodology, the program (pre-CHIP Medicaid, post-CHIP Medicaid, and CHIP), and effect sizes and statistical significance by measure. Several papers provide effects in more than one category and are included in each synthesis. When an article provides estimates for several different populations (e.g., different age-groups, income groups, or race/ethnicity groups), these are considered separate “studies” for purposes of the synthesis.

<title>Study Quality</title>
<p>We reviewed the methodology of each paper that met the basic inclusion criteria and excluded a large number (76) for methodological reasons (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712437245">Table 1</xref>). A small number (3) were excluded because of very low response rates (&lt;40%) or sample sizes (&lt;100). The remainder were excluded because they had an inadequate “counterfactual” or did not address selection bias. For example, in the case of studies of enrollment, the study should address the following question: “What would the rate of public health insurance coverage (or uninsurance) have been without the health insurance expansion (within the particular population examined)?” Examining just trends in enrollment, while very valuable, does not answer this question because growth (or decline) in enrollment could be due to economic changes. In addition, an issue that has received much attention is potential “crowd out.” Public coverage could rise, while uninsurance does not change, if parents drop private insurance for their children and enroll them in public programs. We excluded 29 papers, primarily enrollment studies, because they examined outcomes without a comparison group to control for secular changes such as changes in employer offers of health insurance or economic changes.</p>
<p>The impact questions for studies of access, use, and health status are framed similarly: “What would access to care, use of services, and health status of children who enroll in the new programs have been had they not been eligible or enrolled?” Often, to answer this question, publicly insured children have been compared with uninsured children, with or without controlling for the children’s health care needs and other characteristics. However, these comparisons are plagued by the problem of “selection.” Children who are eligible for a program may or may not be enrolled, depending on their parents’ motivation to enroll them. Often the children who do enroll are in poorer health, for example, than those who do not enroll. We excluded an additional 44 papers because they did not control for selection into public programs or insurance.</p>

<sec id="section10-1077558712437245">
<title>Review of Effect Sizes by Study Authors and Analysis of Effect Sizes</title>
<p>An important goal of this synthesis of findings on the impact of the Medicaid/CHIP expansions is to quantify both the direction and the size of the effects.</p>
<p>The estimates for each study were extracted by one of the authors of this synthesis, reviewed by a research assistant, and then forwarded to one of the authors of the particular article from which the estimate was extracted for review and approval. Effects are expressed as percentage point changes in the rates. Since we sought comparability of effect sizes across studies, at times it was necessary to transform effect sizes to a common metric. All of these transformations were reviewed by the original authors. Of the 38 articles reviewed, we were able to contact at least one of each paper’s coauthors and obtain approval for the extracted effect sizes and statistical significance.</p>
<p>While this review is restricted to studies that provide effect sizes, it was not possible to conduct a full meta-analysis in which estimates from various sources are combined into a summary measure. In part this is because of the diversity of methods and populations used. In addition, some articles do not provide standard errors for estimates of effects sizes. Many studies are now more than a decade old, and the original data analyses cannot be retrieved to obtain standard errors of all estimates.</p>
<p>To address this issue, and portray the range and central tendency of effect sizes, we provide box plots showing the distribution for each measure of enrollment, access, and use. These show the median, 25th, and 75th percentiles and extreme values for each outcome measure. In these distributions, nonsignificant findings are centered at zero (no significant change). This latter decision likely leads to an understatement of impacts, since undoubtedly some studies are underpowered (small sample sizes) and nonsignificant findings might be significant with larger samples. This affects most prominently findings concerning changes in private insurance enrollment, where only 4 of 22 studies report a significant decline, with the remainder of studies showing a decline that was not statistically significant. For all other measures, the majority of studies provide statistically significant results, which are shown in the box plots.</p>

<title>Enrollment Impacts</title>
<p>Sixteen articles are included in the synthesis of the impact of the Medicaid and CHIP expansions on enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP. Studies provide changes in one or more of the following impact measures: public insurance enrollment (Medicaid and/or CHIP), private insurance enrollment, and uninsurance. Studies focus on the Medicaid expansions in the time period either prior to the CHIP expansions (enacted in late 1997) or in the post-CHIP period. The post-CHIP studies examine the impact of CHIP expansions only on CHIP enrollment, or on enrollment in Medicaid as well.</p>
<p>Before reviewing the findings of the studies, it is important to discuss the variety of methods used. All 16 studies are national in scope and use one of the following national data sources: the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (or its precursor the National Medical Expenditure Survey), the Current Population Survey, the National Health Interview Survey, the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the National Survey of America’s Families, or the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. These surveys have different strengths for examining Medicaid/CHIP expansions for children. For example, while the Current Population Survey has a state-representative frame and includes large national samples each year, it does not include any measures of access to care or service use. In addition, some of these surveys (e.g., the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the Medical Expenditure Survey, and The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) are longitudinal, which provides an opportunity to track transitions in coverage. The studies focus on different time periods and different age-groups (e.g., sometimes only young children).</p>
<p>The studies all control for the analytic problem that enrollment in public insurance could grow (or private insurance enrollment could decline) regardless of public health insurance expansions (e.g., because of economic changes), in one of two ways. Eight of the studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712437245">Buchmueller, Lo Sasso, &amp; Wong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712437245">Cutler &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712437245">Gruber &amp; Simon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712437245">Ham &amp; Shore-Sheppard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712437245">Lee, Tian, &amp; Tomohara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712437245">Lo Sasso &amp; Buchmueller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712437245">Shore-Sheppard, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077558712437245">2008</xref>) use a two-stage instrumental variable (IV) approach. The IV studies predict Medicaid (or CHIP) eligibility in the first stage and then predict enrollment in health insurance controlling for eligibility in the second stage. Another five studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712437245">Banthin &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712437245">Blumberg, Dubay, &amp; Norton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712437245">Davidoff, Kenney, &amp; Dubay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712437245">Racine, Kaestner, Joyce, &amp; Colman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712437245">Yazici &amp; Kaestner, 2000</xref>) use a difference-in-differences (D-in-D) approach, whereby changes over time in enrollment in insurance for eligible children are compared with changes in enrollment in insurance over time for another group not eligible for the program. Generally the comparison group is either children in an income group just above the income level for the program or an age-group that is not yet eligible for the program (since the Medicaid expansions were phased in by age). An additional three studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712437245">Card &amp; Shore-Sheppard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712437245">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712437245">Hudson, Selden, &amp; Banthin, 2005</xref>) provide both IV and D-in-D estimates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712437245">Table 3</xref> summarizes the direction of the findings from these diverse studies. In the pre-CHIP period (before 1997), all but 1 of 11 studies find a significant increase in Medicaid enrollment. One study does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712437245">Card &amp; Shore-Sheppard, 2004</xref>), using the IV method. However, in the same article the author provides a statistically significant estimate of an 8.5 percentage point increase in public coverage, using the alternative D-in-D method and the same data set. This illustrates the variation in results that can come from alternative analytic approaches.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>For the post-CHIP era, all studies show a significant increase in public insurance enrollment: 3 for Medicaid enrollment, 10 for CHIP enrollment, and 2 for combined Medicaid/CHIP enrollment. Notably, in the time period when the expansion was concentrated among the CHIP-eligible population, studies find that Medicaid enrollment expanded among Medicaid-eligible children. This continued increase in Medicaid enrollment has been attributed to a “spillover” effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712437245">Dubay, Guyer, Mann, &amp; Odeh, 2007</xref>), whereby some of the policy changes occurring under CHIP such as enrollment simplification and intensive outreach brought children into Medicaid as well as CHIP. This synthesis provides additional evidence of this spillover to Medicaid enrollment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712437245">Table 3</xref> also summarizes the results from studies of the effect of Medicaid and CHIP expansions on private insurance. The debate on whether the public insurance expansions for children caused a decline in private insurance enrollment (often called “crowd out”) has been intense. We review 22 separate studies and find only 4 reporting statistically significant declines in private insurance enrollment. With one exception, a widely cited study from the pre-CHIP era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712437245">Cutler &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>), the studies that find significant declines in private insurance enrollment all focus on the effects of the CHIP program, which is for higher income children than for Medicaid (usually between 100% and 200% of the FPL or higher). Consequently, this review provides limited evidence of declines in private insurance, since almost all studies show no significant decline.</p>
<p>The goal of the public health insurance expansions for children has been to reduce the rate of uninsurance. All but 5 of the 26 studies reviewed show statistically significant declines in uninsurance among children associated with the Medicaid/CHIP expansions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712437245">Table 3</xref>). The studies that find no significant decline are all of subgroups of children, including a study of children of native-born parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712437245">Buchmueller et al., 2008</xref>), 2 studies of children with chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712437245">Davidoff et al., 2005</xref>), a study of young White children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712437245">Racine et al., 2001</xref>), and a study of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712437245">Yazici &amp; Kaestner, 2000</xref>). Some or all of these studies of subgroups may be underpowered because of small sample sizes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712437245">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of effect sizes in box plots for these three measures. As shown, there is a wide range in effect sizes. For example, for public coverage, effects range from no significant change (the one IV study mentioned above from the pre-CHIP era) to a 24.2 percentage point increase (an IV study of all public coverage in the post-CHIP era). The median estimate is 11.1 percentage points.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1077558712437245" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>Effect sizes for impact of expansion on enrollment</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077558712437245-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>While the pattern is not completely consistent, in general the studies that use an IV approach produce a wider range of estimates of the size of the increase in public coverage than do the studies using a D-in-D approach. Another pattern is that the magnitude of the effect is similar on Medicaid enrollment in the pre-CHIP era and on CHIP enrollment after 1997.</p>
<p>Referring again to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712437245">Figure 1</xref>, while most estimates of the decline in private insurance are nonsignificant (causing the estimates overall to center at 0), estimates for the four studies with significant decline range from −5.0 to −10.2 percentage points. Similarly, the range in the size of the decline in uninsurance is wide, from 0 (no significant decline) to −23.0 percentage points. The central tendency for the estimate in the decline in uninsurance, −7.3 percentage points, is less than the median estimate for the increase in public insurance, 11.1 percentage points.</p>
<p>The median estimate of −7.3 a percentage point decline in uninsurance is consistent with the actual decline during the full era of the Medicaid/CHIP expansions. In 1987, about 17% of children were uninsured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077558712437245">Weinick &amp; Monheit, 1999</xref>). By 2009, the percentage of U.S. children who were uninsured declined to 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712437245">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>). (In contrast, over the same time period, the share of adults lacking health insurance coverage was rising.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077558712437245">
<title>Access and Use Impacts</title>
<p>If children enroll in new health insurance coverage, the assumption is that they will have better access to care, which will in turn lead to increased use of appropriate health services. To study whether the Medicaid and CHIP expansions led to increased access to care and use of health services, it is critical to control for selection into the programs.</p>
<p>Three types of studies have emerged that control for selection into Medicaid or CHIP. As with the enrollment studies, researchers have used both two-stage, IV analysis, predicting first eligibility or enrollment, and then access or use, or a D-in-D approach. In addition, researchers have compared children newly enrolling in a program with those who have been enrolled for a year; sometimes this comparison is over time for the same child (a pre/post analysis). These pre/post studies have a potential limitation unique to this design. If children are more likely to enroll when they are sick, in order to obtain medical or dental care right away, they may be more likely to obtain health care in the year just after enrolling than before when they were uninsured. This may lead to an overstatement of the effect of the insurance expansion. Some studies perform sensitivity analyses to assess this bias and some do not.</p>
<p>Six national-level studies estimate the effect of the expansions in eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP on access and use. These all measure the effects on eligible children, whether or not the children enroll in the program, an approach that addresses the selection problem well but does not study the program’s direct effect. Three studies use a D-in-D approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712437245">Banthin &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712437245">Davidoff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712437245">Racine et al., 2001</xref>), two use IV methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712437245">Currie, Decker, &amp; Lin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712437245">Currie &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>), and one uses both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712437245">Wang, Norton, &amp; Rozier, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence from these studies of the effect of eligibility on access and use is mixed, and the limited number of studies shows a mixture of both positive effects for some measures and no effects for other measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712437245">Table 4</xref>). We concentrate on studies that provide effect size estimates for the seven selected measures of access and use provided in the table (four for medical care and three for dental care). For example, the single study of the effect of eligibility on having a usual source of medical care, a study of Medicaid in the pre-CHIP period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712437245">Banthin &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>), shows no significant change, and five studies measuring the likelihood of a medical visit are almost evenly split between improvements (three studies) and no significant change (two studies). The clearest pattern of improvement is for reductions in unmet dental need, with all three studies of this measure showing significant improvement.</p>

<p>There is much stronger evidence for improvements in access and use from the 12 studies of children who actually enroll in Medicaid or CHIP (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077558712437245">Table 5</xref>).

The state-specific studies (or studies of multiple states using common methods) generally use special surveys of parents of children enrolling in Medicaid or CHIP to assess changes from before children enroll compared with after children have been enrolled for a year. Thus, most use a pre/post analysis of children’s access and use experience prior to enrollment and in the year following enrollment. This approach addresses selection well, in that all children do apply and enroll, but the method potentially has analytic problems associated with a pre/post design, as described above. The one national study that uses IV predicts enrollment in the first stage and then access and use in the second.</p>

<p>Having a usual source of medical or dental care is considered the gateway to using care. Of 15 studies examining this measure for medical care, 13 find significant improvements. The results are even clearer for dental care, with all 4 studies finding improvements. The results for medical care use (both any medical care visit and any preventive visit) are mixed, with an almost equal number of studies showing significant improvement as no significant change. This is not true for dental care, where all 9 studies show significant improvement.</p>
<p>In spite of the mixed evidence in use of medical services, 12 of 12 studies show a reduction in unmet need for medical care and 10 of 10 studies show a reduction in unmet need for dental care. The measure, however, may be more subject to potential bias due to regression to the mean, since parents may be more prone to enroll their child in insurance when they have an unmet need for care. One study performed sensitivity analyses to assess the extent to which the estimates were biased due to regression to the mean and found that the impact findings were robust to alternative specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712437245">Kenney, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence of improved access and use, while mixed, is generally positive, with more studies showing some form of improvement than no improvement. However, the range of effect sizes is quite wide. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712437245">Figure 2</xref> shows box plots of effect sizes for all seven measures, grouping the eligibility and enrollment studies. (There are not enough eligibility studies to show separately.) Increases in the percentage with a usual source of medical care range from 0 (no change) to a more than 30 percentage point increase. There are fewer studies of the usual source of dental care, but the range in effect sizes is similarly wide. For all seven measures of access and use, there is at least a 20 percentage point difference between the lowest and the highest effect size. With this variability, it is perhaps best to examine the median estimates that are much more modest than the most extreme values, with a median of an 11.8 percentage point increase for having a usual source of medical care; a 6.3 percentage point increase for having any medical visit, a 3.0 percentage point increase for having any preventive visit, a −12.0 percentage point reduction for having any unmet need, a 14.5 percentage point increase for having a usual source of dental care, a 16 percentage point increase for having any dental visit, and a −9.5 percentage point decrease for having any unmet dental need. While the central tendency across studies shows solid improvements in all measures, the instability of estimates lends substantial uncertainty about the actual size of the effects of the Medicaid and CHIP expansions on access and use.</p>

<p>Additionally, most of the studies of access and use focus on the post-CHIP era. Only four studies examine the impact of Medicaid expansions in the pre-CHIP era, each examining a very limited number of measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712437245">Banthin &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712437245">Currie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712437245">Currie &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712437245">Racine et al., 2001</xref>). Thus the evidence on the impact of the early Medicaid expansions on access to care and use of services is very limited.</p>
<p>This variation in effects is due both to the variations in the methods of these studies and the populations studied. For example, the two stage IV and pre/post studies are more likely to find significant effects and larger effects than the D-in-D studies. One study using both IV and D-in-D approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712437245">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) finds much larger effects with the IV analysis than with the D-in-D approach, showing that specification differences can lead to widely different findings in these econometric studies. The lack of a consensus in the research community about the best way to study the effect of the expansions makes it difficult to synthesize the size of the expansion effects across studies.</p>
<p>In terms of populations, the reviewed studies find (unsurprisingly) (a) more consistent effects for children who are enrolled than for children who are eligible for the programs and (b) larger effects for children who are uninsured prior to enrolling than for those formerly insured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712437245">Kenney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712437245">Kenney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077558712437245">Slifkin et al., 2002</xref>). It is difficult to distinguish differences in the effects for the pre-CHIP and post-CHIP eras, because of the small number of studies done in the pre-CHIP era and the differences in the methods used in the studies before and after CHIP. In addition, almost all studies in the post-CHIP era examine CHIP impacts. The two studies from that era that examine the impact of Medicaid enrollment find effects that are within the range of CHIP effects, suggesting that the impact of the two programs on access and use is similar. However, this is based on very limited evidence.</p>
<p>The effect on improved dental care is more consistently positive than for medical care. Only three studies find no significant improvement in dental care use. All of these are national-level D-in-D studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712437245">Banthin &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712437245">Davidoff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712437245">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and all examine the effect of eligibility not enrollment. It is perhaps understandable that impacts on dental care are more pronounced than for medical care. The health care safety net for uninsured children (including public and private nonprofit clinics) is substantial for providing preventive and primary care, but in many communities such a safety net does not exist to provide free and low-cost dental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077558712437245">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, 2000</xref>). In addition, one of the studies reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077558712437245">Slifkin et al., 2002</xref>) finds no impact of CHIP on medical care use for the youngest children (aged 0-5) but substantial impacts for older children. The public health care safety net may provide more regular care for uninsured young children than older children, leaving less room for improvement associated with health insurance. This could explain why improvements in use of preventive care were found to be more modest than for the other measures.</p>
<p>In summary, these studies of the impact of the Medicaid and CHIP expansions on children’s access to care and use of services provide generally consistent evidence of improvements, especially for children who actually enroll in the programs. Measures of central tendency of these wide-ranging effect sizes suggest that the effect sizes center from a 3 percentage point improvement in preventive care use to a 16 percentage point improvement in dental care use. The few studies that examine Medicaid show effects that are in the same range (not smaller or larger on average) than the effects found for CHIP.</p>

<title>Health Status</title>
<p>One of the ultimate goals of expanding health insurance coverage for children is to improve their health, both in the near term and over their life span. Studying changes in the health status of children is fraught with difficulty, most notably because children are generally in good health, and the most important changes from good health care in childhood may come many years outside the time frame of almost all studies.</p>
<p>In spite of these challenges, some researchers have tackled the difficult problem of examining Medicaid/CHIP expansion impacts on health status among affected children. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077558712437245">Table 6</xref> summarizes findings across 12 studies, 6 of which are national-level studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712437245">Currie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712437245">Cutler &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712437245">Dafny &amp; Gruber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712437245">Howell, Decker, Hogan, Foster, &amp; Yemane, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712437245">Lykens &amp; Jargowsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712437245">Racine et al., 2001</xref>) and 6 of which are state-specific studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712437245">Aizer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712437245">Bermudez &amp; Baker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712437245">Fox et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712437245">Kaestner, Joyce, &amp; Racine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077558712437245">Szilagyi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077558712437245">Szilagyi et al., 2006</xref>). Each of these studies examines only one of four measures of health status, with the exception of one study, which examines two measures. Consequently, there is much less cross-study evidence to synthesize for each measure. In addition, it is not possible to extract comparable effect sizes across all studies.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077558712437245">Table 6</xref>, in contrast to studies of the impact of the expansions on enrollment, access, and use, the evidence about the impact of the expansions on health status is very mixed. Only one study of four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712437245">Fox et al., 2003</xref>) shows an effect on perceived health status, and neither of two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712437245">Lykens &amp; Jargowsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712437245">Racine et al., 2001</xref>) finds an effect on restricted activity days for children.</p>
<p>However, evidence of a positive impact of the expansions on health status does come from several studies of avoidable hospitalization and mortality. These studies examine avoidable hospitalization and mortality using diverse methods. Two use California hospital discharge data for the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712437245">Aizer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712437245">Bermudez &amp; Baker, 2005</xref>); two use national-level hospital discharge data for an earlier period, thus addressing the earlier Medicaid expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712437245">Dafny &amp; Gruber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712437245">Kaestner et al., 2001</xref>); and one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077558712437245">Szilagyi et al., 2006</xref>) examines hospitalization for children with asthma enrolled in CHIP in New York. All but one of these very different studies finds a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations due to the expansions, as do both studies of child mortality.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712437245">Aizer (2007)</xref> finds that a 10% increase in Medicaid enrollment leads to a 1.6% decline in avoidable hospitalization, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712437245">Bermudez and Baker (2005)</xref> find an even larger reduction associated with CHIP enrollment in the same state. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712437245">Dafny and Gruber (2005)</xref> find no significant decline in avoidable hospitalization nationally during the early period of the Medicaid expansions, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712437245">Kaestner et al. (2001)</xref> find a reduction in avoidable hospitalization only for the youngest children (aged 2-6).</p>
<p>Finally, two national-level studies of mortality using similar methods find a significant association between Medicaid/CHIP expansions and reductions in child mortality. The first study covers the early period of the Medicaid expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712437245">Currie &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>), and a second study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712437245">Howell et al., 2010</xref>) uses similar methods but covers the full Medicaid/CHIP expansion period. Both find a similar result, that a 10% increase in Medicaid/CHIP eligibility is associated with an approximately 3% decline in child mortality. Thus, the evidence on the impact of Medicaid/CHIP on child mortality is positive from the two existing studies of this issue.</p>
<p>In summary, the limited evidence of the impact of the Medicaid/CHIP expansions on child health is mixed, with as many studies showing no change as showing positive improvements in health. More research is clearly needed on this very important topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077558712437245">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this synthesis of findings on Medicaid/CHIP impacts. First, while our search was comprehensive, we may have missed some important studies. Because of our familiarity with Medicaid/CHIP research, we feel confident that there are very few exclusions from our list of published studies. The more important limitation is that we have excluded “gray” literature, including reports and briefs that are not published in the formal peer-reviewed literature. This leads to a potential “publication bias.” Such publication bias can lead to more positive findings appearing in the formal literature than the gray literature and a more positive assessment of a program than warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712437245">Higgins &amp; Green, 2008</xref>). It is possible that one or more rigorous smaller evaluations, perhaps at the state level by an evaluation contractor with whom we are not familiar, may have produced important findings that do not appear in the formal literature. However, given the efforts we made to track down all studies on this topic, we think it is unlikely that rigorous studies have been excluded. In addition, as mentioned, including our own literature could have biased the findings from the synthesis.</p>
<p>All the studies summarized here rely on natural experiments or other econometric techniques for addressing possible bias in the impact estimates, which leaves room for doubt about the validity of the findings, even if they are found in multiple studies with different data sources and counterfactuals. Particularly for the CHIP program, where at times states have imposed waiting lists, it might be possible to design a random assignment study that is ethically sound, in order to develop more certainty about the effects of program enrollment. A recent study of adult coverage expansions in Oregon are an example of this type of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712437245">Finkelstein et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While we provide estimates of the size of effects on enrollment, access, and use of services, the wide range in methods used and populations and time periods studied means that there is great variation in the size of these estimates. Thus, we advise caution is using the estimates of effect sizes provided here as concrete measures of the size of the expansion effects.</p>
<p>Finally, while Medicaid is a much larger program than CHIP, the advent of the CHIP program produced a burgeoning number of studies on that program’s impact, with increased rigor in their methods over previous research. This led to a larger number of more recent studies examining CHIP included in the review than might be warranted by the relative size of the program and the importance of the earlier Medicaid expansions for children.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This review of 38 rigorous studies of the impact of the Medicaid and CHIP expansions on children has shown clearly that there have been resulting gains in public health insurance coverage and declines in uninsurance; generally strong evidence of gains in access to and use of medical and dental care (although results vary on the size of these effects, and some studies show no gains)—but very incomplete and mixed evidence on the effect of the expansions on child health (with some studies showing positive findings and an equal number showing no gains). These results are similar to the overall findings from a synthesis of the impact of the Medicaid expansions for pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712437245">Howell, 2001</xref>). The positive effects on access to care and use of services for children found in numerous, diverse states across the country lend credibility to the findings and suggest that the effects found in national-level studies are not concentrated only in certain large states.</p>
<p>While we conclude that there were substantial improvements in access to health care and use of services, questions remain about how large those gains were and for which children. The pre-CHIP era of Medicaid expansions saw strong gains in enrollment in that program, but there were few studies of access and use of services that adequately controlled for selection into the program and other sources of bias. One reason for differences in the significance of and size of effects—particularly for studies of access to care, use of services, and health status—has to do with the widely varying methods that researchers have used to study these effects. The research community has not yet come to agreement on the most appropriate methods for studying enrollment, access, use, and health status, and experimentation continues on how best to conduct such studies. This is perhaps the greatest factor in the range of conclusions drawn from this comprehensive review of a diverse group of studies.</p>
<p>This review of the literature has identified a number of important gaps in our knowledge base. In particular, as evidenced by the paucity of studies that have examined health status, the evidence base is inadequate on whether and how eligibility expansions have affected the health and functioning of children. Likewise, little information is available on how state policy choices with respect to provider payment, the service delivery system, and benefits and cost sharing affect access and health outcomes for children. A broad search revealed few studies of the cost of the expansions. While there is some literature on the effect of the expansions on financial burden for families, mental health use, use of prescription drugs, and use of the emergency room, the evidence is limited.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this review has illustrated a range of methods that can be used to control for selection bias and secular trends, problems that plague many studies of the effects of health insurance expansion. Although there are exceptions, the D-in-D methods yield more modest and consistent estimates that IV analysis, which relies on finding a correct “instrument” for the first stage of the regression analysis. The pre/post studies of people before and after the enroll have many advantages in control for selection, but they may yield incorrect estimates of program effects due to regression to the mean and should be accompanied by sensitivity analyses that investigate that issue.</p>
<p>As the nation enters a new era of health insurance reform, a number of important policy decisions lie ahead that could affect the extent to which the ACA achieves its objectives. In particular, the ACA expands Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes under 133% FPL, a policy change that is similar to the earlier Medicaid expansions that were adopted for children. The lessons from those earlier expansions are that such expansions can produce reductions in uninsurance, especially if coupled with intensive outreach and enrollment efforts. In addition, the expansions will likely increase access and service use among those who are targeted by the expansion, particularly among those who enroll. It remains unclear whether the findings of little or no reduction in private insurance associated with the child health insurance expansions will be repeated for the adult expansions.</p>
<p>However, unlike the prior Medicaid expansions for children, which were phased in over the course of more than a decade, the adult Medicaid expansion is slated for implementation at a single point in time: January 2014. Moreover, the scale of the Medicaid expansion under the ACA is far larger in terms of its potential enrollment impacts than the earlier Medicaid expansions for children. The combination of the implementation schedule and the scale of the ACA Medicaid expansions raise concerns about the capacity of Medicaid delivery systems to meet the increased demand. To the extent that supply constrains service use in Medicaid under the ACA, the access and service use improvements may fall short of what was achieved for children under prior expansions.</p>
<p>The health reform effort that was implemented in Massachusetts, which contains many of the same features as the ACA, offers some guidance on what might occur under the ACA. Studies indicate that health reform in Massachusetts led to reductions in uninsurance for both children and adults and to increases in access to care and service use among the nonelderly adults that were targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712437245">Kenney, Long, &amp; Luque, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712437245">Long &amp; Masi 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712437245">Long, Phadera, &amp; Stockley, 2009</xref>). However, despite the gains in access to care, almost one third of insured adults reported that they had experience trouble getting needed health care in the prior year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712437245">Long &amp; Phadera, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the cost of the adult expansions will likely be larger than for children (although as noted, the cost of the child expansions has not been studied extensively). It will be important to study who bears these costs (e.g. individuals, providers, and governments) and to examine the extent to which the burden of health care financing shifts across these different entities.</p>
<p>Medicaid and CHIP programs for children are also slated to change under the ACA, with children with incomes between 100% and 133% of the FPL transitioning from CHIP to Medicaid coverage and federal CHIP funding allocated only through 2015. Moreover, while the ACA includes a maintenance of effort provision for Medicaid and CHIP for children through 2019, recent proposals have sought to discontinue that provision. While the expansions to parents could increase some children’s coverage, the possible discontinuation of CHIP for certain groups of children could reduce coverage for other children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712437245">Kenney, Buettgens, Guyer, &amp; Heberlein, 2011</xref>). Consequently, it will be important to continue to track how the changes introduced under the ACA affect children.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the findings are not uniformly positive, we conclude that the Medicaid and CHIP expansions led not only to improved health insurance coverage for children but also to an increase in their access to care and use of services. We cautiously conclude that the expansions also led to improvements in health status but note that more research is needed on that topic. Finally, as the nation moves to further expand coverage for uninsured adults, it will be important to build on the methods used to study the impact of the expansions for children, in order to learn as much as possible about how these large public policy changes affect the newly insured groups.</p>
