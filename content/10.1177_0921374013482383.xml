<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amitav Ghosh – a peripatetic writer of South Asian origin and affiliation – is across his fictional and essayistic oeuvre concerned with producing imaginative visions with which to counter contemporary bordered worlds. Focusing on two of his narrative works – <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 1992</xref>) and <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>) – that stand out for the exemplary status they have attained, respectively, within Indian Ocean and postcolonial–ecological studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0921374013482383">1</xref></sup> this article explores the cosmopolitan structures he retrieves from the medieval Indian Ocean world and those he forges along the South Asian littoral in an era of climate change.</p>
<p>The much remarked upon and generically indeterminate <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> tacks across the Indian Ocean and various time zones as it sets an ‘antique’ world of ‘accommodation’ and ‘dialogue’ in counterpoint to the landscape of the present that is scarred by the borders dividing postcolonial nation-states and pockmarked with military offences. Rather than travelling itself, the narrative of <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> is located in the shifting environment and sedimented temporality of the Sundarbans in West Bengal. Played out on this littoral stage is the agentive force of nature, along with environmental destruction and equally destructive conservation projects engineered out of a promiscuous union between multinational capital, a professed Left government and neoliberal organisations such as the World Wildlife Trust. Quivering before the impact of a cyclone, the mangrove forests presented in novelistic form just months before the devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004 suggest also the ‘deep structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0921374013482383">Pearson, 2003</xref>: 13–26) of winds, waves and currents that stitch together the Indian Ocean world Ghosh’s merchants and slaves traversed eight centuries before.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0921374013482383">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both texts turn to the Indian Ocean and its coastal delta in search of the ‘permeability’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0921374013482383">Pearson, 2006</xref>: 356) that characterises the littoral and the syncretic and/or dialogic cultural and life forms emerging along it, which stand in contrast to geopolitical boundaries and species borders. In this social, political and ecological space, they locate a cosmopolitanism that interweaves, elaborates and exceeds the three principle threads in cosmopolitan thought: love of humankind, an ethic of tolerance and mutual respect in a ‘world of strangers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0921374013482383">Appiah, 2006</xref>); celebration of hybridity and fluidity attendant on human migration (Bhabha, Clifford) and the ‘Kantian tradition in thinking of cosmopolitanism as the emergence of norms that ought to govern relations among individuals in a global civil society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0921374013482383">Benhabib, 2006</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Reconceiving cosmopolitanism from the South in an era of climate change, Ghosh pushes beyond the political limits of the ‘citizen of the world’ while immersing this grand, abstract concept in the mud of a local – sticky yet fluid – ecosystem. In the process, he draws close to the ‘new cosmopolitanism’ advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0921374013482383">Gilroy (2004</xref>: 289) in his search for ‘an alternative sense of what our networked world might be and become, a new cosmopolitanism centred on the global south’. Ghosh, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0921374013482383">Gilroy (2004</xref>: 290), moves from the Bandung Africa–Asia Conference of 1955 and the foreclosed potential of the Third World project to ‘environmental concerns’ – and ‘an appreciation of nature as a common condition of our imperilled existence’.</p>

<title><italic>In an Antique Land</italic>: Surfacing a new universalism from the wreckages of History</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I am to think of what drew me to Egypt in 1980, it was, at bottom, … a kind of xenophilia, a desire to reclaim the globe in my own fashion, a wish to eavesdrop on an ancient civilizational conversation … As one of the centres of the world, Egypt has always had a special attraction for travellers and it seemed natural that this was where I would come … But it needs to be acknowledged here that neither I nor any of the other elements of India that were present in rural Beheira – the pumps and the Hindi film songs – would have been able to a find a place there if not for the existence of the Non-Aligned Movement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2009a</xref>: 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Published in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall and concluding with the first Gulf War, <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> revisits the Indian Ocean world of the twelfth century in order to reorient its futures from amidst the triumph of ‘capitalism + empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2009a</xref>: 40) and within the ruins of the ‘Third World project’ launched at the Bandung Conference of 1955.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0921374013482383">3</xref></sup> To this end, it splices a story spanning the 1980s – from Ghosh’s arrival in Egypt as a student ethnographer at the start of the decade to the eruption of the Gulf War in 1990 – with one that pieces together the narrative fragments of the medieval Indian Ocean world found among the Geniza documents. This structure, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0921374013482383">Hofmeyr (2010</xref>: 723) notes, ‘contrasts the old diasporas of the Indian Ocean with the modern nation-state’, placing the former’s cosmopolitan structures in relief against the cultural and religious chauvinisms spawned under the European empire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0921374013482383">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ghosh’s reassembled narrative of the twelfth-century Tunisian-born Jewish trader Abraham Ben Yiju and his South Asian–origin slave Bomma stands in sharp distinction to the state of war that hovers over the text’s conclusion. This state he traces back to the Crusades and the bombastic Portuguese entry into the Indian Ocean that they in part directed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0921374013482383">Cliff, 2011</xref>). Ghosh writes out of a present determined by the neoliberal postcolonial condition that has divided the global South into discrete nation-states prohibiting the ‘free exchange between peoples’ he identifies in the medieval Indian Ocean world (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0921374013482383">Wassef, 1998</xref>: 75), and in which borders are sites of deathly antagonism. His attachment to the pre-European Indian Ocean world is explicitly motivated by ‘an Indian’s terror of symbols’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 1992</xref>: 204–210) produced by the foundational trauma of Partition and reinforced during the riots following the assassination of Indira Gandhi in New Delhi in 1984. From this vantage point, he articulates a longing for the filiations forged across the ocean in the pre-Da Gama era – filiations, he finds, briefly reactivated in the Non-Aligned Movement that emerged from the Third World project (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>The model Ghosh evokes from which to imagine alternative futures is located in the medieval port cities strung around the ocean rim. His Indian Ocean world is unified by the movements of the merchant Ben Yiju, its nodal points consisted of the ports he inhabits or in which he has trading interests: Tunis, Fustat (Cairo), Aden and Mangalore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0921374013482383">5</xref></sup> It is – to adapt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0921374013482383">Pomeraz and Topik’s (2006)</xref> title – rendered as ‘a world that trade created’. For Ghosh, the trade that structures and breathes life into its cosmopolitan potentialities is a vector for the transport of affect, connection and culture. Reading an epistolary exchange between Ben Yiju and a trading partner, he observes that ‘despite all the merchandise it speaks of, the letter’s spirit is anything but mercenary’; it is instead ‘alive with warmth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 1992</xref>: 18). At the heart of this model, in other words, lies the Kantian conception of ‘commercial interactions as a paradigm of interaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0921374013482383">Waldron, 2006</xref>: 93) and of ‘world trade provid[ing] the historical basis of cosmopolitan unity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0921374013482383">Cheah, 2006</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Granting trade this pivotal role in producing an exemplary conviviality that stands as foil to a degraded present, Ghosh is driven to explain away the ubiquity of slavery therein, even as his ostensible aim is to restore Ben Yiju’s slave, Bomma, to narrative presence from the state of ‘social death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0921374013482383">Patterson, 1985</xref>) to which he has been consigned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0921374013482383">6</xref></sup> Here, Ghosh apparently falls in line with a pervasive romanticisation of the Indian Ocean world and its port cities that takes place under the sign of the cosmopolitan (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0921374013482383">Pearson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0921374013482383">Simpson and Kresse, 2007</xref>), which is proving increasingly inadequate to attempts to imagine both the past and the future.</p>
<p>A number of critical responses have tackled the nostalgic impulse inflecting Ghosh’s rosy representation of trade. Three are particularly illustrative. Highlighting his ‘unaccountably “soft” view of slavery’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0921374013482383">Lal (1993)</xref> questions whether ‘those critical faculties which Ghosh so agilely and persuasively brings to bear upon his dissection of the claims of modernity and rationality are somewhat suspended in his consideration of the ethos of the medieval period’ (p. 96). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0921374013482383">Desai (2004)</xref> similarly finds that ‘[w]hile the cautionary note distinguishing transatlantic slavery from Arab forms is essential, it risks coming across as … a sanitized view of slavery’ (p. 138).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0921374013482383">7</xref></sup> He argues, moreover, that
<disp-quote>
<p>[d]espite Ghosh’s own critique of the West, particularly its imperialist history, <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> shares with Goiten’s work an uncanny disposition in favor of free-market economics and the market-oriented state. Its overwhelming acceptance of the proposition that multiculturalism would follow if only the market were left to work on its own ultimately reflects a libertarian rather than a liberal imagination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0921374013482383">Desai, 2004</xref>: 134–135)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That is, it reflects an imagination in which ‘toleration’ becomes ‘an interest of the state’. In Desai’s reading, then, the culture of tolerance, bargaining and accommodation Ghosh recuperates in the medieval Indian Ocean world emerges as precursor rather than alternative to the free-market state of neoliberal capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0921374013482383">Grewal (2008</xref>: 184–185, 189) – while sharing Lal’s and Desai’s discomfiture with <italic>In an Antique Land</italic>’s presentation of slavery – similarly remarks of Ghosh’s ‘golden past … of cosmopolitan connections divided by religion but unified through trade’ that ‘it is difficult, in this current phase of the power of capital flows across many transnationalisms, to think of trade as either benign or as emptied of colonial power relations’.</p>
<p>It is, however, instructive to take account of the distinctions Ghosh so carefully draws between precolonial Indian Ocean trading structures (including ones that traffic in human beings) and those of the era of ‘empire + capitalism’ that for him stretches from the disruptive Portuguese entry into this oceanic world up to our globalised present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0921374013482383">Graeber (2011)</xref> draws a similar distinction, arguing that Ghosh’s ‘golden age’ was characterised by a suspension of the ‘military-coinage-slavery’ complex constellated in the preceding Axial Age and virulently re-established during the ‘Age of Exploration’. The medieval Indian Ocean world,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0921374013482383">8</xref></sup> Graeber finds, functions according to virtual credit systems ‘based almost entirely on trust and reputation … – a world of handshake deals and paper promises backed only by the integrity of the signer’. It is precisely this convivial state of exchange that Ghosh’s narrative explicates. Within such a ‘credit economy that operates largely without state mechanisms of enforcement’, Graeber locates ‘a genuine free market, not one created by the government and backed by its police and prisons’.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0921374013482383">Pomeraz and Topik (2006)</xref>, similarly, the Portuguese, though never establishing their desired hegemony over the Indian Ocean, introduced a fundamental shift away from the ‘cosmopolitan’ practices that predominated when ‘Asia was the world economy’, particularly in their attack on ‘the principle – common throughout the region – that the sea belonged to no one’ and in their use of ‘force to redirect trade’. What Portuguese entry into this arena inaugurated was ‘the age of mercantilism, trade wars, and a Europe-centred world economy’ that the more successful Dutch and English monopolistic corporations and imperial states would later entrench. Trampling upon the dialogic negotiations that <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> both represents and mimics, state-imposed warfare and enforced monopoly are shown to replace it with monologic authoritarian structures.</p>
<p>This is highlighted by the text’s juxtaposition of the expansive trade relations of the medieval Indian Ocean world with the degraded ones of the postcolonial present that are represented by Abu-‘Ali’s shop in the Egyptian village in which Ghosh-the-ethnographer resides. Proprietor of the only retail outlet in the area, Abu-‘Ali has acquired a trading monopoly by currying favour with the authorities, while his wealth is dependent on the exploitation of his customers. Profiting further from the war between Iraq and Iran, Abu-‘Ali – himself now puffed up like a python in a corporeal manifestation of the stranglehold that his gluttony and avarice exerts over the village – is found on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh’s (1992)</xref> return visit a few years later to have risen ‘to an estate where neither his family nor his neighbours were fit to use his furniture’ (pp. 298–299). Presented as antithetical to this trade that profits from war and state-enforced monopoly and sunders rather than sutures community is the ‘free exchange’ of the medieval Indian Ocean world (even as Ghosh shies away from the question of what such a phrase might mean for Bomma).</p>
<p>Ghosh sequences his narrative fragments in such a way that the European destruction of the peaceful trade he locates in the Indian Ocean is immediately followed by the chapter ‘Going Back’, which relates his return to Egypt on the eve of the Gulf War. Here, he finds that half of the village has left for Iraq in search of wages with which to enter more fully into what Ghosh presents as Western (technological) modernity. In stark contrast to the reconstructed experiences of Ben Yiju, these migrants face humiliating, even deadly, xenophobia abroad. The entangled skein of connections stretching across the Indian Ocean, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh (1992)</xref> reflects in a telling turn of phrase, ‘had been partitioned long ago’ (p. 40).</p>
<p>The arrival of technologised warfare as announced by Da Gama’s cannon-fire is held up as the dealing the ‘death knell’ to ‘centuries of dialogue’ and ‘a world of accommodations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 1992</xref>: 286, 237):
<disp-quote>
<p>Soon, the remains of the civilization that had brought Ben Yiju to Mangalore were devoured by that unquenchable, demonic thirst that has been raging ever since, for almost five hundred years, over the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 1992</xref>: 288)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374013482383">Ghosh (1992)</xref> submits after a devastating exchange between ‘the Imam and the Indian’ in an Egyptian village during the early 1980s, the only common language available within the South since the collapse of the Third World project is that of technologised warfare; thus, he concludes regretfully, we are all ‘travelling in the West’ (p. 237), enmeshed in the Cold War military–industrial complex and its globalising successor. The cosmopolitanism he evokes in this present is thus posed as ‘political alternative’ to the nation-state and as response to ‘the remilitarization of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0921374013482383">Cheah, 2006</xref>: 18–19) or the ‘armoured cosmopolitanism’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0921374013482383">Gilroy (2004</xref>: 289) also writes against.</p>
<p>Engaging in what Boym defines as ‘reflective’ rather than ‘restorative’ nostalgia, <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> works ‘contrapuntually, moving back and forth between the modern and the medieval while pointing out their contractions, as Boym puts it, “wistfully, ironically, desperately”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0921374013482383">Desai, 2004</xref>: 142). It peddles in fragrant fragments rather than seeking restored wholeness and is explicitly produced from amidst the flotsam piling up in the present. In this immediate post-Cold War moment – in which Area studies boundaries continue to divide Africa and Asia, while the legacies of the bipolar conflict play out in emergent configurations in the Middle East and ‘capitalism + empire’ reaches its apotheosis – Ghosh tacks back and forth across the Indian Ocean and its histories in order to resurface its cosmopolitan potentialities. This project is aimed at reanimating the ‘Bandung Spirit’ of a more recent past, with its ‘refusal of both economic subordination and cultural suppression’ and its desire to enact ‘a novel world order committed to human rights, self-determination and peace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0921374013482383">Lee, 2010</xref>; cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0921374013482383">Hofmeyr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0921374013482383">Prashad, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0921374013482383">Cheah (2006</xref>: 31) locates in the ‘Bandung model’ the ‘primary normative anchor of national consciousness’, for Ghosh it instead surfaces cosmopolitan practice from the ruins of the medieval Indian Ocean world. His useable past is apposite. As Lee notes, Bandung was not only an origin point but ‘also served as a culmination of connections and relationships that had crossed the Indian Ocean for centuries’; even as the common ground shared by the delegates from the 29 participating countries was ‘the history of Western imperialism in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East since the sixteenth century’: a ‘shared history of Western aggression’. What Ghosh is primarily drawn to in his ‘antique land’ is the idea of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. This ideal, reiterated by the declaration of Non-Aligned Movement, draws from the past the imaginative material from which to construct a future as yet unattained – and in fact increasingly threatened in the shifting geopolitics of our time in which – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0921374013482383">Kaplan (2010)</xref> ominously proclaims in his efforts to ward off the ‘post-American’ world anticipated by commentators such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0921374013482383">Zakaria (2011)</xref> – ‘the Indian Ocean … constitutes the new Great Game in geopolitics’.</p>
<p>It is in the face of such a future – ‘post-American’ or not – that Ghosh salvages from the ‘catastrophic’ wreckage of the Third World project and recycles as his intellectual rudder the Non-Aligned Movement’s emphasis on producing ‘a world governed by peace and justice’, and shaped by ‘mutual development’ rather than ‘brute force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0921374013482383">Prashad, 2007</xref>: xviii, 13, 96).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0921374013482383">9</xref></sup> Ghosh is himself quite clear that his backward glance is not the retrogressive gaze of ‘restorative’ nostalgia. Although, in ‘Confessions of a Xenophile,’ he admits to the temptation to ‘look back on the days of non-alignment with some nostalgia’, he acknowledges ‘it would be idle to pretend that solutions could be found by looking backwards in time’:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I have reflected on it here, it is not in order to suggest that we should try to turn back the clock – as religious fundamentalists seek to do – nor in order to fall back on an ideology of permanent victimhood … I have pointed to that period, rather, in order to evoke the desires and hopes that animated it, in particular its strain of xenophilia, to its yearning for a certain kind of universalism – not a universalism merely of principles and philosophy, but one of face-to-face encounters, of everyday experience. Except that this time we must correct the mistake that lay at the heart of that older anti-colonial impulse – which is that we must not only include the West within this spectrum of desire, we must also acknowledge that both the West and we ourselves have been irreversibly changed by our encounter with each other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2009b</xref>: 41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The project of <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> is thus to salvage from the accumulated flotsam of the distant and recent past a new universalism given shape by but not limited to the South – one that acknowledges the co-constitution and complicity of North and South that is also a product of the Portuguese rounding of the Cape. Nonetheless, the apology for slavery in its medieval Indian Ocean manifestations issued therein remains symptomatic of a necessary forgetting or erasure in the figuring of the cosmopolitan ideal as nurtured in the world of commerce and consumption. It is my contention that this occlusion is one that <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> might be seen to address, albeit from an unexpected angle.</p>

Whereas <italic>In an Antique Land</italic> invites a reading attentive to the salvage of flotsam from the wreckage of an oceanic world, <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> directs attention to what we might symbolically describe as the jetsam – the jettisoned abject – of the current world order. Challenging the boundaries circumscribing social and political life along with the species border, it enumerates a relation to the very matter of the globe evoked in the phrase ‘citizen of the world’. At the same time, it seeks to account for the subjects disposed by the nation-state and those consumed by the commodity hunger that composes the ‘antique land’ as trading arena.</p>
<p>Extending its temporal reach into the ‘deep time of geology’, <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> reads the traces of continents in motion in the Ganga River flowing from the Himalayas mountain range thrown up by the impact of the colliding landmasses and extending deep into the ocean, carving out its underwater course along the sea-floor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 180-181). Set along the ‘transitive’ medium (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0921374013482383">Clingman, 2009</xref>) of this river in what it terms the ‘tide country’ of West Bengal – the ‘archipelago of islands’ comprising the Sundarbans delta where the Ganga unfurls into the Indian Ocean – it wades into a littoral ecosystem that includes the largest surviving mangrove forests and contiguous tiger population in the world today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0921374013482383">Anand, 2008</xref>: 25), along with the nearly extinct or critically threatened Gangetic and Irrawaddy dolphins and a human population of approximately 4 million settlers drawn to the tide country by a series of utopian social projects (some fled caste restrictions, and others were displaced by the imposed border dividing Bengal). Evocatively rendered in the narrative is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0921374013482383">Pearson (2006</xref>: 373) defines as ‘littoral society’: ‘amphibious’ in lifestyle and syncretic and cosmopolitan in culture and belief. What we might term the ‘cultural ecology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0921374013482383">Buell, 2005</xref>) of the tide country is said to be ‘shaped not only by rives of silt, but also rivers of language: Bengali, English, Arabic, Hindi, Arakanese and who knows what else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 247).</p>
<p>The setting functions as far more than backdrop. On the one hand, it has an agentive presence to the extent that it appears almost as character in the plot;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0921374013482383">10</xref></sup> on the other, its rhythms of ebb and flow come to emplot the narrative itself (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0921374013482383">Gurr, 2010</xref>) in similar ways to how the monsoon-regime shapes <italic>In an Antique Land</italic>. In this portrayal, the nature–culture division collapses. As a priori a ‘process geography’, the tide country moreover presents a resonant novelistic chronotope of a boundary-less world in constant motion. ‘The rivers’ channels’, reports the narrator, ‘are spread across the land like a fine-mesh net, creating a terrain where the boundaries between land are water are always mutating, always unpredictable’, and in which there are ‘no borders … to divide fresh water from salt, river from sea’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0921374013482383">11</xref></sup> while the ‘currents are so powerful as to reshape the islands almost daily’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>Various time zones emerge and retreat with the tides, seeping into the narrative present of the early twenty-first century in which Kanai, a translator from New Delhi, and Piya, a United States cetologist of Indian origin, are along with Fokir, a local-yet-displaced fisherman, drawn into the eye of a storm. These include the ill-fated imperial construction of Port Canning, erased by the cyclone of 1867, a settlement project for Dalits in 1920, the cyclone of 1970, the habitation of the island of Morichjhapi by refugees in 1978 and their massacre a year later. Interspersed with the time of human history is the deep geological time in which the Sundarbans were formed, the recent past in which the delta teemed with marine mammals and a looming future of dwindling fish stock, dolphin extinction and increased cyclonic activity.</p>
<p>In writing the novel, Ghosh describes himself as having been ‘concerned with the dilemma of how to balance human needs with nature’ given that the settlers populating the islands ‘are some of the poorest people in the world’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0921374013482383">Pulugurtha, 2010</xref>: 82); at the same time, he identifies the environment as ‘absolutely the fundamental question of our time’, which ‘writers of [his] generation have a duty to address’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2009b</xref>: 137). He seeks to strike the desired balance through a littoral imagination that dissolves distinctions between apparently opposed categories and which disperses agency without losing sight of the forces of power assembling against the ecosystem and its human components.</p>
<p>Two literary allusions in close proximity elaborate the position he is taking: Conrad’s <italic>Heart of Darkness</italic> – evoked with the phrase ‘the horror’ and a denial of coevalness between metropolitan and local subjects – and Melville’s <italic>Moby-Dick</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 300, 304). The gesture to Conrad, for whom Ghosh has repeatedly expressed aversion and whom he, like Chinua Achebe, reads as fundamentally racist, references a deathly conflict between man and tiger that is in this inter-textual moment spliced into one between human and (disposable) human. Melville, whose <italic>Moby-Dick</italic> has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0921374013482383">Buell (2001)</xref> as ‘a book calculated to unsettle one’s assumptions about the borderlines between the human and the nonhuman’, is elsewhere applauded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0921374013482383">Ghosh (2010</xref>: 17) for being ‘one of the very few nineteenth-century writers who took time to look at the world of the lascars [Indian sailors] with some attention’. Ghosh’s affinity with Melville is thus dual and the allusion entwines a cosmopolitan social vision with one permeating the species border. Rather than merely balancing the apparently opposed interests of human versus nature, what that novel comes to present through its references and emplotment is instead an entangled ecosystem.</p>
<p>Alluding to <italic>Moby-Dick</italic> while taking up an activist position against a proposed development project that, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0921374013482383">Ghosh (2004)</xref> hypothesises, is ultimately a cover for oil extraction, the story of <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> is entered into a larger plot of resource plunder that stretches from whale oil to petroleum. This plot, of course, drives industrialisation, producing what some, following Crutzen, describe as the ‘Anthropocene Age’ in which humans wield a geological force; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0921374013482383">Chakrabarty (2009</xref>: 207) puts it, the distinction between natural and human histories has in this age ‘begun to collapse’.</p>
<p>The outlook for littoral societies from this present is particularly poor (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0921374013482383">Nixon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0921374013482383">Pearson, 2006</xref>). Like other littoral locations, the Sundarbans face a set of entwined pressures that threaten its ability to sustain human and non-human life. These include post-independence modernisation, tourism, pollution, global warming and other forces of environmental disruption and degradation, along with the seemingly insatiable hunger for oil that raises global temperatures and enhances the hunger of the tides. Writing at least partly in response and resistance to these forces, as his essay ‘Folly in the Sundarbans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2004</xref>) elaborates, Ghosh begins unravelling the knot of interests that have woven a deadly web over the tide country. He notes both the potential environmental degradation consequent on the ‘enormous new tourism complex’ planned for the Sundarbans and the further ‘folly’ of such a venture in ‘one of the most active cyclone regions in the world’, arguing for the ‘near certainty’ of ‘another devastating storm … in this era of global warming’. Simultaneously threatening environmental destruction and imperilled by the forces of nature unleashed in the Anthropocene Age, the development, notes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0921374013482383">Ghosh (2004)</xref>, would moreover (re)displace its human inhabitants and make a mockery of their suffering:
<disp-quote>
<p>the islands of the Sundarbans are not ‘virgin’ in any sense. Many, if not most of the islands have been populated at some time or the other. In fact several islands were forcibly depopulated in order to make room for Project Tiger. In 1979 the Left Front government evicted tens of thousands of refugee settlers, mainly Dalits, from the island of Morichjhapi. The cost in lives is still unaccounted, but it is likely that thousands were killed. The eviction was justified on ecological grounds … It is scarcely conceivable that a government run by the same Left Front is now thinking of handing over a substantial part of the Sundarbans to an industrial house like Sahara Parivar … The Sahara Parivar’s project would turn large stretches of this very forest, soaked in the blood of evicted refugees, into a playground for the affluent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sounding a site in which human and non-human life has been disastrously positioned in antagonistic stances while in the wings the territorial state prepares to sell its contested grounds to the footloose tourist class, Ghosh, like his characters, trawls through mud rather than aspiring for the security of solid ground as he forges an ‘eco-cosmopolitan’ vision that embraces rather than abject human subjects while producing ‘a story about environmental <italic>and</italic> social injustice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0921374013482383">Weik, 2006</xref>: 120; emphasis added).</p>
<p>Much of the novel is concerned with retrieving the story of the jettisoned humans massacred by the state in the interests of Project Tiger. Establishing a refuge for the Bengal tiger ‘hunted to near-extinction in other parts of India, especially during colonial times’, this project was undertaken by Indira Gandhi ‘to win international prestige for India’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0921374013482383">Huggan and Tiffin, 2010</xref>: 185), in the process underwriting the state’s potential as a broker of global capital while performing an act of postcolonial redress. When refugees settled on an island set aside for tiger conservation, the government of West Bengal, in collusion with or under pressure from the World Wildlife Fund, took steps to evict them. The massacre that haunts the narrative ensued. As Ghosh presents it, uncounted and unaccounted for lives are lost; the women taken away and ‘used’ before being ‘thrown into the rivers’: ‘[t]he sea claimed them all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 279). In the tide country, however, flood follows ebb, and their stories return in the notebook bequeathed to Kanai by his uncle – until it, too, is reclaimed by the mud.</p>
<p>What the retreating narrative tide exposes are the ways in which the apparently inherent and intractable conflict between human and non-human animals is produced by historical forces set in motion by colonialism, the nation-state and neoliberal globalisation. These stretch from colonial destruction of symbiotic environments and obscene hunting spectacles demonstrating European masculinist mastery over nature to Partition and the arbitrary carving up of the subcontinent that produced waves of refugees, including those later fleeing the Bangladesh War. They culminate in India’s jostling for a place at the superpower table that manifests in Project Tiger and the proposed development of the Sundarbans into a tourist playground (which Ghosh’s novel has, for now at least, helped to avert).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0921374013482383">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Refusing what Mukherjee describes as a projected ‘scenario in which [the refugees are] seen as competing for scarce resources <italic>against</italic> other “natural” agents like animals and the mangrove forest’, which ‘presume[s] a fundamental difference between human and non-human communities’, Ghosh asks readers to reconceptualise environmentalism beyond the external critique of the ecological movement and the co-options of the green economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0921374013482383">13</xref></sup> Not least among the continuities between humans and non-humans traced in the novel is their shared exposure to state violence performed in the name of ‘conservation’: uniformed men in Forest Department motorboats both massacre the Morichjhapi population and are later identified as responsible for the death of the dolphin calf whose presence earlier signalled a potentially self-sustaining population (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0921374013482383">Anand, 2008</xref>: 39).</p>
<p>In the face of the threat assembling against it, Ghosh asks readers to apprehend the entangled ecosystems comprising the Sundarbans (including the marine life supported by it and the terrestrial lives – of fishermen and their families – it in turn supports as it hosts symbiotic partnerships entangling the interests of human and non-human). These are presented as unravelling under the reign of ‘capitalism + empire’. For instance, lucrative prawning ventures using new nylon nets are reported to be destroying the fishing grounds, while opposition to them is thwarted by traders paying off politicians; ‘in fifteen years the fish will all be gone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 134), reflects a character, evoking the disastrous consequences for both ‘nature’ and ‘humankind’.</p>
<p>Implicit in this denunciation and the broader one issued at the proposed development of the Sundarbans is the argument advanced by environmental justice activists: that the reduction of poverty and human inequality, on the one hand, and the attainment of environmental sustainability, on the other, can best be achieved in conjunction rather than being set in competition. Such moves are entered into by collapsing the distinction between human and nature or permeating this defining border of species exceptionalism. This is most keenly visible in the novel as the cyclone gathers force and beats its path through the Sundarbans. Piya and Fokir first sit together in ‘animal’ silence before seeking shelter in a tree, only to spot a tiger doing similarly next to them. Earlier, too, Piya is drawn to acknowledge her human subjectivity as part of ‘nature’ and becomes aware of the extent to which her research is driven and determined by crabs and tides rather than her own intentionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 142). As nature–culture and object–subject binaries fray and enfold, readers are brought to recognition of the human–non-human assemblages theorised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0921374013482383">Latour (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>The most spectacular collapse occurs during the cyclonic storm that nearly – though not quite – draws the narrative to closure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0921374013482383">14</xref></sup> As other readers of the novel note, water ‘is a constant actant in the novel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0921374013482383">Huggan and Tiffin, 2010</xref>: 190), ‘shaping not only the story but also the geography and history of the land’ with its ‘unusual agency … – its potential to act, as well as to move from object/other position to that of the subject and, in doing so, reverse the object/subject status of the characters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0921374013482383">Anand, 2008</xref>). Among the things it acts upon are the human made and enforced geopolitical borders Ghosh’s oeuvre writes against.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0921374013482383">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In granting nature an agentive presence Ghosh is, however, careful to avoid a consequent abrogation of human responsibility, as well as a flattening out of the human subject by denying its differential vulnerability to catastrophe. The disaster represented in the novel issues from ‘nature’, yet over the ending looms the more total threat of extinction and social devastation that might yet be wrought by the self-styled ‘eco-tourist’ development. As Ghosh’s linking of global warming to increased cyclone frequency in the region suggests, over the represented world hangs the shadow cast by <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> as geological force of nature. Yet, that Fokir alone does not survive this particular cyclone issues a reminder of the ‘fact that the crisis of climate change will be routed through all our “anthropological differences”’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0921374013482383">Chakrabarty (2012)</xref> notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>however anthropogenic the current global warming may be in its origins, there is no corresponding ‘humanity’ that in its oneness can act as a political agent. A place thus remains for struggles around questions on intrahuman justice regarding the uneven impacts of climate change. (p. 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The revised conflict Ghosh begins to unravel – not between jettisoned human and non-human, but between an ecosystem in which both are entangled, on the one hand, and ‘capitalism + empire’, on the other – is one to which neither local nor global responses are in isolation adequate: the forces the text seeks to confront mesh local and global interests (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0921374013482383">Weik, 2006</xref>: 120).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0921374013482383">16</xref></sup> As Weik suggests, the position Ghosh takes to this end is one that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0921374013482383">Heise (2008</xref>: 59) describes as ‘eco-cosmopolitan’. This position seeks to extend the cosmopolitan recognition of shared humanity – crossing the species boundary to recognise a shared embedding in local ecosystems – while simultaneously opening up the environmentalist’s place-bound myopia to the global condition. It enables Ghosh to interweave his concern for abject peoples and natural biospheres. Avoiding the move by which the ‘environmentalist advocacy of place has all too often morphed into hostility toward displaced people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0921374013482383">Nixon, 2011</xref>: 239), Ghosh simultaneously addresses the global reach and local manifestation of the environmental crisis to which the old slogan of the Green Movement – ‘Think Global, Act Local – is manifestly inadequate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0921374013482383">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>‘An indispensible first step in the direction of such an eco-cosmopolitan awareness’, proposes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0921374013482383">Heise (2008</xref>: 59), ‘is the acknowledgement of “varieties of environmentalism”, as Ramachandra Guha and Juan Martinez-Alier have labeled the divergent motivations of efforts for the protection of nature in different regions of the world’ (p. 59). This is indeed the culmination of Piya’s journey as she comes, by the end of the novel, to recognise and acknowledge the ‘environmentalism of the poor’ practised by the indigent local fisherman Fokir (noting, for instance, that his fishing lines are too flimsy to pose any threat to the dolphin population, whereas the lucrative prawning industry draws an entire ecosystem into its maw). Surviving the storm to which he – drawing on his intimate environmental knowledge – martyrs himself to save her life, Piya returns to the tide country to establish a partnership with the local Trust run by Kanai’s aunt, Nilima, and names her cetological research project in Fokir’s honour. While her research records were lost in the cyclone, her GPS has stored all the dolphin routes to which he introduced her. ‘Nilima’, we are told, ‘fell silent as she pondered the mysteries of Fokir and his boat, writing a log of their journeys and locking it away in the stars’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 398–399). Here, we find Ghosh bringing ‘local histories’ into ‘dialogical’ relation with ‘global designs’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0921374013482383">Mignolo, 2000</xref>) in ways that set subject and object relations in a state of ebb and flow rather than stabilising them along the directional vectors of global ‘capitalism + empire’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0921374013482383" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> ends with Piya and Nilima celebrating their new partnership and declaring themselves at home: for Piya, ‘home is where the Orcaella are’, while, for Nilima, ‘home is wherever I can brew a pot of good tea’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374013482383">Ghosh, 2005a</xref>: 400). If in coming to rest on the concept of ‘home’ the novel seems to evoke the ‘local attachments’ of environmental discourse encoded in ‘dwelling’ rather than the ‘environmental world citizenship’ towards which scholars such as Heise seek to direct ecological criticism, Ghosh’s refiguring of home opens up this space and its implications. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0921374013482383">Clifford (1997)</xref> has said of <italic>In an Antique Land</italic>, we conclude here too with a sense of ‘dwelling-in-travel’ (p. 2). Piya’s at-home-ness with dolphins bespeaks a de-territorialised at-oneness with nature, while, in professing herself to be at home in the tide country, she shifts its value from ‘scientific “field”’ defined by ‘the exclusion of intimate involvement’ to a ‘place of habitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0921374013482383">Mukherjee, 2010</xref>: 112, 131). As for Nimila’s ‘pot of good tea’: Ghosh is across his oeuvre far too attuned to the ‘social life of things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0921374013482383">Appadurai, 1986</xref>) and particularly to the flows of commodities organised by ‘capitalism + empire’ – pepper, oil, teak, rubber, sugar, opium and so on – not to be having a dig at constructions of national culture and their repressed hybrid and mercantile histories, surfacing in the domestic repose of this conclusion a ‘world fundamentally characterised by objects in motion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0921374013482383">Appadurai, 2000</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Evidencing a keen sense of place, Ghosh’s ecological vision resists the xenophobic impulse and appeals to the global community to check the sovereignty of the local state. While elaborating a cosmopolitan placed-ness that is deeply local, he ensures that it is one – like the mangrove forests themselves – held in place by roots entwining in the relational and fluid medium of water and the mutable, porous ground silting up in it. The cosmopolitan vision Ghosh produces from his ‘antique land’ and ‘tide country’ chimes with the expansive definition proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0921374013482383">Pollock et al. (2000)</xref> in their special issue of <italic>Public Culture</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cosmopolitanism, in its wide and wavering nets, catches something of our need to ground our sense of mutuality and conditions of mutability, and to learn to live tenaciously in terrains of historic and cultural <italic>transition</italic> … A cosmopolitanism grounded in the tenebrous moment of transition is distinct from other more triumphalist notions of cosmopolitical coexistence. (pp. 580–581)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Neither triumphant nor apocalyptic, <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic> eschews concluding with mastery over the storm or foregrounding the storm as event in favour of a quotidian ending, leaving in place catastrophe as ongoing process (the tide country, after all, is a place where ‘catastrophe … [is] a way of life’ [79]) and settling upon the ‘precarity’ of living on ‘besides oneself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0921374013482383">Butler, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0921374013482383">2004b</xref>) in the mutable, mutual dwelling place of the littoral zone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0921374013482383">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this conclusion, Ghosh returns readers to that of <italic>In an Antique Land</italic>, where the vulnerable singular subject erased in History’s onslaught implicitly issues the appeal for a cosmopolitan alternative to the state of war that marchers unchecked across the uneven geography of the current world ‘order’. Across the two texts, then, we can trace the unfolding of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0921374013482383">Gilroy (2004</xref>: 290) describes as a ‘planetary consciousness’ that emerges out of anti-colonialism to apprehend the world as ‘not a limitless globe, but a small, fragile, and finite place, one planet among others with strictly limited resources that are unequally allocated’. Initially enamoured with trade and advancing a Kantian conception of hospitality premised thereon, this consciousness ultimately comes to register across Ghosh’s oeuvre the world-reducing hungers of commerce and the impossibility of transcending the finitude of nature.</p>

The essay pays extensive attention to the human (political, cultural and economic) factors that lent the natural event its catastrophic force (not least being the hubristic desire for superpower status of the Indian nation-state and the misplaced Mediterranean aesthetic that favours sea-front living) and, when searching for an illustrative comparison, points to Hiroshima after the bomb.

<disp-quote><p>the story of capital, the contingent history of our falling into the Anthropocene cannot be denied by recourse to the idea of species, for the Anthropocene would not have been possible, even as a theory, without the history of industrialization. How do we hold the two together as we think the history of the world since the Enlightenment? How do we relate to a universal history of life – to universal thought, that is – while retaining what is of obvious value in our postcolonial suspicion of the universal? The crisis of climate change calls for thinking simultaneously on both registers, to mix together the immiscible chronologies of capital and species history. (pp. 219–220)</p></disp-quote></p>

<disp-quote><p>climate change poses for us a question of a human collectivity, an us, pointing to a figure of the universal that escape our capacity to experience the world. It is more like a universal that arises from a shared sense of a catastrophe. It calls for a global approach to politics without the myth of a global identity, for, unlike a Hegelian universal, it cannot subsume particularities. We may provisionally call it a ‘negative universal history’. (p. 222)</p></disp-quote></p>
