<p>Continuous measurements of number concentrations and size distributions of particles with diameters of 7–225 nm and 100–2,000 nm were conducted, using a TSI scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and an optical particle counter (OPC), respectively, in eight weekdays of 2005 at a roadside environment in Hong Kong. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations, black carbon (BC), particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (p-PAHs), traffic counts and meteorological parameters were simultaneously monitored every hour. On average, the total particle number concentrations were 50,235 ± 27,076 cm<sup>−3</sup> in the SMPS size range and 5,771 ± 1,793 cm<sup>−3</sup> in the OPC size range in the winter sampling days, exceeding the summer particle number concentrations by a factor of 1.5 and 2.5, respectively. The ultrafine mode particles accounted for ∼90% of the particles in the SMPS size range. Daily cycle of particle numbers in the SMPS size range were obvious, with high values during daytime and low values during nigh time, which is consistent with the traffic pattern, especially the diesel-fuelled vehicles (<italic>r</italic> = 0.72). Moreover, these particles were found to have good correlations with BC (<italic>r</italic> = 0.84) and p-PAHs (<italic>r</italic> = 0.90). The findings have suggested that diesel-fuelled vehicle exhausts are the dominant source for ultrafine particles at roadside environments of Hong Kong.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X12445490"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Experimental evidence in epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X12445490">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X12445490"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12445490">3</xref>] have shown that exposure to ultrafine particles has a strong effect on health, compared to exposure to fine particles (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm) and to coarse particles (particles with aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 µm and 10 µm) at equivalent masses. High numbers of ultrafine particles have been shown to overwhelm the human body’s defence mechanisms, travelling across the lungs and into vital organs such as the heart and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X12445490">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12445490"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X12445490">6</xref>]. Through investigating the health effects of human’s exposure to real-world diesel ultrafine particles, Diaz-Sanchez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12445490">7</xref>] found that diesel exhaust particles may increase allergic sensitization.</p>
<p>Traffic is the most important source for ultrafine particles in urban areas, which contribute significantly to ambient atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12445490">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X12445490"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X12445490">10</xref>]. There were 581,487 licensed vehicles in Hong Kong by the end of 2007, representing an increase of 2% in comparison with those in 2006. New vehicles are added each year to the existing large vehicle population and the inadequate street and roadway networks. The vehicle density in Hong Kong is ranked one of the highest in the world, with 581,487 vehicles on the road of only 1,900 km, and one would expect that the number concentrations of ultrafine particles near roads are high.</p>
<p>Short-term measurements of particle numbers have been conducted in urban, tunnel and rural areas of Hong Kong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12445490">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X12445490"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X12445490">13</xref>]. According to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12445490">11</xref>] with an engine exhaust particle sizer (5.6–560 nm), the aerosol representative of rural area particles consisted of a single mode at 50 nm, which was formed by a combination of condensation and coagulation growth of nucleation mode particles. Outside of a roadway tunnel with heavy traffic, ultrafine particle counts peaked at 10 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12445490">11</xref>]. Inside the tunnel, the 10 nm ultrafine particle counts decreased with distance into the tunnel. The 50-nm particle counts increased continuously from entrance to exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12445490">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Ultrafine particle number counts and size distributions in Hong Kong need to be monitored to better understand how human exposure can vary temporally and with the source contributors and this could also have an important impact on exposures in homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X12445490">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X12445490"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X12445490">16</xref>]. The dispersion of fine particles in a street canyon in Hong Kong has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X12445490">17</xref>]. In this study, number concentrations and size distributions of particles with sizes ranging from 7 to 2,000 nm were investigated at a roadside environment in Hong Kong. The aims of the study were to

<sec id="sec3-1420326X12445490"><title>Sampling Site</title>
<p>The monitoring was conducted in the campus of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PU), a typical roadside location in urban Hong Kong impacted mostly by primary vehicular emissions. The sampling station (the PU Roadside Station) was located in a street canyon, about 1–2 metres away from the kerb along Hong Chong Road, Hong Kong. With four lanes in each direction, Hong Chong Road is one of the busiest cross-harbour roads in Hong Kong. The traffic numbers were extremely high during the sampling periods, with daily average traffic number of more than 120,000. The diurnal variations of fleet compositions were constant for each day, with high traffic numbers during daytime and low values during night time. During daytime, over 6,000 vehicles per hour passed the sampling site, of which about 30% were diesel-fuelled vehicles, 60% were gasoline-fuelled vehicles, and 10% were liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-fuelled taxies. The lowest traffic activity was observed during early morning from 2:00 to 5:00, with about ∼2,000 vehicles per hour.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1420326X12445490"><title>Measurements of Particle Numbers and Size Distributions</title>
<p>In order to obtain size distribution of particles with a wide size range, two particle counters were used in this study. Particles with diameters between 7 and 225 nm were measured using a TSI scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The SMPS system comprises of a TSI Model 3081 electrostatic classifier (EC) and a TSI Model 3022A condensation particle counter (CPC). Particles were first drawn into the EC, classified into 64 channels in a diameter range of 5.9–225 nm using an electrical mobility detection technique and then counted using the CPC. The flow rate of aerosols was 1.5 L·m<sup>−1</sup>. It should be noted that peaks due to large particle numbers at the lower end of the size distribution is highly uncertain due to the imperfect solution of the multiple-charge inversion. Thus, observations of peaks of the particles below 7 nm were not considered in this study to avoid the artefacts.</p>
<p>Particles with diameters between 100 and 2,000 nm were measured in eight channels using a LASAIR Model 1003 (Particle Measuring Systems, Inc., US) optical particle counter (OPC). Sample air was drawn through a laser beam by a small vacuum pump operated at 0.028 L·m<sup>−1</sup>. As entrained particles in the air passed through the laser beam, the laser light interacted with the particles and was scattered. The burst of light energy from each particle was converted into a pulse of electrical energy to determine the size and quantity of the particles.</p>
<p>Since the traffic density and composition on the road is stable, particle number and size distributions at the sampling station was assumed to be constant within a season. Continuous sampling was conducted in non-rainy weekdays of 6th (Tuesday), 11th (Thursday), 20th (Tuesday), 21st (Friday) Jan, 12th (Thursday), 13th (Wednesday), 14th (Tuesday) and 15th (Friday) July 2005. The SMPS and OPC were operated simultaneously. Both the SMPS system and the OPC used in this study were brand-new instruments pre-calibrated and certified by the manufacturer. The sampling interval was 3 min for the SMPS system and 2 seconds for the OPC, respectively. The SMPS data were stored as 30 min averages in the computer. The instruments were placed on a bench in an air-conditioned shelter, with individual sampling inlets outside. One silicagel dryer was added to each sampling line to avoid water condensation inside the instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12445490">8</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X12445490"><title>Measurements of Particulate Matters (PMs), Black Carbon and Particle-bound Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
<p>The PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm), PM<sub>10</sub> (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 µm), and BC were monitored by an automated dichotomous monitor SPM-613D (Kimoto electric co., Ltd., Japan), which was designed to continuously measure PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and BC at a 1-h interval. The SPM-613D aspirated the ambient aerosol through a standard 16.7 L·m<sup>−1</sup> inlet and introduced the fractionated PM<sub>10</sub> aerosol into a custom-designed virtual impactor. The virtual impactor has the advantage of being able to sample not only PM<sub>2.5</sub> but also PM<sub>10-2.5</sub> simultaneously. The PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> deposited on Teflon filters were quantified by beta gauge method and the BC concentrations from the PM<sub>2.5</sub> channel were determined by optical method. The reflection of LED light by particles was measured continuously to determine the BC concentrations.</p>
<p>Continuous particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (p-PAHs) was measured using a photoelectric aerosol sensor Model 2000 (Ecochem, US) with the method of photoionization of p-PAHs particles. Aerosol in air was irradiated by an excimer lamp. The aerosol particles that had p-PAHs molecules adsorbed on the surface emitted electrons that were subsequently removed when an electric field was applied. The remaining positively charged particles were collected on a filter inside an electrometer, where the charge was measured. The signal established by the resulting electric current was proportional to the concentration of total p-PAHs.</p>
<p>The meteorological parameters, including mixing height, solar radiation and wind speed, were measured in ambient atmosphere by the Hong Kong Observation. Vehicle numbers, speeds and types were obtained from the toll gate of the cross-harbour tunnel. The particle number concentrations, meteorological parameters and traffic counts were subsequently averaged at 1-h time resolution to align with SPM-613D data.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1420326X12445490"><title>Particle Number Concentrations</title>
<p>On average, the total particle number concentrations by SMPS were 50,235 ± 27,076 cm<sup>−3</sup> in winter and 34,077 ± 19,026 in summer. The total particle number concentrations by OPC were 5,771 ± 1,793 cm<sup>−3</sup> and 2,293 ± 1,031 cm<sup>−3</sup> in winter and summer, respectively. This clear seasonal variation of particle number concentrations, with high values in winter and low values in summer, has been reported in other cities, e.g., Helsinki, Finland (8–400 nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X12445490">18</xref>], Stockholm, Sweden (TSI Model 3022 CPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12445490">8</xref>], Augsburg, Germany (TSI Model 3022 CPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12445490">8</xref>], Rome and Barcelona, Italy and Spain (TSI Model 3022 CPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12445490">8</xref>] and in New Delhi, India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X12445490">19</xref>]. The summer total particle number concentration in the SMPS size range in the present study is close to the spring value (39,000 ± 35,000 cm<sup>−3</sup> for particles with diameters of 7–10,000 nm) reported by Roth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X12445490">20</xref>] who measured aerosols in the centre of Strasbourg, France, where there is a prevalence of high-density motor vehicle traffic daily. Most cities mentioned above are located in the Northern hemisphere, experiencing distinguished seasonal differences in terms of meteorological parameters, such as lower mixing layer height, greater atmospheric stability and lower temperature (increased nucleation events of combustion exhaust emitted from motor vehicles) in winter compared to summer. This explains high particle number concentrations in winter.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1420326X12445490"><title>Size Distributions of Particle Number</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12445490">Figure 1</xref> presents the average size distributions at a roadside environment in Hong Kong during winter and summer. The results conducted individually by the SMPS and OPC instruments are presented on the same figure. The particle number size distributions were characterized by one major peak in the ultrafine mode (particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 100 nm) and one minor peak in the accumulation mode (particles with aerodynamic diameters between 100 nm and 1000 nm), no matter whether in winter or summer. The particles were within the typical size range for particle number measurements at roadside sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X12445490">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X12445490"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X12445490"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X12445490"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X12445490">25</xref>]. The ultrafine mode dominated the particle emissions, accounting for ∼90% of the total particle number concentrations (the SMPS size range). The median diameter (MD) in the ultrafine mode was ∼23 nm during the wintertime. A shift of the MD to ∼34 nm during the summertime was found, which might be associated with the presence of particle growth in summer.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X12445490" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The typical size distributions of particle numbers (7–2,000 nm) at the Polytechnic University (PU) Roadside Station in winter (a) and in summer (b), in Hong Kong.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X12445490-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The minor peak in the accumulation mode was centred at ∼150 nm, no matter whether in winter or summer. The 100–225 nm particle number concentrations only accounted for ∼10% of the total particle emissions (the SMPS size range). Number concentrations of the OPC size range particles (100–2,000 nm) were found to decrease with an increase in particle diameter. The accumulation mode particles (100–1000 nm) were the major constituents of the total particles (the OPC size range), accounting for ∼99% of the total particle emissions. The total particle count in the OPC size range of 100–2000 nm was eight-fold lower than that in the SMPS size range of 7–225 nm in winter and thirteen-fold lower in summer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X12445490"><title>Size Distributions of Particle Mass, Volume and Surface</title>
<p>The knowledge of the size distribution of particulate mass, volume and surface, in addition to the particle number, is essential for the study of health effect. The number size distributions obtained at the roadside site were transformed to the size distribution of particle mass, volume and surface by assuming a spherical particle shape using soot density of 1.8 g·cm<sup>−3</sup>, which is a typical density for soot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X12445490">26</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X12445490">Figure 2</xref>, particle mass showed substantially different distribution with particle numbers. The particles in the accumulation mode, centred at ∼150 nm, dominated the aerosol mass, while the ultrafine particles, centred at ∼20 nm, composed the main part of particle numbers. The size distributions of volume were similar to those of particle mass. A priory study by Yao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X12445490">27</xref>] also found a similar volume distribution with a peak at 200 ± 100 nm in vehicle plumes in Hong Kong. The accumulation mode particles were formed as a result of the coagulation and condensation growths of soot particles emitted from vehicle tail pipe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X12445490">27</xref>]. The particle surface area size distributions at the roadside site were characterized by one major peak in the accumulation mode and one minor peak in the ultrafine mode, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X12445490">Figure 2</xref>. For the same mass of particles, the health effects are stronger for particles with larger surface areas. In addition, particle surface area affects heterogeneous chemical reactions in atmosphere, such as the production of nitrous acid or the removal of free radicals such as HO<sub>2</sub>.

<sec id="sec10-1420326X12445490"><title>Daily Evolution</title>
<p>The daily cycles of total particle number concentrations for the SMPS and OPC sizes were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X12445490">Figure 3</xref>. The particle number concentrations in the SMPS size range showed obvious daily cycles during weekdays, with high concentrations in daytime and low concentrations in night time, which is consistent with the daily pattern of diesel-fuelled vehicle numbers (correlation coefficient [<italic>r</italic>] is equal to 0.72). The maximum of the hourly average concentrations was detected during the rush hours in the morning (∼9:00 am) or evening (∼17:00 pm), and the minimum was found in the early morning (∼3:00 am) with the least traffic. Ultrafine particles at the roadside site are emitted directly by vehicles or formed during the emission, dilution, cooling and mixing of the exhausts with the ambient air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X12445490">28</xref>]. Additionally, dispersion effect by wind was found in the present study. In winter, the maximum of the hourly average concentrations occurred in the evening rush hour rather than the morning rush hours due to high wind speed during that period. In summer noon–afternoon, particle number concentrations decreased when wind speed became high. The OPC size range particles showed similar diurnal variations, but they were not as pronounced as the SMPS size range particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X12445490">17</xref>].

</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X12445490">Figure 4</xref> shows the evolution of particle size distributions on a typical summer day (14 July). On 14 July, two peaks of nanoparticle (&lt;50 nm) number concentrations were measured at 9:30 am and 11:00 am, respectively. Obviously, the first peak was formed due to the increased vehicle numbers during the morning rush hours because the solar radiation was quite low during that period. This means that the particles were not formed by nucleation processes in atmospheric reactions. Instead, they were freshly emitted directly from combustion sources or condensed on primary particles from cooled gases soon after emission. It seemed that the nanoparticle numbers, accompanied by the occurrence of high solar radiation value, reached a high level at 11:00 am, probably indicating a new particle growth due to nucleation process in the atmosphere. However, it is not easy to conclude whether there was new particle growth in the atmosphere in this case, because the evolution of particle size distributions did not exhibit size growth as did particle sizes in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X12445490">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X12445490">30</xref>]. This at least demonstrated that no obvious nucleation process occurred in the atmosphere of roadside microenvironment or that the nucleation process was too poor to be detectable. This result was expected because the sampling location was a source-dominated site with a considerable number of fresh particles continuously emitted into atmosphere from 6:00 am to 23:00 pm each day. New particle growths by nucleation are less favourable in polluted urban atmospheres than the growths by the condensation of low-volatility vapours onto existing particles due to the high pre-existing particle surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X12445490">24</xref>].

<p>The current air quality standards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epd-asg.gov.hk/english/backgd/hkaqo.html">http://www.epd-asg.gov.hk/english/backgd/hkaqo.html</ext-link>) for particles are expressed in terms of particle mass concentrations, either of PM<sub>2.5</sub> or PM<sub>10</sub>. Since the increased evidence from epidemiological and toxicological studies revealed strong associations between ultrafine particles and health effects, the problems whether current particulate standard of particle mass is able to reflect the level of particle number have been studied by researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X12445490">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X12445490">32</xref>]. If it is, the number concentrations of ultrafine particles also can be reduced with the elimination of the current particulate standard. In the present study, the hourly total particle numbers by SMPS were compared to the hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations by collocated SPM-613D using the linear regression method and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X12445490">Figure 5</xref>. It can be seen that the correlation was poor between ultrafine particle number concentrations (the SMPS size range) and PM mass (<italic>r</italic> = 0.51 for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and <italic>r</italic> = 0.50 for PM<sub>10</sub>), implying that the reduction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> or PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations had no obvious effect on ultrafine particle number concentrations. It is reasonable because ∼90% of the particle numbers by SMPS were in ultrafine size range, which is insignificant in mass. This finding is supported by several previous studies in other cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X12445490">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X12445490">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X12445490">34</xref>].

<p>Molnár et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X12445490">23</xref>] has reported a good correlation between accumulation mode particles (100–368 nm) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass. In the present study, the accumulation mode particles (the OPC size range) also showed good correlations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass, with the correlation coefficients of 0.86 for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 0.85 for PM<sub>10</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X12445490">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, the results from linear regression suggest that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations were dominated by particles in the accumulation mode and did not represent the changes of ultrafine particle number concentrations. Therefore, particle mass (such as PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) can be a surrogate measurement for accumulation particle number but not for ultrafine particle number in the roadside environment.</p>
<p>Ultrafine particles (the SMPS size range) showed good correlations with BC and p-PAHs concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X12445490">Figure 3</xref>), with correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.90, respectively. Previous study by Rodriguez and Cuevas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X12445490">28</xref>] also reported a good correlation between ultrafine particle and BC. BC has been proven to come mainly from diesel-fuelled vehicle exhausts in Hong Kong (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epd.gov.hk/">http://www.epd.gov.hk/</ext-link>) and by studies carried out in other cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X12445490">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X12445490">36</xref>]. The present study has further illustrated that primary diesel-fuelled vehicle exhausts were the dominant source of BC, p-PAHs and ultrafine particles in the roadside environment. Poor correlations were observed between the accumulation mode particles (the OPC size range) and BC and p-PAHs, with the correlation coefficient of 0.17 for each, suggesting these particles were from different sources.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1420326X12445490"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The hourly particle number concentrations in the SMPS and OPC size ranges were measured in the roadside microenvironment during January and July 2005. Particle number concentrations showed significant seasonal variations, with high values in the winter (50,235 ± 27,076 for the SMPS size range and 5,771 ± 1,793 cm<sup>−3</sup> for the OPC size range) and low values in the summer (34,077 ± 19,026 and 2,293 ± 1,031 cm<sup>−3</sup>, respectively). Distinctive variations on a daily cycle basis were also found, with high concentrations during daytime and low concentrations during night time. Ultrafine particles composed ∼90% of the total particle number concentrations in the SMPS size range. Ultrafine particles showed good correlations with p-PAHs and BC but poor correlations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations. Particles in the accumulation mode dominated the aerosol mass, volume and surface, showing good correlations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations but poor correlations with p-PAHs and BC. No obvious nucleation process occurred in the atmosphere of roadside microenvironment. The above findings in the present study suggest that the ultrafine particles, BC and p-PAHs in the roadside environment were mainly from primary diesel-fuelled vehicle emissions.</p>
