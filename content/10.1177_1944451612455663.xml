<p>There is significant literature showing improved outcomes in patients who are cared for in a specialized neurocritical care unit. The authors propose a model where the key aspects of specialized neurocrticial care can be provided within the framework of an existing ICU in an efficient and effective manner as an alternative to a separate neurocritical care unit. The key aspects of programmatic success are described.</p>

<p>The development of specialized neuro-ICUs has been an important development in patient care for those with a broad range of neurological diseases. The history of neurocritical care units (NCCUs) goes back, at least, to the 1950s and maybe even the 1930s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612455663">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612455663"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612455663">3</xref></sup> Multiple studies have shown a trend toward better outcomes for patients with neurological disease cared for in specially designated NCCUs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612455663">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612455663"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612455663"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612455663"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612455663">8</xref></sup> However, a beneficial effect of admission to specialized care units for neurologically injured patients has not always been found and studies vary as to which patient populations may benefit the most. In addition, it has been difficult to determine which elements of the NCCU may lead to better outcomes for these patients. No true randomized, blinded controlled trials have been devised to study factors such as nurse education, availability of neurointensivists, development of standardized guidelines, or other factors.</p>
<p>Recently, Knopf et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612455663">9</xref></sup> found that a trained neurointensivist may be a key component, especially for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), whether or not they were treated in an NCCU. It should be noted that any criticism of the limitations of the study methodology of the literature of neurocritical care can be easily applied to studies of critical care in general as seen in the limitations in the classic study used to support Leapfrog and regular ICUs by Pronovost et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612455663">10</xref></sup> Regardless though of the details of study data, most reasonable clinicians would agree with the premise that care is improved by ensuring that all practitioners involved in the patient care have appropriate knowledge of pathophysiology and have appropriate institutional support in terms of personnel and equipment supported by consistent processes. This study added to the literature as to the rationale for creating separate neuro-ICUs. Given the proliferation of full-time intensivists and the growing acceptance of the importance of neurocritical care there is emerging an alternative model where high-level neurocritical care is provided within a nonspecialized medical–surgical ICU.</p>
<p>In this article, we will propose a specific alternative model to develop neuro excellence in the ICU, consistent with Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) vision, but without the creation of a separate NCCU. There are many ways to look on this approach, but it may be easiest to view it as the creation of a virtual NCCU within the walls of an existing ICU.</p>
<p>Our hospital (St Jude Medical Center) is a 384-bed community hospital with 24-hour/7-day a week in-house intensivist coverage that had recently become a stroke receiving center. The emergency department is level 2, that is, it receives all types of patients except trauma. The hospital was looking to expand the neurology science program and add neuro-interventional radiology (IR) capability. It was clear that we needed to have programmatic approach to provide neurocritical care in the same way we had needed a program to provide prompt interventional cardiology services. Building on our existing critical care program seemed to make more sense rather than adding more layers of complexity and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The model that we arrived at for developing neuro excellence in the existing ICU was quite empiric and merely represents our solution; we make no claim that this is the best way or the only way. It builds on an existing set of critical care principles and is predicated on the preexistence of a well-functioning ICU with 24/7 staffing by regular, nonspecialized intensivists. There is nothing novel to the concept of providing high-level neurocritical care within the confines of the ICU. In fact this is the delivery system found throughout Australia and New Zealand where there are no NCCUs. Multiple publications from the Australia–New Zealand Intensive Care Society in the field of critical care and the recently published randomized control trial of hemicraniectomy provide examples and support for the notion that high-level neuro-ICU care can be provided without a specific NCCU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612455663">11</xref></sup> However, extrapolation is dangerous without understanding key aspects of care delivery and a specific plan is needed for any general ICU that wants to provide a high level of neurocritical care.</p>
<p>In this essay, we make recommendations for the creation of a successful neuro-ICU program within the confines of an existing ICU program. The key points mirror some of those expressed by Dr Mayer in the Neurointensivist blog on July 2011 as necessary for a neuro-ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612455663">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>1. Identify a neuro-ICU director from within neurology, neurosurgery, or anesthesiology who will commit to working together and leading a multidisciplinary team</italic>. For an existing ICU, clearly the medical director of the ICU may be the one to take the lead and work with the other disciplines that have the most interest and involvement with these patients. When this effort began, to create neuro excellence throughout the hospital and ICU, problems soon appeared. Most neurologist do not have much exposure to neurocritical care in their regular training. In many centers patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) are managed primarily by neurosurgery with neurological consultation generally limited to electrodiagnostics and seizure management. Neurosurgeons may have the most experience in dealing with specific neurological issues but tend to be physically present in the ICU less than some of the other specialties. Our ICU medical director, despite being boarded in both critical care and cardiology had minimal understanding of the basics of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neurocritical care. Likewise, the intensivists had not been exposed in a meaningful way to neurocritical care in their training or practice. These readily acknowledged shortcomings often led to some drift in progressing forward with our efforts toward neuro excellence particularly as there was no neurointensivist champion.</p>
<p>Although there are guidelines in many areas of neurocritical care, there is a paucity of randomized control trials to support these guidelines. We found that different stakeholders had somewhat different views how best to proceed. Although the team approach was critical, not having a single person with a global expertise, which an experienced neurointensivist could have provided, was definitely a hindrance.</p>
<p>As this process began, the physicians clearly needed to learn much more about neurocritical care. Some of the doctors signed up for <italic>Continuum</italic>, an incredibly helpful resource and all did remedial work studying the basics of neuroanatomy and neurocritical care. Most important, 2 of the physicians met the criteria to sit and pass the Neurocritical Care Boards. This experience was highly educational and clear sign of commitment from the physician group to the entire ICU staff of the importance of neurocritical care. We would encourage all interested intensivists to seriously consider starting to study now to meet the criteria for Neurocritical Care Board certification. Although board certification does not guarantee immediate expertise, it quickly helps develop improved care coordination with other team members.</p>
<p><italic>2. Emphasize the multidisciplinary nature of the ICU</italic>. This may be one of the strongest reasons not to carve out a separate neuro-ICU in your hospital. The essence of neurocritical care is taking care of the entire patient simultaneously at the highest level possible. St Jude has a common 32-bed ICU—there are not separate neuro, cardiac, medical–surgical units within our hospital. An attempt had been made several years ago to create a separate cardiothoracic unit, to make sure that there would be appropriate focus on the care of the fresh open-heart patients. Despite the fact that this separation did not occur, over the past years the hospital’s rating by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons has gone from 2 to 3 stars The issue is not the sign on the outside of the door, but the structure and quality of the care provided within the unit.</p>
<p><italic>3. A minimum of 2 neurointensivists are required at any medical center to start a neuro-ICU program</italic>. We believe this is an important element and is a great advantage to creating neuro excellence in the existing ICU. Any critical care program needs to have a multidisciplinary plan in place to be providing the highest possible level of neurocritical care. We developed a structure where the existing intensivist group acted as the team leader with the appropriate consultative support from neurosurgeons, neurologists, anesthesiologists, and neuro-IR physicians, as well as reaching out to the qualified neurointensivists colleagues for input. In addition, a well-trained midlevel practitioner can be invaluable for direct care as well as quality and educational initiatives, though we have not included them in our model at this time. Robotic tele-presence may also play a role in some situations now and in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612455663">13</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>4. Specialized neurocritical care nurses are the single most important aspect of care in the neuro-ICU</italic>. This is by far the most important aspect of creating meaningful and sustainable neuro excellence in the ICU. There needs to be full engagement of the hospital nursing staff and administration to support nursing education. This education must include the general critical care and the specific elements of neurocritical care. In terms of the general critical care, 6 years ago only 10% of our nurses had their CCRN (critical care nurse certification); it is Currently more than 50%. Three years ago, the number of nurses who had their CNRN (neuroscience nurse certification) was zero; it is now 5.</p>
<p>However, we do not feel there is need for a specific nurse manager for the neuro-ICU patient population. There is danger in creating an isolated structure rather than creating a process that is not person/nurse dependent. One of the first steps we took for nursing education was to take a bedside nurse who had neurocritical care experience and put her into a teaching role. One third of her time was still at bedside and two thirds was devoted to teaching. Although there was a didactic component, the most important aspect of the teaching was real-time teaching at the bedside when we had the neurocritical care patients. She worked closely within the existing framework that we had developed to ensure rapid dissemination of care standards, patient flow, and competencies. Within our ICU we had already created small teams and train-the-trainer models. We have separate teams that focus on ventilator associated pneumonia prevention, care of the open-heart patient, continuous renal replacement therapy, and so on. Rather than creating new layers of management, this model of leveraging experienced neuro-ICU nurses within the existing framework provided greater flexibility and prevented creation of redundant management levels. More important, it reinforced the concept that there is nothing magic per se about neuro-ICU care, but that it has to be integrated into the care of all of our patients.</p>
<p>At the same time though, it was clear that we needed to create special competencies for the care of certain defined patients in the neuro-ICU in the same way that the care of patients with an intra-aortic balloon pump or on continuous renal replacement therapy requires specific training and competency. Although we have a general ICU, only nurses who have gone through the specific education, training, and validation for advanced patient assessment, monitoring, and interpretation of intracranial pressure (ICP), and so on, with acute neurosurgical patients and acute SAH patients are assigned to these patients.</p>
<p>All our acute care RNs are annually certified in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), utilized for all ischemic strokes. Furthermore, many of the NIHSS defined examination techniques and the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR Score) Coma Scale have been incorporated into a comprehensive neuro assessment tool. This assessment enables consistency of performance and reporting, while elevating the skill level for all RNs caring for patients with primary and secondary neurological deficits. The importance of a good neuro exam cannot be overemphasized and having multiple clinicians perform an exam together in real time is a valuable experience. We have a monthly neuro excellence meeting that is well attended by the unit nurses and also by the neurosurgeons, neurologists, and intensivists.</p>
<p>Finally, we have created a Web site that is used for all aspects of the unit and for the neuro-ICU. We make particularly sure to make available a full gamut of support services, including PowerPoint presentations by the various doctors, educational material, detailed in-service information on all of the equipment, and troubleshooting materials. We have protocols for ICH that include the standard blood pressure control agents and coagulopathy reversing agents. We use mannitol rather than 3% saline as matter of consistency for elevated ICP and do not use 23.4% saline to simplify management options when there is no one clear right answer.</p>
<p><italic>5. Bullet rounds to be held every morning with neurosurgery and the ICU team</italic>. It is ideal to do multidisciplinary rounds at 10 <sc>am</sc> even though the neurosurgeons tend to be rounding much earlier. We work hard to cater to the neurosurgeons’ needs by making sure that daily brain computed tomography scans, when needed, are done by 5 <sc>am</sc> so that the images are available when they round. The intensivists will declare brain death. Of course, it is ideal to have everybody round physically together at the same time. However, when this is not possible or feasible it is necessary that there be clear-cut communication and clear delegation of responsibility. Since our intensivist is physically present at all times, direct communication with the intensivist is rarely a problem and over time we have certainly come to a general understanding that communication about major issues such as patient transfer occur between both neurosurgeon and the intensivist. Other more straightforward issues may be handled by only one or the other team with the nurses notifying other team as appropriate.</p>
<p><italic>6. Things can change quickly. Therefore, a protocol should be established for communicating clinical events throughout the day</italic>. This is certainly very important. Neurosurgeons as a group tend to be very possessive of their patient and want to know about significant changes in the patient status; however, the desire is certainly not to harass them with calls throughout the day, and when possible put protocols in place so that urgent treatment can be delivered immediately. We are still trying to refine this element. In general, the neurosurgeon is called directly for ICP issues or change in status with the intensivist being called for most other issues. We have recently brought neuro-IR in-house and at this point we are also making 3 calls, including the intensivist, neuro-IR, and neurosurgery to make sure that everybody is on board. The reality is we are somewhat limited by not having a formally trained neurointensivist who has the comfort and background to truly adjudicate some of these borderline issues; however, by protocolizing care and ensure communication, we feel we can accomplish the same end.</p>
<p><italic>7. Ongoing evaluation of resources and support staff for advanced neuro monitoring and care technologies</italic>. This is the one point in Dr Mayer’s essay that requires critical examination and may inadvertently discourage progress in advancing the cause of neuro excellence. The reality is that at this point there are no data to show that monitoring patients with brain tissue oxygen monitors, microdialysis, or any other modality improves outcomes. The BOOST 2 trial (phase 2 randomized control trial of patient care with and without LICOX) is clear-cut proof that the experts in the field consider use of brain tissue oxygen monitoring at clinical equipoise. This controversy is reminiscent of that surrounding the use of pulmonary artery catheters in the ICU. One of the most influential articles from that era was titled “The Cult of the Swan-Ganz Catheter. Overuse and Abuse of Pulmonary Flow Catheters,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612455663">14</xref></sup> and we eventually learned that Swan-Ganz monitoring was not generally needed.</p>
<p>There is no question that multimodal neuro monitoring along with the data management systems is a valuable research tool and may someday be shown to have clinical utility. However, since benefit remains uncertain at this time, the use should not be a priority and may in fact be a distraction from the basics of patient care. However, there is no controversy regarding the use of hypothermia devices to appropriately manage patients after cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation. It is of interest to note the ongoing clinical trial to see whether patients really need to be made hypothermic to 32° to 34°C and whether 36°C may in fact be an adequate endpoint (Target Temperature Management Trial, Principal Investigator Niklas Nielsen).</p>
<p>Similarly, no one would reasonably argue the need for immediate electroencephalograms with rapid reading to rule out non-convulsive status. However, the value of <italic>continuous</italic> electroencephalography monitoring, although less invasive than other methods, has not been proven. The significant heterogeneity in how this monitoring is provided, who looks at the strips and in what time frame suggests that pehahps it should not be an initial focus of neuro excellence. It should be acknowledged that a recent NCS position statement considers cEEG to be a standard aspect of status epilepticus management.15 We have found that it is far more important to provide significant support for the nursing education and time for staff to implement necessary changes than to adopt unproven technology. Nevertheless, it is vital that the hospital provide the resources and support to have to make sure that when new technology becomes accepted as having value such as ICP monitoring or transcranial Doppler it is performed accurately and the information is effectively integrated.</p>
<p>We are not Luddites and are grateful that there is ongoing work in dedicated neuro-ICUs where sophisticated multimodality monitoring is used to plan for the future and understand the pathophysiology of brain injury and how we can prevent it. What makes a neuro-ICU special is that the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapy, and all the other staff are dedicated to the optimal care of these patients. The intelligent use of technology to improve outcomes in selected patients should always be a research goal as long as research is not confused with accepted standard of care.</p>
<p><italic>8. Finally, it has long been said that hospitals are essentially turning into big ICUs</italic>. The point of ensuring that there is continuity of care between the ICU and the rest of the hospital is certainly a valid point. For those delivery systems in which it is appropriate, having neurointensivists follow the patient onto the floor seems like a very reasonable way to improve acceptance of neurointensivists by the hospital. In a community setting where support for dedicated neurointensivists may not exist, it becomes important for neurology to be involved within the ICU care when they are going to follow the patient out to the floor.</p>
<sec id="section1-1944451612455663">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ongoing process improvement is an integral part of any new service. This is a challenge that we wrestle with. We do have a dedicated stroke nurse practitioner and their role has expanded to take on our SAH, ICH, and neurosurgical patients. We collect and report data using the Première data system and have shown good results in terms of costs and mortality by the risk adjustment model. However, the Première system does not collect key data such as ICH size, location, or grade of bleed. Ideally, we would have some way of abstracting these types of data without manual collection and there are clearly information technology opportunities here. The impression of the staff is that we have made particular improvement in our SAH care, specifically in recognition of vasospasm and need for ventriculostomy, in improved medical and neuro-IR management, and in coordination with neurosurgery. However, given relatively small numbers and wide confidence intervals, it is difficult to prove success quantitatively.</p>
<p>To quote again from Dr Mayer from his blog in June,
<disp-quote>
<p>The advocacy mission of NCS is to make the case that complex, life-threatening neurological diseases are best cared for by a multidisciplinary team with special expertise in neurocritical care . . . any new CSC guidelines need to strongly encourage a dedicated neuro-ICU whenever possible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Any well-functioning and well-run ICU that meets Leapfrog criteria has the ability to provide this type of care. Guidelines that define a neuro-ICU should focus on education, training, program, and structure rather than the creation of artificial barriers. The multidisciplinary team already exists in a well-functioning ICU but what may be missing is the aspect of “special expertise in neurocritical care.” General intensivists who take the time and effort to sit for the Neurocritical Care Boards have proven in our experience their special expertise in neurocritical care. Nurses who have taken the time to receive CNRN certification have developed their special expertise in neurology and when combined with the CCRN show their special expertise in neurocritical care. A hospital administration that is willing to invest the significant time and effort to create a budget that supports the need for nursing education as well as the other ancillary needs is also an essential contributor to a multidisciplinary team. We need to focus as to the essence of what the term <italic>a dedicated</italic> neuro-ICU means. The dictionary meaning of “dedicated” does not include the phrase “geographically isolated.” Dedication is a frame of mind and a vision. To quote from Dr Marik, “We believe that every critically ill patient deserves treatment by an intensivist-led multidisciplinary team.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612455663">2</xref></sup> This vision requires a properly trained intensivist and team—we need to have defined core competencies in the relevant areas for any patient.</p>
<p>In this piece, we have presented a vision of neuro excellence in the ICU and some of the specific steps that we have taken to provide for neuro excellence in our ICU. All ICUs should undertake such efforts to provide an intensivist and a team with special expertise in neurocritical care or consider transferring their patients to a place where the requisite expertise exists—regardless of title or specialty of the doctors in the unit or the sign on the outside of the door.</p>
