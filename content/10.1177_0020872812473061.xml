<title>History</title>
<p>The International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW), founded in 1928, is affiliated in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) at the UN since 1947. It was one of the first NGOs following the creation of the UN in 1945.</p>
<p>Social Work Day at the United Nations was founded in 1983 in remembrance of Jack Kamaiko, a social work professor at Hunter College of the City University of New York’s School of Social Work.</p>
<p>In the early years, Social Work Day at the United Nations (UN) was a modest undertaking. By the 25th anniversary of the annual event, it became a huge success and was attended by almost a thousand people. The confluence of renewed awareness of the importance of a global perspective and a more compelling program can be credited with the increased attendance. Global Social Work Student Day, developed and implemented by IASSW and IFSW interns, was instituted at that time. It provides a venue for more interaction with students and has proven to be so successful that the event is conducted annually on the day before Social Work Day.</p>
<p>The mission of Social Work Day at the UN is twofold: 1) to educate social workers and social work educators about what the UN is doing and how social work can participate, and 2) to educate the UN - its agencies, governments and missions – about the relevance of social work in achieving its shared goals. The two entities have similar human rights and social justice ethos and objectives.</p>
<p>The Annual Program has always been based on the focal point of the UN in any given year and the stated interests of students based upon their program evaluations. The themes have run the gamut from poverty and human rights concerns that include, inter alia, children’s issues from Child Soldiers to Trafficking and The Girl Child, to Women-at-Risk, Global Health and Mental Health, including HIV-AIDS and Noncommunicable Diseases, the Family, Intergenerational Issues, Trauma and Natural and Man-Made Disasters, and the UN Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>In 2010, Social Work Day was headlined by the leaders of IASSW, IFSW (International Federation of Social Workers) and by ICSW (International Council on Social Welfare). The theme of the event was Social Work and Social Welfare: A Commitment to Partnership with the United Nations. The sub themes were Life Course Challenges, Equity and Social Inclusion, and Sustainable Environment. It was a prelude to the tripartite 2010 Joint World Conference on Social Work and Social Development held in Hong Kong the following summer. A UN dignitary keynoted that conference that proved to be a transformative event.</p>
<p>In 2010, recognizing the need for a joint policy and practice agenda if social work is to be more influential at the UN, IASSW, IFSW and ICSW launched a Global Agenda at a tripartite congress in Hong Kong. Keynoted by a UN official, the Global Agenda focused on furthering the relationship between social work, social welfare and the United Nations.</p>
<p>In 2012, the 29th Annual Social Work Day at the UN was dedicated to the launching of the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development: Commitment to Action. For the first time on March 26, 2012, Social Work Day had focused solely on the presentation of the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development: A Commitment to Action (The Agenda Commitments). The three organizations’ presidents presented the Global Agenda to the UN, received by Helen Clark (Chair of the United Nations Development Group) and to the Ethiopia and China missions. The Global Agenda commits the three organizations to addressing the root causes of oppression and inequality. They are dedicated to leading a movement that will create a more socially just and equitable world. The UN in New York has been just one of the venues at which the agenda was proclaimed. There was a follow-up tripartite conference held in July 2012 in Stockholm at which the Global Agenda’s implementation and enforcement were addressed.</p>
<p>The title of the 29th Annual Social Work Day at the UN was “Partnering with the United Nations, Social Work and Social Development”. Relevant sub-themes will be “Human Rights and Social Equality” and “Social Media and Social Action”.</p>

<title>The IASSW’s Directory available on the IASSW Website</title>
<p>The updated 2010-2011 Directory of Social Work Schools and Programs lists 2150 post secondary institutions in 122 countries. The directory is significant because it documents the growth of social work education post-secondary degree programs and reflects the commitment of the profession in responding to human needs and advocating for social justice. This worldwide directory lists institutions offering at least one post-secondary/degree program in social work.</p>
<p>We appreciate the hard work of the Standing Committee on the World Census comprising Dr. Angeline Barretta Herman, Dr. Henry Parada, Dr. Brian Littlechild, and Dr. Patrick Leung as the IASSW Board Members; and the many colleagues who lent their support and assistance to updating of this directory and for completing this tremendous task. The directory has been kept online (read only) for open access to the IASSW website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iassw.net/iassw-directory">http://iassw.net/iassw-directory</ext-link>. The unique feature is that it can be updated continuously and Angeline has offered her time and commitment to that process.</p>

<title>International Conference on Transnational Social Work: Opportunities &amp; Challenges; Role of IASSW- ‘Social work curriculum to be revamped’</title>
<p>The 2012 International Studies conference was organized by the Department of Social Work, Madras Christian College, Chennai, India with the objective of sensitizing social workers about the opportunities and challenges for Transnational Social Work.</p>
<p>Prof. Vimla V. Nadkarni, President of IASSW, representing TISS and IASSW, gave the inaugural address focusing on the importance of Indian social work education responding to issues of migration, displacement, environmental problems, human trafficking, and so on, that cut across borders. She stressed that India and Asia need to position themselves strongly in the international arena of social work education while not ignoring local and national work. She encouraged the young students and faculty to strengthen the National Network of Schools of Social Work in India, an initiative started by her through TISS.</p>
<p>Speaking on the sideline of the International Study during the conference Prof. Nadkarni stressed, “Under the aegis of the National Network of Schools of Social Work in India, we have formed five zonal task force committees, which are working to develop contextual curriculum for the social work discipline across the country.” The five zones include North, South, East, West and North East and the Zonal task force is represented by the social work fraternity, mostly from the academia. Prof. Nadkarni stated: “with globalization sweeping the country and an increase in developmental issues, it is important that the social work curriculum needs to be reinvented and stay relevant” (Indian Express, Chennai Edition, 29, September 2012). There are 340 social work institutions across India.</p>

<title>Upcoming aspirations</title>
<p>In order to support our goal to enhance international communication and to develop the capacity of social workers and educators through mutual sharing, IASSW, through its volunteer base and Board members, are working towards achieving the following objectives:</p>
<list id="list1-0020872812473061" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To take forward the Global Agenda arising out of our partnership with IFSW, ICSW and other stakeholders, to multi-level implementation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intellectual Resources development and setting up of IASSW Resource Hubs or Centers, which would promote the development of a database and educational resources to be provided online for use by the members of IASSW.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encourage International Faculty and Student Exchanges: particularly between programs in the South to encourage a sharing of common concerns and collaborate on indigenous research, teaching and practice. Also exchanges with the North in order to enhance the sensitivity and understanding of the problems faced by the populations living in less developed regions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Position Social Work Research as integral to social work education and practice: IASSW help to define and strengthen social work research and support capacity building programs for social work educators so that there is a greater development of indigenous knowledge especially in developing nations that tend to depend on the North for theoretical frameworks for practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Making curricula more relevant to multicultural contexts: IASSW would work to make curricula across the globe more relevant to each country’s social, political and cultural contexts. Also dialogue on the role of international social work specially to work on transnational and global issues for policy development and social action.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using Appropriate Technology for Communication: would promote the use of digitized communications to enhance networking and synergies and make the website more interactive so that new members see benefit from joining the Association and partner with the IASSW to achieve its vision and mission.</p></list-item>
