<abstract>
<p>Water is a basic human resource that should be distributed equally, but increasingly there is uneven distribution, as in the majority of the cities covered under JNNURM which are unable to provide access to water supply to more than half the slum population. Research in Delhi demonstrates that both slums and resettlement colonies are inhabited by the poorer classes who do not have political claim to resources, and ‘resettlement’ from slums is to evict them from where land is more ‘valuable’ to relocate them in the to-be-developed periphery where there is no water supply. Construction of toilets only ensures greater use of water, which eventually pollutes the surface as well as ground water sources. Health services are concentrated in the core of the city. The social determinants of health in urban areas are clearly rooted in the investment policies that are driving processes of ‘urban renewal’ and ‘economic growth’.</p>

<p>Water is a basic human resource, a resource that should be managed and its distribution should be based on principles of equality, conservation, and sustainability. One of the most pressing issues of the contemporary search for better standards of living, social justice, and environmental conservation is allocation and use of water. However, increasingly, there is uneven distribution of safe and adequate water, especially for marginalised social groups.</p>
<p>The Hazards Centre has been providing technical and professional assistance to a large number of community groups and organisations working with the poorer sections of society, mainly in the urban areas. As part of this effort it has become clear that one of the major problems that such sections face is the lack of water and sanitation. This is, in turn, related to the pattern of water governance emerging in urban areas, and the major determinant is the policy package that drives urban renewal.</p>
<p>The attention of the Centre was drawn to this determinant in December 2005 when the biggest initiative in urban renewal, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), was launched in 63 million-plus cities with funding support of $6.4 billion from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The objectives of the JNNURM were linked to making urban infrastructure and services more ‘efficient’ and ‘accountable’. Apart from solid waste management, drainage, transport, parking, and heritage sectors, the largest allocations under JNNURM were earmarked for ‘water supply and sanitation<italic>’</italic>.</p>
<p>While the central government was committed to providing 35–90 per cent of the funds required for these projects—depending upon the size of the city—it was expected that the remaining capital would come from private and market sources. Hence, JNNURM was inextricably linked to ‘investor-friendly’ changes in urban governance and these were termed as ‘reforms’ that had to be undertaken by the local governments who constitutionally control land and urban development. In order to provide legal teeth to these changes, state governments and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) were also required to sign Memoranda of Agreements before they could access central funds.</p>
<p>Since JNNURM has now been officially declared as a ‘success’, it is now being extended in its second phase to all the 5,000-odd urban settlements in India. It is in this context that it becomes important to understand the score of mandatory and optional ‘reforms’ that the ULBs are forced to accept if they want financial support for building necessary infrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0049085713493045">Figure 1</xref>). One-third of these reforms have to do with easing the purchase and sale of land as a commercial commodity, including repeal of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, reform of the Rent Control Act, and reform of property taxes, so that the ULBs can raise revenues from the only asset that they have, and enable them to repay the loans from the centre as well as the market.</p>

<p>Another one-third relate to city planning, double entry accounting systems, special budgetary provisions for the poor, and e-governance, with stricter norms for raising user charges to pay for operation and maintenance. Along with making rules for water harvesting and recycling, these reforms are also directly linked to directions for encouraging Private–Public Partnerships (PPPs). The remaining one-third put in place laws for ensuring participation and disclosure and access to services and housing, especially for the poor. But since all these are linked to property rights, the eventual access mechanism is controlled by the possession of papers that prove ownership—something that most urban poor do not possess.</p>
<p>A quick look at the distribution of investments across the 63 JNNURM cities reveals that half the projects sanctioned are for water supply and sewerage, and the cost of these projects is roughly 70 per cent of the total budget (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0049085713493045">Figure 2</xref>). In other words, the basic infrastructural requirements for better health are determined by the manner in which investments will be made. But if one selects a random set of cities from Agra to Vadodara, for which data is available on the website of the Ministry, their City Development Plans indicate that all of them have large slum populations of 1–20 lakhs, and the majority are currently unable to provide access to water supply to more than half the slum population.</p>

<p>At the same time every city or town is planning to expand in ever larger circles to accommodate projected urban ‘growth’ in the tertiary sector. Thus, Bangalore has moved away from garment manufacture to infotech and electronics with major inputs of foreign direct investment while declaring its 540 slum settlements as ‘shadow areas’ because they cannot be properly serviced. Hyderabad, with 1630 slums, has followed a similar trajectory into ‘Cyberabad’. Modern Ahmedabad has unsuccessfully tried to attract its textile magnates to invest in slum networking in its 710 slums, at the same time as property taxes have boomed three-fold. Almost all other cities have aspirations of becoming ‘world-class’.</p>
<p>The case of Delhi is symptomatic of this global disease. Since 1990 the administration, emboldened by a series of viciously anti-poor judgements by the courts and a pervasive vision of a ‘slum-free city’, has been demolishing hutments and moving the poor out to the periphery of the city into ‘resettlement’ colonies on land which had been considered unfit for human habitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0049085713493045">Figure 3</xref>). Service availability and provisioning is far worse in these colonies than in the original settlements. Thus, if one considers the supply of water to the entire city, officially 42 per cent is sourced from ground water and—given the location of the resettlement colonies in low-lying areas—much of it is heavily polluted.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, with a hopelessly unrealistic supply norm of 360 litres per capita per day (lpcd), the city has never been able to meet more than 60 per cent of its requirement and the norm has been arbitrarily reduced to 225 lpcd for slums and resettlement colonies—though the Delhi Jal Board further slashes it to 42.5 lpcd. Surveys conducted by us in 1998 have revealed that actual supply is as low 33 lpcd in the poorer settlements, and as high as 400 lpcd in the affluent areas. Another 2002 survey in 3,000 flats built by the Delhi Development Authority for high, middle and low income groups also yielded a norm of 100 lpcd with which all families appeared to be content—and this is well within the actual availability of 120 lpcd.</p>
<p>This also means that there is corresponding pollution of the effluent, with the difference that the sewers and drains carry about 90 per cent of it away in the regular colonies while in the slums one-third is disposed off on land and thereby leaches into the shallower aquifers. A study of 77 samples taken from 5 slum clusters and 6 resettlement colonies in 2005 bore out this hypothesis since only 8 per cent of the samples in the pre-monsoon season and 22 per cent during the monsoon were found to be potable and, while both types of colonies had terrible water supply, the officially planned resettlement colonies were ‘more<italic>’</italic> polluted than in the ‘illegal’ slums (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0049085713493045">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Yet another study was performed in 2008 of 15 ground water samples in one of the ‘model’ resettlement colonies settled in 2000, with 20,000 evicted families from 11 different slums, located right next to one of the three landfills that are still operational in Delhi. This study clearly indicated that toxic leachates (dissolved solids, faecal coliform and heavy metals like zinc, cadmium and lead) had infiltrated into the ground and severely polluted the water supply, with the wells closer to the landfill being far more polluted than those further away. During the health survey, the people complained of various problems such as gastro-intestinal diseases, musculo-skeletal pain, skin and eye irritation and respiratory problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0049085713493045">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Regular contact with the polluted groundwater for use in domestic chores such as bathing, washing utensils and clothes, had obviously led to a large number of people suffering from skin and eye irritations and itching. There was considerable reporting of these conditions in the media and community groups also sent delegations to the Chief Minister and the water utility. The response from the Jal Board to the hue and cry was to paint all the hand pumps red! Yet the irony is that the resettled families are located on tiny plots on a 10-year ‘licence’ and already there are indications that the people may be moved again since the land is being surrounded by a golf course, a lake, a park and a housing complex.</p>
<p>This helps us to ask two questions: why is water quality so bad in these colonies; and why is it worse in resettlement colonies which are supposed to be properly planned by the authorities prior to relocation of people from slums? It may be because both slums and resettlement colonies are inhabited by the same poorer classes who do not have the political claim to resources as the wealthy citizens. Additionally, ‘resettlement’ may not to make life better for the poor but to evict them from where they have already improved the land and made it more ‘valuable’, as well as to locate them in the undeveloped periphery where they can repeat the same process all over again.</p>
<p>This explains why the ‘world class’ city has to become ‘slum-free’, why the poor are considered an environmental menace, so that they can be easily dumped outside the city. Then, as the city expands, and the land at the periphery becomes valuable because of their efforts, they can then again be picked up and flung out. Additionally, there is a propensity of making profit from everything, including waste. Thus, in Delhi, privatisation of waste has been carried out, and earlier ways of waste management that actually helped in reducing and recycling waste, such as the waste pickers, have been made illegal. National policy and schemes such as JNNURM drive centralisation, and encourage private corporations, thereby discouraging existing decentralised and efficient mechanisms, which also offered routes for livelihoods for the urban poor.</p>
<p>Following the above study, we carried out a study in 2009, to focus on the quality of water in surface water sources, hand pumps, bore wells, and tankers, as well as Ranney wells and piped water supply at the nearest point to the water treatment plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0049085713493045">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0049085713493045">9</xref>) all over Delhi. During this study, 53 water samples were taken from throughout the city, and analysed for various parameters. It was observed that, of the 53 samples, only 2 water samples had potable water; 72 per cent of the samples were faecally contaminated, another 72 per cent had fluoride levels above permissible limits, some had high levels of iron, lead, and cadmium, and in others, organo-chloro and organo-phosphorous pesticides were present. Even 87.5 per cent ground water was faecally contaminated.</p>

<p>Again this raises questions about the sustainability of the current system of managing sewerage and the efficiency of completely centralised water management. The current debate on sanitation restricts itself to talking about toilets. However, construction of toilets at every site can only ensure greater use of water, all of which—in the absence of adequate treatment and disposal—eventually reaches the surface as well as ground water sources. This can be seen in the fact that piped water is faecally contaminated in 46 per cent of the samples taken in Delhi and this water is supplied to people who are socially and economically less able to cope with the health hazards. Thus, there is a need to look at alternative models for water supply and waste disposal.</p>
<p>Water and sanitation are only part of the social determinants of health. Not surprisingly, health services also seem to follow the same trajectory as the supply of these services. Thus, in Delhi, all hospitals, maternity homes, and other health centres are concentrated in the core of the city (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0049085713493045">Figure 10</xref>). The periphery, to which the poor are being forced to move, has only the dispensaries run by the Government of Delhi, and even these are poorly maintained and staffed. This leads to the question as to who has rights over health, water, sanitation, and all other infrastructure in a region. Is access to health eventually conditioned by wealth and the political clout it commands?</p>
<fig id="fig10-0049085713493045" position="float">

</fig>
<p>The social determinants of health in urban areas are clearly rooted in the investment policies that are driving processes of ‘urban renewal’ and ‘economic growth’. In the vision of the policy-makers, urban development is solely defined by the growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Hence, all urban policies are accompanied by a set of ‘reforms’ that heighten user charges and favour the privatisation of services. The returns on investment, however, mainly accrue from land and property and, consequently, cities expand to shift from manufacturing to services and informal labour is driven to the periphery.</p>
<p>However, the immiserised working population, already underserved in the slums, gets a harsher deal in the new resettlement colonies. Eviction from the core of the city ensures even less access to water, sanitation, transport, livelihoods and all other services. Pollution mitigation technologies (such as water and waste treatment)—that may enhance GDP growth—are inaccessible to the majority of the urban poor. The policy-driven attempt to invest and make profits requires that externalities are passed on to the less well-off sections of the population whose ‘exclusion’ is central to this mode of ‘development’ that neglects all other aspects of sustainability.</p>
<p>Hence, if health care is to be assured to all sections of the people then this mode of development has to be challenged. Mere targeting of the poor, or providing them with cash coupons, or talking of ‘inclusive’ development is not going to be able to address the processes of exclusion. Livelihoods, homes, food, water, and sanitation are all contributors to the state of health of a family. As long as supply and governance mechanisms ensure that these are not accessible, health for all will remain a distant and elusive dream.</p>
