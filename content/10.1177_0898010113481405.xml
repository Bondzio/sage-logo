<abstract>
<p>As nursing moves into the next paradigm of health care, there is an increasing shift toward integrative health care that is founded on the integration of traditional or complementary medicines alongside biomedicine. As part of the shift nurses are increasingly observing clients accessing traditional forms of medicine. One such product that has been used for hundreds of years and is more recently being incorporated into nursing care is the honey produced by bees pollinating <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic>, traditionally known as Manuka. Manuka honey is currently used widely in wound care and as a topical antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory. Review of the literature supports a very effective and low-risk botanical intervention that is both cost-effective and easily accessible. There is future scope for the use of <italic>L. scoparium</italic> oil products in nursing and potential for further research to continue to discover its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Since the dawn of time indigenous peoples from around the globe have known and used the power and medicine of nature. Many of these natural remedies came about through trial and error and the observation of how animals interacted with the plant life around them. Eventually the wisdom was passed down through the generations by the “medicine people” and elders of the community. Natural medicine was shared and started to become assimilated into mainstream society. Now around the world there are numerous natural medicine colleges. Since traditional herbal remedies have started to become more mainstream, nurses have incorporated them into practice.</p>
<p>Herbal medicine includes indigenous or traditional medicines sourced from plants. In 2001, researchers identified 122 compounds used in mainstream medicine that were derived from “ethnomedical” plant sources; 80% of these have had an ethnomedical use identical or related to the current use of the active elements of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113481405">Fabricant &amp; Farnsworth, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> is the botanical name given to New Zealand’s Manuka tree. It is it also known as the “New Zealand Tea Tree” or to the native Maori of New Zealand as “Kahikatoa.” There are two species of <italic>Leptospermum</italic> in New Zealand, the white and red. <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> is a small bush called “Scrub or White Manuka” and is found on the East Coast of New Zealand, growing in both the lowlands and the higher subalpine territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010113481405">Falsetto, 2009</xref>). Although <italic>L. scoparium</italic> is located widely in New Zealand, it has been regarded as a “weed” for many years and its important medicinal uses not acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010113481405">Derraik, 2008</xref>). <italic>Leptospermum</italic> is a member of the Myrtaceae family of botanicals of which all species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010113481405">Derraik, 2008</xref>). The subfamily Leptospermoideae (ca. 80 genera) are recognized as having dry fruits referred to as capsules and leaves arranged alternately. The Leptospermoideae are found mostly in Australasia, with a center of diversity in Australia. <italic>L. scoparium</italic> has large white flowers with brown centers that grow freely and flower between December and February (New Zealand summer) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010113481405">Falsetto, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>New Zealand’s indigenous people, the Maori, were already using the Manuka tree as a medicinal product for hundreds of years before Captain Cook arrived in 1769. Traditionally, most knowledge about medicinal plants was held exclusively by the Tohunga (Maori Doctor) in the Maori community; however, the people through observation were able to decipher which parts of the plants had particular therapeutic or medical value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010113481405">Neill, 1884</xref>).</p>
<p>The first recorded observations of the use of the Manuka tree were documented by the first European settlers in New Zealand. They observed that the leaves of the Manuka were removed, boiled, and then drank as a tea and used for urinary problems as a diuretic.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is a well-known diuretic when drunk in quantity; and I remember hearing of a doctor in Dunedin in the early days, who told a patient who had dropsy to go into the bush, gather a handful of Manuka leaves put them in a quart jug and fill up with boiling water and drink it often. She did this and was cured. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010113481405">Neill, 1884</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other documented observations included the boiling of the leaves providing head cold relief, the use of Manuka oil for constipation, and the chewing of bark assisting in any problems with insomnia or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010113481405">Crowe, 2004</xref>). Bark and oil from <italic>L. scoparium</italic> could also be rubbed on painful joints and appeared to relieve inflammation. The inner bark was boiled and used as a mouthwash and for painful eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010113481405">Cambie &amp; Cooper, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, it was noted that the young shoots of <italic>L. scoparium</italic> were chewed and swallowed as a relief from dysentery by the natives of New Zealand. The emollient white gum, called <italic>pia manuka</italic>, was given to nursing babies and also used to treat scalds and burns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010113481405">Adams, 1945</xref>).</p>
<p>Captain Cook gave Manuka the name of “tea tree” and wrote of it as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The leaves were used by many of us as a tea which has a very agreeable bitter taste and flavour when they are recent but loses some of both when they are dried. When the infusion was made strong it proved emetic (induces vomiting) to some in the same manner as “green tree.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010113481405">Cook, 1777</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But really the beauty of the Manuka tree can be found in its pollen. Manuka is known worldwide for the honey that is produced from its pollen. It is perhaps the most beautiful example of symbiosis in nature. The Manuka flowers (as beautiful as they are) attract the bees, which then transport the pollen into their bee hives and create Manuka honey. Humans then use this honey for medicinal purposes. Nurses are in a perfect position to use <italic>L. scoparium</italic> for the natural antimicrobial effects of the honey produced from it. Manuka honey was originally used in the 1940s and 1950s for its antibacterial properties prior to the discovery of antibiotics and synthetic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113481405">Cooper, 2008</xref>). There has been much research conducted about the use of Manuka honey as a traditional remedy, and it seems that its most effective use is in wound healing. Studies show that as an oral antibacterial its potency is likely to be limited; however, topically it has been shown to be highly effective against many strains of bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010113481405">Gethin &amp; Cowman, 2005</xref>). The antibacterial activity of any honey has been attributed to its high osmolality, acidity, and hydrogen peroxide content. Manuka honey has recently attracted attention, however, because its antibacterial activity is not only attributable to the hydrogen peroxide content but is also due to plant-derived components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010113481405">Molan &amp; Betts, 2004</xref>). Manuka honey has been shown to be highly effective against <italic>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and the dermatophyte <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophyte, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010113481405">Henriques, Jenkins, Burton, &amp; Cooper, 2012</xref>; Jenkins, Burton, &amp; Cooper, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010113481405">Molan &amp; Betts, 2004</xref>). In another recent study, it was found that honey from <italic>L. scoparium</italic> was effective against the pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, which is responsible for gastric ulcers. Growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was completely inhibited by a solution of 5% Manuka honey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010113481405">Somal, Coley, Molan, &amp; Hancock, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>A 2010 study showed that although Manuka honey was safe to ingest, it did not have any notable effect on the digestive system microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010113481405">Wallace et al., 2010</xref>). Among other benefits, one study concluded that Manuka honey is particularly effective in the treatment of dental plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010113481405">Nayak, Nayak, &amp; Mythili, 2010</xref>). Another study showed that Manuka honey stimulated the release of inflammatory factors from monocyte cells as part of the inflammatory response from the immune system. This potentially provides further support that honey is particularly effective for wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113481405">Tonks et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, Manuka honey is only available for topical application in clinical practice in the form of impregnated sterile dressings (adhesive and nonadhesive), sterile dressing paste, and sterile topical cream. In the United States, different companies are producing Manuka honey products sterilized and prepared for use in clinical practice. Comvita New Zealand was the first company to gain approval for MEDIHONEY™ dressings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007. Derma Sciences Inc. now supplies MEDIHONEY paste and dressings throughout the United States for use in hospitals and nursing homes. Two such hospitals are the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in Phoenix and the Georgetown University Hospital Centre for Wound Healing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22398921/ns/health-health_care/t/honey-making-medical-comeback/#.UTbeUVer4_g">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22398921/ns/health-health_care/t/honey-making-medical-comeback/#.UTbeUVer4_g</ext-link>). In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service now supplies all hospitals with 10-g and 20-g tubes of MEDIHONEY for use in wound healing.</p>
<p>MEDIHONEY dressings are typically used for the treatment of venous and leg ulcers, surgical wounds, partial thickness burns, and skin grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010113481405">Molan, 1999</xref>). Although dressings are available in different sizes, on average a single hydrocolloid or calcium alginate impregnated Manuka honey dressing will cost between US$10 and 15 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.comvita.com/shopping-search-landing">http://www.comvita.com/shopping-search-landing</ext-link>). Similar products on the market such as Allevyn Border cost around US$10 each, and more expensive SSF (silver sulfadiazine) dressings can be anywhere between US$25 and 35 each.</p>
<p>MEDIHONEY paste can be purchased in the United States at US$58 for a 3.5-oz tube. MEDIHONEY in this form is applied directly to the wound and then covered with a suitable sterile dressing. Through this method the practitioner is able to apply the desired amount to affected area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010113481405">Acton, 2008</xref>). As with any new product, the recommendation would be to source training on how to use the products from the company representative when first purchasing the products.</p>
<p>Derma Sciences Inc. has introduced MEDIHONEY products to the American public and health professionals at international and national events. Over the past 2 years, MEDIHONEY products have been exhibited at both the American Professional Wound Care Association Conference and the World Union of Wound Healing Conference held once every 4 years.</p>
<p>Honey has been shown to have very little if any side effects when used topically for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010113481405">Chaiken, 2010</xref>). Honey from L. <italic>scoparium</italic> is available worldwide and is being used widely in both hospitals and nursing homes that recognize the many advantages of the products. Honey is potentially a highly cost-effective product in wound healing and is easily accessible and is a renewable resource as long as we keep the plant ecology stable. As other studies have also been conducted using different honey sources, honey sourced from hives near <italic>L. scoparium</italic> bushes is five times as effective as an antimicrobial. Nurses working with hospitals and dealing with wounds on a daily basis are in a powerful position to educate medical staff about the use of Manuka honey for topical infections. As evidence-based practice seems imperative these days, Manuka honey use is resourceful, and also using a natural product supports a health system that respects nature and the interconnectedness of our world.</p>
<p>There is scope to further investigate the use of Manuka oil, leaves, and bark for other medicinal properties as described by the first settlers to New Zealand. The main active constituents of Manuka oil are trichetones, flavesone, leptospermone, and isoleptospermone, which have antibacterial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010113481405">Williams, 1997</xref>). In the future, research into the use of Manuka oil as a natural antibiotic could be considered. Manuka oil is used in aromatherapy as a relaxation agent and also used as a topical applicant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010113481405">Davies, 2000</xref>). Although <italic>L. scoparium</italic> grows throughout the east coast of New Zealand and Australia, it is not currently a protected species; however, the location on the East Cape of New Zealand is in some regard a physical protection. More important, as <italic>L. scoparium</italic> has special medicinal value to the Maori, many of the large populations of the botanical are situated on Maori-owned land and therefore are protected by the people of the place.</p>
<p>As a natural resource, <italic>L. scoparium</italic> has provided us with a natural botanical source of medicine that has in the past been used for a wide variety of ailments. Already nursing as a profession has a close harmony with herbal products as most of our medications come from botanical sources. There is much scope for nurses to use this natural product in wound healing and have it as a financially viable option for patients. Currently, wound dressings are very expensive for patients and have to often be specifically ordered in from health care professionals. Interestingly, some areas of nursing such as palliative care already use essential oils in massage and as aromatherapy for patients. Nurses currently must work within their scope of practice, and it is an exciting time as new research considers natural products that now can be used with patients.</p>
