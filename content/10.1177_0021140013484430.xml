<p>This article sets disability discourse within the context of two foundational ideas. Our Western tradition has inherited these two ideas from the Christian understanding of the human condition, and they need to be taken together if we are to realize a wholesome humanism. The first is the incommensurable value of every individual human being, which, however, if taken on its own as a foundation, can lead to severe isolationism. It requires the corrective of the second; namely, the realization that humanity itself is a substantial unity. We cannot stand absolutely apart, and knowing this raises the crucial issue of our relationship to those who in certain circumstances are self-helpless.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about my first ever encounter with someone with profound intellectual disability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140013484430">1</xref></sup> I was a student in the mathematical sciences in Maynooth and in my second year was cajoled into joining a student society that visited Stewarts in Palmerstown. Stewarts was a residential care centre for persons with severe intellectual disability. My first visit was on a Tuesday afternoon, and I was very nervous about it because I had never really met, or been close to, anyone with severe disability. When I went in the front door of the residential unit, a staff member locked the door behind me—I hadn’t expected this, and I thought to myself: ‘Mmm … coming here was probably a mistake.’ But nothing could have prepared me for what happened next! I stepped from the foyer into a large recreation room, where several people were gathered around in groups, residents and carers, doing various activities. Within about 30 seconds, in a flash, a woman stood up at the far side of the room, dashed across towards me, lifted me off the ground, held on to me tightly, and would not put me down! Needless to say, I was absolutely terrified! Finally she was persuaded to let me go and was taken back to her seat, but for the remainder of my time there, she watched me closely, and it was very clear, to me at least, that this would be repeated if the opportunity should arise again. I remember sitting there, watching her watching me, and thinking: ‘when I get out of here, I am never, ever, coming back!’</p>
<p>When I now reflect on this ‘event,’ years later, I realize that my entire experience was shaped by my own eyes, by what I was seeing. I saw someone who was going to destroy me, to kill me; I imagine that she saw someone that would be hers, someone that she, before anyone else, could have to herself, someone to hold onto, to love, perhaps. I saw death; she saw life. In my naivety, my ignorance, and my vulgarity, I saw a kind of madness, where there was simply human desire being expressed in a form that I did not, and could not, understand.</p>
<p>I now see things differently, but that is a story for later.</p>
<sec id="section1-0021140013484430">
<title>I</title>
<p>In the Christian understanding of the human condition, there are, I think, two foundational ideas that the Western Tradition has now inherited, and that I would like to highlight as we begin this day exploring and reflecting on human vulnerability, and on something of the exceptional wounded-ness of the human condition.</p>
<p>The first idea is simply that all human life is sacred. Every human being is a trace of the divine, and, in that sense, every individual is an inviolable presence. The face of human being <italic>is</italic> the mirror of God, the <italic>imago dei</italic> (image of God). This means that everyone, irrespective of any conditionality, possesses inherently a dignity that is infinite and incommensurable. Human being is to be respected before everything else in the created order. There can be no proportionate entity or value to take its place. The intellectual clarity here, we owe in many ways to Kant, who reserves the word ‘dignity’ to human being, and remarks: ‘That which has a price can be replaced … by something else that is its <italic>equivalent</italic>; on the contrary, that which is superior to every price, that which as a result does not admit of an equivalent, it is this that has a dignity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140013484430">2</xref></sup> And it is precisely because of the connection to the divine that the Christian mind holds doggedly to this dignity of human being in all its manifestations.</p>
<p>To a mind schooled in a closed secular framework, this will appear as a kind of fanaticism, and, yet, the idea is not irrational. The Swiss philosopher, Charles Secrétan remarks: ‘There is something of the absolute in human individuality and consequently in each individual [person].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140013484430">3</xref></sup> Joyce understates this beautifully in <italic>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</italic>: ‘And every single fellow had a different way of walking.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021140013484430">4</xref></sup> In fact, this idea of the absolute in human individuality, to some extent, is written into the very fabric of this room: I am here and you are there. The abyss between us is far deeper than anything geography, or physics, or biology, or psychology might determine. We cannot, in that real, substantial sense, exchange places: my presence is unique, as is yours. The most that we can do is meet, converse, reflect together, understand, and, perhaps, love. In the end, each of us will die alone in the absolute integrity that is ours alone.</p>
<p>We never really understand another person. The other in their interior integrity remains always refractory to our grasping; and this includes the grasping of the mind. Those whose very difference places them on the margins of our society remind us very clearly of this. Others in their otherness remain other: and to be cultured (as opposed to the vulgarity that I spoke of earlier) is to be conscious of this, to respect this, and, of course, ultimately, to welcome this. When looking to the other (whoever he or she may be), it is to search out not only the same, the mutual, the common, and the comfortable, but to acknowledge also the difference, the diversity, the dignity, the delight, and, sadly, perhaps, the danger.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021140013484430">
<title>II</title>
<p>This appreciation of the dignity of the individual human person has to some extent led, in post-Cartesian modernity, to an isolationism of the individual. We are alone, first, and only, then, do we relate to others. This is a very powerful tradition in Western thought that runs from Descartes right through the Enlightenment with Kant and on to Husserl and 20th-century phenomenology. This is even so for Levinas, who struggles to overcome this ego-centring of the subject, but who does so only by setting it in motion again, hence the multiplicity of contradictions in his philosophy (such as an ethics without norms, in the plural).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, in the name of freedom, we have placed the subject, every subject, every individual, at the centre, alone, fending for himself or herself. You might recall the haunting, final line of <italic>Finnegans Wake</italic>, which is to bring us back to the beginning: ‘A way a lone a last a loved a long the’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021140013484430">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not unconnected to this, we live, also, in a time that espouses a range of values that could be described as upwardly mobile. These include competency, performance, mastery, power, achievement, independence, efficacy, excellence, profitability, success, x-factors: you get the idea. This family of related values, particularly at the level of public discourse, permeates almost every sector of society: the workplace, education, the economy, the health services, and so on. They are increasingly emphasized even in our personal lives, where our relationships, how we take care of our bodies, how we relate, how we nurture our souls are all to be managed from within the framework that is structured by such values. I have relatively little difficulty with the values per se: they have their place; but when they become the <italic>exclusive</italic> framework from within which we think, act, value, and structure our living, then, to my mind, we are in trouble. We end up with an atomized, isolating, and competitive society, where the base expectation is that everyone ought to be able to look after themselves, where mutuality makes no great <italic>essential</italic> sense, and where those who do not perform competently are valued less than those who can. This is one of the (many) reasons why we need another foundational idea that will act as a counter-point to what I have been sketching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021140013484430">
<title>III</title>
<p>And so, the second foundational idea that I would like to draw your attention to is, as I see it, an important <italic>corrective</italic> to the first. It is the realization that humanity itself is <italic>a substantial unity</italic>: in other words, ‘we belong together.’ We do not, and cannot, stand absolutely apart, and it is an illusion to assume that we do. The Christian foundation here is rooted in two ideas: the first is the theological unity of humanity that is grounded in the metaphysical act of creation; and the second is the redemptive gesture of the Christ, who gathers us up again in our wounded-ness and in our fragility and re-presents us to our God. This eschatological gathering, despite the multiple fragmentations of humanity, has already begun, and many contribute to its realization. It is a matter of both our origin and of our ultimate destiny.</p>
<p>This idea of <italic>the unity of humanity</italic> was a vibrant idea in the 19th century, often in more radical secular circles, where the idea was set to replace that of God: you find it, for example, not only in the wake of Auguste Comte and the positive tradition, but also in a whole spectrum of thinking rooted in Marx’s writings. Here <italic>humanity as a whole</italic> takes centre stage, usually at a cost to an acknowledgement of the transcendent and the infinite dignity of the individual. This is no surprise for the Christian mind, where the rejection of the transcendent includes the rejection of its congenital trace in human being. Totalitarian regimes reflected this position. The collapse of the European totalitarian ‘tradition,’ that maintained this centrality of humanity per se has, regretfully, meant also a certain neglect of this idea of <italic>the unity of humanity</italic>.</p>
<p>In terms of a philosophical analysis, it is indirectly evident in what I will call concentric circles. I do not come into being in isolation; I am not a <italic>creatio ex nihilo</italic> (a creation out of nothing). I always already belong, even at the biological level. We may, indeed, and do, disagree as to how to characterize this first level of belonging, but for each one of us, there is that intimacy of parental origin that is that first connection beyond ourselves to a wider humanity. But outside of this first intimate circle, there are other circles of belonging, wider families, if you like: geographical communities, social groupings, work teams, religious communities, communities such as L’Arche, social networks, even cyber communities, etc., all of which reflect at each level an increasing generalization of our universal belonging.</p>
<p>To some degree this unity is metaphysical; it is not immediately obvious. There are no direct empirical links. But there are, if you like, phenomenological hints: language being one, music and art another, charitable action in aid of those whom we do not know, and so on. Somehow, below the surface, we know that we humans are one. And this is the central idea in every humanism. Any neglect, any violence to, any rejection of, this universal body of humanity is a depletion of my own humanity. Any insight, any goodness towards, any tenderness for, this same body of humanity, is, equally, an enrichment of my own being. This insight is not generally appreciated.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more we inhabit our own presence, the more we realize that we are integrated into ever expanding circles of belonging, to the point of recognizing this fundamental unity of humanity. The complexity of this unity can be approached from many different angles: biological—we share a unique genetic code; ethical—we have a primordial responsibility for each other (which explains the extraordinary response to disasters across the globe); political—we seek to establish structures of governance that will lead to greater world stability; economic—globalization is now characterized by a greater integration of human histories, and at every level.</p>
<p>It is, I think, clear that we do not join humanity as we might join a golf club, or a library, or a gym: we always already belong there. And the other side of this belonging is that <italic>we are one</italic>. Neither can we eject someone from humanity, as you might from a classroom or an airplane. Yes, we can kill someone—but even then, we speak of <italic>human</italic> remains. Our creative, powerful freedom does not constitute humanity; rather, humanity constitutes us—each of us—immediately, through parents, grandparents, and teachers; but out beyond this immediacy, there are others whom we do not know who belong at our origin. How are we to inhabit this wider humanity, this community of the unknown, that has, and that continues, to shape us?</p>
<p>The flourishing of humanity is intrinsically conjoined with the flourishing of each individual member, and the flourishing of each individual <italic>is</italic> the flourishing of humanity. For a range of very complex reasons, this cannot be taken for granted. Our very freedom allows us to choose how we interact with the wider family of humanity. We move in and out, for the most part, as we please: we connect and we dis-connect; we join groups and we leave groups. But what of those who do not enjoy this freedom? What of those, who, for whatever reason, are self-helpless? If we belong together in the family of humanity, can we play our freedom against another’s absolute lack of freedom? Ought we to assume this power over life and death? Can we be God, in the absence of God? And I ask this, too, in terms of our own personal humanity.</p>
<p>All of this sets in motion another range of values so as to create a more humane living space for everyone. This is eminently evident in the corridors of hospitals, in nursing homes, in lecturers’ offices, in day-care centres, to name some of the places that I have witnessed counter-values to calculation, profit, and power. These are not, however, the dominant discourse: they are acknowledged not as essential but as supplementary and desirable. They do not enjoy the force of the argument, and they are weak in the play of power. Such values are acknowledged and welcomed only to the extent that the dominant discourse is allowed, unchallenged, to shape the world that we inhabit together. At the level of cultural discourse we need the counter-voice if we are to honour the integrity of human being.</p>

<title>IV</title>
<p>Subjacent to all of this is what I would like to call the inward journey to infinity, a journey that was radically interrupted by Kant and that leaves us, modern man and woman, at a great loss when we turn to interiority. The metaphysical tradition of interior exploration from Augustine to Maine de Biran and Bergson, to our own William Desmond is hardly attended to any more.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021140013484430">6</xref></sup> We are addicted to the exterior and, perhaps, afraid of the interior. The radiant inner brightness that is each of us, an afferent light, is darkened by our own fears. For it is to see beyond the measurable, the finite, and the surface to the qualitative, the infinite, and the depth. It is to be truly present to the complexity and fullness of the moment, the vision, and the person. There is no rest, no completion, no totality, and no end point. Our common destiny is the horizon. The eye should not come to rest. Gerard Manley Hopkins coined the word inscape to capture the density of distinction and individuality. He would write in his Journal on the 12 December 1872, and I’m quoting: ‘I saw the inscape, though freshly, as if my eye were <italic>still</italic> growing.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021140013484430">7</xref></sup> I welcome each of you to this symposium. My wish for today is that we would all recognize that our eyes are, indeed, still growing, and that in being here as part of this day we might see otherwise and more profoundly tomorrow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021140013484430">
<title>V</title>
<p>You will recall that I promised myself all those years ago that I would not go back to Stewarts. Well, I can assure you, I kept that promise, and had no further contact with profound mental disability in the subsequent years of being at university and seminary. I was eventually ordained and after some post-graduate study in Rome, was duly appointed a curate to my first parish in Galway: Ballybane, for those of you who are here from Galway.</p>
<p>And on my very first morning, the parish priest offered to drive me around the parish and show me the important and the holy places: the schools, the churches, the GAA pitches, and so on. Now on the return journey to the parish house, we were driving up the hill to St Brigid’s Church and he said to me: ‘Oh yes, in there on the right is the John Paul II Centre; and you’ll be the main chaplain there.’ (And remember, this is my very first day.) Sheepishly I asked: ‘And what’s the John Paul II Centre?’ to which he replied, ‘Oh, it’s a residential centre for those with severe intellectual disability.’ I remember taking one very long deep breath and thinking: ‘Oh no, I’m back in Stewarts!’</p>
<p>Of course, as you have well guessed, I very soon realized that the John Paul Centre was an enlightening place, with exceptional people, who do extraordinary things. There was a quality of humanity there that made it one of the finest places to be in the parish, and, of course, it opened my eyes and ensured their growth. There is, it has to be said, in all of this, at least for me, a certain irony: if all those years ago the woman in Stewarts had not lifted me out of my narrow world, so literally, I suspect very strongly that I would not be standing here before you this morning, and this symposium would not be taking place.</p>
<p>I want to leave you with a poem. It is from one of the very finest post-war European poets, Paul Celan. He was of Romanian, Jewish, German-speaking origin, and he lived most of his life in Paris. It is a short poem—so I’m going to give it to you first in the original, and then in my own translation. And when I was translating this poem, some two weeks ago, in view of this day and this symposium, I had in mind those of you who are here present, who have lived and laboured, longed, lost, laughed, and loved in deep proximity to profound disability. The poem is called ‘Stehen im Schatten (To Stand in the Shadow)’; and whenever Celan uses the verb ‘stehen (to stand),’ it is the signifier for strength, for resistance, for integrity, and for dignity.</p>

<p>From Kant, to Husserl, to Sartre, to Merleau-Ponty, and even Levinas, there is a refusal to facilitate an exploration of interiority in its solitude. Intentionality is to be directed outwards, to the exterior. Consciousness is always consciousness of something, limited to the things (zu den Sachen selbst).</p>
