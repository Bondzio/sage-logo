<abstract>
<p>The primary aim of this study was to assess the moderating role of emotion regulation in the relationship between some components of social information processing (hostile interpretation and anger) and aggressive behavior. The secondary aim was to assess whether emotion regulation, hostile interpretation, and anger account for gender differences in aggressive behavior. A total of 1,125 adolescents (627 girls) filled out the social information processing questionnaire to assess hostile interpretation, anger, and emotion regulation. Reactive and proactive aggressive behaviors were assessed by self- and peer reports. The results showed that adaptive regulation negatively predicted aggressive behavior and moderated the relationship between anger and reactive aggressive behavior. Boys’ higher scores for aggressive behavior were accounted for by their higher scores for anger and lower scores for emotion regulation. However, the strength of the relationships among variables was similar for both boys and girls. Findings of this study indicate the importance of emotion regulation as a target for aggressive behavior interventions.</p>

<p>In recent years research on the relationships between social cognitive processes and children and adolescents’ aggressive behavior has received a great deal of attention. The social information processing (SIP) model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412444079">Dodge (1986</xref>) is one of the most heavily studied models of aggression development. This model proposes that SIP takes place in sequential steps, where aggressive children and adolescents manifest a series of cognitive deficits and distortions. Specifically, according to the reformulated model of SIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025412444079">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>), aggressive children and adolescents in ambiguous social situations tend to selectively encode or attend to cues associated with hostile intent (step 1), attribute hostile intentions to the provocateur (step 2), select hostile or revenge goals (step 3), generate aggressive responses (step 4), evaluate aggressive responses more favorably, expect positive outcomes from aggressive behavior, and feel more self-confident in performing them (step 5); finally, this process leads them to enact the aggressive response (step 6).</p>
<p>The most studied SIP component is probably the second step, the attribution of intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025412444079">Dodge, Coie, &amp; Lynam, 2006</xref>). Typically, to evaluate this component, participants are presented with a series of ambiguous provocations. Participants are asked to make an interpretation about the intentions of the person in the scenario. Many studies have supported the relationship between hostile attribution biases and aggressive behavior, both cross-sectionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412444079">Camodeca &amp; Goossens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025412444079">Crick, Grotpeter, &amp; Bigbee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0165025412444079">Zelli, Dodge, Lochman, Laird, &amp; Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 1999</xref>) and longitudinally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412444079">Burks, Laird, Dodge, Pettit, &amp; Bates, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412444079">Dodge, Pettit, Bates, &amp; Valente, 1995</xref>). Moreover, in a meta-analysis, a robust significant association was found between hostile attribution biases and aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro, Veerman, Koops, Bosch, &amp; Monshouwer, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Social situations are rarely neutral, but are instead emotion-evoking events. These emotions play an important role in situations where the child does not have all of the information. Although emotions are theoretically part of the SIP model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025412444079">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>), their role has been emphasized later on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165025412444079">Lemerise &amp; Arsenio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro, Merk, Koops, Veerman, &amp; Bosch, 2005</xref>). Some important emotional aspects of SIP are coding and labeling the emotions of others (e.g., interpreting that the other person is happy with what happened), one’s own emotional state (e.g., experiencing anger), and emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025412444079">Nas, Orobio de Castro, &amp; Koops, 2005</xref>). For instance, adolescents who experience anger and interpret that the other person is happy will generate aggressive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2005</xref>). These emotional processes could be modified by regulatory processes, which are generally called emotion regulation strategies.</p>
<p>Emotion regulation has been described as the processes through which the individuals control which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025412444079">Gross, 2007</xref>). These processes can be intrinsic (automatic or effortful) when a person regulates his or her own emotions, or extrinsic when another person helps to regulate the person’s emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0165025412444079">Werner &amp; Gross, 2010</xref>). The inability to regulate one’s emotions is related to several forms of psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025412444079">Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, &amp; Schweizer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165025412444079">Kring &amp; Sloan, 2010</xref>). Regarding the role of emotion regulation in aggressive behavior, previous studies have shown that aggressive children and adolescents use less effective emotion regulation methods than non-aggressive children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025412444079">Nas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0165025412444079">Silk, Steinberg, &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>). For example, aggressive children and adolescents use forms of adaptive emotion regulation (e.g., problem-solving strategies and distraction) as a way of feeling better less frequently than non-aggressive children and adolescents, and often think that their emotions can only be regulated by other people. Moreover, the regulation of one’s own negative emotions in hypothetical provocative situations reduces aggression in aggressive boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro, Bosch, Veerman, &amp; Koops, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>SIP can play a different role for reactive and proactive aggressive behaviors. Namely, first steps of SIP (i.e., hostile interpretation and emotions of anger) seem especially useful to explain proximal aspects of reactive aggressive behavior, which represents a reaction to a perceived provocation and is characterized by intense anger. In contrast, the role of hostile interpretation and anger in proactive aggressive behavior seems to be less relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412444079">Dodge &amp; Coie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025412444079">Nas et al., 2005</xref>). Proactive aggressive behavior consists of deliberate actions aimed at achieving a desired goal and is more affected by the expectations of positive outcomes and self-confidence about the ability to enact the aggressive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025412444079">Arsenio, Adams, &amp; Gold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412444079">Dodge, Lochman, Harnish, Bates, &amp; Pettit, 1997</xref>). Regarding emotion regulation, it should be negatively related only to reactive aggression, which is the type of aggression associated with anger. In contrast, adolescents who are proactively aggressive are not expected to experience anger when provoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165025412444079">Hubbard, McAuliffe, Morrow, &amp; Romano, 2010</xref>), and therefore emotion regulation should not affect their aggressive behavior. However, as at least in a previous study emotion regulation was also related to proactive aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2005</xref>), additional research is required.</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesize that emotion regulation strategies can influence social information processing. Emotion regulation strategies have been described as adaptive or maladaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025412444079">Aldao et al., 2010</xref>). For example, problem solving, distraction, and cognitive strategies have been highlighted as adaptive, and aggressive strategies and suppression as maladaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025412444079">Gross &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>; Nolen Hoeksema &amp; Aldao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0165025412444079">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2005</xref>). Adolescents who attribute hostile intentions to others and experience anger might continue the typical information processing pattern and generate aggressive responses; conversely, they might challenge their hostile biases, employing adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and reduce their anger, leading to non-aggressive responses. For example, if an adolescent tries to distract and calm him- or herself before deciding on his or her response, he or she could construct different courses of action and evaluate the consequences of such actions more carefully. Therefore, the relationships between these SIP components (i.e., interpretation and anger) and the final aggressive behavior may be moderated by the adolescent’s emotion regulation strategies. Moreover, this moderating effect is expected to be higher for reactive aggression, as hostile interpretation and anger are more relevant for reactive aggression than for proactive aggression.</p>
<sec id="section1-0165025412444079">
<title>Gender differences in SIP and emotion regulation</title>
<p>Problems in SIP that are related to aggressive behavior are often reported as more prevalent for boys than for girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412444079">Dodge et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025412444079">Lansford et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, it is not surprising to find gender differences in emotional components of SIP due to cultural and personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025412444079">Brody &amp; Hall, 2010</xref>). For example, cultural norms seem to discourage boys from feeling sadness and girls from expressing anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0165025412444079">Simon &amp; Nath, 2004</xref>). This is supported by the results of several studies that show that anger is expressed more often by boys than by girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412444079">Calvete &amp; Orue, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0165025412444079">Orue &amp; Calvete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0165025412444079">Trentacosta, Izard, Mostow, &amp; Fine, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, boys and girls tend to use different emotion regulation strategies. For example, girls are more likely to engage in activities such as problem solving, seeking social support, cognitive strategies such as rumination, putting situations into perspective, and positive refocusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412444079">Eschenbeck, Kohlmann, &amp; Lohaus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165025412444079">Garnefski, Teerds, Kraaij, Legerstee, &amp; van den Kommer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0165025412444079">Zlomke &amp; Hahn, 2010</xref>), whereas boys engage more often in activities such as distraction, avoidant coping, or strategies such as blaming others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025412444079">Calvete, Cámara, Estévez, &amp; Villardón, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412444079">Eschenbeck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165025412444079">Hampel &amp; Petermann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0165025412444079">Zlomke &amp; Hahn, 2010</xref>). Moreover, boys score higher than girls on all types of aggressive behavior except for relational aggression, which seems to be evenly enacted by both boys and girls (Card, Stucky, Sawalani, &amp; Little, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412444079">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165025412444079">Salmivalli &amp; Nieminen, 2002</xref>). These gender differences in aggressive behavior could be explained by the above differences in anger expression and emotion regulation.</p>

<title>The present study</title>
<p>The primary aim of this study was to test whether emotion regulation moderates the relationship between the interpretation and anger components of SIP and aggressive behavior. We expected to find that the relationship between these components of SIP and subsequent aggressive behavior would be lower when adolescents use adaptive emotion regulation strategies such as problem solving or distraction, and that this moderating effect would be higher for reactive aggression than for proactive aggression. We also expected that these moderation effects would be similar for boys and girls. The secondary aim was to test whether SIP components of interpretation and anger and adaptive emotion regulation explain gender differences in aggressive behavior. We expected that boys would display more hostile interpretation and anger and fewer adaptive strategies of emotion regulation, and that these factors would account for their higher scores on aggressive behavior. These hypotheses were tested in a 6-month longitudinal study involving a large sample of adolescents who were 13–17 years old. This age group was selected because adolescents have rarely been the focus of research on SIP and aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165025412444079">Lee &amp; Hoaken, 2007</xref>), even though adolescence is an important period in the development of emotion regulation skills. Moreover, adolescents are exposed to a significant number of stressors, especially interpersonal stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412444079">Compas &amp; Wagner, 1991</xref>), which require the development of adequate emotion regulation skills.</p>

<sec id="section4-0165025412444079">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The initial sample comprised 1,371 adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age. Participants were students from 31 classrooms located in 10 educational centers in Bizkaia (Spain). The schools were selected randomly and included both public and private educational centers. The final sample included 1,125 adolescents (627 girls and 498 boys) who completed all the measures at time 1 (T1) and measures of aggression at time 2 (T2). The attrition rate was 17.94%. There were no differences in the variables of the 1,125 adolescents who completed both waves and the 246 adolescents who could not participate in the second wave. Parents were informed by letter that the study focused on risk factors for aggressive behavior in adolescents and that the responses would be confidential and voluntary. They were given the option of refusing to allow their son or daughter to participate. None of the parents refused. Participation was voluntary, and a few adolescents (<italic>n</italic> = 6) decided not to participate in the study, contributing to the attrition rate. Socioeconomic levels were determined by applying the criteria recommended by the Spanish Society of Epidemiology and Family and Community Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025412444079">2000</xref>) and from information provided by the school staff about parental education and income. The distribution of socioeconomic levels was as follows: 4.99% low, 23.04% medium-low, 51.92% medium, 10.07% medium-high, and 9.98% high.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0165025412444079">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Adolescents completed measures about social information processing and emotion regulation at time 1 (T1) and measures about aggression both at T1 and T2. The social information processing questionnaire (SIPQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412444079">Calvete &amp; Orue, 2009</xref>) is based on the social information processing inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro, 2000</xref>). The SIPQ presents five ambiguous scenarios, three suggesting ambiguous provocations by peers (e.g., being hit in the back by a ball), one involving interaction with an adult for being wrongly accused (being unjustly punished by the teacher), and one involving an ambiguous rejection by peers (not being allowed in a peer group). These types of scenarios have been used in previous studies to assess SIP (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0165025412444079">Zelli et al., 1999</xref>). Adolescents are asked to imagine each scenario and answer questions about the way they would think, feel, and behave in those situations. The SIPQ includes two versions, one based on open responses that must be coded and one based on Likert-type scales. In this study, we used the open-response version of the SIPQ to assess the following variables: (1) intention attribution: <italic>Why did the other person behave that way?</italic> (behavior in the vignette); (2) emotion attribution: <italic>How does that person feel?</italic>; (3) own emotion: <italic>How would you feel if that happened to you?</italic>; and (4) emotion regulation: <italic>If you felt angry, can you think of something that could make you feel better?</italic>
</p>
<p>The first two questions were combined into a single factor to assess the interpretation dimension because, theoretically, aggressive individuals who attribute hostile intentions to others also attribute happiness to provocateurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, in a previous study about the measurement model of SIP, attribution of happiness to provocateurs in the scenarios merged with the attribution of hostile intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412444079">Calvete &amp; Orue, 2012</xref>). Therefore, in this instrument, these two components are grouped in the same measure, which was labeled as negative interpretation.</p>
<p>Although the SIPQ allows for obtaining information about several categories of responses, in order to test the specific hypotheses of this study, the responses for the attribution of intent were coded as 1 (hostile) or 0 (benign, accidental, ambiguous, or irrelevant); for emotion attribution as 1 (happy) or 0 (sad, angry, or irrelevant); for own emotion the responses were coded as 1 (angry) or 0 (sad, not happy/bad, happy, guilty/ashamed, or irrelevant); for emotion regulation as 1 when the adolescents proposed an adaptive emotion regulation or 0 when the proposed solution was maladaptive or irrelevant. Adaptive forms of emotion regulation included problem solving (e.g., “I would speak to the teacher”), distraction (e.g., “I would go to my bedroom to listen to music”), and cognitive strategies (e.g., “I would think that it is just a game”). Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies included aggressive solutions (e.g., “I would hit him”), rumination (e.g., “Why me?”), and “others’ action” (e.g., “He would have to ask my forgiveness”). Although structured equation modeling (SEM) models were based on the aforementioned codification, the results section also includes descriptive statistics for some specific emotions (e.g., sadness) and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., problem solving and cognitive strategies). Four psychologists coded the responses after receiving specific training regarding this task. To assess the inter-rater reliability for the coding of open answers, transcripts of 100 randomly selected adolescents were coded by five independent judges. Kappa coefficients were 0.82 for interpretation, 0.87 for the experienced emotion, and 0.87 for emotion regulation. Total scores for negative interpretation, anger, and adaptive emotion regulation were obtained by summing the number of vignettes coded as 1. The internal consistency coefficients at T1 were 0.57, 0.59, and 0.59 for negative interpretation, anger, and adaptive emotion regulation, respectively. Low internal consistency in SIP components has been interpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025412444079">Dodge, Laird, Lochman, Zelli, and Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (2002</xref>) as a good indicator of the diversity in the scenarios used to measure SIP.</p>
<p>Following the procedure used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412444079">Boxer, Guerra, Huesmann, &amp; Morales, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412444079">Calvete &amp; Orue, 2012</xref>), we used composite measures of participants’ aggressive behavior that were made up of a combination of the self-reported reactive proactive aggression questionnaire (RPQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0165025412444079">Raine et al., 2006</xref>) and a peer nomination instrument developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412444079">Crick (1997</xref>). The RPQ consists of 11 items for reactive aggression (e.g., “How often have you become angry or mad when you don’t get your way?”) and 12 items for proactive aggression (e.g., “How often have you had fights with others to show who was on top?”). Each item is rated as 0 (<italic>never</italic>), 1 (<italic>sometimes</italic>) or 2 (<italic>often</italic>). The questionnaire has exhibited positive reliability and validity in adolescent samples. Alpha coefficients in this study were 0.77 and 0.78 at T1 and T2 for self-reported reactive aggression, and 0.81 and 0.82 at T1 and T2 for self-reported proactive aggression. We used a peer nomination instrument that was used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412444079">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>) to assess reactive (four items; e.g., when mad, hits or pushes others) and proactive aggression (three items; e.g., tries to keep certain people from joining their group during activity or play time). The adolescents were required to name up to three classmates who had behaved as described. The number of nominations that the adolescents received from their classmates for each item was added and standardized in each class. Previous studies have found positive psychometric properties for this questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412444079">Crick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412444079">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>). The standardized scores from the items were then added to obtain the scores of peer-reported reactive aggression and proactive aggression. The internal consistency coefficients in this study were .75 and .76 at T1 and T2, respectively, for peer-reported reactive aggression, and .73 and .74 at T1 and T2, respectively, for peer-reported proactive aggression. The correlation coefficients between self-report and peer report measures were <italic>r =</italic>.22, <italic>p</italic>&lt; .001 for reactive aggression and <italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for proactive aggression.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>T1 measures were taken between October and November of 2007, and T2 measures were taken between May and June of 2008. At T1 the adolescents completed all of the questionnaires; at T2, they completed the aggressive behavior measures. The responses were confidential, and participation was voluntary. The adolescents filled out the questionnaires in their classrooms. Participants were informed that their responses were confidential and would only be read by the investigation team. Participants were encouraged to ask questions if they had any trouble answering the items. The questionnaires took approximately 60 minutes to complete at T1 and 30 minutes to complete at T2.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025412444079">Table 1</xref> displays the descriptive statistics and gender differences for all variables in the study. Male adolescents showed a more negative interpretation of others. When imagining the various scenarios, males experienced anger more frequently. Interestingly, females experienced sadness more frequently (means 1.20 [1.19] vs. 0.96 [1.05] for female and male adolescents, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Regarding emotion regulation, female adolescents scored higher than males on adaptive emotion regulation. An examination of the specific emotion regulation strategies used indicated that female adolescents employed problem solving and cognitive strategies more frequently than males (means 1.17 [1.20] vs. 0.82 [1.11] for problem solving, and 0.31 [0.70] vs. 0.15 [0.53] for cognitive strategies).</p>

<title>Adaptive emotion regulation as a moderator of the association between hostile interpretation, anger, and aggressive behavior</title>
<p>We used structured equation modeling (SEM) to test our hypotheses. The goodness of fit was assessed by the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Generally, CFI values of 0.90 or above, RMSEA values of less than 0.06, and SRMR values less than 0.08 reflect an adequate fit.</p>
<p>The hypothesized model included paths from T1 aggressive behaviors to T2 aggressive behaviors, paths from T1 interpretation of others, anger, and adaptive emotion regulation to T2 aggressive behaviors and paths from the interaction terms (interpretation × adaptive emotion regulation and anger × adaptive emotion regulation) to T2 aggressive behaviors. Item parcels were used as indicators for each latent variable in the model by randomly assigning items from each subscale to the parcels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165025412444079">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2001</xref>). The scale of each construct was set by fixing the latent variance to 1 because this method is adequate when the manifest variables are measured on different scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412444079">Little, Slegers, &amp; Card, 2006</xref>). Two indicators (i.e., parcels) were used for each latent variable except for proactive and reactive aggression, which were represented by three indicators (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165025412444079">Table 2</xref> for a description of the indicators). To represent the latent interactions, the residual centering procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025412444079">Little, Bovaird, and Widaman (2006</xref>) was used. Following this procedure, each possible product term from two sets of indicators for two latent constructs (e.g., anger and adaptive emotion regulation) was created to obtain orthogonalized indicators for a latent interaction construct. Thus four uncentered product terms were computed (e.g., anger parcel 1 × adaptive emotion regulation parcel 1). Each of these resulting product terms was then individually regressed onto the first-order effect indicators of the constructs. The residuals for this regression were saved and used as an indicator of the latent interaction construct. The procedure was repeated for each of the four product terms. Finally, the residuals were used as indicators of the latent interaction construct. In addition, the latent interaction term was not allowed to correlate with the main effect latent variables. In total, the model used 26 indicators for nine latent variables.</p>

<p>The SEM models were tested via maximum likelihood with LISREL 8.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025412444079">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2006</xref>) using the covariance matrices of the indicators. The error terms of the aggressive behavior latent variables at T1 and T2 were conceptualized as correlated with each other due to the assumption that factors that contribute to the measurement error of any specific variable would be consistent across time points. First, a preliminary confirmatory factor analysis indicated the appropriateness of measuring the latent variables with the indicators and confirmed that the factor loadings were significantly different from zero (see factor loadings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165025412444079">Table 2</xref>). Next, the hypothesized structural model was tested. The fit indices were satisfactory for the model, χ<sup>2</sup> (210, <italic>n</italic> = 1125) = 1162.43, RMSEA = 0.056 (0.053; 0.060), SRMR = 0.051; CFI = 0.95. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412444079">Figure 1</xref> shows the principal parameters of the model. Both types of aggression at T1 and T2 were highly correlated. Most of the predictive paths were significant only for reactive aggression: hostile interpretation and anger predicted a residual increase in reactive aggression at T2, whereas adaptive emotion regulation predicted a residual decrease in reactive aggression. The anger × adaptive emotion regulation term was significantly correlated with the residual change in reactive aggression, although the coefficient represented a small effect size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412444079">Figure 2</xref> displays this interaction, representing adolescents who scored higher (one standard deviation above the mean) and lower (one standard deviation below the mean) for anger and for adaptive emotion regulation. The association between anger and the residual change in reactive aggressive behavior was lower for those who scored higher on adaptive emotion regulation. Lastly, adaptive emotion regulation predicted a decrease in proactive aggression over time, although the effect was small.</p>

<p>We examined whether the path coefficients of the model described earlier were equivalent across both subsamples through a multiple-group analysis. First, the model was estimated separately for male (<italic>n</italic> = 498) and female (<italic>n</italic> = 627) adolescents. The model exhibited adequate fit indices in both males, χ<sup>2</sup> (210, <italic>N</italic> = 498) = 865, RMSEA = 0.068 (0.063; 0.078), SRMR = 0.070, CFI = 0.93, and females, χ<sup>2</sup> (210, <italic>n</italic> = 627) = 637, RMSEA = 0.053 (0.048; 0.058), SRMR = 0.05, CFI = 0.95. Second, we tested the configural invariance of the model to demonstrate that the pattern of fixed and free parameters was equivalent across subsamples, χ<sup>2</sup> (420, <italic>N</italic>= 1125) = 1501, RMSEA = 0.060 (0.057; 0.064)<sub>,</sub> SRMR = 0.07, CFI = 0.94. Next we tested the invariance of the paths. The non-significant increase in the χ<sup>2</sup>parameter indicated that the overall pattern of paths was similar for male and female adolescents, ▵χ<sup>2</sup>(10, <italic>N</italic> = 1125) = 7, non significant.</p>

<title>Adaptive emotion regulation and SIP as mediators between gender and aggressive behavior</title>
<p>The next step was to assess the contribution of SIP and emotion regulation in explaining gender differences in aggressive behavior. We tested a model in which male adolescents’ higher scores on aggressive behavior would be accounted for by their more frequent negative interpretations of others’ intentions and emotions, more frequent feelings of anger, and decreased utilization of adaptive strategies of emotion regulation. The model included eight latent variables and 19 indicators. The fit indices were adequate, χ<sup>2</sup> (100, <italic>N</italic> = 1,125) = 393, RMSEA = 0.053 (0.047; 0.058), SRMR = 0.064, CFI = 0.97. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0165025412444079">Figure 3</xref> shows the unstandardized paths, following the recommendation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025412444079">Cole and Maxwell (2003</xref>) for mediation models. The model included paths from gender to interpretation of others’ intentions and emotions, anger, adaptive emotion regulation, and T1 aggressive behaviors, and paths from these variables to T2 proactive and reactive aggressive behaviors. The paths from gender to all of the T1 variables were statistically significant. Anger predicted an increase in T2 reactive aggression, whereas adaptive emotion regulation predicted a decrease in reactive aggression. The associations between gender and T2 aggressive behaviors via T1 aggressive behaviors were also significant.</p>

<p>The significance of the indirect effects of gender on T2 reactive aggressive behavior via anger and emotion regulation was tested using a bootstrapping procedure. The approach relies on resampling the dataset to generate an empirical sampling distribution of the indirect effects, which is used to test hypotheses and derive confidence. In this study, we created 1,000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset by random sampling with replacement; the covariance matrix was estimated from each sample. The second step was to conduct the structural model 1,000 times with these 1,000 bootstrap covariances to yield 1,000 estimations of each path coefficient. The third step was to use LISREL’s saved output of 1,000 estimations of each path coefficient to calculate an estimate of the indirect effects. The final step was to determine whether the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimated indirect effects included zero. According to Shrout and Bolger’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0165025412444079">2002</xref>) proposal, an indirect effect is significant at the 0.05 level if the 95% CI does not include zero. Using this criterion, the results from the bootstrap procedure indicated that the indirect effects via anger (0.012; 95% CI: 0.011–0.013) and emotion regulation (0.30; 95% CI: 0.24–0.36) were statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although many studies have found evidence of the influence of both SIP and emotion regulation on aggressive behavior, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed the moderating role of emotion regulation in the relationship between SIP and proactive and reactive aggressive behaviors. This study contributes to our understanding of the role of emotion regulation in both the relationship between SIP components and aggressive behavior and the gender differences that occur in aggressive behavior.</p>
<sec id="section12-0165025412444079">
<title>SIP and adaptive emotion regulation as predictors of aggressive behavior</title>
<p>Overall the role of SIP and adaptive emotion regulation was stronger for reactive aggression. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">2005</xref>), the SIP components of hostile attribution and anger predicted an increase in reactive aggressive behavior but not in proactive aggression, whereas adaptive emotion regulation predicted a decrease both in reactive and proactive aggressive behavior. Therefore, in contrast to what was expected theoretically, but coherent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al. (2005</xref>), adaptive emotion regulation was also negatively related to proactive aggression.</p>
<p>More interestingly, adaptive emotion regulation moderated the relationship between anger and reactive aggressive behavior. Specifically, the relationship between anger and reactive aggressive behavior was diminished for adolescents who scored higher on adaptive emotion regulation, meaning that once an adolescent has experienced anger, the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies leads to less reactive aggressive behavior. Although the effect size was small, these results suggest that training in adaptive emotion regulation is especially important for adolescents with anger control problems. Moreover, some of the relatively small effect sizes were probably influenced by the open response format used to assess both emotion regulation and SIP components, which was different from the measure method used for aggressive behavior. The use of different methods contributed to the reduction of shared-method variance that tends to overinflate associations between variables (Kliewer, Lepore, Oskin, &amp; Johnson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025412444079">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, adaptive emotion regulation did not moderate the relationship between hostile interpretation and aggressive behavior, suggesting that it is not until the adolescent experiences anger that the emotion regulation strategies act to control emotions, thereby reducing the probability of a reactive aggressive act.</p>
<p>As described earlier, the results also indicate that the SIP components assessed in this study are less relevant for proactive aggression. According to previous studies, other SIP components, such as response evaluation, can be more predictive of proactive aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025412444079">Arsenio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412444079">Dodge, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412444079">Dodge et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025412444079">Orobio de Castro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0165025412444079">Smithmyer, Hubbard, &amp; Simons, 2000</xref>). As these components were not assessed in the present study, additional research is required to examine the interplay between these components and emotion regulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0165025412444079">
<title>Gender differences</title>
<p>As hypothesized, boys scored higher than girls on all of the types of aggressive behavior, hostile attribution, and anger. Consistent with previous studies, girls scored higher than boys in sadness. These gender differences in the emotional responses to ambiguous situations that suggest provocation and rejection are consistent with the greater vulnerability of women to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165025412444079">Hankin &amp; Abramson, 2001</xref>). That is, it suggests that, when they face the same type of negative situation, boys tend to experience anger, whereas girls tend to experience sadness. Finally, girls showed more adaptive strategies of emotion regulation; specifically, they scored higher than boys in searching for solutions and employing cognitive strategies.</p>
<p>The findings also indicate that these gender differences in SIP components and emotion regulation contribute to the higher frequency of aggressive behavior among boys. Specifically, the results of the mediation analysis showed that gender differences in reactive aggressive behavior were mediated by anger and adaptive emotion regulation. That is, boys scored higher in reactive aggressive behavior partly because they experience more anger and use fewer adaptive strategies of emotion regulation. The findings also suggest that other variables not included in this study, such as beliefs about justification of violence and anticipation of consequences, should be examined as explanations for the gender differences in proactive aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the strength of the associations among the variables in the study were similar for boys and girls, suggesting that boys’ higher scores in reactive aggressive behavior could be due to their higher scores in SIP components and lower scores in adaptive emotion regulation, but not due to their role as predictors of aggressive behavior. This result is consistent with previous studies, which have found that, although boys score higher in several cognitive variables associated with aggressive behavior, such as the justification of violence, the strength of the variables’ association with aggressive behavior seems to be similar in both genders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025412444079">Calvete, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165025412444079">Huesmann &amp; Guerra, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0165025412444079">
<title>Limitations and implications of the study</title>
<p>This study has some limitations. First, although we used both self-reports and peer reports to assess aggressive behavior, teacher reports would have also been desirable. Second, we examined emotion regulation strategies reported by the adolescents in an open question format, but the use of other standardized measures of emotion regulation (e.g., emotion regulation questionnaire; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165025412444079">Gross &amp; John, 2002</xref>) could have provided additional information about the methods that they habitually use to regulate their emotions.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the findings contribute to our understanding of the interplay between social information processing and emotion regulation and their role in aggressive behavior. These findings suggest that emotion regulation skills may constitute an important component in interventions with aggressive adolescents, particularly when aggressive behavior is linked to intense anger. For instance, programs like coping power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0165025412444079">Lochman, Boxmeyer, Powell, Barry, &amp; Pardini, 2003</xref>) or making choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025412444079">Fraser et al., 2005</xref>), which include group sessions addressing issues such as anger management, have been shown to improve emotion regulation and reduce aggressive behavior through training in social problem alleviation skills.</p>
