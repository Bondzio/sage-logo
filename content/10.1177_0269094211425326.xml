<sec id="sec1-0269094211425326" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a passage written in 1972, Hunter S Thompson evokes the thrill and optimism of being young in San Francisco in the mid-1960s: ‘There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was <italic>right</italic>, that we were winning … We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave’. Less than five years later, he is already composing an elegiac farewell to the dreams and aspirations of that era: ‘So now … you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost <italic>see</italic> the high-water mark—that place where thewave finally broke and rolled back’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211425326">Thompson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>If by the 1970s Hunter and many others of his generation felt disillusioned and disengaged—it was only a few years until punk would explode onto the British music scene—it is nothing compared to how their children are entitled to feel, according to three recently published books. Their subtitles alone suggest something has gone seriously wrong for today’s young generation: <italic>How Britain Has Bankrupted Its Youth</italic>; <italic>How the Baby Boomers Took Their Children’s Future—And Why They Should Give It Back</italic>; <italic>How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy.</italic></p>
<p>The struggles these young people face are not philosophical ones of wilting idealism, but what Hunter might term ‘grim meathook realities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211425326">Thompson, 2005</xref>). Their employment prospects are worse than any youthful cohort for decades. Even in the boom years between 1997 and 2007, youth unemployment was rising steadily. The job prospects of 16–17 year olds, rather than moving with economic swings, seem to just progressively deteriorate.</p>
<p>Worse still, to enter an increasing number of coveted professions it is necessary to work for free for months at a time, without the hard-won employment rights that were firmly in place by the time Hunter scanned the San Francisco skyline. This is the world of illegal internships, encouraged by universities and tacitly condoned by regulatory bodies, that Ross Perlin dissects and challenges in the fascinating <italic>Intern Nation</italic>.</p>
<p>Nor is getting on their bike and finding work the only thing today’s youth are likely to find far harder than their parents. Rocketing house prices—not just more expensive, but as <italic>The Jilted Generation</italic> phrases it: ‘disproportionately expensive. Outrageously expensive’—have made it exceptionally difficult for young people to get a foot on the housing ladder. Both <italic>The Pinch</italic> and <italic>The Jilted Generation</italic> argue that such obstacles to the job and housing markets do not only cause material difficulties for young people, but existential ones. They disrupt the development of a narrative of one’s life, the ability to hold down stablerelationships and to enter ‘genuine adulthood’.</p>
<p>And we have yet to touch on a host of other well-known issues: an ageing population and consequent sky-high pension and healthcare bills; climate change and its knock-on effects on the costs of energy, flood prevention and water; enormous public debt; and decreasing social mobility. All are burdens that will have to be shouldered by the younger generation. On top of these, <italic>The Pinch</italic> argues that the last 50 years have seen growing social atomization and a breakdown in trust between individuals. Taken together, the three books paint an exceptionally bleak picture, bleak enough for one of them to name the cohort of young people born between 1979 and 1994 ‘the jilted generation’.</p>
<p>So who does this ‘jilted generation’ have to blame for being unemployed and unable to move out of their parents’ homes? All three books arraign the older generation, more or less roughly the ‘baby boomers’. The members of this older generation have failed to translate their youthful advantages and, in some cases, lofty sense that ‘whatever we were doing was <italic>right</italic>’ into opportunity and a well-buffered economy for the generations following them. How this happened, and what can be done about it, are the questions that these books attempt to explore.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211425326"><title>The Pinch</title>
<p>David Willetts begins <italic>The Pinch</italic> by warning ‘we are not attaching sufficient value to theclaims of future generations’. The baby boomers, born in two distinct surges in the birth rate following World War 2, have done fantastically well from the welfare state. Intotal, they are set to take out 118 percent of what they have put in. But, Willetts argues, in a worryingly diverse range of areas they have neglected to pass on the benefits they have received.</p>
<p>Their rapacious consumption and sloth-like response to the threat of climate change has left a huge environmental threat whose consequences will have to be dealt with by today’s youth. They failed to save enough personally—between 1987 and 2007 ‘our net savings was the lowest of any advanced western country’—leaving Britain particularly exposed to the tremors of the financial crisis. This is encapsulated in the problems faced by young people wishing to buy a house: having seen their properties soar in value during the housing boom, baby boomers eschewed saving some of this windfall for future generations in favour of immediate gratification, borrowing against their assets to raise their levels of consumption even higher. On a national level, they have failed to invest in the physical infrastructure the next generation will need. This all while anticipating a deliciously comfortable retirement funded by generous company pension schemes, many of which are now closing to new young members.</p>
<p>And such economic failures are only half of Willetts’s worries. He criticizes an ‘ultra-individualism unleashed by the post-war baby boomers’, which has catalysed social atomization, fragmented families, propelled divorce rates, circumscribed childhood, exacerbated social mobility, and generally crumpled Britain’s previously smooth social fabric. The changes instigated by the Sixties, ‘however justified, were destructive of social capital’, and following them there was ‘a breakdown of trust within and between generations’.</p>
<p>Willetts’s most distinctive point, though, is neither his fairly irrefutable list of economic and environmental failures, nor his fairly predictable nostalgia for the alleged harmony of Britain in the 1950s. Rather, it is what he sees as causing the changes he describes: demography. Using the allegory of a primitive tribe—a thought experiment he returns to several times in his book—he inverts the demographic theorizing of Malthus and, more contemporarily, Richard Easterlin. Both thinkers assumed that being born in a large generational cohort like that of the baby boomers would result in a more difficult life, but Willetts argues the opposite. In the case of his tribe, when there are more hunters, they can hunt more mammoths, and moreover, there are more resource gatherers relative to the elderly members of the tribe who must be supported by them. This ‘demographic sweet spot’ allows time for greater experimentation, and space for creative diversity. Against the conventional explanation that the social transformations following the Sixties resulted from greater affluence and permissiveness, Willetts argues that they really result from the demographic earthquake of the baby boom. And these changes, as we have seen, are in Willetts’s view in large part responsible for our failure to value our ties with other generations. Ultimately, demography is the bogey man behind our current social and economic ills.</p>
<p>For Willetts, this is something to celebrate. It handily frees us from ‘the widespread belief that the trajectory of any modern society must inevitably be towards ever greater fragmentation’. Much of the rest of his book is devoted to developing ‘a clearway of thinking about the rights of future generations’, in the process of which Willetts guides us through a dense tangle of thinkers and theories. Evolutionary biology, game theory, Hume, Rousseau and John Rawls are all invoked in Willetts’s march towards reinvigorating the intergenerational social contract. The links between the generations provide a key source of meaning, he argues; and his book finishes with the plea: ‘we must understand and honour those ties which bind the generations’.</p>
<p>Drawing on such a wide range of sources, interrogating so many different facets of theoretical thought, and threading through numerous thought experiments involving mammoths, <italic>The Pinch</italic> is quite dazzling. But while a fascinating journey to undertake, some readers seem to have been blinded bythe cerebral sorcery. Richard Reeves, director of Demos, praises the book for being ‘remarkably non-political’. In fact, in focusing so much on demography, in devoting pages and page to creating thought experiments of prehistoric tribes and discussing Hume and Rousseau’s theories on the origins of human cooperation, Willetts successfully excuses himself from taking an in-depth look at the realities of Britain since the 1960s. As a result, many other issues and specific policy decisions crucial to the young generation’s difficulties are ignored, and alternative perspectives are kept carefully out of sight.</p>
<p>Some of these omissions are glaring. Is it not possible that the sale of council housing under Thatcher and the reliance on the free market to make up the resulting shortfall contributed to the young generation’s housing problems? Similarly, in discussing social mobility and lamenting the fact that ‘the competition for jobs is like English tennis, a competitive game but largely one the middle classes play against each other’, Willetts does not even mention the increasingly ubiquitous need to work unpaid internships to enter numerous white collar professions. And what about the collapse of traditional industry in the 1980s, and the concomitant dissolution of the communities centred around it? The growth of a desire-orientated consumerism? Is it not even worth considering the possibility that these, as wellas demography, contributed to the weakening of social bonds and a sense of responsibility to the next generation?</p>
<p>These telling blank spots, these missing statistics and pages of analysis, become particularly conspicuous in his discussion of two key social changes to emerge from the Sixties and Seventies: the liberalization of divorce, and the movement of women into employment. These transformations are linked to a number of negative outcomes in <italic>The Pinch</italic>: rising house prices due to an increased number of households following divorce; deepening inequality because there are now more single women earning less than the men they may have previously formed a household with; worsened social mobility as middle-class women take the jobs of working-class men; and a far weightier benefits bill, as ‘a welfare system that was originally designed to compensate men for loss of earnings is slowly and messily redesigned to compensate women for the loss of men’.</p>
<p>It is not to say there is no truth whatsoever behind such claims. And Willetts nevertheless affirms that ‘it is of course absolutely right that women should have education and employment opportunities opened up to them’. But one cannot help wondering why, if he is genuinely interested in the effects of divorce and female employment, does he not once look at the employment statistics of women? Or consider the gender pay gap? Or survey the opinions of women on issues such as abortion and divorce? His only two gauges of female opinion are a survey from <italic>Bliss</italic> magazine, and the attitudes expressed in ‘Sex and the City’ and ‘Bridget Jones’s Diary’. All this despite the fact that on more than one occasion he draws on Sweden and Denmark as glowing examples of countries with lower inequality, and ‘higher levels of happiness’—hardly countries famed for their strict divorce and abortion laws, or known for having remained untouched by the movement of women into work.</p>
<p><italic>The Pinch</italic> is a wide-ranging magpie book, and it is well worth joining Willetts as herambles through wide plains of Enlightenment thought and dense jungles of statistics. But the value of its social and economic analysis suffers from his determination to heap as much blame as possible on the social transformations of the Sixties and Seventies. This line fits neatly with his argument that the demographic shockwaves of the baby boom caused deep-reaching social dislocation, but these two interlinked conclusions are only sustained through a wilful blindness to the complex, specific realities of British society over the past 40 years. In terms of shedding some light on the particular dilemmas facing the younger generation, <italic>The Pinch</italic> would have benefited enormously if Willetts had dropped the implicit politics and focused on these actualities instead.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094211425326"><title>The Jilted Generation</title>
<p>Many of the blind spots created by Willetts’s ideological tunnel vision are explored in <italic>The Jilted Generation</italic>, by Ed Howker and Shiv Malik<italic>.</italic> These two ‘twenty-something journalists’ choose a far simpler structure than <italic>The Pinch,</italic> setting out the difficulties faced by the jilted generation in three clear chapters: ‘Housing’, ‘Jobs’ and ‘Inheritance’.</p>
<p>The book begins by taking up arms in defence of today’s young generation, labelled ‘boomerang kids’ and KIPPERS—‘Kids InParents’ Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings’—by unsympathetic and disdainful commentators. Howker and Malik marshal a legion of statistics to repel these criticisms. More of today’s young people live with their parents not because of a sudden upspring of fecklessness, but because it is far more difficult and expensive for them to afford their own place. Not only have house prices increased enormously—had the cost of a battery chicken grown at the same rate, it would now cost £47.50—but the gulf between a first-time buyer’s income and a first-time buyer’s house price has cracked wide open too. Nor did the recession help: banks, wary of lending to all but those with rock-solid credit histories, demanded sky-high deposits from first-time buyers. In February 2009, these reached 25 percent, the highest since records began.</p>
<p><italic>The Jilted Generation</italic> is also impressively lucid when it comes to demonstrating how the last 30 years of housing policy have created this situation. Howker and Malik explain—and here David Willetts should take notes—how the sale of council housing in the 1980s was accompanied by a dramatic decline in the Government’s house building programme. The free market completely failed to make up the shortfall, and worse, the houses the market did build dropped in quality. This may seem strange: why is the housing market not responding to the demands and desires of consumers? Again, Howker and Malik are quick to explain this: buyers and consumers are not the same people. Builders construct for housing speculators who then rent out the properties. And this has become another mechanism by which wealth is transferred from the younger generation to the older, because it is primarily the baby boomers who buy (58 percent of buy-to-let investors were aged 46–65 in 2008, while only 2 percent were under 26) and the young who rent the properties.</p>
<p>The job market, too, is tilted against the jilted generation. Work is more difficult for young people to find and when they do it is more likely to be temporary, unstable, part-timeand even—with the rise of internships—unpaid. Meanwhile, once they are in employment they will have to work to service the interest on a staggering level of public debt. The boomer generation are compared to the generation preceding them, the war generation, who took out a huge loan to pay for post-war reconstruction of the country, and managed to reduce it from 250 percent of GDP to 52 percent of GDP by 1976. In contrast, the boomers have failed to reduce this proportion any further, despite experiencing such dramatic growth in GDP. The discovery of North Sea oil and the sale of public utilities during the 1980s were huge windfalls direct into the state coffers. But whereas the Norwegians placed their oil revenues in a sovereign wealth fund that has grown to £300bn and will generate wealth for future generations<italic>,</italic> we have spent it all already.</p>
<p>It is a powerful portrait of a bleak situation, and by so convincingly setting out the injustices heaped upon today’s under-30s <italic>The Jilted Generation</italic> creates a strong appetite for an explanation. In a fourth chapter, ‘Politics’, Howker and Malik sketch one with a grand and ambitious narrative of British society since the 1960s. The movements of the Sixties, they argue, had less to do with combating social injustice and more with fighting for self-expression. This desire for self-expression gradually morphed into an individualistic, brand-driven consumerism. Under Thatcher, policy makers, contrasting a capitalist culture of individual freedom with a simplified socialism, turned to the market to meet the demands of this new individualism. The state began to reconstitute itself to function more like a market, a trend that continued through Major and into Blair and the New Labour Governments. Targets and incentives are used to motivate civil servants. Voters are increasingly treated like consumers, focus groups used to guide government decision making. In policy-making terms this results in a short-term scramble for the centre ground, eroding government’s ability to take difficult, long-term decisions. The jilted generation are simply those unfortunate enough to follow a style of government incapable of looking beyond theshort term.</p>
<p>This is a pretty grand narrative, and having put it forward Howker and Malik seem a little uncertain of where to go next. Do the authors want to return to a pre-Thatcherite emphasis on fiscal management of the economy? Some of their commentary, for example highlighting the fact that previous to 1976 unemployment never really rose above 3 percent, whereas afterwards it has rarely fallen below that figure, would suggest so. But what would such a re-orientation involve? Do they want to see industries re-nationalized? Do they wish to return to an economic culture in which equality is valued above overall economic growth? They are never entirely clear, acknowledging that the Thatcher years stabilized a haywire economy, and laid the groundwork for astonishing GDP growth. The old tension between equality and overall wealth is implicit in the book’s argument, but they never really confront it head on.</p>
<p>And so the solutions they do offer are limp, their discussion of them superficial. They call for political discourse to move from a rhetoric of ‘rights and responsibilities’ to one of ‘benefits and obligations’. They argue that democratic decisions should be devolved to a lower level, and local communities should be more active and engaged in meeting their needs. Communities and citizens should build their own homes, bysetting up Community Land Trusts. Workers’ co-ops are praised for involving employees in the running and ownership of the businesses they work for. These are interesting suggestions, innovative ways of working with the free market. But the book, after so much careful statistical exploration of the plight of the jilted generation, does little more than raise them as possibilities. Do they really hold the potential to combat the consumerism, individualism and myopic policy-making that the book blames for inter-generational injustice? While Howker and Malik can hardly be expected to provide solutions to all the problems they describe, it is a pity that interesting suggestions such as these are not more thoroughly explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211425326"><title>Intern Nation</title>
<p>Tellingly overlooked by David Willetts, and only briefly touched on by Howker and Malik, the white-collar world of internships is given the thorough interrogation it deserves in Ross Perlin’s engaging and enraging <italic>Intern Nation</italic>. For decades hidden in the shadowy recesses of the UK’s economy, over the last few years internship culture has had a bright light thrown on it by a number of flagrant news reports. An exclusive auction held at Oxford University included a ‘mini-pupillage’ with a top QC. Even more outrageously, a Conservative Party ball included an auction of internships at city hedge funds.</p>
<p>Over in America, <italic>Intern Nation</italic> uncovers a growing niche market of businesses selling prestigious internships. One of the book’s most memorable passages comes when Perlin encounters the founder of a company called ‘The University of Dreams’. Utterly unrepentant, this smooth-talking fresh-faced entrepreneur proudly describes his business plan to a horrified Perlin: charging $7999 to set students up with an eight-week summer internship.</p>
<p>These examples, of course, are only the tip of a very big iceberg, deeply embedded in theocean floor of our ‘fast-changing, intangible economy’. Even when internships are not being sold to the highest bidder, the expectation that you have to work for free to enter some of our society’s most coveted and influential professions is clearly a sharp blow to social mobility. A lack of pay can strip people of their rights as employees (<italic>Intern Nation</italic> tells some horror stories of sexual harassment cases being thrown out of court for solely this reason). Full-time employees can be displaced. The whole arrangement devalues both work and training.</p>
<p>Perlin sets out to discover how such a pernicious work practice has come to be an essential rite of passage into so many careers. He narrates the growth of internships from their roots in 19th-century medicine, when a stint interned in a hospital formed the beginning of a doctor’s career. In the story of their insidious spread through Washington DC in the 1930s, and other white-collar professions through the Sixties and Seventies, Perlin identifies two major culprits: American universities, and centres of government.</p>
<p>For American universities, awarding students academic credit for work performed with an external organization is a highly profitable enterprise. The students pay for the credits, and universities can get away with providing very little in return—indeed there is often little effort to ensure a decent level of training and academic content in the internships they recommend. This highly suspect arrangement is encapsulated in the American university system’s nefarious relationship with Disney Corporation, a case study to which Perlin devotes the opening chapter of his book. Thirty years ago, facing a local labour shortage threatening to disrupt plans to expand their immense theme park, Disney approached American universities to see if they would be willing to lend students as temporary workers. The universities were very keen—and out of this arrangement has grown one of the world’s biggest internship programmes, with 8000 students a year working as interns for Disney. They at least get paid, albeit near-minimum wage, but must live in strict gated communities, and work nearly full time—serving in shops, running rides, chirpily loping round in Goofy costumes—‘without sick days or time off, without grievance procedures’. And guess what? The students are paying their school per credit for this experience. Not only is this plain money-grubbing cynicism on the part of Disney and the universities, but it displaces full-time Disney employees, damages local economies, and is emblematic of a process whereby universities have allowed the academic legitimacy of internships to wither.</p>
<p>Just as bad as the universities, though, is the Government’s attitude to internships. With 20,000 interns swarming into Washington DC every summer, Perlin describes how ‘at the very heart of American life and public policy—where pious watchwords like democracy, meritocracy and transparency are the stuff of constant sound bites—the ground floor is now a vast intern culture, driven by money, power, and connections’. Beyond this, Perlin charges governments with failing to uphold their own labour laws. One of the most surprising insights <italic>Intern Nation</italic> provides is just how clearly in breach of (American) minimum wage law the vast majority of internships are. The minimum wage was introduced in a 1937 Act; 10 years later, an exemption was made for trainees, in a ruling formulated for railway brakemen. Although this exemption is held up as shrouding the entire internship issue in foggy legal ambiguity—crikey, do interns count as trainees or not?—the American law is actually remarkably pellucid. There are six clear criteria that must be met if a trainee is to be exempted from minimum wage law. Grab the book—glance at the list—it is immediately obvious that only a very thin sliver of currently unpaid internships would come close to meeting these criteria. It should not take a legal Sherlock Holmes to grasp this. The spread and unabashed advertising of plainly illegal internships bespeaks not legal confusion, but a shameful absence of proactivity on the part of the departments responsible for upholding the law.</p>
<p><italic>Intern Nation</italic> is impassioned and convincing in its condemnation of unpaid, ill-prepared internships and the educators and law enforcers who have allowed them to takeroot. But perhaps an even more difficultchallenge is to convince people that, with such complicity between employers and ambitious interns, and with a British PM who has declared he is ‘very relaxed’ about giving his next-door neighbour an internship, such an entrenched culture can be changed. But <italic>Intern Nation</italic> is remarkably successful in making this seem possible.</p>
<p>In the midst of his analysis, Perlin embeds two particularly revealing and well-chosen case studies. The first is drawn from the American tale of the rise, fall and rise again of apprenticeships. By the end of the 19th century, apprenticeships had fallen into the shadows and outskirts of the American economic model. Perlin outlines how a small, 200-word bill, the 1937 Fitzgerald Act, instituted labour and wage standards for apprentices. This bill, combined with the hard work of the Department of Labour’s Office of Apprenticeship, has enabled the return of this medieval institution to the centre of American economic life. He notes that: ‘86% of apprentices expressed satisfaction with their classroom training, 84% with their on-the-job training’. Small, carefully focused regulation, his tale of American apprenticeships demonstrates, can make an enormous difference.</p>
<p>In a second case study, Perlin delves into the world of professional architects, which until the early 1990s was notorious for what one practitioner describes as its ‘ignoble tradition’ of mistreating unpaid, overworked interns. But, beginning with a resolution from a body of student architects in 1993, the profession began to turn against this practice. By 2000, professional ethics had shifted to make employing unpaid interns entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p>These entertaining case studies, told with verve and colourful detail, are a great example of what makes <italic>Intern Nation</italic> so enjoyable to read. In Britain, numerous groups and websites are working to tackle the pervasive culture of unpaid and low-paid internships. The website Interns Anonymous gathers together the experiences of interns across the UK, while the campaign Intern Aware and the social enterprise Internocracy both aim to improve internship culture. <italic>Intern Nation</italic> is an excellent field guide and call to arms in this latest struggle against unjust practices in the workplace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094211425326" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is no doubt there is a ‘jilted generation’; the book of that title powerfully proves both that today’s youth face real difficulties, and that the previous generation holds significant responsibility for this. And while neither <italic>The Pinch</italic> nor <italic>The Jilted Generation</italic> is any more than stimulating, rather than satisfying, in their attempts to diagnose the root causes of this intergenerational neglect, they are both good introductions to a highly pertinent issue. <italic>The Jilted Generation</italic> is especially clear, straightforward and readable. <italic>Intern Nation</italic> is an impressively comprehensive account of the issue of internships, and its conclusion puts forward some practical suggestions for action. All three books are sure to remain highly relevant through the coming years.</p>
