<abstract>
<p>This article is an examination of the candidate preferences of 2008 superdelegates and of their role in determining the eventual Democratic nominee. Multivariate analysis suggests that female superdelegates were less likely to support Obama than were men; African-Americans, in contrast, were more likely to support his candidacy. A higher percentage of the popular vote received by Obama in the primary or caucus also influenced superdelegates to support him. The effect of contributions from Obama to superdelegates appeared to boost his support, but Clinton contributions had little impact. Also examined is the effect that superdelegates had on the nomination outcome. Analysis suggests that the impact of unpledged superdelegates on the 2008 Democratic nomination was significant. A substantial number of superdelegates continue to follow their own preferences, especially in states where Clinton was victorious, and this asymmetry made a difference in the nomination outcome. The race for the nomination could have been quite different without the presence of these unpledged superdelegates, or under alternative rules for delegation selection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the desire to give party leaders and elected officials a more important role in the nomination process, the Democratic Party, under the auspices of the 1982 Hunt Commission, allocated additional slots to the states for the inclusion of governors, large-city mayors, members of Congress and state party chairs as unpledged delegates to its national convention. The bloc of party leaders and elected officials, or ‘superdelegates’, thus dramatically increased from 8 percent of the total delegates at the 1980 convention to 15.5 percent in 1984 (<italic>Report of the Commission on Presidential Nomination</italic>, 26 March 1982, hereafter referred to as the Hunt Commission Report) and has continued to rise in subsequent elections. Superdelegates made up approximately 20 percent of the convention delegates at the 2008 convention.</p>
</sec>

<title>Representation and the presidential nomination process</title>
<p>The reintroduction of party leaders and elected officials within the nomination process by the 1980 Hunt Commission is indicative of the ongoing debate within the party over the proper model of the presidential nomination process. Those who favour the ‘participatory’ model urge greater democratization within the party; rank-and-file members should have a full and meaningful opportunity to participate in the selection of the nominee.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354068810376782">1</xref>
</sup> The more traditional ‘trustee-brokerage’ model emphasizes that party leaders, by virtue of their experience, have a better sense of the electability of presidential candidates. Implicit in each of these models are assumptions about the proper role of the delegate and the goals of the national convention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068810376782">2</xref>
</sup> The participatory model assumes that convention delegates follow the mandate of the primary or caucus vote. According to this model, a delegate should act as an ‘instructed delegate’ rather than as a Burkean ‘trustee’ who exercises a certain amount of independent judgement. The trustee-brokerage model assumes that the convention should be a deliberative body where the nomination is made through a process of bargaining and compromise among delegates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810376782">Crotty and Jackson, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>During the past 40 years, the Democratic Party has vacillated between these two models, and delegate selection rules have literally been reversed twice with regard to the use of elected officials and party leaders as delegates. During the 1968 Democratic convention, Senator Eugene McCarthy and his supporters claimed that they had not had a fair chance at a convention that was made up of delegates selected by party leaders in ‘smoke-filled backrooms’. As this chaotic convention drew to a close, the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection (popularly known as the McGovern–Fraser Commission) was created. The commission recommended 18 specific guidelines regarding delegate selection. Among them was the expectation that states would repeal laws that allowed certain public or party office-holders to be delegates simply by virtue of their official positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810376782">Crotty and Jackson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068810376782">Democratic National Committee, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810376782">Scott and Hrebenar, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>After McGovern’s defeat in 1972 and Carter’s difficulties in the White House, Democratic Party leaders began to reappraise the move towards democratization that began with the McGovern–Fraser Commission. Some argued that the 1972 and 1976 conventions had contained too many ‘amateur’ delegates who had little understanding of the necessary qualities for successful presidential candidates. Others argued that exclusion of mainstream Democrats prevented presidential nominees from building coalitions that were necessary for winning the election or governing effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810376782">Scott and Hrebenar, 1984</xref>). As a result, the 1978 Winograd Commission increased the size of state delegations by approximately 10 percent in order to grant voting rights to state party officials and elected officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810376782">Democratic National Committee, 1978</xref>). In 1982, the Hunt Commission increased the number of these superdelegates dramatically, as described above. The Commission argued that there was also a need to restore peer review to the nomination process. According to this view, superdelegates, owing to their prior experience in government or party politics, are more capable of assessing a candidate’s leadership potential. The Hunt Commission also emphasized the importance of coalition-building within the party prior to nomination, when alliances would be formed that would help all party members campaign and govern effectively. Therefore, party ties would be strengthened among elected officials by giving them a greater sense of identification with the nominee and platform. The commission also defended the unpledged status of these superdelegates by arguing that it would help return decision-making and flexibility to the convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810376782">Democratic National Committee, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the first nomination contest in which superdelegates played an enhanced role, the 1984 race, spawned immediate controversy. In the winter of this year, presidential candidates Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson criticized the early endorsement of Walter Mondale by unpledged superdelegates from the US Congress and argued that such an arrangement clearly favoured the candidate who had well-established ties with elected officials. In addition, these superdelegates in 1984 played a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the nomination. As analysed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810376782">Southwell (1986)</xref>, Mondale received only 38 percent of the vote in the primaries, but won 55.7 percent of the delegates from those states, including 79.4 percent of the superdelegates. This dramatic lead in superdelegates was the main factor that enabled Mondale to reach the number of delegates needed for the nomination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068810376782">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The controversy over these unpledged superdelegates in the 1984 nomination race helped to spawn the resolution passed by the Rules Committee during the convention, creating the Fairness Commission to review, once again, the nomination process of the Democratic Party. Jackson forces wanted to abolish unpledged superdelegates, whereas Hart supporters advocated reducing their number to 5 percent of the total delegates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810376782">Democratic National Committee, 1984</xref>). A powerful coalition formed, nonetheless, to ensure the survival of unpledged superdelegates. On 1 February 1985, the Democratic National Committee passed a resolution calling for their continuance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810376782">Kamarck, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Although superdelegates displayed a distinct preference for Dukakis over Jackson in 1988, Clinton over Brown and Tsongas in 1992 and Gore over Bradley in 2000, their support did not differ much from the overwhelming number of primary and caucus victories enjoyed by Dukakis, Clinton and Gore in these years. In 2004, controversy over superdelegates arose again. Before the first caucus or primary was conducted, former Vermont governor, Howard Dean, held endorsements or pledges of support from 117 superdelegates, while the other candidates had the backing of considerably fewer. However, the primaries and caucuses intervened, and Dean’s edge among superdelegates steadily eroded after his defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>In 2008, concerns about the possible impact of superdelegates arose not from the candidates themselves, as occurred in 1984, but from the media, public interest groups and certain party leaders. As early as February 2008, several observers saw that the race for the Democratic nomination was likely to be close, and became concerned about the possibly decisive role of superdelegates<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068810376782">4</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810376782">Spivak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810376782">Wirzbicki, 2008</xref>). In early February 2008, Nagourney and Hulse noted how Obama and Clinton were both aware that the nomination race might not be settled in the primaries and caucuses, with both candidates ‘lavishing attention on a group that might hold the balance of power’ (2008: A1). During the winter of 2008, MoveOn.org began an online petition drive stating: ‘The Democratic Party must be democratic. The superdelegates should let the voters decide between Clinton and Obama, then support the people’s choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810376782">MoveOn.org, 2008</xref>). Another organization, Democracy for America, run by Howard Dean’s brother, Jim, launched a similar ‘Voters Decide’ campaign ‘to pressure Democratic superdelegates to affirm the winner of the popularly allocated delegates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810376782">Democracy for America, 2008</xref>). Shortly afterwards, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stated that superdelegates should ‘reflect’ which candidate had claimed the most pledged delegates, although she was careful to note that she was not referring to the popular vote in each state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810376782">Silva, 2008</xref>). Those superdelegates who subsequently endorsed this principle were considered members of the ‘Pelosi Club’ and included former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>In addition, a new wrinkle was added: campaign contributions to the superdelegates by certain presidential candidates. The non-partisan Center for Responsible Politics noted the sizeable campaign contributions that had been given to superdelegates by both Obama’s and Clinton’s PACs, but disagreement arose among observers as to how much influence the contributions were likely to have on superdelegates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810376782">
<italic>Boston Globe</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810376782">Mayer, 2008</xref>). As such, these developments during the winter of 2008 began to resemble the 1984 nomination process by underscoring the potential influence of superdelegates.</p>

<sec id="section3-1354068810376782">
<title>Previous research on superdelegates</title>
<p>Within the presidential literature, research on superdelegates is usually embedded in an analysis of the impact of the ‘rules of the game’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068810376782">5</xref>
</sup> The paucity of research on superdelegates arises, in part, from the transitory nature of such political actors. They are a changing set of faces, and they really only evoke interest or cause concern when certain candidates are disadvantaged or the popular will seems to be thwarted – similar to the Electoral College. In addition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810376782">Southwell’s (1986)</xref> analysis of the 1984 race, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810376782">Cohen et al.’s (2001)</xref> findings support their claim that party leaders have been able to give their chosen candidates a sufficient edge on the nomination battlefield, such that their anointed favourites have won each party’s nomination from 1980 to 2000. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810376782">Ansolabehere and King (1990)</xref> did not examine the votes of superdelegates themselves, their model of the translation of votes in primaries and caucuses into delegates (from 1976 to 1988) suggests that candidate bias is a good prediction of the winner of the nomination contest. Herrera’s article (1995) addresses the ‘representativeness’ of superdelegates. Relying on data about the views of delegates to the 1988 national party conventions and the 1988 American National Election Study, he dismisses fears that professional delegates (i.e. superdelegates) were more out of touch with the party’s rank-and-file members than were pre-reform delegates.</p>
<p>Despite their seemingly transitory role, the impact of these superdelegates on the outcome of the nomination is not readily dismissed. Following the release of the Hunt Commission Report in 1982, one member of the Democratic National Committee pointed out that in a tight contest for the nomination this unpledged bloc of 14 percent could prove decisive to the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810376782">Davis, 1982</xref>). Given the prolonged race for the Democratic nomination in 2008, this scenario proved to be prophetic.</p>
<p>By 5 June 2008, the end of the primary and caucus season, most estimates concluded that Obama would receive a majority of the delegate votes, approximately 53.9 percent of the total. These projections were momentous for both the Obama and Clinton campaigns, with Clinton soon afterwards pledging her support (and her own superdelegate vote) to Obama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810376782">
<italic>New York Times</italic>, 2008</xref>). Of this total, Obama had secured 65.8 percent of the superdelegates (542 out of 824), while Clinton had gained the support of only 26.3 percent (217), with 7.2 percent still uncommitted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354068810376782">6</xref>
</sup> At this time, the delegates from the states of Michigan and Florida were counted as one-half. Yet this widely circulated delegate total masked a significant difference between the candidate totals of pledged delegates and unpledged superdelegates.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is an examination of the candidate preferences of these 2008 superdelegates and of their role in determining the eventual Democratic nominee.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068810376782">7</xref>
</sup> Were female superdelegates more likely to back Hillary Clinton and African-Americans Barack Obama? Did the candidate preferences of superdelegates who were elected officials differ from those who were members of the Democratic National Committee? How much did the primary and caucus results influence the behaviour of superdelegates? What was the extent of campaign contributions to superdelegates, and did such contributions influence their support for a particular presidential candidate? Did superdelegate preferences in states differ substantially from those of pledged delegates? Did superdelegates determine the outcome of the 2008 Democratic nomination, as they appear to have done in 1984? Would other nomination rules have changed the outcome?</p>

<title>Superdelegates as political actors</title>
<p>We first examine the preferences of these superdelegates with regard to gender, race and type (as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810376782">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068810376782">8</xref>
</sup> Of this bloc of superdelegates, 36 percent were women, a majority of whom supported the Obama candidacy, although considerably less so than superdelegates who were men. Approximately 5 percent of the superdelegates were African-American and 89.5 percent supported Obama much more than they did other superdelegates.</p>

<p>A possible explanation for this contrast is the political pressure felt by elected officials to support the candidate who won in their state or district, that is, a ‘vox populi’ response, despite the freedom that superdelegate status gave them. This was the defence that Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), a long-time friend of the Clintons, gave as his reason for switching support from Clinton to Obama. In his 5th congressional district, over 75 percent of voters favoured Obama in Georgia’s primary.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1354068810376782">Table 3</xref>
 provides little aggregate support for this argument, however, as the support for Obama remains very strong among elected officials, even in the states in which Clinton received more popular votes than Obama. (Note that for the sake of clarity, the data on uncommitted delegates are omitted from this table.) The percentage of Obama supporters is lower (except for governors) when one considers only the states in which Clinton came out on top, but only among DNC members does Clinton get a plurality of superdelegates in such states. The deviant endorsements (the upper right and lower left cells for each category of superdelegate) showed a distinct preference for Obama, as 257 (or 79 percent) of the total number of deviant endorsements went to Obama. This bias is particularly true for elected officials. For example, 108 (or 49 percent) of the 222 US representatives who were superdelegates supported Obama in the states in which Clinton won the popular vote in the primary or caucus. Although 52 DNC members supported Clinton in states where Obama was the winner, this subset constituted only 13 percent of the 396 DNC members who were superdelegates.</p>

<title>Campaign contributions to superdelegates</title>
<p>A more nefarious explanation for superdelegate endorsement is the effect of campaign contributions made by the two leading candidates on these superdelegates, as noted earlier. For this purpose, I examine the two political action committees established by both Clinton and Obama for the purpose of contributing to federal or state candidates. HILLPAC was created by Clinton in 2005, and a similar political action committee, the Hope Fund, was created by Obama in the same year. Obama clearly outspent Clinton with regard to the overall amount of contributions to superdelegates, and gave to a greater number of them as well. Across these four years, Obama gave $680,926 to 100 superdelegates that were eligible to receive campaign funds, averaging $6,766. Clinton gave $247,500 to 47 such superdelegates, averaging $5,906. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068810376782">Table 4</xref>

<p>Obama contributed to 31 percent of all the superdelegates who were elected officials, and Clinton only 12.7 percent. Of the donations to superdelegates, Clinton focused on governors, who, ironically, were the group least likely to back her candidacy.</p>
<p>In all analyses of campaign contributions, one is left with the inevitable quandary of causation. Did such contributions affect the candidate choice of superdelegates, or did they simply flow to the federal and state candidates with a personal or political affinity to the candidate? It is not surprising that Clinton would give $5,000 to a DNC member (Terry McAuliffe) who was also her campaign manager and an announced candidate for Virginia’s 2009 gubernatorial race. Similarly, Obama gave to seven US representatives (and superdelegates) from his home state of Illinois. However, other, more strategic, examples include contributions by both candidates to all the congressional superdelegates from both Iowa and New Hampshire. (Clinton also gave to Iowa’s governor, and Obama to a DNC member from New Hampshire who was also a state senator.)</p>
<p>Of course, Obama and Clinton gave to many candidates who were not superdelegates as well. However, 86 percent of Obama’s Hope Fund recipients in 2008 (48 out of 56) were superdelegates, while only 23 percent of those who received funds from Clinton’s HILLPAC in 2008 (14 out of 60) were superdelegates. Either Clinton did not spend enough or she gave to too few superdelegates, or the money simply did not make a difference.</p>

<sec id="section6-1354068810376782">
<title>Multivariate analysis</title>
<p>In an effort to control for the various factors that may have affected the endorsements of superdelegates, as discussed above, a binary logistic regression model was estimated, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1354068810376782">Table 5</xref>. Here, we control for the demographic variables of race and gender, as well as campaign contributions and the statewide percentage received by Obama in the primary or caucus. The dependent variable is candidate endorsement (1 = Obama; 0 = Clinton or uncommitted). In general, these results support the bivariate findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810376782">Tables 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810376782"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1354068810376782"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068810376782">4</xref>. Female superdelegates were less likely to support Obama than were men, while in contrast African-Americans were more likely to support him. A higher percentage of the popular vote received by Obama in the primary or caucus may have influenced superdelegates to support him. The effect of contributions from Obama to superdelegates also appeared to boost his support, but Clinton contributions had little impact.</p>

<p>The explanatory power of this model is not particularly strong, so there were clearly additional explanations for these superdelegate endorsements. A crucial one may have been that they simply preferred one candidate over another. Independently of their own gender or race, many were willing to go against the popular vote in their state or caucus. Simply put, they were acting as superdelegates should, i.e. in accordance with supporters of the reforms that created and enhanced their role in the nomination process.</p>
<p>We now return to the initial concerns expressed in early 2008, and throughout the past few decades, that this unpledged status of superdelegates deviated from the popular will, as expressed in the primaries and caucuses. Did the bias of superdelegates for Obama in 2008 merely influence the outcome, or did it result in an outcome that differed from the preferences of rank-and-file Democratic members?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1354068810376782">
<title>Effect of superdelegates on the nomination outcome</title>
<p>As discussed above, superdelegates showed an overwhelming preference for Obama by early June 2008. In contrast, the candidate preferences of pledged delegates reveal a much closer nomination race. Following the conclusion of the primary/caucus season, and the 31 May 2008 ruling that the Florida and Michigan delegates would receive only half a vote, the proportionality rules of the party had resulted in the allocation of 50.1 percent of the pledged delegates to Obama, with 48.0 percent to Clinton, and the remaining 1.9 percent uncommitted (Leip, 2009). The contrast between pledged delegates and unpledged superdelegates is indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1354068810376782">Table 6</xref>.</p>

<p>The primary and caucus results for each state are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1354068810376782">Table 6</xref>. The impact of the superdelegates is revealed in the overall make-up of each state’s delegation. In three states where Clinton was the ‘winner’ of the popular vote, she actually received fewer total delegates than did Obama. For example, in Ohio, where Clinton won 53.5 percent of the popular vote in the state’s primary, she received 78 delegates as compared to 81 delegates for Obama. The 14-to-4 preference of the superdelegates for Obama was enough to give him the edge in total delegates from Ohio (see also Nevada and Arkansas). In many other states, the Obama advantage among superdelegates was so overwhelming that the proportionality of the pledged delegates was diminished considerably. For example, in 10 states, Clinton received no superdelegate votes, despite popular vote margins as high as 41 percent (Oregon).<sup>

</sup> The two rightmost columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1354068810376782">Table 6</xref> indicate the impact of the superdelegate preferences on the overall proportionality of each state’s delegation. The furthest right column is the deviation in the percentage of superdelegates for Clinton as compared to the Clinton percentage of the popular vote in the state or caucus. One column to the left of this column is the deviation in percentage of the entire state delegation for Clinton, as compared to the popular vote. Of course, the magnitude of this percentage is much more significant in the larger states such as California.</p>

<title>Hypothetical outcomes of the 2008 nomination</title>
<p>I now turn to hypothetical estimations of this nomination race with alternative rules. What if there had been no superdelegates? What would the outcome have been had a modified ‘Pelosi’ rule<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1354068810376782">11</xref>
</sup> been applied to each state, i.e. if all superdelegates had given their support to the candidate who got the most pledged delegates in each state. What if all of the delegates had been allocated in proportion to the votes received in a state – the criteria that are close to the stated goal of MoveOn.org’s and Democracy for America’s petitions, as well as the method that is the most commonly mentioned in literature on presidential nominations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810376782">Ansolabehere and King, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810376782">Ceaser, 1979</xref>). As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1354068810376782">Table 7</xref>, Obama would have had a much tighter race for the nomination under these three scenarios than was the actual case. Without the votes of unpledged superdelegates, Obama would have received only a few more votes than the necessary number for nomination, especially if Michigan and Florida were included in the tally. Looking at the modified Pelosi rule and proportionality, Clinton and Obama are in a dead heat; Obama would gain enough delegates for the nomination only when the states of Michigan and Florida are excluded.</p>

<p>All of these outcomes, even the actual one, are made murky by the uncertainty about the Michigan and Florida delegations. The simplest way to handle this is to exclude them from certain analyses. However, it is difficult to completely ignore the size of the Clinton vote in both these states, even with the absence of campaigning in Florida by either candidate, or Obama’s absence from the Michigan ballot. In general, the race for the nomination could have been quite different without the presence of these unpledged superdelegates, or under alternative rules for delegation selection.</p>

<sec id="section9-1354068810376782">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The above analysis suggests that the impact of unpledged superdelegates on the 2008 Democratic nomination was significant. However, these scenarios are quite different from expected by the commentators of early 2008, when Clinton seemed to have the advantage among superdelegates. Yet, as Obama began to gain on her in certain primaries and caucuses, the superdelegates gravitated towards Obama, despite Clinton’s victories in the late primaries in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Perhaps the superdelegate pendulum was a bit too volatile in this nomination race, as many of them watched the pledged delegate total with a wary eye. However, a significant number of superdelegates continue to follow their own preferences, especially in states where Clinton was victorious. And this asymmetry made a difference in the nomination race.</p>
<p>Aside from certain disgruntled Clinton supporters, very few individuals are likely to lose much sleep over the 2008 nomination process, given the outcome of the presidential election in November. However, the 2008 Democratic nomination contest veered close to the scenario of a delegate winner without a decisive win in the popular vote,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1354068810376782">12</xref>
</sup> even though it was not identical to the 1984 one. The extensive discussion over the possible gap between popular preferences and superdelegate commitments in early 2008 suggests that such issues of ‘fairness’ or ‘democracy’ are likely to reoccur whenever a competitive race for the nomination emerges.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party might wish to head off such controversy before it occurs again. First, it would seem a good public relations step to discourage presidential candidates from making campaign contributions to any convention delegates once they have achieved delegate status. Second, the party could reduce substantially the number of party leaders and elected officials at the convention, from 20 percent to 8–10 percent, as was the case before 1984. Alternatively, the party can require that the bulk of superdelegates be pledged, or that superdelegate endorsements be delayed, until the end of the campaign season. The party may have to adjust its rules, once again, to maintain an acceptable balance of power between elite and rank-and-file members.</p>

<p>Unlike the analysis of convention floor votes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810376782">Southwell (1986)</xref>, we examine the public endorsements of superdelegates as of 6 June 2008 after the conclusion of the primary and caucus season. This step seems justified, given that the convention floor vote in August 2008 was overwhelmingly in favour of Obama, even among delegates previously pledged to Clinton.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, this table displays the full count of delegates from the states of Michigan and Florida. Initially, the Rules Committee allowed a half-vote for each of these delegates, but their full count was restored during the Democratic National Convention.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1354068810376782">
<label>9.</label>
<p>Obama also received more support from superdelegates from caucus states (79.3 percent) compared to primary states (63.5 percent).</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-1354068810376782">

<p>It is not quite clear whether Speaker Pelosi intended superdelegates to follow the preferences of pledged delegates <italic>nationwide</italic> or <italic>statewide</italic>; we will adopt the latter method, as this is in keeping with the concept of a delegation from each state or territory.</p>

<p>Again, the Michigan and Florida primaries prevent an estimate of the nationwide Democratic popular vote, but <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1354068810376782">Table 6</xref> indicates a very close race.</p>
