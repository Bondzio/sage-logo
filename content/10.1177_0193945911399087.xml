<abstract>
<p>Although HIV is considered a chronic pediatric illness that is on the wane in the United States, challenges remain for those affected. The purpose of this longitudinal qualitative study was to examine the phenomenon of raising an HIV-positive child in the United States from the parental perspective. This study incorporated a longitudinal, phenomenological approach. The purposive sample included parents and guardians from 10 families from the northeast region of the United States with children diagnosed with asymptomatic HIV infection at the study onset. The researcher conducted in-depth interviews with the parents over a 7-year period. The common themes identified included: balancing normalcy with uncertainty, facing the multifaceted dilemmas associated with disclosure, and addressing the evolving medication and treatment challenges. The findings of this study can enhance the understanding of nurses and other health care professionals to improve policies, standards of care, and interventions for children and families living with pediatric HIV infection.</p>

<p>Since the early 1990s, there has been a significant reduction in the number of children under the age of 13 living with HIV/AIDS in the United States as a result of the increase in routine HIV screening during pregnancy and improved treatments to prevent perinatal HIV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911399087">Lampe et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the dramatic decrease in perinatal HIV transmission rates, an estimated 8,500 HIV-positive children are living in the United States and entering their teen years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911399087">Hazra, Siberry, &amp; Mofenson, 2010</xref>). During the past decade, advances in HIV treatment have changed the outlook of this infection from a lethal infection to a chronic disease. Although the literature on chronic illness in children provides insights on the issues of raising a child with HIV, the unique challenges associated with HIV from a longitudinal perspective as treatments continue to evolve have not been fully examined.</p>
<p>Although the numbers of children born with perinatally acquired HIV in the United States have dwindled to fewer than 300 newborns in 24 selected U.S. areas under surveillance from 2000 to 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911399087">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008a</xref>), a cohort of children born with HIV persists and these children are now “coming of age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911399087">CDC, 2008b</xref>, p. 3). It is estimated that there are between 8500 and 10,000 children who were born with HIV since the 1990s who are living in the United States today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911399087">Belluck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911399087">Hazra et al., 2010</xref>). Global improvements in HIV screening and access to antiretrovirals during pregnancy have been documented in the past decade. However, only 45% of all pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries received antiretrovirals in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911399087">World Health Organization [WHO], 2008</xref>). The opportunities for children with HIV/AIDS to be identified early and treated appropriately vary considerably depending on the country of origin and its level of economic development.</p>
<p>The reduction in mortality among HIV-positive children is attributed primarily to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since the mid 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911399087">Hazra et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of HIV-positive children in developed countries currently receive HAART, which has changed the infection from that of an acute fatal disease to another chronic illness of childhood. With the dramatic reduction in mortality, however, many HIV-positive children now face issues related to morbidity, associated with side effects of the treatment and other opportunistic infections.</p>
<p>Current research among children with HIV and other chronic illnesses has focused on quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911399087">Janse, Sinnema, Uiterwaal, Kimpen, &amp; Gemke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911399087">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911399087">Gannoni &amp; Shute, 2010</xref>), shared management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911399087">Kieckhefer, Trahms, Churchill, &amp; Simpson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911399087">Miller, 2009</xref>), and the impact of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911399087">Holm, Patterson, Rueter, &amp; Wamboldt, 2008</xref>). A recent qualitative metasynthesis of qualitative research on parenting children with chronic illness identified the major themes of chronic grief, a lack of adequate information, and deficiencies in the family–provider relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911399087">Kepreotes, Keatinge, &amp; Stone, 2010</xref>). The constructs of “chronic grief” and “chronic sorrow” have previously been documented among families of children with chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911399087">Eakes, Burke, &amp; Hainsworth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911399087">Lindgren, Burke, Hainsworth, &amp; Eakes, 1992</xref>). Lessons learned from these studies are relevant to families living with an HIV-positive child. However, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911399087">Bayer (1991)</xref> suggested an “end to HIV exceptionalism” in his classic paper, unique challenges continue to face families raising children with HIV to this day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911399087">Haberer &amp; Mellins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Special challenges faced by children living with HIV include the persistent racial/ethnic and economic disparities among persons and children with HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911399087">CDC, 2010</xref>), which can lead to access and compliance issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911399087">Haberer &amp; Mellins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911399087">Naar-King et al., 2009</xref>); the continually evolving standards of care for the prevention and treatment of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911399087">FDA Notifications, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911399087">Spensley et al., 2009</xref>); potential cognitive and behavioral issues associated with pediatric HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911399087">Burns, Hernandez-Reif, &amp; Jessee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911399087">Nozyce et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911399087">Rudy, Murphy, Harris, Muenz, &amp; Ellen, 2009</xref>); the potential for multiple affected family members and the persistent vestiges of stigma, which affect psychological adjustment and the disclosure process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911399087">Belluck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911399087">Davey, Duncan, Foster, &amp; Milton, 2008</xref>); and potential side effects from the life-long medication, including memory loss, abnormal fat redistribution, high lipids, cardiac, and/or renal problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911399087">Belluck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911399087">Hazra et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of studies that examined the lives of families with children with HIV infection relied predominantly on cross-sectional quantitative methods focusing on one major measure of their lives, including quality of life in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911399087">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), standardized psychological and self-concept measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911399087">New, Lee, &amp; Elliott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911399087">Waweru, Reynolds, &amp; Buckner, 2008</xref>), adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911399087">Haberer &amp; Mellins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911399087">Rudy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911399087">Simoni et al., 2007</xref>), and sexual behaviors among HIV-positive teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911399087">Brogly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911399087">Childs &amp; Maxwell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911399087">Wiener, Battles, &amp; Wood, 2007</xref>). Although these studies reveal insight into specific issues, they do not paint a broad picture of the richness of their lives over time. No studies were noted that focused on the experience of raising a child with HIV.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945911399087">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the phenomenon of raising a child with HIV from a longitudinal perspective in a developed country (United States). Specifically the major research question was, What is the experience over time of raising an HIV-positive child in the United States from the parents’ perspective?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0193945911399087" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study design incorporated a heuristic and transcendental phenomenological approach as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911399087">Moustakas (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911399087">1994)</xref>. Moustakas discusses the heuristic approach as a way of knowing that involves an investigation of a human phenomenon. It assumes that the investigator has direct and personal interest in the phenomenon and that the process of discovery engages the researcher and the study participants. Moustakas refined his heuristic approach into a transcendental method borrowing from the work of Husserl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911399087">Moustakas, 1994</xref>). He proposed an “organized, disciplined and systematic study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911399087">Moustakas, 1994</xref>, p. 103) that involved seven requirements. These included a reflective series of steps in the research process involving the discovery of a research question that has social significance to the analysis and that ultimately reflects a “synthesis of textural and structural meanings and essences” (p. 104) gleaned from person-to-person interviews. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911399087">Shin, Kim, and Chung (2009)</xref> recently noted that his method is less commonly used than other phenomenological researchers’, based on their review of published qualitative research between 1999 and 2007. However, his method has been incorporated into studies in numerous fields of study, including psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911399087">Brown, Sorrell, McClaren, &amp; Creswell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911399087">Moerer-Urdahl &amp; Creswell, 2004</xref>), nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911399087">Caldwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911399087">Peterson, Sword, Charles, &amp; DiCenso, 2007</xref>), and counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911399087">Pinson, Ottens, &amp; Fisher, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The original study design planned for an annual in-person interview with the parents/guardians for a 5-year period. Because of unanticipated circumstances in the researcher’s life, data collection was postponed during 2 years of the original time frame; thus the study period extended over a 7-year period. An additional modification in the design included one round of interviews with the children during the final year of the study. This change came about as a result of several parents’ suggestions. The results of the children’s interviews are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911399087">Mawn, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0193945911399087">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The researcher purposively recruited parents/guardians from a pediatric HIV clinic in the northeast region of the United States. The inclusion criteria at the study outset included parents or legal guardians of children, ages 3 to 8 years, who had HIV infection that did not meet the AIDS criteria and whose immune function was considered normal based on age-appropriate CD4 counts. The age range was selected at the outset so that the children would all be within a relatively homogenous group of school-age children in the preteen years during the study period. The medical criteria were chosen at the outset as the focus was on children who were living with HIV, as opposed to those who were dying or suffering significantly from HIV-related morbidity at the outset of the study.</p>
<p>Initially 12 families chose to participate; parents from two families withdrew from the study after the first year. The 10 families who contributed to this final study analysis included 11 parents/guardians from 10 families who had at least one child diagnosed with HIV who met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 39 years (range of 31-49). The reported parental race/ethnicity included Caucasian, non-Hispanic (6), African American (4), and Hispanic (1). The one family that had both parents participate at all of the interviews together consisted of two women who were partners. Among the 10 participating families, 1 parent was male; the remaining were female parents or guardians.</p>
<p>Among the 5 participating biological parents, all but 1 (a father) were also HIV positive; their HIV status was relatively stable throughout the study period. The remaining families included adoptive parents (4) or a relative with custody (1). Four of the 11 participants were college graduates whereas the remainder had a high school education only (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or some college (<italic>n</italic> = 4). The majority of participants were married (5) or living with a partner (4); 2 were single parents living with their child/children. Four families had a single child at the study outset; the remaining families had from three to five other children. The majority of families lived in urban areas; 3 lived in suburban settings and 1 lived in a rural area. All but 2 families relied on federal aid through either social security/disability and/or Medicaid coverage for their child’s health care. The children’s mean age at study onset was 5.4 years, with a range from 3 to 7. The majority of children were African American (five), followed by Hispanic (three) and Caucasian, non-Hispanic (two).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945911399087">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The researcher recruited families from a pediatric HIV/AIDS clinic at a hospital in the northeast region of the United States. The nurses and physicians in the clinic recruited families who met the study criteria and the inclusion criteria were verified by the researcher using the child’s medical record prior to the first interview. The researcher conducted all interviews in the family’s homes with the exception of one family, who preferred the hospital clinic setting. At the start of the interview, the researcher obtained a signed informed consent and reviewed the elements of the consent with each participant. The study was approved by two participating institutional review boards.</p>
<p>The interviews were audiotaped with permission and later transcribed. The interviewer kept pre- and postinterview field notes in order to maintain an audit trail and to facilitate the process of “epoche,” which Moustakas considers a core process in the transcendental method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911399087">1994</xref>). He describes this term as a “new way of looking at things” (p. 33) that necessitates reflection and setting aside of one’s own perceptions and understanding of the phenomenon. The interviews lasted from 1 to 4 hours, with an average of 2 hours. The majority of participants completed five interviews over the 7-year period; two families were able to complete only four interviews.</p>
<p>The researcher conducted interviews with all of the participating parents in English with the exception of one participant. A social worker trained in qualitative research and pediatric HIV care conducted the interviews with one parent in Spanish. These interviews were transcribed into Spanish and then translated to English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945911399087">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The researcher followed the steps of phenomenological analysis outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911399087">Moustakas (1994)</xref>, which included considering each statement from each transcript and recording all relevant statements, listing each nonoverlapping statement and cluster into themes to describe a texture of the experience from each transcript, reflecting on the textual descriptions, identifying a structural description of the experience from each transcript, constructing a textual and structural description for each of the participants, and finally deriving a composite textual–structural description of the meaning and essence of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The researcher analyzed all transcripts individually first and then on an aggregate level to evaluate common themes in that period. The final analysis included an exhaustive examination of the experiences of the phenomenon over time, focusing on the aggregate level while noting pertinent family-level changes as well.</p>
<sec id="section6-0193945911399087">
<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911399087">Moustakas (1990)</xref> recommended that the analysis process can be enhanced through verification by the study participants. After the first year, the researcher attempted to verify emerging themes from the interviews by mailing a summary of the emerging individual themes to the study participants with a stamped, return envelope addressed to the researcher. None responded to this method; subsequent member checking was limited to a verbal recap by the researcher of the stories and themes expressed at each subsequent interview. Although this method appeared to facilitate the discussion by cueing the participant as to where he or she left off at the last interview, it may have been a limitation to the study as it could have influenced the subsequent discussion in ways the researcher could not anticipate. The researcher sought validation of themes on an ongoing basis each year as graduate students in the researcher’s qualitative research course examined the transcripts for themes and textual and structural descriptions. The researcher kept a detailed audit trail including field notes from each interview encounter. These assisted in the analysis phase to help the researcher recall and reflect on her own feelings and preconceptions before or after the interview itself.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-0193945911399087">
<title>Major Themes</title>
<p>Each family unit had its own unique story and strengths. Despite their different paths, the phenomenon of raising a child with HIV over time for these families did emerge with several shared themes. Over time these included balancing normalcy with uncertainty, facing the multifaceted dilemma of disclosure, and addressing the evolving medication and treatment challenges.</p>
<sec id="section9-0193945911399087">
<title>Balancing normalcy with uncertainty</title>
<p>Despite the ever-present awareness of the uncertainties associated with HIV, the parents did not view their children daily within the context of the virus. As one parent shared, “Latisha [all names used in this report are fictitious] is in the choir, I’m in the choir and my husband is in the choir. . . . We spend whatever time we can together when we are at home because he still works a lot of crazy hours . . . but . . . that’s the important things in life and HIV just takes a back seat to all of it. Like I said, the only way we know it’s here is because we take the medicines.”</p>
<p>The parents were neither living in denial nor chronic sorrow; rather, their stories reflected a positive attitude toward many uncertainties in their lives. Over the 7-year period, the uncertainties changed subtly to include concern and worry about the teen years, which were rarely spoken of during the first 2 years. The parents frequently used the term <italic>normal</italic> when describing their child. And yet, their lives required “balancing” as a result not only of the changing standards of care that they were faced with related to HIV but also the changing nature of life itself. “Normalcy” for many included common life struggles such as job loss, marital problems, loneliness, and their own and other family members’ health problems, sometimes related to HIV but often not. In addition, they shared other “normal” life issues such as their child’s struggles with school adjustment and performance, violence in their lives, pregnancy, a new adoption, and death of loved ones.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all of the children remained stable medically during the study period; none experienced a serious HIV/AIDS-related illness or hospitalization. Thus while parents focused on “normalcy” from day to day, they also needed to balance uncertainties related to treatment changes and concerns about an unknown future for their children. As Shauna eloquently shared, “Looking forward to the future when she is a teenager and after she is out of high school and goes to college . . . when she is thinking about perhaps a serious relationship or wanting to get married . . . if she feels that maybe someone won’t love her because she is HIV positive or she will never be able to have kids or I don’t know what kind of thought she will be having but again I am staying very prayerful that there will be something . . . by the time she is 20 to help her live life and find someone who loves her and have children the same way I was able to.”</p>
<p>But despite concerns addressed throughout the study period, a positive attitude typically prevailed, which suggested a focus on “normalcy” as exemplified by Precious, the mother of a 12-year-old girl: “I keep her in dance activities and gymnastics and aerobics. She is dancing and singing . . . so you keep her, you know, like a normal child.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Lisa, the adoptive parent of an 8-year-old daughter expressed: “[She is] . . . a regular kid. I never taught her that she was different in any way. The only difference is that we take our medicine every day.” As the prognosis for children with HIV continued to improve over time, the uncertainty remained but clearly with an upbeat attitude of a “near normalcy.” Elizabeth shared the following sentiments during her third interview:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I was thinking over the weekend that there was something I wanted to tell you that had changed in our emotional life. And that is I took money that I had put aside for Laurie’s funeral and I am using it for summer camp and some of it I am putting away in a college fund now. . . . So far you know she has been very, very, lucky . . . [but we are] still having to deal with the ambiguity of not knowing what the right treatment is . . . the hardest is living in the ambiguity and not knowing which is the right risk to take.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193945911399087">
<title>Facing the multifaceted dilemma of disclosure</title>
<p>The dilemma of disclosure was incredibly complex for all of the participating families in this study. The parents were faced with numerous decisions about disclosure from the moment of the child’s diagnosis. Parents struggled with the question of “Who can I trust?” to share this diagnosis with. The paramount concern over the course of the study period, however, was related to the issues of when and what to tell the child. By the end of the study period, when the average age of the children was 12 years, with a range of 10 to 14, all but two of the children had been told that they were HIV positive. As the study unfolded, 3 of the 10 children ended up hearing of their diagnosis inadvertently from others outside of the home.</p>
<p>The parents of the two children that had not been told of their diagnosis each had a unique story. Robert, the biological father of a now 12-year-old boy, had experienced the death of his wife along with suffering the indignity of being ostracized by neighbors who learned of his wife and son’s diagnosis. As a single parent, he could not bear to explain to his son that the reason he was taking medications unlike his friends was because of the same virus that killed his mother. He shared his perception:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Nobody knows anything. He doesn’t even know. He knows the only reason he takes his medicine is to keep himself healthy. But I mean there is still a lot of ignorant people out there. And I don’t think I will let anybody in on that. It will stay a secret and God forbid he really gets sick. . . . It’s really no one’s business. And as long as he is healthy and doing good, that’s all that matters.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another parent discussed a different dilemma. The adoptive mother shared her story of trying with her husband to sit their son down to explain “why his blood was different” and they wanted to tell him what the name of his condition was. “We’ve tried and he just refuses. He doesn’t want to know. . . . He hasn’t been willing for us to label it.” The child and family had been in counseling and plans were underway to consider possibly tell him together with the counselor. And yet his mother acknowledged: “To put it in a little bit better perspective, this is a 12-year-old kid who also refuses to believe that there is not a Santa. . . . He says to other kids . . . if you believe, he comes.”</p>
<p>In general there was a trend among parents/guardians to become somewhat less open with persons outside of the immediate family as time went on. Several commented that they tried not to burden the child with a “secret” but rather talked about it as something “private.” Precious shared her story of a painful experience for her daughter when she was in the fourth grade:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>She went to a birthday party and one of the kids’ friends’ mothers was a nurse that took care of Deirdre when she was maybe 6-7 months old. . . . She [the nurse/mother] told someone and it got to the little girls. And they waited until Monday and said, “Hey my mom said you have AIDS, So do you have AIDS?” She said, “No I don’t have AIDS . . . well that’s what my mom said.” So they didn’t push the issue. I told Deirdre, “You didn’t say you had AIDS which you don’t. You just have HIV.” . . . She don’t want to lose her friends. I think her friends are more important to her now than anything. So we don’t push it along.</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Addressing evolving medication and treatment challenges</title>
<p>In the early years of the study, the issues related to medication adherence were acknowledged by several parents. On top of these struggles was the feeling expressed by a few in the early years of the study that they were not really sure if the medications were necessary. In one interview, Ellen shared: “He is giving me so much grief about the medication. It is awful . . . I don’t know what to do . . . that is the biggest problem I am having.” Rosa, the mother of six children including 10-year-old Jose, who qualified for this study shared her story: “When he would ask, ‘Mommy I am tired of taking pills. Why do I have to take more pills?’ [she would respond] Baby if you want to live a little longer you have to take your pills. Do you want to go camping this summer? Then you have to take them.” To keep her child on track, she used a helpful computer program inserted in his watch that would vibrate when it was time to take his pills.</p>
<p>Over time, the concern was less about the difficulties of the parent getting the medication into the child but more concerned with the child’s ability or willingness to take some control over this aspect of his or her care. For example, by the final year of the study, at age 13, Elsa’s daughter was starting to rebel against taking the meds:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>She has been all right so far but she hasn’t been taking the medication. Her health has been okay and I’ve talked to her. . . . I try to force her but there is only so much I can do as far as making her take it . . . I scare her and all of that, nothing’s working. . . . To me she just don’t care.</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Participant Recommendations for Providers and Other Families</title>
<p>Despite satisfaction with many levels of care that the majority of families received, the parents had many recommendations for providers to improve communication and care. Several commented that they expected that their doctor work with them in a partnership and improve respect and communication. Rosa, whose first language is Spanish, in particular felt that “I am just another number.” She noted they never call to see how her son is doing and she felt no one listened to her at the clinic, including doctors, social workers, and psychologists. In contrast, Precious had a different experience at the same clinic: “ So far it’s [the care] been a blessing . . . as far as the social worker here, she gets there and nips in right in the bud. . . . I like the care . . . the next day someone from the clinic will call and see how she is doing.”</p>
<p>Kerrie and several other study participants recommended that school nurses in particular needed advanced education and training on the latest treatment and standards of care for children with HIV. All felt vulnerable to the evolving standards of care in the world of pediatric HIV infection and stressed the importance of developing trust, empathy, and a true partnership in the management to the illness. In particular, several commented that they felt pressured by the clinic staff about the timing of disclosure and were not respected as an equal partner in terms of making this and other treatment decisions. As Elizabeth noted, “We are people who actually really mean it when we say we want to be partners in our child’s health care and we actually know what that means.” The study participants also suggested future research to explore the upcoming issues HIV-positive children would face in their teen years.</p>
<p>Most participants lived in some level of isolation in terms of sharing the disclosure with others beyond immediate family. When asked what recommendations they had for other families, many expressed their faith in God as their mainstay and a major source of support beyond their immediate family members. Shauna explained: “Latisha knows the life that we live. We know God everyday; we just don’t know God on Sunday when we go to church. We know him on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.” Few had time or energy for any kind of support group although several mentioned that they wished that they could have had this type of support. But what they most commonly recommended for other parents is simply to love their special child as you would any other child. As Shauna commented, “No one is guaranteed tomorrow.” Ellen, an adoptive mother of Jeffrey whose HIV status was not initially known and who previously had raised her own six children, advised:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It’s not like oh, we have to treat them with kid gloves, no you don’t. Treat them like you would any other child, you’re just giving them the medicine, love ’em up! Will I do it again? If I was younger I would take another child but not at this age. If I didn’t have Jeffrey first and someone just said to me “Would you take an HIV child?” I can honestly tell you I don’t know if I would have. I probably would have been scared. Because . . . we didn’t know. But now, yeah, 10 years ago after him . . . I don’t fear anything about the disease.</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this longitudinal study supported other research findings among children with HIV and other chronic illnesses related to the tendency toward normalization, the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and concerns related to disclosure and medication adherence. The poignant stories shared generously by the study participants revealed resiliency as found in other studies of families living with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911399087">New et al., 2007</xref>), a positive outlook on life and a never-ending strive toward normalcy as reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911399087">Rehm &amp; Franck, 2000</xref>). The construct of uncertainty among children and families living with chronic illness has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911399087">Holm et al., 2008</xref>) and was supported by the findings of this study. The results of this study, however, did not support prior research that reported a lifetime colored by chronic sorrow experienced by families of children living with a chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911399087">Kepreotes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911399087">Lindgren et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In a review article on HIV disclosure to children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911399087">Wiener, Mellins, Marhefka, and Battles noted that “few research studies have been conducted that evaluate . . . the acute disclosure process as it unfolds over time” (2007</xref>, p. 162). This study contributed to the literature in that it provided a witness of the stories of disclosure over a 7-year period. The findings suggest considerations for health care providers to work collaboratively with parents and children as a team to better determine the disclosure process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911399087">Wiener, Mellins, and colleagues (2007)</xref> also reported various patterns of disclosure among children with HIV infection and identified factors related to nondisclosure, including caregiver’s assessment that the child is not “ready,” concern about keeping the diagnosis private, and concern about stigma. In contrast to their review, however, this study did not support findings from the literature that suggested that HIV-positive mothers are reluctant about disclosure because they harbor guilt or fear that their child will be angry at them.</p>
<p>In contrast to studies of older children with chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911399087">Kieckhefer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911399087">Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911399087">Naar-King et al., 2009</xref>), the construct of shared decision making was not a major theme noted in this study. However, issues related to medication adherence noted in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911399087">Hazra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911399087">Rudy et al., 2009</xref>) did emerge in this study.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study is that the purposive sample of parents was predominantly female and was recruited from a pediatric clinic. Thus the views were from mainly mothers and families who had access to high-level care in an urban pediatric HIV center in a developed country. However, the sample did have some diversity in terms of ethnicity, race, and economic status. Although critical research on outcomes for children with HIV infection in developing countries is underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911399087">Sauvageot, Schaefer, Olson, Pujades-Rodriquez, &amp; O’Brien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911399087">WHO, 2009</xref>) future studies need to consider not only access and response to medical therapies but the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of living with the illness among children living in less developed countries.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study’s aims and methods were unique in that they used a phenomenological approach over a 7-year period to examine the experience of raising a child with HIV. Parenting a child with HIV has similarities to parenting any child with a chronic illness, and yet this study provided evidence that despite significant progress, there are still some special considerations for families in this challenging situation. These families learned over time to balance very busy lives with the usual assortment of financial and social stressors to achieve a sense of normalcy despite ambiguity and uncertainty in their lives as a result of the virus. The parents did so with dignity, grace, a sense of humor, and compassion for their children and other families living with HIV.</p>
<p>Despite the significant reduction in maternal-to-child HIV transmission globally, without mandatory prenatal screening and access to care for all pregnant women, there will continue to be more HIV-positive children born in both developing and developed countries. As standards of care continue to evolve rapidly, urgent attention is necessary to examine the phenomenon of a raising an HIV-positive child in different social, geographic, and economic contexts to help health care providers, policy makers, and other support systems facilitate the journey of these children and their families throughout the world.</p>
