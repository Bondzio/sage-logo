<p>The “Welcome to City of East St. Louis” website promotes the city as a “great place to live, to work, to do business, and to raise a family.” However, according to the 2010 census, the city’s population had declined to less than one-third of its peak in 1950. Why such a drastic decline in the city’s population? In this wonderfully written and compelling ethnography, <italic>Abandoned in the Heartland</italic>, Jennifer F. Hamer details the transformation of East St. Louis from an industrial city to one that has become a segregated, isolated black community riddled with poverty. Hamer has written an engaging and often disturbing assessment of the problems of a low-income, black suburban city abandoned by its leaders’ economic and social policies. Yet, despite these problems, and like most Americans, these residents hope to become socioeconomically mobile and achieve the American dream.</p>
<p>By the time Hamer began this ethnographic research in 1996, the city of East St. Louis had amassed a 180-million-dollar debt. Some residents moved to other cities and a higher standard of living. Residents who stayed struggled to maintain a decent quality of life without decent wages. From 1996 to 2003, Hamer interviewed over 100 residents, attended public city meetings, and searched for historical data on the city. In order to explore the multitude of social problems that have plagued this city with its long history of racial strife and poverty, she had to drive around potholes and pass streets without sidewalks, houses in need of roof repairs, vacant lots, and boarded-up businesses. Only a tiny fraction of small businesses serve the once-thriving commercial downtown. While there was a small middle class, most were barely eking out a living.</p>
<p>Before World War I, East St. Louis was variously called the industrial offshoot of St. Louis and the Hoboken of St. Louis. But in 1917, the city was the scene of one of the bloodiest race riots in the twentieth century when over 100 black workers who were hired to replace white striking workers were beaten, stabbed, and lynched.</p>
<p>Hamer was not the first to observe this broken city infrastructure. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477381">1991</xref>, Jonathan Kozol described East St. Louis as “America’s Soweto,” a repository for a nonwhite population that is now regarded as expendable. Kozol’s focus on East St. Louis’ educational system pointed to the depressing conditions of their schools as inherent outcomes of racism and inadequate economic policy. Hamer takes a closer look at how residents grapple with inferior schools, low wages, part-time employment, and poor city services on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In Chapter One, Hamer recalls an earlier time when the streets of East St. Louis were filled with shoppers, moviegoers, and people eating at Blackman’s Terrace Cocktails and Steaks. Now, many of those buildings are boarded up. Aside from The Casino Queen, a gambling facility, few businesses in East St. Louis attract white customers. Although the casino brings in millions of dollars annually, profits have not trickled down to be reinvested in the local community. By the time Hamer visited East St. Louis, high unemployment and financial problems served to minimize industrial investment and reduce support for such essential services as fire and police.</p>
<p>Chapter Two shows us how most residents who must travel across the river to St. Louis to work in dead end jobs, struggle to maintain vehicles in good repair, as public transportation is ineffective or unavailable. The residents constantly worry about being fired if they have car trouble or are sick, since most of these employers harbor negative stereotypes of black employees, especially black men, as being unreliable and untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Hamer concludes that “this midwestern region of the United States has a history of reserving public space for white Americans” (p. 73). In the late 1980s, the police closed a bridge connecting St. Louis to East St. Louis. In 2000, the adjacent, predominantly white village of Sauget, Illinois built a makeshift barricade across the major thoroughfare that connected its community to East St. Louis. In both cases, black residents of East St. Louis were prevented from driving into these communities to shop or attend social events.</p>
<p>In Chapter Three, Hamer interviews East St. Louis residents who depend on service sector jobs but have few skills and limited transportation, a clear counterpoint to the “up by your own bootstraps” culture of poverty proposal. Hamer, like most scholars who study the black population, finds it necessary to explain that social problems like those faced by East St. Louis residents, are the result of institutionalized racism and class inequality and not inherent features of black culture. This contrast is further illustrated by Hamer’s finding that 33 percent of the families and 56 percent of youth below the age of 18 live below the poverty level.</p>
<p>Chapters Four to Seven take us into the lives of people who protect children and aged kin, who build community networks to overcome cumulative and unending social, physical, cultural, and economic demands. Hamer introduces men who search for meaning and opportunity in dead-end jobs, women who take on caretaking responsibilities until well into old age, and parents who have the impossible task of protecting their children from the dangers usually associated with urban cities.</p>
<p>Hamer concludes with a brief examination of President Obama’s domestic policies. She raises the question of how to assess the first black president’s performance when issues of abject poverty in areas like East St. Louis have not yet been addressed.</p>
<p>Where we live matters, Hamer tells us. Like all ethnographers who study impoverished communities, she has had to describe a community beset with economic and social obstacles that, without insightful analysis, could be misunderstood as symptoms of cultural dysfunction. Aside from this thoughtful and thought-provoking analysis, I was disappointed that she dismissed Kozol’s study of East St. Louis—after all, he helped open the door to this black community’s racial segregation, one that Hamer finds to be still alive in East St. Louis. Kozol’s work deserves more discussion than the mention that many East St. Louis residents saw his work as unfair and inaccurate. My view is that his study of East St. Louis is groundbreaking, and I have used his books in my own work and in my classroom teaching. In fact, Hamer’s major findings show that East St. Louis is still “America’s Soweto.”</p>
<p>Still, Hamer’s inquiry into one of America’s most neglected populations is a welcome addition to the fields of ethnography, race, class, and social justice.</p>
