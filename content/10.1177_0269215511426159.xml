<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To determine the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A in chronic plantar fasciitis compared to the local injection of a corticosteroid plus local anaesthetic.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of plantar fasciitis made at least six months earlier were selected to enter a randomized, single-blind study of treatment with injections of botulinum toxin type A or corticosteroid. There were 28 patients in each treatment group. Patients were evaluated at one month using the Foot Health Square Questionnaire and those with no clinical response subsequently received a second injection with the drug of the other arm of the study, creating two new treatment groups. Re-evaluation was performed at six months.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: One month after injection there was a clear clinical improvement in both treatment groups but it was greater in the botulinum toxin group, with a significant difference for the pain item (<italic>P</italic> = 0.069), though not in other items. At six months, patients treated with botulinum toxin type A had continued to improve in all items, whereas the corticosteroid group lost part of the improvement achieved at one month (improvement with botulinum toxin vs. corticosteroid: pain 19.10/–6.84 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), function 16.00/–8.80 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), footwear 13.48/–7.95 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004), self-perceived foot health 25.44/–5.41 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Botulinum toxin type A should be considered for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis in view of the improvement found at one month, and particularly at six months, when this treatment clearly has better results than corticosteroid injections. Further studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm these results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘Plantar heel pain’ or plantar fasciitis is a common condition that can lead to significant disability. It is a frequent problem among persons who practise sport regularly, accounting for more than 25% of disorders of the foot in athletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511426159">1</xref></sup> and, in general, affects 8% of individuals who run;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511426159">2</xref></sup> however, it also has a high prevalence in the general population, being responsible for 7% of cases of foot pain in the population over 65 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511426159">3</xref></sup> It is estimated that one million patients are seen for this condition in hospitals and health services (hospital outpatient departments and office-based physicians) in the United States each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511426159">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Plantar fasciitis causes pain and tenderness under the heel, occasionally also affecting the sole of the foot, particularly on weight bearing. The pain is characteristically worse during the first steps on getting up from bed in the morning or after periods of inactivity. It is also exacerbated by prolonged standing or walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref></sup> Although the disorder can be self-limiting, it more commonly leads to significant disability for months or even years. Risk factors have been proposed and are listed in a number of reviews and clinical guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511426159">7</xref></sup> Prolonged standing, a high body mass index and reduced ankle dorsiflexion are independent risk factors for developing plantar fasciitis. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic imaging for chronic plantar heel pain, McMillan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511426159">8</xref></sup> found calcaneal spurs to be eight times more common in individuals with heel pain than in a control group.</p>
<p>Numerous treatments have been used to manage plantar fasciitis, indicative of the absence of a curative therapy. The efficacy of these treatments has been evaluated in systematic reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511426159">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511426159">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511426159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup> Conservative treatments such as the use of insoles (off-the-shelf or made-to-measure), specific exercises to stretch the plantar fascia and night splints can lead to an improvement in pain and function (grade B recommendation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup>), but this may be short-lived.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref></sup> Shock-wave therapy has also achieved positive results in plantar fasciitis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426159">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511426159">7</xref></sup> but there is insufficient evidence to support its widespread application. Nor is there consensus regarding the most appropriate type of shock wave (electrohydraulic, electromagnetic or piezoelectric).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426159">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A widely used treatment in clinical practice is local corticosteroid injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511426159">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511426159">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511426159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup> In a systematic review, Crawford et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426159">11</xref></sup> concluded that evidence for the effectiveness of this therapy is limited and that it is only useful in the short term. The most recent review (2010) by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons considered this therapy to be a grade B recommendation for heel pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another approach has recently been proposed for the management of plantar fasciitis: injection with botulinum toxin type A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511426159"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511426159">16</xref></sup> This substance, which blocks presynaptic acetylcholine reuptake, produces weakness of the muscles related to the plantar fascia, reducing the tension and improving the pain, similar to its action in the treatment of myofascial pain disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref></sup> In addition, it has an analgesic action due to inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters involved in nociceptive neural pathways (glutamate, substance P and calcitonin-gene related peptide).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511426159">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511426159">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A injection with the local injection of corticosteroid plus local anaesthetic in patients with long-standing plantar fasciitis (duration greater than six months). We waited this length of time in order to confirm that spontaneous resolution did not occur and that no improvement was achieved with simpler therapies (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heel pads, insoles and night splints).</p>
<p>Corticosteroid injection was chosen as the control treatment for this study as it is a widely used technique with recognized short-term benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426159">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients with a clinical diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, based on the presence of heel pain during the first steps after a period of rest or pain exacerbated by walking or by standing for many hours, were recruited to the study. Patients were referred to our Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation by general practitioners and orthopaedic surgeons (working in the same hospital or at other centres). The diagnosis was confirmed by observing an increase in the pain that the patients usually felt when pressure was applied over the calcaneal tuberosity. Those with heel pain due to other causes (calcaneal fractures, tumours or infection, enthesopathy of rheumatic origin, or nerve entrapment) or painful disorders of the foot that could coexist with plantar fasciitis (severe osteoarthritis, Morton neuroma, metatarsalgia, etc.) were excluded as were patients with disabling diseases or cognitive disorders. Treatment of plantar fasciitis by injection within the previous six months was also a criterion for exclusion. All patients had been treated with conventional therapeutic techniques (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heel pads, insoles, night splints) for at least six months without success.</p>
<p>As there is moderate evidence for the benefit of stretching the calf muscles and, in particular, the muscles of the plantar fascia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511426159">19</xref></sup> all patients were initially treated with stretching, with revision after several weeks. Four patients were discharged and were excluded from the study after achieving acceptable improvement with these methods; the remainder required further treatment. Even if there had been no improvement with muscle stretching, patients were encouraged to continue performing these exercises as a complement to the injections.</p>
<p>Patients were informed about the study and signed a written consent form to participate; they were able to withdraw from the study at any time. Their permission was requested to administer botulinum toxin type A as a medicine for off-label use.</p>
<p>All patients who satisfied the selection criteria (<italic>n = </italic>56) agreed to participate in the study as they had been referred to our department after the failure of numerous therapies.</p>
<p>The variables recorded in all cases included sex, age, side affected and body mass index. Obesity was defined as a body mass index equal to or greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Podoscopic examination was used to classify the feet as normal, cavus or flat. Ankle dorsiflexion, measured by goniometry, was considered poor if it was equal to or less than 10° and was otherwise considered normal. Finally, patients were questioned about personal and occupational activities, which were defined as high risk if they included high-impact sports or prolonged walking or standing every day. Radiographic study was performed to establish the presence or absence of a calcaneal spur.</p>
<p>The study was divided into two phases. In phase 1, a randomized and single-blind trial was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy of botulinum toxin type A injection (botulinum toxin group) and corticosteroid injection (corticosteroid group), with evaluation at one month. A computer-generated randomization table was used to allocate the patients. As this was a small sample, block randomization was used to ensure the same number of patients in each treatment group. Patients did not know which treatment they were to receive and the medication was prepared out of sight of the specialist performing the injection. However, we cannot describe this as a true double-blind study as the injection volumes of the two treatments were different and the specialist could therefore guess which one was being given. A different doctor evaluated the results.</p>
<p>In the botulinum toxin group, botulinum toxin type A (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) injection was performed at two sites. Using the method described by Babcock et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref></sup> 100 U of botulinum toxin type A were diluted in 1 mL of normal saline and 70 U were injected: 40 U in the tender region of the heel medial to the insertion of the plantar fascia and 30 U in the area between one inch (2.5 cm) distal to the talar insertion of the plantar fascia and the midpoint of the plantar arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511426159">Figure 1</xref>). The injections in the corticosteroid group were performed with a corticosteroid (2 mL of betamethasone 6 mg/mL (as acetate and disodium phosphate)) plus local anaesthetic (0.5 mL of 1% mepivacaine) in the same area of the calcaneal tuberosity. In addition, a small subcutaneous injection of placebo (normal saline) was performed in the middle of the medial side of the fascia to make the injections identical in the two groups. All the injections were performed by a doctor with experience in the technique.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although it was not possible to ensure exactly into which structures the injections were administered (due to the absence of ultrasonographic guidance and to the diffusion capacity of the fluid), the aim was to target particularly the quadratus plantae, flexor digitorum brevis and abductor hallucis muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511426159">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In phase 2, beneficial effects were compared at six months. As the patients in our sample had suffered from significant pain for a long period and presented marked disability, we considered it unethical to postpone further treatment until the six-month follow-up visit in those patients with no improvement when evaluated at the end of phase 1. Furthermore, we believe that those patients who showed no improvement at one month would be unlikely to develop a later response. We therefore decided to continue the study on an intention-to-treat basis in order to respect the initial randomization, though this could reduce the power of the final conclusions at six months. It was thus decided to include in the study protocol the possibility for a second injection with the alternative drug (corticosteroid in the botulinum toxin group or botulinum toxin type A in the corticosteroid group) if there was no improvement in the pain at one month (‘therapeutic failure’). Patients were reorganized into two new groups for evaluation at the end of the second phase: one group formed of patients injected with botulinum toxin type A at the first treatment plus those patients undergoing a second injection with botulinum toxin type A due to failure of treatment with corticosteroid, and a second group formed of patients injected with corticosteroid at the first treatment plus those patients undergoing a second injection with corticosteroid due to failure of treatment with botulinum toxin type A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215511426159">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Assessment scales</title>
<p>Treatment evaluation was performed using the Foot Health Status Questionnaire, a specific questionnaire for the foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511426159">20</xref></sup> This questionnaire is validated in Spanish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511426159">21</xref></sup> It consists of eight items that measure various aspects of self-perceived foot health and general health. Assessment was based on the four items most closely related to foot health: (1) Foot pain, (2) Foot function (repercussion of the pain on daily activities), (3) Shoe (difficulty finding adequate footwear or wearing it) and (4) General foot health (the patients’ perceptions of the general state of their feet). It was decided not to use the items ‘General health,’ ‘Physical activity,’ ‘Social capacity’ and ‘Vigour’ in order to simplify the results and because these items involve more general details and sensations of the patients that could be influenced by circumstances other than the plantar fasciitis. The score for each item varied between 0 (worst possible) and 100 (best possible). The questionnaire was administered prior to treatment, and at one and six months after treatment.</p>
<p>Information was also gathered about possible adverse effects of the injection of each product and patients were asked if they would repeat the treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269215511426159">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The two treatment groups are described using absolute numbers and percentages for categorical variables and comparisons were performed using the chi-square test. Quantitative variables are described using means and standard deviations, and comparisons were performed using a one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Evaluation and comparison of the number of therapeutic failures at one month after the initial injection, according to the treatment received, are presented in the form of a contingency table and statistical significance was calculated using the chi-square test.</p>
<p>The variables for evaluation (the Foot Health Status Questionnaire) are quantitative and they have been described using means and standard deviations. The results followed a normal distribution and we therefore used parametric tests to look for differences in efficacy between the treatments: a paired <italic>t</italic>-test to evaluate the changes occurring over time in each one of the treatment groups and an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test when comparing the efficacy between the two treatments. The hypothesis was tested with a confidence interval of 95%.</p>
<p>The SPSS version 15.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used as the database for data processing.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixty-five patients were referred to our department for plantar fasciitis.

<p>At one month, patients who had not responded (10 in the corticosteroid group and 4 in the botulinum toxin group) were administered a second injection with the alternative treatment. Regrouping after the second injection left 34 patients in the group finally treated with botulinum toxin type A and 22 in the group finally treated with corticosteroid. This led to some loss of similarity between the two groups, as explained above.</p>
<p>All 56 patients completed the six months of the study. Comparison of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire scores at six months with the scores at one month revealed a continued and significant improvement in all parameters in the patients treated with botulinum toxin type A.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the results of our study, botulinum toxin type A could be a useful treatment for plantar fasciitis, particularly in terms of pain reduction. At one month, the results with botulinum toxin type A were at least as good as the results with the corticosteroid and they were clearly better in the evaluation at six months.</p>
<p>Many names have been used in the literature to refer to plantar heel pain: plantar fasciitis, heel spur syndrome and plantar fasciosis. The term plantar fasciitis has been used for years, probably in an attempt to recognize the actual changes occurring in the plantar fascia with or without the concomitant presence of a spur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup> Recently, the term plantar fasciosis has been advocated to de-emphasize the presumed inﬂammatory component and reiterate the degenerative nature of histological observations at the calcaneal enthesis. Despite the differing terminology, clinicians, the published literature and general practice behaviours all describe the same findings: pain in the area of the proximal plantar fascia and over its attachment in the area of the calcaneal tuberosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aetiology and pathogenesis are still not fully understood. Although some authors consider the disorder to be the result of excessive tension in the fascia, producing microscopic tears which lead to a subsequent inflammatory repair process, many others have demonstrated degenerative changes, though without finding signs of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511426159">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511426159">23</xref></sup> Entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve has also been cited as a possible cause of heel pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511426159">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the presence of a calcaneal spur is not considered to be a cause of pain, it is more common in patients with plantar fasciitis than in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511426159">25</xref></sup> McMillan and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511426159">8</xref></sup> in a recent meta-analysis, observed that patients with heel pain were eight times more likely to have a calcaneal spur.</p>
<p>In the assessment of the effectiveness of the two treatments, a visual analogue scale was not used to evaluate pain as the specific test for the foot, the Foot Health Status Questionnaire, already contains an item to measure this parameter. We could equally have used pressure algometer assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511426159">26</xref></sup> to quantify pain perception by the patient but, in our experience, this technique could be affected by the fact that the pressure point to detect maximum pain can vary by a few millimetres and the pain may even be felt in different areas on different days.</p>
<p>Imaging studies such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance and scintigraphy can aid the diagnosis of heel pain and demonstrate involvement of the plantar fascia as the responsible structure. According to McMillan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511426159">8</xref></sup> in a systematic review of the literature, plantar fasciitis may be suspected as a cause of heel pain when ultrasonography shows thickening of over 4 mm with an associated fluid collection. Our study was designed before the publication of that systematic review of the diagnostic imaging of heel pain. Ultrasonography may also be useful to monitor the changes after infiltrations with corticosteroids. Although ultrasonography or magnetic resonance studies had been performed in many of our patients to confirm the diagnosis, the lack of these studies in some patients meant that they were not used as a criterion for participation in the study. Nor were these imaging studies used to monitor the results.</p>
<p>Tsai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511426159">27</xref></sup> reported that ultrasonography-guided injection could reduce the number of recurrences of pain in plantar fasciitis treated using corticosteroid injections. However, in a later study, the effectiveness of the injections was not found to differ significantly whether the injection was guided by palpation, ultrasonography or scintigraphy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511426159">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of mechanisms may be involved in plantar fasciitis-related pain: irritation of free nerve endings or of mechanoreceptors by recurrent trauma or chronic pressure on the plantar fascia, painful ischaemia due to the same chronic pressure on the digital vessels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511426159">23</xref></sup> increased nociceptor sensitivity secondary to the inflammation, or increased local pain mediated by neurotransmitters such as glutamate, substance P or calcitonin-gene related peptide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511426159">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511426159">29</xref></sup> Furthermore, in some situations of chronic pain there can be central sensitization whereby non-nociceptive spinal neurons perceive non-nociceptive stimuli as painful, producing persistent pain transmission via sympathetic pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref></sup> Botulinum toxin type A could act by producing relaxation of the muscles related to the plantar fascia, thus reducing tension at the insertion of the fascia onto the heel and decreasing the pressure on local neurovascular structures. It could also have an intrinsic analgesic action and improve the pain by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters responsible for pain transmission. Botulinum toxin type A could therefore reduce central sensitization.</p>
<p>Before the present study, only three papers had been published on the effect of botulinum toxin type A in plantar fasciitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511426159">15</xref></sup> The largest sample – 27 patients, 43 affected feet – was in the study by Babcock et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref></sup> using botulinum toxin type A (Botox). That study reported an improvement in pain, algometry and functional status. We therefore decided to use the same technique and dose of botulinum toxin type A. Placzek et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511426159">14</xref></sup> using botulinum toxin type A (Dysport) in a smaller number of patients (<italic>n = </italic>9) but with a long follow-up (up to 52 weeks), also observed good efficacy. Placzek et al. also showed that the effect of 200 U of Dysport was greater than that of 100 U.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511426159">15</xref></sup> Another randomized clinical trial of 50 patients recently published by Huang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511426159">16</xref></sup> compared the effects of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) with placebo; botulinum toxin type A was found to have a clinically beneficial effect and they also reported a reduction in the thickness of the plantar fascia. However, those authors insisted on the benefits of ultrasonography-guided injection to confirm the site to be injected and to minimize the adverse effects. Although we consider ultrasonography-guided injection to be a useful technique, it is not routinely available in many centres and we therefore did not use it in our study.</p>
<p>We detected a marked improvement in the pain and in its functional repercussions. We would like to stress that the patients included in our study were difficult cases due to the long-standing nature of their condition and the previous failure of all the usual treatments.</p>
<p>Analysis of our results showed that the lowest baseline values in the Foot Health Status Questionnaire corresponded to the item ‘Footwear’ and, in particular, the item ‘General foot health’. This would correlate with the feelings of disability reported by patients in our series in relation to a condition that had persisted for more than six months. Patient re-evaluation one month after the injection found pain to be the item with the greatest improvement, whereas six months after treatment the item general foot health showed the greatest increase in score. A possible interpretation of these findings is that, in the short term, patients note an improvement in the pain and that, with the use of botulinum toxin type A, they also perceive a clear, long-term improvement in their disability.</p>
<p>The treatment of plantar fasciitis by corticosteroid injections is a widely used technique in daily clinical practice and has been extensively cited in many reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511426159">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511426159">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511426159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426159">11</xref></sup> Our results support the conclusions of the Cochrane review (Crawford and Thomson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426159">11</xref></sup>) on the effect of corticosteroid injection. The result of treatment with these agents is effective, but only in the short term. Although the initial improvement after corticosteroid injection was similar to the results with botulinum toxin type A, a large part of that improvement disappeared after one month of follow-up. However, in addition to the similar or even better results with botulinum toxin type A compared to corticosteroid at one month of follow-up, the patients in the botulinum toxin group achieved good results in the Foot Health Status Questionnaire items on pain, function, self-perceived foot health and ease of finding adequate footwear six months after the treatment. It is also interesting to note that although the mean results were good one month after corticosteroid injection, the number of patients who did not develop therapeutic improvement was higher than in the botulinum toxin group. It would thus appear that corticosteroid injections lead to a marked improvement in some patients at one month while others report no change, whereas the effect of botulinum toxin type A is less evident initially but benefits a greater proportion of patients.</p>
<p>Cases of rupture of the plantar fascia have been reported after corticosteroid injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511426159">30</xref></sup> This could be another potential benefit in favour of botulinum toxin type A, though no specific studies have yet been published.</p>
<p>None of the patients developed drug-related adverse effects. We found the technique described by Babcock et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426159">13</xref></sup> simple to use. Although any injection in the foot can be uncomfortable, almost all patients stated their preference for repeating the injections should further treatment be necessary.</p>
<p>Although stretching of the plantar fascia and of the calf muscles had been ineffective in these patients, they were encouraged to continue performing these exercises after the injections as the majority of studies using other therapeutic techniques systematically include such exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426159">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426159">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511426159">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although our study demonstrates the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A in chronic plantar fasciitis after one month and also at six months, further studies with larger samples would be necessary to confirm these results. Future research could also look into maintenance of the effect for more than six months, the mechanisms of action of botulinum toxin type A on this condition, the ideal dose and site of injection, and its use in combination with other therapies.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Treatment of plantar fasciitis by injection with botulinum toxin type A shows better results at one month and particularly at six months compared to injection with corticosteroids in patients in whom conservative measures such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heel pads, insoles and night splints have failed for at least six months. In view of the benefit demonstrated in our study six months after treatment and the lack of other clearly effective treatments, we recommend botulinum toxin type A injection as a possible therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. However, we also stress that, although our results are promising, our findings will need to be replicated in larger studies with longer term follow-up before botulinum toxin type A injections can be routinely recommended to all patients.</p>
