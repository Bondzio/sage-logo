<abstract>
<p>Most futures studies in higher education take place at the graduate level. Conspicuously missing is an undergraduate bachelor’s degree program. How might such a program be designed for futures studies in higher education? And how might this undergraduate bachelor’s degree program be linked to the graduate program as a whole? What should be the theoretical foundation for its design? This article will address these concerns.</p>

<p>Futures studies focus on trends in global development and sustainability. But graduates from every program of futures studies will face stiff competition in the job market. What is the core competency that every future studies graduate should master, and how does this relate to their cultural background? Furthermore, what job opportunities are likely to be available for undergraduate program students of futures studies? These are big questions, and the answers depend to some degree on how the future is perceived in the countries that different students come from. We need some answers about these issues.</p>
<p>Most of the futures studies programs around the world are exclusively graduate programs. The first and only bachelor’s degree in futures studies is offered by the department of Future Studies at Fo Guang University (FGU) in Taiwan (ROC). If futures studies is really a strong need for our future, then many more bachelor’s degree programs should be considered. Why then is there no incentive for most institutions in higher education to set up their own bachelor’s programs in futures studies?</p>
<p>Most graduate programs of futures studies emphasize independent study with interdisciplinary integration. But bachelor-level programs will need to focus more on employability and the core competencies of futures studies. To ensure good linkage between these two levels of futures studies in higher education, undergraduate and graduate educators should discuss the fundamental goals of futures studies education as a good first step toward the design of this program.</p>
<sec id="section1-1946756712467302">
<title>The Nature of Futures Education</title>
<p>Futures studies is an interdisciplinary field, but it is hard to establish just the right position or even to decide exactly what its name should be. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1946756712467302">Ziauddin Sardar (2010)</xref> wrote an article published by the journal <italic>Futures</italic> that gave rise to considerable discussion. For example, he offered these “four laws of futures studies”: Futures studies are wicked; futures studies are mutually assured diversity (MAD); futures studies are skeptical; and futures studies are futureless. Many individuals responded to this article with contributions about the nature of future studies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1946756712467302">Bergman, Karlsson, and Axelsson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1946756712467302">Cubitt 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1946756712467302">Gidley 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1946756712467302">Jori 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1946756712467302">Marien 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1946756712467302">Ringland 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1946756712467302">Tonn 2010</xref>). Basically, they were proposing a sort of liberation movement to free future studies from its name. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1946756712467302">Eleonora Masini (2010)</xref>, for example, proposed that research should be conducted in different social and cultural contexts for concepts.</p>
<p>Recently, there were twelve papers in the special issue devoted to futures education in the journal <italic>Futures</italic>. To quote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1946756712467302">David Hicks and Jennifer Gidley (2012)</xref>, “The papers in this issue are arranged into two areas: futures <italic>in</italic> education and futures <italic>of</italic> education. The first four papers offer case studies in which futures studies theories, concepts, and methods are introduced into educational settings in different ways. Both Debra Bateman and David Hicks explore futures education in schools, while Francis Hutchinson and Peter Herborn, and Ellisha Nasruddin <italic>et al</italic>. offer case studies of futures in higher education. The remaining five papers (Gidley, Dahlin, Montuori, Hampson, Judge) move into more theoretical, visionary, and speculative territory, exploring possible and preferred futures for education at all levels.” (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1946756712467302">Bateman 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1946756712467302">Hicks 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1946756712467302">Hutchinson and Herborn 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1946756712467302">Nasruddin, Bustami, and Inayatullah 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1946756712467302">Gidley 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1946756712467302">Dahlin 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1946756712467302">Montuori 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1946756712467302">Hampson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1946756712467302">Judge 2012</xref>.)</p>
<p>There is a common belief that futures education should focus not only on global issues but also on local culture. For example, from the Chinese perspective, the best guideline for futures education is the future philosophy of Confucius. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1946756712467302">Liang (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1946756712467302">2009b</xref>) mentioned three issues and five beliefs for futures education based on ancient truths of Chinese culture. These three issues are all based on a vision of the future world and the future demands of human society. The first issue concerns wisdom or knowledge, which should be the goal of education in the future, the second issue is to focus on academic achievement or the learning of Truth (Tao), and the third issue is about changing the attitude of the educator (teacher) from instruction to learning. Finally, five basic beliefs are suggested for change management in education. Together, these are the theoretical cultural foundation for futures education in Chinese society.</p>
<p>Before this article, a lot of discussion took place about whether futures studies qualifies as a new disciplinary or field. The best-known books on this subject to date are:</p>

<p>From the 1960s onward, a sense of emergency has become more and more noticeable in futures studies around the world. The problem of this emergency for future studies is due to human selfishness. The United Nations (UN) promotes the development of future studies because problems cannot be solved by any single country or single discipline. Simply waking people up to face a problem does not mean it really can be solved.</p>
<p>The basis for this interdisciplinary field called futures studies are the so-called five futures: STEEP (<bold>S</bold>ocial Futures, <bold>T</bold>echnological Futures, <bold>E</bold>conomic Futures, <bold>E</bold>nvironmental Futures, and <bold>P</bold>olitical Futures). The essential keys for addressing the five STEEP futures are interdisciplinary ability, together with methods for systems integration.</p>
<p>It does not matter what the name is: futures, futures studies, futurology, futuristic, foresight. It does not matter whether it is a field, a discipline, or a discourse. The important thing is to develop the professional ability or capability in students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1946756712467302">Liang (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1946756712467302">2009b</xref>) proposes a FIFIS model (<bold>F</bold>orecast, <bold>I</bold>nsight, <bold>F</bold>oresight, <bold>I</bold>nnovation, and <bold>S</bold>trategy) for futures education. These are the five basic abilities that students of future studies at FGU in Taiwan develop,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1946756712467302">1</xref></sup> and this core competency should be the focus for any bachelor’s degree program in future studies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1946756712467302">Vanston (2003)</xref> mentioned five different views of the futures that can be utilized to develop valid forecasts and contribute to the successful operation of an organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1946756712467302">2</xref></sup> He was the leader in the development of TFI’s <italic>Five Views of the Future™ Analysis Framework</italic> and the <italic>Technology Advantage Management</italic> concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1946756712467302">3</xref></sup> The five FIFIS core competencies make up the second key element in futures studies education.</p>

<title>Job Prospects for Future Studies Undergraduate Majors</title>
<p>What are the job opportunities for undergraduate students in a futures studies program? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1946756712467302">Samet (2010)</xref> mentioned four tracks of futures research: planning and infrastructure; economics and sociology; environment and interacting population; and living systems. The most popular track for futures studies will likely be planning, but the same track is also vital in most of the management field. What we really need is a unique capability for future studies and more job opportunities in different industries. What is the major difference between planning in futures studies and in management: time horizon or deep insight?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1946756712467302">Liang et al. (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1946756712467302">2010b</xref>) urge future studies students at FGU to think about some future industries that will provide entrepreneurial opportunities and good jobs for students in a bachelor’s degree program of futures studies. For instance, the sustainability industry and the health industry both need more future thinkers and planners. Clearly, LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability) offer a good alternative for bachelor’s degree programs from the perspective of employment after graduation. But beyond job opportunities, we still need more capabilities for futures education.</p>
<p>The unique attribute of futures studies should be foresight thinking with a “time horizon.” Future vision and insight will be most important for futures education, but these abilities are also crucial for future leaders. Good vision and deep insight are vital for future leaders and attaining those demands true wisdom more than mere knowledge.</p>

<title>The Conceptual Framework of Futures Education—A Chinese Perspective</title>
<p>What futures philosophy should be followed by students in futures studies programs? From a Chinese perspective, the best Chinese future philosophy should be Confucius’s <italic>Li Yun Ta Tong</italic> Chapter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1946756712467302">4</xref></sup> The crucial part of the <italic>Ta Tong</italic> Chapter is that the global future should be in harmony with the world of Tao. Two major translations for the meaning of <italic>Ta Tong</italic> are “The Commonwealth State” and “The Age of Great Harmony.” The basic assumption for a Ta Tong future is general acceptance of Tao. When the great Tao prevails, the world community is equally shared by all. The whole chapter statement is as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>When the great Tao prevails (大道之行也), the world community is equally shared by all (天下為公). The worthy and virtuous persons are chosen as office leader and God will give them the ability and power (選賢與能). Mutual confidence is fostered and good neighborliness cultivated (講信修睦). Therefore people do not regard only their own parents as parents, nor do they treat only their own children as children (故人不獨親其親，不獨子其子). Provision is made for the aged till their death (使老有所終), the adults are given employment (壯有所用), and the young enabled to grow up (幼有所長). Widows, widowers, orphans, the old and childless as well as the sick and disabled are all well have taken care of (鰥寡孤獨廢疾者皆有所養). Every man and woman has an appropriate role to play in the family and society (男有分，女有歸). While they hate to see wealth lying about on the ground, they do not necessarily keep it for their own use (貨惡其棄於地不必藏於己). While they hate not to exert their own effort, they do not necessarily devote it for their own ends (力惡其不出於身不必為己). Thus evil scheming is repressed, and robbers, thieves and other lawless elements fail to arise 是故謀閉而不興，盜竊亂賊而不作). So that outer doors do not have to be shut (故外戶而不閉). This is called “the Age of Great Harmony” (commonwealth state) (是謂大同).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1946756712467302">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The world of Tao is the ultimate future world. This Chinese future philosophy was stated by Confucius, three thousand years ago, and expresses the spirit in which the Republic of China was established in 1911. The ultimate goal for futures education is the world of Tao, based on the Chinese cultural background.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of higher education in general? A Chinese book, <italic>The Great Learning</italic> (大學),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1946756712467302">6</xref></sup> provides a clear guideline for higher education or university study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1946756712467302">7</xref></sup> This classic establishes three main purposes for higher education, to comprehend the spirit of nature (在明明德), to comprehend human relations (在親民), and to master the art of living in harmony with nature and with other human beings (在止於至善).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1946756712467302">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>I see these as the goals of future higher education, not only for Chinese but also for all the institutions of higher education around the world. Another one of the Four Books, <italic>The Doctrine of the Mean</italic> (中庸), is also a fundamental guide for Chinese university education. The basic three principles in <italic>The Doctrine of the Mean</italic> are these:
<disp-quote>
<p>What Heaven has conferred is called Nature (天命之謂性);</p>
<p>Accordance with nature is called Tao (率性之謂道);</p>
<p>The cultivation of Tao is called Education (修道之謂教).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1946756712467302">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All three of these writings have one common concept: the human future is to be a world of Tao. Based on Chinese philosophy, to achieve this ultimate goal of a human future, every person should be educated to be a Tao receiver and a Tao cultivator. The basic knowledge for attaining the ultimate future can be learned from reading these three writings, <italic>Ta Tong</italic> (The Great Unity) Chapter, <italic>The Great Learning</italic>, and <italic>The Doctrine of the Mean</italic>.</p>
<p>To achieve the ultimate goal for the future, there are five crucial national policies: senior affairs, economic policy and full employment, education, social welfare, and gender affairs. These national policies mean a total integration with the five STEEP futures we referred to above (i.e., Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, and Political). Each national policy in a Tao world should well organize these five futures into their policy decision and context. Futures education is not limited by knowledge of STEEP futures. Learning how to implement the five crucial national policies with STEEP is the most important part of futures education. In this article, we will suggest focusing on training in systems integration.</p>
<p>How to implement the five crucial national policies is a question that addresses the core competencies of futures education. As mentioned above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1946756712467302">Liang (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1946756712467302">2009b</xref>) proposed a five-step process to develop the core courses for futures education. Forecasting methods, Insight thinking, Foresight modeling, Innovation Management, and Strategic Planning would be the basic five core courses for a sound futures studies program. The five FIFIS core courses will provide basic training for integration with the five STEEP futures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1946756712467302">Oner (2010)</xref> offers a discussion note on theory building in Foresight and Futures Studies, suggesting that such theory building would draw on other disciplines such as management, systems theory, computer science, economics, sociology, mathematics, statistics, philosophy and ethics, political science, and so forth. What should we draw from other disciplines? The answer is all that is likely to benefit the FIFIS core competencies.</p>
<p>Traditionally, achieving sustainability is the special aim of Futures Studies. Put this in the context of the job market, and one of the developments most sought after should be to promote the LOHAS industry. LOHAS means Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1946756712467302">Ray and Anderson 2000</xref>). LOHAS is really two related industries: health and sustainability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1946756712467302">10</xref></sup> Another desirable goal for Futures Studies will be to demonstrate how other future industries may benefit from traditional LOHAS thinking. While these future industries will likely vary in some ways depending on national and cultural background, it is most important that any undergraduate bachelor’s degree program of futures studies produce graduates who can reasonably expect employability in at least one profession after their four years of study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1946756712467302">Table 1</xref> presents a conceptual framework for futures studies education based on a Chinese perspective. The first level is the cultural background, which sets the goal for futures education. The second level makes use of this goal to set forth specific policies for the future world. The third level will focus on the core competencies needed to implement these future policies. The fourth and final level will focus on career development and employability.</p>

<title>A Case Study in Taiwan: Fo Guang University</title>
<p>Most people in the field of futures studies think of Tamkang University in Taiwan as the largest such program in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1946756712467302">11</xref></sup> But in fact, the largest master’s degree program and the largest bachelor’s degree program in Taiwan are actually at FGU.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1946756712467302">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first master’s degree program of futures studies in Taiwan was offered by FGU in 2000. The first bachelor’s degree program of futures studies in Taiwan began there in 2002.</p>
<p>As of 2011, the master’s program had sixty graduates each year and there were one hundred bachelor’s degree students in this department at FGU. The development history of this department has gone through five stages.</p>
<sec id="section5-1946756712467302">
<title>Starting Period of the Master’s Degree Program (2000–2002)</title>
<p>For the first two years, there was a master’s degree program only. Ten to fifteen graduate students enrolled each year. They focused on basic research in the five STEEP futures. This period also saw the start of a college with the name Fo Guang College of Humanities and Social Sciences (FGC). Six master programs were offered in this starting period: Literature, Arts, Life Science, Future Studies, Political Science, and Information Science.</p>

<sec id="section6-1946756712467302">
<title>Starting Period of the Bachelor’s Degree Program (2002–2006)</title>
<p>The bachelor’s degree program in futures studies began in August 2002 with twenty students. There were eight required courses for this program: Introduction to Futures Studies, Anthropological Topics in Futures Studies, Futures Studies in Society, Culture/Civilization Perspective, Futures Studies Methodologies, Statistics, Social Science Research Methods, and Special Topics in Futures Studies. In addition, some thirty other courses were provided as electives.</p>

<title>STEEP Period of DFS at FGU (2006–2008)</title>
<p>After the first students graduated from these bachelor and master degree programs, Fo Guang was upgraded by the Education Ministry, ROC Government from a college to a university. The Department of Future Studies (DFS) moved to the College of Social Sciences and Management at FGU. This began a new era for DFS in which it developed an integrated structure for both master and bachelor programs. There are now seven required courses for the bachelor program: Introduction to Futures Studies, Futures Studies in Sociology, Futures Studies in Science and Technology, Futures Studies in Economics, Futures Studies in Politics, Research Methods in Social Science, and Special Topics in Futures Studies. Two tracks may be elected by bachelor’s degree students: Trend Analysis and Taiwan Futures. At this time, the five STEEP futures are all formally included in the required courses.</p>

<p>Beginning this year, the DFS will follow the new Ten Year Development Plan of FGU to merge with the Department of Life and Culture Study for LOHAS to form a new department: Department of Futures Studies and LOHAS Industry. This new department will follow the structure outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1946756712467302">Table 1</xref> so as to be more practically oriented for bachelor’s degree students, especially in the LOHAS industry. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1946756712467302">Table 2</xref> represents the new structure of the futures studies bachelor degree program. There are nine required courses for the bachelor degree program as the core track and another two elective tracks from which students must choose at least one. The nine required courses are Introduction to Life Study, Special Topics for Futures Studies, Sustainability and Future Life, Career Planning, Forecasting and Foresight, Insight and Innovation, Future and LOHAS Industries, Introduction to LOHAS, and LOHAS and Life Cultivation. The Future Trends Track will focus on the STEEP and FIFIS levels. The LOHAS Track will focus on issues related to the LOHAS industries. There are 27 Core Track credits required for graduation and 21 additional credits from the Elective track. Another track offered will be the College Basic Track with 21 credits. Furthermore, all three bachelor programs still require 36 credits of common courses and 23 credits of free elective courses. Thus, the total number of credits required for a bachelor’s degree is 128.</p>

<p>Based on this structure, the new department will offer two master’s degree programs, one in Futures Studies and the other in Life Studies, linked to the two bachelor tracks, Future Trends and LOHAS. Both master programs require students to take thirty-six credits of coursework, including six credits of master thesis.</p>
<p>The courses required for the Futures Studies Master program are Methodology for Futures Studies, Research and Analysis for Futurology, Special Issues in Futures Studies, and Research and Planning. The courses required for the Life Studies Master program are Introduction to Life Studies and Methodology of Life Studies. The linkage between the master’s program and the bachelor’s program is based on the two tracks of the bachelor’s degree program and the two tracks of the master’s degree program.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we have presented the conceptual structure for a futures studies program that offers both bachelor’s and master’s degrees. This conceptual framework includes four levels: the cultural level, the STEEP interdisciplinary level, the FIFIS competency level, and the LOHAS industry level. The cultural level draws upon students’ common cultural background to develop their future philosophy or thinking. The STEEP level provides interdisciplinary integration ability and training. The FIFIS level focuses on the core competencies for futures studies. The LOHAS level provides more job-market-oriented preparation for future careers and service in LOHAS industries.</p>
<p>A real case, the Department of Futures Studies at FGU in Taiwan, was presented. In the next ten years, this department will develop both its bachelor’s and master’s programs to provide more practical training for students to help them secure employment in the futures field. After 2013, this department will expand further to a new independent College to be named College of LOHAS Industry.</p>
