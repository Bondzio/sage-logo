<p>This book is a detailed analysis of party system change in Tamil Nadu state in South India. Andrew Wyatt centres his analysis on political entrepreneurs as drivers of party system change, particularly the emergence of new parties, rather than employs the institutional or sociological approaches that are standard in the party systems literature.</p>
<p>He criticizes rational choice approaches as stripping politicians of agency and as reducing them merely to responders to political incentives. He views political entrepreneurs as creative and innovative individuals who have the agency to redefine political cleavages. Institutions and (social) structure are the background factors. Entrepreneurial leaders cause party systems to change in two ways – by forming new parties and by altering existing parties.</p>
<p>About Tamil Nadu, Wyatt argues that the party system has changed from the stable two-and-a-half party system (DMK-AIADMK-Congress) of 1980–96 to a bipolar multipartyism of the period from 1998 characterized by two shifting coalitions led by the DMK and the AIADMK, and including several smaller parties and the Congress and sometimes BJP on one or the other side. This emergence is counter-intuitive because the 1980–96 system had seemed to be stable and because the ‘Dravidian’ ideology shared to a degree by the two leading regional parties, DMK and AIADMK, did not allow for caste-based party formation, whereas most of the emergent new parties since the 1990s have been caste-based (that is, structural cleavage) parties.</p>
<p>Wyatt argues that this development cannot be explained by either institutional or sociological variables, as both have been stable. Institutional variables, including the constitution, the electoral system and constituency boundaries (up to 2009), have been stable. The only thing that has changed is the federal system in practice, though not constitutionally, by the accommodation of regional parties in multiparty national coalition governments. Wyatt argues that the seven social structural cleavages – religion, caste, class, language, region (centre-state), gender and the urban–rural divide – were cut across by both the Congress and the DMK before 1967 and by all parties since then, all of them being catch-all parties. The major shifts were not based on the emergence of structural cleavages but on non-structural political cleavages – sociological variables, especially caste and religion, having been stable. Therefore, political entrepreneurship needs to be studied to analyse the emergence and, in some cases, relative success of new parties such as the PMK, DPI, PT, BJP (in Tamil Nadu) and DMDK, and the fact that the first three are caste-based parties. The second half of the book (chapters 5–10) analyses political entrepreneurship in the emergence of new parties.</p>
<p>The PMK, the most successful of the new parties, and relevant by an extension of Sartori’s criterion of relevance to pre-electoral coalitions, has been a vital member of pre-electoral coalitions from 1998 for both assembly and parliamentary elections, and a member of central cabinets from 1998 to 2009. Based on the ‘most backward’ Vanniar caste, concentrated in the Northern districts, the high bar for vote-share under the single-member simple plurality (SMSP) electoral system has been a barrier that the PMK has surmounted due to the creative political entrepreneurship of its founder, Dr Ramadoss. He cast it as not just a Vanniar party but as a party of the down-trodden and forged electoral alliances with Dalit voters in the party’s districts of concentration, and with both the DMK and AIADMK in turns, enabling it to win a few seats and emerge in others’ perceptions as a valuable alliance partner.</p>
<p>The two new Dalit-based parties – the DPI founded by Thol Thirumavalavan and the PT founded by Dr Krishnaswamy – have encountered the same SMSP barriers to winning elections, but have been less successful, particularly the PT based on the Pallar Dalit caste in southern Tamil Nadu. While the DPI, despite being based on the Paraiyar Dalit caste in the Northern districts, has projected itself as a broad Dalit party (i.e. not a single caste party), exploited alliances with the DMK and AIADMK in turns and projected a perception of itself as the holder of an important vote bloc, the PT has got branded as a single caste party of Pallars and has been electorally un-successful. This is due to the differing styles of political entrepreneurship of their founders.</p>
<p>The BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit has emerged with a degree of success in that it won parliamentary seats in the 1998 and 1999 elections in alliance with the AIADMK and DMK, respectively, overcoming its image as a pro-Hindi, northern, centralist party. Being in power nationally and being able to trade cabinet positions at the centre in exchange for seats in the state helped it. However, despite the depth of popular Hindu religiosity in Tamil Nadu, it has not created a substantial base. Factors include a lack of leadership, minorities not being perceived to be a threat, and the AIADMK and DMK themselves promoting soft pro-Hindu policies.</p>
<p>The most successful and relevant of the new parties has been the DMDK founded by film star Vijayakanth. A populist party based on a non-structural, non-caste, ‘disillusioned’ vote, the DMDK has been created by the skilful use of Vijayakanth’s fan clubs, wealth and resources, which have played a mobilizational role. Not winning many seats (until 2011), but relevant in that it is now perceived as a useful alliance partner, the DMDK’s success is due to Vijayakanth’s political skills and catch-all pitch.</p>
<p>Apart from the entrepreneurial skills of their founders, the successful new parties have been helped by the institutional circumstance of the weakness and top-down centralism of the two major parties, while being constrained by institutional features of the SMSP system. The key, as Wyatt shows in chapter by chapter of thick description in the second half of the book, is political entrepreneurship and not institutional or sociological variables. This book is full of information and insights and a refreshing change in the literature on party system change.</p>
