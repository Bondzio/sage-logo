<p>Walter Goffart has been one of the most productive, original and wide-ranging historians of his generation. His work has traced a visible trajectory from the publication in 1966 of his <italic>The LeMans Forgeries: A Chapter from the History of Church Property in the Ninth Century</italic>. That book made two kinds of contributions: It addressed some thorny problems in the history of church property and it explored a particularly complex and difficult body of source material. The former interest led on to <italic>Caput and Colonate: Towards a History of Late Roman Taxation</italic> (1974), a study preceded by several relevant articles. In addition to signalling an interest that sharpened in focus from property to fiscality, these studies also marked the beginnings of Goffart’s well-known wrangling with several old, entrenched and, probably, wrong historiographical traditions. In 1980 he published <italic>Barbarians and Romans A.D. 418–584: The Techniques of Accommodation</italic>. The first chapter of this book presents Goffart’s thinking on the ‘barbarian invasions’. He insists that this was never a single process, that it must be understood on a short and not a long history and that Rome tried very hard to manage the process. In chapters 2 to 8 he argued a controversial thesis about how Roman fiscal machinery, and not land allotments, was used to ‘accommodate’ the barbarians. Goffart’s arguments stirred up a lot of discussion, in which he participated vigorously, and in <italic>The Barbarian Tides: The Migration Age and the Later Roman Empire</italic> (2006) he returned to, expanded and defended his earlier arguments. Chapter 1 of <italic>Barbarians and Romans</italic> developed some arguments that also appear in an important article in <italic>The American Historical Review</italic> for 1981. In particular, Goffart reflected on the liquid metaphors that had been so long applied to the barbarian invasions: waves, tides, floods, etc. This interest let to a series of articles exploring how and why maps appeared with various lines, ribbons and arrows supposedly illustrating the long treks of the barbarians from some alleged homeland, across much of Europe, and then into the Roman world. These interests took on a life of their own for a few years and resulted in <italic>Historical Atlases: The First Three Hundred Years, 1570–1870</italic> (2003). Never far in the background in all this work, indeed reaching back into articles that started appearing in the 1950s, were questions about sources: Who wrote them? Why are they structured as they are? What were their authors trying to tell us? How have the sources come down to us? When and why have these sources been misread and misunderstood? Most obviously these interests assumed largest and most coherent form in <italic>The Narrators of Barbarian History (A.D. 550–800): Jordanes, Gregory of Tours, Bede, and Paul the Deacon</italic> (1988; 2nd ed., 2005).</p>
<p>The volume noticed here contains 16 studies published, with two exceptions (chapters 12 and 14), between 1988 and 2007. The first one (‘Two Notes on Germanic Antiquity Today’) encapsulates a series of arguments Goffart has been making for a long time: There was no coherent, cohesive ‘Germanic Antiquity’, at least not one that can be recovered from the primary sources at our disposal. As he has put it elsewhere, of course the barbarians had a past but we are not authorised to turn that past into a history by combining later sources and half-baked theories <italic>ad libitum</italic>. In some ways Chapter 6 (‘Conspicuously Absent: Martial Heroism in the Histories of Gregory of Tours and Its Likes’) puts more holes below the water line of the good ship ‘Germanentum’ while also making important points about how to read early medieval historical writers. Chapters 2 to 4 show the evolution of Goffart’s thinking on the map of the barbarian invasions. In particular, he treats the cartographic work of Johann Georg Hagelgans and Emmanuel de la Cases. Chapters 13 and 16 also treat maps, the former William Lambarde’s map of the Anglo-Saxon ‘Heptarchy’ and the latter the numerous, rich and complex maps of the Vatican map gallery that connects the museums with the Sistine Chapel. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 are devoted to Bede; one to the old crux of Bede’s ‘Vera <italic>Lex Historia</italic>’ and the others to responding to some of the criticisms of the Bede’s chapter in <italic>Narrators</italic>. Goffart is concerned to show that his interpretations of Bede’s emphases and intentions are not motivated by some sort of anti-Bede slant. Chapters 14 and 15 address the old and perennially lively question of the dating of Beowulf. By trying to figure out who the ‘Hugas’ were and what ‘Merovingian’ might have meant to the poet, Goffart comes to a date well into the tenth century. Chapter 5 turns the heretofore solid and reliable <italic>Vita Sancti Severini</italic> into a historical novel while Chapter 12 usefully unsettles prevalent readings of the three, or four, accounts of the translation of St. Liborius in 836. Chapter 10 offers a reading of Paul the Deacon’s <italic>History of the Bishops of Metz</italic> designed mainly to show that Paul preserves a succession plan from the early 780s that saw Charles Junior as primary heir, somewhat in anticipation of the <italic>Ordinatio Imperii</italic> of 817. The key point is that the <italic>Divisio Regnorum</italic> of 806 was not the first or the only plan. Finally, there is Chapter 11, in effect an extended review of volumes 13 to 19 of the <italic>Chartae Latini Antiquiores.</italic> This detailed study contains information of interest to both specialists and general readers. The volume concludes with six pages of addenda and five pages of additional articles by Goffart relevant to the topics treated in this book. I am reminded of the 25 pages of invaluable updating added by Goffart to the new edition of <italic>Narrators</italic>.</p>
