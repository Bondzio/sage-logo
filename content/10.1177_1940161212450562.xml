<abstract>
<p>In Romania, the political system, itself an amalgam of systems and still shifting in line with a continually evolving democracy, is only the vessel in which corruption is percolating and not the cause of it; culture is the cause. This is true of the very nature of how instrumentalization, clientelism, and political parallelism have evolved. Romanian clientelism and the political parallelism are often an expression of the powers of the manager-journalist or star journalists and not only of media owners and politicians. This may set the Romania mass media system apart from other systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the more than two decades since the fall of communism, Romania’s mass media system experienced an unarguable enlargement of its freedoms and, concurrently, suffered successful, partially failed and failed attempts to control, manipulate, and influence it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212450562">1</xref></sup> Some scholars justifiably argue that the media have been directly and indirectly “captured” by successive governments or by “vested interests networked with politics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1940161212450562">Mungiu-Pippidi 2008</xref>, 91). The political, governmental, and commercial-based grip over the 1,120 broadcasting companies and 1,325 publications,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161212450562">2</xref></sup> particularly the news outlets among them, is affected by the still democracy-challenged character and functioning of the political system and society. Mass media owners, editors, directors, commentators, analysts, and other journalists—individually and collectively—represent not only the political, governmental, and commercial milieu that nurtures the character of the mass media but also the general, political, and professional cultures that define them in the ongoing Sturm und Drang of Romanian mass media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212450562">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interdependence between a society’s media and its political system has become gospel in the social sciences, whereas the interdependence between the political system and the extant culture is only alluded to but insufficiently studied for purposes of explaining the workings of media systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini (2004)</xref>, in their sophisticated, skillful framing of mass media systems models, are the latest exemplification of this long-established approach to media system theory.</p>
<p>Exploring the system-to-system relationship is valuable in determining interdependence and a range of other issues but it lacks, in the Habermasian sense, the “anchoring” of its mechanisms in the cultural life-worlds of those who make each of the systems and their relationships function. The salient question is not just what the architecture of a political or media system looks like or how it works, or even what its connecting fibers are (e.g. its rules, regulations, ideologies). Indeed, if we are to understand how systems work and interact we must explore the collective and individual ethos of the individuals making them work and that which defines the nature of the systems’ functioning, the interpretations and applications of laws, rules, regulations, policies, and ideologies that drives them. Only then can we fully gauge the nature of system-to-system interdependence, mutual or other effects, and their roles in society, because as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212450562">John Dewey (1930)</xref> wrote nine decades ago, “Political and legal institutions may be altered, even abolished; but the bulk of popular thought which has shaped their patterns persists.”</p>
<p>With this in mind, we offer a glimpse here of the relationship between the Romanian mass media system and politics and the political system, what it might tell us about the former, and identify what perhaps are cultural-related idiosyncrasies in the nature of Romanian media instrumentalization, clientelism, and political parallelism that suggest further research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161212450562">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-1940161212450562">
<title>A General Overview of the Political and Mass Media System Issues</title>
<p>Romania’s postcommunist politics and political system in the 1990s can be generally summed up as follows: a nascent parliamentary system in a semi-presidential republic with two camps, the Ion Iliescu (National Salvation Front/Social Democratic Party [Frontul Salvarii Nationale/Partidul Social Democrat]) one and the one opposed to it, scores of other political parties, politics that were oriented to filling the power vacuum left by communism’s demise and establishing political identities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161212450562">5</xref></sup> The plethora of political parties, creating both fragmentation and volatility, was dysfunctional in this nation of around 22 million, as was the composition of the Social Democratic Party and the amateurish opposition, and the largely undemocratic milieu that provided the context for the postcommunist transition and transformation. The mass media consisted of a wealth of newspapers, many of them owned by political parties, as already pointed out, and other commercial enterprises that struggled to survive after 1993 when they registered a precipitous drop in circulations; licensed and unlicensed radio stations; and “public” television to which private, commercial channels were added by the end of the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212450562">Gross 1996</xref>). The size of the print media in the 1990s can be assigned to (1) the multiplicity of political parties and the incipient establishment of civil society and also to (2) the natural response to liberation from communism that drove individuals and groups to establish newspapers and radio stations, and express a variety of viewpoints and meet a wide range of perceived informational needs.</p>
<p>Romania’s political scene, as well as its mass media system, is far more complex today. Part of this complexity is created by ineffective political parties, a society not wholly governed by the rule of law thanks to a deficit of independent institutions that ought to carry out oversight, regulatory and judicial functions, and by the individual and collective values, attitudes and behaviors of Romanians. In addition, Romania has a weak State that is not accountable to its citizens and “did not manage to gain more . . . autonomy towards (sic) political parties to be able to organize itself at least at a medium level of authority as a modern policymaking agent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161212450562">Mungiu-Pippidi 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For one thing, this weakness contributes to making the Romanian State an “exploited” one in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212450562">Grzymala-Busse’s (2007)</xref> characterization, which amounts to “state capture.” More oversight institutions and regulations now exist in Romania than ever before and even if they are <italic>not</italic> effective bulwarks against state exploitation in the short term, argues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1940161212450562">Young (2009)</xref>, they may be so in the long term. That is a very optimistic view given that the “crisis of institutional accountability” that political scientist M. Stephen Fish found in the 1990s still persists in Romania, with no sign of abating any time soon, both in the political and mass media systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161212450562">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This may explain the willful misinterpretations and misapplications of laws and regulations pertaining to libel, defamation, privacy, right of reply, hate speech, confidentiality of journalistic sources, access to information, media concentration, competition, political communication, broadcasting licensing and content by a judiciary that lacks independence. All of the above may resemble comparable laws and regulations in Western democracies, yet few if any are interpreted and applied with fidelity to democratic values or to the letter of these laws and regulations, as prominently and continually noted since 1990 by Reporters Without Frontiers, the Council of Europe, and Freedom Forum among others, inclusive of the latest acknowledgement of “defective” enforcements by the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212450562">Ghinea and Mungiu-Pippidi 2010</xref>). The fact that journalists are no longer so easily punished by the courts for insults, slander and disparagement as before 2010, may be a promising change but the permanency of this change has not yet been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ganea et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Other, “non-State means of making media responsible towards the public,” such as press councils, ombudsmen and journalism reviews, are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212450562">Bertrand 2000</xref>, 208). Codes of ethics abound but, as we shall see, they are non-functional. Other accountability instruments internal and external to the media are either nonexistent or lack the institutionalization that would make them effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212450562">Coman and Gross 2006</xref>). The combination of accountability suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212450562">Fengler, Eberwein, and Leppik-Bork (2011</xref>, 16) is simply missing: (1) State regulation, as pointed out above, is unreliable; (2) self-regulation, that is, a combination of accountability activities by audiences/stockholders on one hand and media professionals on the other, is simply missing; and (3) coregulations is equally absent.</p>
<p>Accountability in the political system has not changed despite changes in the system. The number of political parties, for example, so numerous in the 1990s that it made the system unwieldy and unstable, began shrinking as the new millennium arrived and by the 2004 and 2008 elections only four parties were represented in Parliament, compared to five in the 2000 elections, seven in the 1992 elections and sixteen in the 1990 elections. In theory, this should have brought more stability and predictability to the Romanian political system. It did not. After the 2008 elections, the parties of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance were at odds with one another, almost as intensely as they were at odds with the array of opposition parties headed by the Social Democratic Party, which had lost its hold on the presidency and government in 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1940161212450562">7</xref></sup> At the time of this writing in late 2011, the ruling coalition consisted of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians; they hold a majority in the Senate but not in the Chamber of Deputies. In February 2011, a new coalition of opposition party, the Social-Liberal Union, was formed by the Social Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party, and the Conservative Party; the last two constituted the Center-Right Alliance just one month before. There are a number of minor parties of little consequence and an extreme right-wing camp embodied in the Greater Romania Party and the New Right. There is also a nationalist populist camp led by the New Generation Party, which has been siphoning off some of Greater Romania Party and Social Democratic Party adherents since 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1940161212450562">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The expectation that fewer political parties will bring about a sharper ideological separation between them has not yet been met. As a result, political identities and party loyalties by and large continue to shift with every new election cycle, with the liberals having perhaps the highest level of ideological institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212450562">Jiglau and Gherghina 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212450562">Grzymala-Busse (2007</xref>, 60) points out that “clear opposition is not limited to the ideological distance among parties and other spatial understandings of political competition.” Yet nonideological opposition may affect true, robust political competition, “meaning clear, plausible and critical,” a necessary ingredient to moderate the parties’ “exploitative behavior and commit to building strong institutions of state oversight in anticipation of the possible consequences of losing elections” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1940161212450562">Young 2009</xref>, 5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1940161212450562">9</xref></sup> This has not yet happened in Romania and it is also reflected in the absence of clear, plausible, and critical media coverage of political issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212450562">Ghinea and Mungiu-Pippidi 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212450562">Hume 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ganea et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>If we accept Huntington’s ([1996] 2006, 71) thesis that “corruption is most prevalent in states that lack effective political parties, in societies where the interests of the individual, the family, the clique, or the clan predominate,” then it is no surprise that corruption continues to be a salient issue in Romania. A number of analysts have suggested that there is a synergetic link between Romanian politics and a number of mafia-like networks or at the very least nefarious links between the now entrenched economic and political elites, and that by extension the media are part of this Mephistophelian coupling. Since 1989, the press has traversed a number of stages, from belonging to no particular media “system” in the first few weeks after the end of the communist regime to becoming, with few exceptions, an atomized party press and, subsequently, for a brief few years seemingly moving to a commercial model only to solidify its dual commercial-political profile for the owners. In the last few years, additionally, for media managers, editors, star journalists, and commentators, the media became personal commercial platforms that brought individual wealth for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212450562">Coman 2009</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212450562">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212450562">Gross 1996</xref>). The introduction of commercial broadcast media, particularly television, was not allowed until the second half of the 1990s. News channels and talks shows came to be increasingly politicized or tabloidized. Public broadcasting was given a Western patina but has functioned as a political platform for those who are in control of the government and continues to be a political football in the general political system. The political nature of Romania’s mass media has increased with the growth of conglomerates, as pointed out by a slew of studies, but a causal relationship between these developments and changes in the political system is difficult if not impossible to prove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212450562">Candea 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212450562">Ciubotaru et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212450562">Coman 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ghinea and Mungiu-Pippidi 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212450562">Hume 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The mass media themselves constitute a form of corruption that is incompatible with the nature of a media functioning in and on behalf of a democracy. Not to mention that a corrupt watchdog allows for even greater corruption in society at large and all of its institutions. Even using the issue of corruption as a weapon is also a corrupt act in Romania. For as Young argues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1940161212450562">2009</xref>, 35), “Due to the incentives of using corruption accusations as a political weapon against rival parties, parliamentary collusion on joint protection against anti-corruption prosecution is not a stable equilibrium, but one that can easily dissolve when coalitions change.” However, she adds, “Parties’ frequent incentives to use oversight institutions to keep incumbents accountable can strengthen these institutions, and make them, in time, effective guarantors of political accountability.” Only time will tell whether these prognostications are accurate. The coverage of corruption in the media, for instance, because it is politically inspired against political opponents of the media outlet’s owner or of his or her business or political associate, it can be argued, makes for corrupt journalism even when it ultimately does a service in revealing bona fide wrongdoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212450562">Gross 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212450562">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212450562">2008c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212450562">Coman and Gross 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212450562">Gross 2004</xref>). Even investigative journalism, therefore, “lacks credibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1940161212450562">Preoteasa 2004</xref>, 421).</p>
<p>The general effectiveness of state institutions is highly questionable, particularly in the fight against corruption, as Transparency International (2009) points out,
<disp-quote>
<p>The Romanian judicial system is paralysed [<italic>sic</italic>] by an excessive self-regulatory process coupled with an absence of checks and balances, as well as accountability mechanisms. It is particularly worrying that reforms are not systemically approached. Instead, anti-corruption measures appear <italic>to be timed to achieve short-term political goals and influence public opinion</italic>. (emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While anti-corruption laws, institutions, campaigns, and lawsuits increased after 2009, mostly in response to the EU’s advocacy and President Traian Basescu’s commitment to fight it, they have been largely ineffective. Corruption in and of the media continues despite the existence of codes of ethics, press councils, and other “national instruments intended to ensure the social responsibility of journalists” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212450562">Coman et al. 2011</xref>, 142).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1940161212450562">10</xref></sup> Social norms of governance, such as the rule of law, corruption, and democratic accountability, “correlate systematically and strongly with national scores on cultural dimensions and also differ across cultural regions of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1940161212450562">Licht, Goldschmidt, and Schwartz 2007</xref>). In Romania, such national scores on cultural dimensions remain to be identified but we posit that they may well explain the tenuous nature of the rule of law, the ever-present corruption, and the absence of democratic accountability.</p>
<p>As a result of the failure of the rule of law and of the battle against corruption and for increased accountability, in general and in the mass media institution, trust in the media has fallen. They ranked high in the 1990s and in the first decade of the new century when Romanians considered them, together with the army and the church, to be most trustworthy institutions and when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212450562">Eurobarometer 69 (2008</xref>, 6) concluded that trust in the Romanian media “is by far the highest when compared to the EU.” By 2009, the media were considered increasingly corrupt; in 2010 that opinion was only slightly more positive according to the Global Corruption Barometer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr">http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1940161212450562">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such public perceptions about the media are reinforced by scholars as well as other analysts such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1940161212450562">Rodica Palade (2009)</xref> whose discouraging summation of what has occurred over two decades of postcommunist media evolution is telling: the media have rapidly degraded their credibility and, purposefully and for money, abdicated elementary principles; they have prostituted themselves; they violate elementary standards and abolish their duties vis-à-vis the public; they follow the Muscovite model and not at all the Western one. [Is the text following the colon, “the media have . . . Western one,” a quotation? If so, please enclose within quotation marks and provide the page number.]</p>
<p>By 2006–2007, newspaper circulation plummeted (“Miscari in jos” 2007) and an equally significant loss of television audiences was registered; this followed in the heels of a decline in media audiences after 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212450562">Coman and Gross 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212450562">Chiruta 2007</xref>). Excessive fragmentation in the television field, that is, more television channels and offerings, and higher living standards that afforded Romanians other forms of entertainment and information sources were blamed (“Peste zece posture”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1940161212450562">Patapievici 1996</xref>). Still, television appears to retain a significant audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161212450562">Institutul Roman Pentru Evaluare si Strategie 2011</xref>). Reliable empirical data are not available to pinpoint the causes for the loss of readers and viewers since the early 1990s, nor do we have empirical evidence of the levels of and reasons for displeasure on the part of Romanians with the journalistic offerings of both the print and broadcast media. We cannot, however, dismiss the significance of the negative perceptions of the media, their corrupt nature, being one of the causes for the loss of print and broadcast audiences.</p>
<p>Corruption makes the nature of Romanian democracy a very special one indeed. A latecomer to democratization when compared to other European countries, Romania’s political system and its politics show a thin veneer of Westernization. Romania needs to get beyond its historical nondemocratic past, that is, in reverse chronological order, the forty-plus years of communism and its hundreds of years of division and foreign rule (Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian). This past led to its political activity “in the modern sense of the term” to develop “quite differently from the countries of the west” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1940161212450562">Weber 1965</xref>, 501). The great liberalization movement, for instance, that touched the young Romanian elites in mid-nineteenth century, followed by the union of Wallachia and Moldova into a unitary Romanian state in 1859, and the addition of other Romanian provinces in 1878, was of a quality entirely different from that found slowly blossoming in the West. Thus, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1940161212450562">Weber (1965</xref>, 503) of the Romanian kingdom, even its smattering of liberal elites of the mid-nineteenth century, “accepted reform when it favored their interests, state interference when it brought grist (or contracts) to their mills. They were ready to use the state as an instrument of Westernization, much as in Russia. But they operated from outside, upon masses unwillingly affected by processes that others manipulated.”</p>
<p>How many of these attitudes persist today and to what degree is a matter of debate. Aside from the culture-based analysis of Romania’s postcommunist evolution offered by the late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1940161212450562">Adrian Marino (1996)</xref>, Romanian intellectuals such as Vladimir Pasti, Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, Andrei Plesu, and Horia-Roman Patapievici, among a smattering of others, resolutely point to specific cultural aspects that make contemporary Romanian modernization and democratization, at least in part, a parallel world to that of the 1800s. They argue that the attitudes, values, and behaviors of political and other institutions, and most specifically that of their elites, are not much different than those of their forefathers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1940161212450562">Tapalaga (2010</xref>, 28) writes that with few exceptions, Romania “does not have pro-Western, reformist opinion leaders” who are “liberals” in the general sense of the world; “The majority [of opinion leaders] mimic . . . the ethics and values of the West.” The Levantine inclination to hold everything negotiable and to make negotiation a central tenet of sociocultural behavior when personal gain is at stake, may in broad strokes be assignable perhaps to the hundreds of years of subjugation and the need to find accommodation with the subjugators, survive, and prosper as much as possible under any circumstances. Romanians, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1940161212450562">Patapievici (1996</xref>, 53), always look to adapt themselves to the situation at hand and without being held to account for how they might do so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1940161212450562">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A contemporary media–related example is the practice of some Romanian television channels to register in other EU countries to evade Romanian regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1940161212450562">13</xref></sup> Even more telling are the Worlds of Journalism Study (2006–2011) results for Romania that represent the cultural traits outlined above: when Romanian journalists were queried about the institutional role of the media, their epistemologies and ethical ideologies, their responses were similar to those given by Western journalists; and when asked about the internal and external influences on their work, they essentially denied that such influences are brought to bear on their work in any substantial way. They knew what the expected “correct” answers are; unfortunately, all foreign and domestic analysis of media roles, epistemologies, ethics, and external and international influences upon their work contradicts the answers they gave. During the 2009 presidential elections, for example, many journalists, most certainly the “stars” among them, the commentators, and manager-journalists took overt sides in the electoral battles, and since then the roles, ethics, and practices of Romanian journalism have only worsened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212450562">Hume 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ganea et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A cultural-historical approach to understanding the degree of and possibilities for general societal transformation is the path-dependent one articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161212450562">Inglehart (2000</xref>, 80, 96), or the so-called involutionists “who see in the present the dead weight of the past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1940161212450562">Stark and Bruszt 1998</xref>, 4–8) constitutes one school of thought (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212450562">Crawford and Lijphart 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161212450562">Jowitt 1992</xref>). Such a preponderant influence of the past on the postcommunist transformation is also argued by some media scholars to be present in the mass media’s transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1940161212450562">Sparks 1998</xref>), whereas others simply see the Eastern European institutional transformations, including that of the mass media, as being imitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1940161212450562">Splichal 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In Romania, one can make the argument that institutional imitation on the systemic level is certainly present but that there is also the perception that the “permanence of the past,” partly encouraged by the “stolen” or “confiscated” revolution of 1989, and partly by the historical lack of democratic experiences, shapes how the new Western-style institutions function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161212450562">Maner 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161212450562">Linz and Stepan (1996)</xref> are more direct in assigning blame for Romania’s postcommunist development to both the legacy of totalitarianism and to the much longer legacy of “Sultanism” that is today exhibited in the still vertical power hierarchy in society and all of its institutions, including the mass media.</p>
<p>The political system—the institutions that define it—does indeed resemble its Western counterparts but its vertical hierarchical structure and the values and behaviors of its leadership limits democratization and makes true reform difficult to achieve. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1940161212450562">Wydra (2007)</xref> points out, echoing John Dewey and others, institutional redesign is not enough and reform driven by the political system, as Huntington ([1996] 2006) describes it, is most noticeably lagging.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1940161212450562">14</xref></sup> On the most fundamental level, the political system’s ability to clearly tell us something about and guide us in our understanding of the mass media system, a politicoeconomic institution in Romania and much less so a social institution, is limited at best without first understanding what explains the political system itself. But setting that aside, the political system is unhelpful to our understanding of the media system for at least four reasons: (1) its dualities; (2) its functioning outside the expected parameters that its formal attributes and legal frameworks dictate; (3) therefore, the system’s unclear classification, as we shall see; and (4) the attitudes and behaviors of its major and minor players that can perhaps best be explained in cultural terms, rather than strictly in economic and political ones.</p>

<title>Media, Politics, and the Political System</title>
<p>Romania is a semipresidential system with a popularly elected president coexisting with a prime minister whose government is dependent on parliament, creating the so-called dual authority structure that shifts power from the president to the prime minister and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1940161212450562">Sartori 2004</xref>, 139).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1940161212450562">15</xref></sup> That presidential systems are less stable than parliamentary ones is questioned by some scholars such as Mainwaring and Shugart (2011), who write, “even if <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161212450562">Linz [1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161212450562">1996</xref>], is largely correct in his argument that parliamentary government is more conducive to a stable democracy; a great deal rests on <italic>what kind</italic> of parliamentarism and <italic>what kind</italic> of presidentialism are implemented” (emphasis added). Presidentialism, they argue, “appears to be more viable with parties that are at least moderately disciplined, and it is especially problematic with highly fragmented multiparty systems,” such as one finds in Romania, and which specifically hints that it is a <italic>majoritarian</italic> democracy rather than a <italic>consensus</italic> democracy that is functional in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1940161212450562">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>But a clean separation between <italic>majoritarian</italic> and <italic>consensus</italic> politics is not easily discernible in Romania, where elements of both are detectable. Whether this constitutes a hybrid system, some sort of a conflation of the two, or simply two systems functioning side by side is not clear. For instance, imitating <italic>consensus politics</italic>, there is a coalition government in power in Bucharest, and thus power sharing; and Romania has a multiparty system and there is in this semipresidential republic with at least a de jure separation of power between the legislative and executive branches. As in <italic>majoritarian systems</italic>, there are distinctions between the government and the opposition but the distinctions are not necessarily ideological and thus the competition is for power, mostly to maximize economic benefits for the power holders, for example, high official salaries, the opportunities to “share” the wealth made by official and unofficial business partners, the ability to help family members and friends with lucrative appointments or contracts, and so on. Politics in Romania, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1940161212450562">Stan (2003)</xref>, is “<italic>an office-seeking process rather than a way to achieve policy goals</italic>” (emphasis added). As in a <italic>consensus system</italic>, there is a party-list proportional representation election system in place, which may be losing its appeal but is in no danger of being eliminated. Recent proposals to do away with the system failed; it’s a hard sell after all given that it guarantees the political class “exorbitant” power by creating “a parliamentary autocracy . . . which serves its own interests when it is not obsequiously pandering to those of the oligarchs, its backers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212450562">Delaloye 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>None of this explains the nature of the mass media, except superficially, its monopolization by the oligarchs, their symbiotic alliances with politicians and political parties, and at the same time the shifts in these alliances as realignments (not loyalties) continue to define a political system driven not by ideology but by power interests that are oriented to acquiring and securing wealth, sinecures, and other remunerations. That is, a different kind of media system, with a different character and nature could exist in the extant political system. In short, Romania’s political system does not allow for a clear classification of the mass media and its journalism along the lines suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini (2004</xref>, 50–53) who, it must be noted, make it clear that the three models of media systems they outline, based largely on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161212450562">Lijphart’s (1984)</xref> definition of the nature of democratic systems, are “exploratory.” After all, Romania is less a democracy than one in the making. But in a situation whereby a political system consonant to a democracy is being forged at a purely institutional-systemic level without a concomitant and appropriate evolution of the culture, Romanian democracy may be frozen in place.</p>
<p>Neither the <italic>majoritarian</italic> aspects of Romanian democracy nor the <italic>consensus</italic> ones gave birth to the “neutral servant”–type journalist, to “catch-all” media or to internal media pluralism, whereby “media organizations both avoid institutional ties to political groups and attempt to maintain neutrality and ‘balance’ in their content” and “formally represent a variety of political forces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>, 29–30).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1940161212450562">17</xref></sup> And despite the <italic>consensus</italic> aspects present in Romanian politics, there is only restricted, qualified external pluralism in the Romanian media, with the overwhelming majority of national and local media generally reflecting the points of view of groups and tendencies as represented by political parties, politicians, media owners, and/or by the journalistic elites and managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212450562">Coman 2012</xref>) (an issue further developed in the section “Parallelism, Instrumentalization and Clientelism”).</p>
<p>The expectation that the more diverse a political system is and the more political parties are in parliament, the more external pluralism is present in the mass media may have been partly true in the first half of the 1990s but no longer. It is not the decreased number of parties that may be to blame but the increasingly smaller politico-economic power centers with whom media owners, and separately manager-journalists, commentators, and “star” journalists, negotiate about the issues and mostly the individuals who will be the focus of positive or negative media attention. Furthermore, true ideological diversity and clear political identities are in reality limited, as already suggested, regardless of the number of political parties, and the political parallelism that is associated with external pluralism and that has a specific nature in Romania (see section “Clientelism and Political Parallelism Romanian Style”). Adding to the diminution of external pluralism, the economic downturn in Romania that began in 2008 has caused the closing of more than sixty local newspapers, as well as other media outlets, and the firing of six thousand journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ganea et al. 2011</xref>, 7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1940161212450562">18</xref></sup> The absence of media pluralism is path dependent: the Romanian press has historically not exhibited internal pluralism, whereas external pluralism did exist to a lesser or greater degree, as it does today, particularly in the years between the two world wars.</p>
<p>A positive correlation between diversity or pluralism in the political system and that found in the mass media system, as hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212450562">Engesser and Franzetti (2011)</xref> and found wanting in their study, is missing in Romania. In Mexico, for example, they found a great deal of diversity in the political system but a limited reflection of it in the mass media system, whereas in the United States there is limited political diversity or pluralism in the U.S. Congress but a great degree of diversity or pluralism in the mass media. Their conclusion that “perhaps, diversity in one of the two systems compensates for the missing plurality in the other” is not the case in Romania where despite the large number of political parties and media outlets, diversity or pluralism is largely absent in both realms. What diversity or pluralism exists is limited to the ever-changing coupling between established media outlets and the major politicoeconomic powers in a game that is incestuous and leaves Romanian society in the unenviable position of a spectator rather than a participant. That is, if one looks at the trust in the media, journalism, and journalists, and in the political and economic elites and their political parties, Romanian society exists and functions more or less separately from the media and the politicoeconomic powers that are mutually dependent on what is for them an illusory role of leadership and public opinion formation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212450562">Lazescu (2007)</xref> makes the case that even the spectators to these “truly mediated [political] shows are relative few.”</p>
<p>The most basic feature of politics in <italic>consensus</italic> systems, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1940161212450562">Lijphart (1999</xref>, 171), is power sharing; thus, it is associated with organized pluralism or corporatism, whereas individual pluralism or liberalism is linked to <italic>majoritarian</italic> systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1940161212450562">19</xref></sup> There is a modicum of power sharing in the Romanian media between the owners on the one hand, and media managers, editors, and star journalists on the other hand, mostly by virtue of the self-assigned (and perhaps illusory) power of the latter group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212450562">Coman 2012</xref>). In line with the extant elements of a <italic>consensus system</italic>, there is also a modicum of power sharing in broadcast governance in Romania, reflected in the legally mandated appointments to the National Audio-Visual Council (CNA) but there has also been a continuous battle over the council and a plethora of controversies have grown around it since its inception in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212450562">Coman and Gross 2006</xref>). The CNA has eleven members, six appointed by parliament, two by the president, and three by the government; civil society is not represented. CNA members are beholden to those who appointed them and not to a notion of social responsibility consonant to a democracy. The nature of CNA governance rests in the power of the head of the council and his or her political sponsors or the political inclinations (and political sponsors) of the majority on the council. One of the latest controversies, as Romania prepares for the 2012 parliamentary elections, is the granting of fifty-two television licenses, the majority of them to companies that are financed outright or <italic>sub rosa</italic> by local politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212450562">Ciubotaru et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The intense political conflicts the CNA has brought about has not moved it closer to a professional model, which might be expected in a <italic>majoritarian</italic> system, elements of which are also present in Romania. The operative model of broadcast governance in Romania is a strange amalgamation of models that in theory should be distinct: the government model and the parliamentary or proportional representation model; there is no sign yet that the professional model or the “civic” or “corporatist” has any chance of being established in Romania.</p>
<p>Besides the CNA, parliament has also been a venue where attempts to control broadcasting and print media is an ongoing sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ganea et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212450562">Hume 2011</xref>). For example, drafting laws (1) calling for television stations to broadcast both negative and positive news in equal measure, (2) to put print media under the jurisdiction of the CNA, and (3) to censor news websites were introduced and then dropped after vociferous opposition from professional journalism organizations and domestic and international nongovernmental organizations. The wide array of laws and regulations pertaining to the media are, on one hand, obvious attempts to establish a rational-legal authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161212450562">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212450562">Coman and Gross 2006</xref>). But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini (2004</xref>, 56) so rightly note, what is most important to rational-legal authority is “the degree to which citizens, businesses and other actors are willing to follow rules, or alternatively seek to evade.” In Romania, the important cultural component of rational-legal authority is the inclination to always seek to evade rules, regulations, and laws if it is in one’s personal interest and if the political connections and/or economic wherewithal make it possible. Romanians prefer to live, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1940161212450562">Tapalaga’s (2010</xref>, 15) words, “intimately, according to other [than Western] political and social codes, in which bribery, corruption, social promotion [based on] criteria [tied] to clan, nepotism, etc., are not really so bad.”</p>
<p>The issue of broadcast governance continues to vie for attention with the battle started in January 1990 over public television and, to a lesser extent, public radio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212450562">Gross 1996</xref>). The notion advanced by Humphreys, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini (2004</xref>, 52), that “we might expect the publicly owned media to be more vulnerable to capture by the dominant political tendency” in a <italic>majoritarian system</italic> is most true in Romania where, it bears repeating, elements of a <italic>consensus system</italic> are also present. One might conclude that the absence of a clear majoritarian-consensus distinction and the presence of elements of both systems has not brought Romania the best type of media governance but rather the worst. Political parties negotiate the appointments to the public television’s leadership and “The people thus appointed act openly as representatives of their parties. They see their role as making the president of the party [they represent] look good on TVR news” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212450562">Ghinea and Mungiu-Pippidi 2010</xref>, 14). And there is more: Prime Minister Emil Boc asked that public television grant him his own show every Wednesday during prime time.</p>
<p>It is posited that in a <italic>consensus system</italic> one finds “strong, centralized organizations representing social groups” and the expectation is that journalists would have such organizations as well. Romania does indeed have such organizations but their powers and effectiveness are limited. From time to time, if and when they raise their voices in concert with other national and international nongovernmental organizations, they collectively have brought a halt to the most egregious attempts by parliament to negatively affect the mass media. MediaSind, a federation of trade unions, carries out collective bargaining on behalf of journalists with media owners; such bargaining is supposed to be binding but in many cases the agreements are but words on paper. MediaSind also offers legal assistance to journalists and has had some success in cases when journalists have been mistreated or fired. Other notable organizations include the Romanian Press Club that is, however, controlled by media owners and managers, and the Convention of Media Organizations that encompasses about twenty-four nongovernmental organizations that have media-related programs, the most important of which are the Center for Independent Media and Active Watch–The Media Monitoring Agency.</p>
<p>The Romanian political system thus provides an incoherent, incomplete, and unstable explanation of the mass media system, unless of course one considers the mass media, particularly the news media, to be nothing more than a political institution, in which case one might argue that they mirror the attributes of the political system, its nature and modus operandi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1940161212450562">Schudson 2002</xref>). The Romanian political system and the new economic system have changed the culture, and both have influenced the mass media system and the culture that defines it. It is also observable that in Romania’s political and mass media systems, together with changes that have been brought by new institutions, there is a “persistence of distinctive traditional values,” as found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161212450562">Inglehart and Baker (2000)</xref> to be true in modernizing countries. In the Romanian case, at least to date, we can also observe that economic and political developments or a change in political and economic systems has brought cultural changes in the mass media that are inimical to democratization, but only in the sense that changes in the political and economic systems have allowed particular cultural traditions to continue to dominate, and their most egregious aspects to have uninhibited freedoms. An examination of political parallelism, instrumentalization, and clientelism buttresses this view.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1940161212450562">
<title>Political Parallelism, Instrumentalization, and Clientelism—Romanian Style</title>
<p>Political parallelism, instrumentalization of both public and private media, and clientelism (PIC) thrive in Romania. The question is whether PIC follows classic definitions and whether its nature is stable.</p>
<p>There are generally two sets of media owners, those who are (1) business people, and domestic and foreign corporations, and (2) local and national politicians who own one or more media outlet and perhaps other businesses as well. The first group is joined by politicians (who do not own media), political parties, other economic actors, government institutions, and only to a miniscule extent in Romania, social groups or movements to control and manipulate the media and “to intervene in the world of politics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>, 37), or at least attempt to do so. The second group of owners <italic>are</italic> “the media,” they are their own best clients and in these circumstances we cannot speak of political parallelism, of “links” between the media and political parties, or how the media reflect the major political divisions in the country. In this instance, separation between the media and a political party as represented by the politician who owns a media outlet is nonexistent. This type of media outlet then reflects not the major political divisions but, first and foremost, the nonideological political interests of the politician-owner/owner-politician and the struggle for power and, indirectly, the interests of his or her party. PIC is thus predominantly related to political figures and parties and not to differing political policies and goals.</p>
<p>There is one additional power center in the Romanian media. Media managers, columnists, and “star” journalists, with their ability to separately negotiate with politicians, political parties, business people, and corporations their positive (or another’s negative) coverage in the media, or just coverage, also control and manipulate the media. They are simply cashing in on their gatekeeping and other perceived powers to affect public opinion; sometimes they consider themselves to <italic>be</italic> public opinion. In a minority of cases, negotiating PIC with politicians, political parties, and government officials leads these media managers, commentators, and “star” journalists to cross over into government service and even media ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212450562">Coman and Gross 2006</xref>). At times, they are also at odds with the media owners for creating a world of PIC that parallels the traditional one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212450562">Coman 2012</xref>). They behave as the politician-media owner, businessman-media owner, and corporate-media owner do and for the same reasons: first and foremost, power, which makes possible greater economic gain and, secondly, economic gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212450562">Coman 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1940161212450562">20</xref></sup> The important point is that traditional media–politics parallelism and clientelism (institution to institution and nonpolitical) operate concurrently with an even stronger nontraditional type of parallelism and clientelism (individual to institution and individual to individual, and nonpolitical). This two-sided, Janus-like parallelism and clientelism makes for robust instrumentalization that is not only in the exclusive purview of media owners, politicians, and business people but also of the media managers, editors, “star” journalists, and commentators (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1940161212450562">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the Janus-like nature of PIC and those who exclusively control the media’s instrumentalization, it should be no surprise that for some analysts the Romanian media are nothing more than a propaganda machine, and independent journalism is feared and unwelcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212450562">Candea 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212450562">2011b</xref>). Addressing themselves to media moguls in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212450562">Ganea et al. (2011</xref>, 21) conclude that they
<disp-quote>
<p>control editorial policy of media outlets (and change it depending on their economic, political and legal interests). These “masters” understand ethics only as an ornament that he will display from time to time, and many journalists (and editorial managers) in their [media] trust accept this situation and participate in the realization of the master/owner’s interest.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parallelism is supposed to be stronger in <italic>consensus</italic> democratic systems and much less so in <italic>majoritarian</italic> systems, but we must not forget that Romania has features of both <italic>majoritarian</italic> and <italic>consensus</italic> systems, the tilt perhaps favoring the former ever so slightly. And the faux rational-legal authority established in Romania, whereby extensive laws, regulations, and rules exist but their interpretations and applications are largely negotiable, enhances the robustness of PIC. Furthermore, it allows for the corrupt nature of political society and political and professional cultures, at least at the top of the journalistic pyramid, to fully bloom, adding resilience to PIC. Given what we have described above, that is, the power centers that control and manipulate the media, it suggests that the nature of democracy is less important to understanding PIC than other factors that describe the way the mass media function. Clientelism in Romania is strong, for instance, at least among media not directly owned by politicians (see above discussion), and so is weak adherence to legal norms but one has less to do with the other, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212450562">Hallin and Mancini (2004</xref>, 58) posit in general terms to be the correlative reality, and more to do with values, attitudes, and behaviors that independently affect both.</p>
<p>Everything in Romania, after all, depends on age-old values and attitudes and, consequently, behaviors. The troika of <italic>pile</italic> (a “file,” a tool that smoothens metals; a metaphor for smoothing the way for yourself, relatives, and friends), <italic>cunostinte</italic> (acquaintances), and <italic>relatii</italic> (connections), so very well described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1940161212450562">Pop (2006</xref>, 25), dominates every aspect of life, public and private. This was so for hundreds of years before the communist regime was established and remained so during the regime’s life when “pile, cunostinte, relatii” spelled out the acronym of the Partidul Comunist Roman (Romanian Communist Party [PCR]) and was the source of many political jokes. Postcommunism has not altered Romanian culture—societal, political, or professional; it has only given it an opportunity to begin its slow, bumpy, and uncertain process of change, in the present stage exhibiting its most egregiously negative aspects in the extreme.</p>
<p>The corrupt nature of political society and political, social, and professional cultures, at least at the top of the owners, politicians, business people, and journalists’ pyramid, is reflected in the nature and effects of PIC. The injection of additional politician-owners into the media scene, the exit of some foreign media owners, and the scandals surrounding media moguls continues to reinforce PIC and concurrently also offer opportunities for altering its nature. Additionally, if we consider the migration of “star” journalists, commentators, and media managers from one media outlet to another in the last few years, we see additional opportunities for renegotiations with various “clients” for access to the media and positive coverage, and perhaps yet another change in the nature of PIC. The gladiatorial struggles in 2005 between media managers/editorial leaders and owners, which took on international dimensions given that some owners were foreign, were exemplifications of an internal struggle in the media system for control over who affects the extent, nature, and beneficiaries of PIC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1940161212450562">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, we posit that PIC in Romania is not necessarily stable and predictable, as it might be if and when only media owners are solely in charge of instrumentalizing the media, carrying out a clientelistic relationship, and being the arbiters of political parallelism. PIC will continue until basic changes in the social, political, and professional cultures are sufficiently significant and lasting to have an effect on its nature, functioning, and degree of presence in Romania.</p>

<p>In Romania, the political system, unclear in its nature and still shifting in line with a still evolving democracy, does not explain the mass media system. It is the vessel in which Romanian cultural predilections find full expression, and in turn explain both the relationship between the political and mass media system and the nature and functioning of the latter. This is true of the very nature of how instrumentalization, clientelism, and political parallelism have evolved and how it is practiced.</p>
<p>Clientelism and the political parallelism of the media are often expressions of the powers of the manager-journalist or star journalists and not only of owners of the mass media, of the political system and its culture, and of the politicians. This has turned PIC in Romania into a continually twisting and turning drive on an mountain-like path on which the rules of the road are made up by the drivers and not always by the owners of the figurative vehicle, by the political system or by the government, and most certainly not by the passengers in whose name both the political and media systems are supposed to function. Perhaps the Romanian situation is unique; we cannot yet gauge if it is so. Much more research remains to be done on the subject in Romania, as well as in the other Eastern European countries, before comparisons can be made. And a culture-based approach to examining mass media must be found, because only then can we have a deeper understanding as to why a mass media system functions the way it does.</p>

<p>The legal support for media freedoms is well documented, together with problems of implementation, in Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (July <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161212450562">2009</xref>). Ameliorating changes in laws that couch on the media and their journalists were made since 2009, but the implementation problems persist.</p>

<p>Most of the Romanian mass media is concentrated in four media groups such as Adevărul Holding, MediaPro, Realitatea Media, and Intact Media Group. For more information about the number of Romanian media companies in 2010, see the websites of the National Statistics Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insse.ro">http://www.insse.ro</ext-link>) and the National Audiovisual Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cna.ro">http://www.cna.ro</ext-link>). The number of publications has fallen since 2008 when 2,820 were recorded, 80 of them dailies. The number of broadcast outlets has increased; the companies listed have 810 national and local television stations. There were 805 broadcast outlets in 2008.</p>

<p>We only include the traditional media here. By 2010, 35.5 percent of Romania’s population had access to the Internet, according to the International Telecommunication Union (2010), a significant growth from only 3.6 percent in 2000. The Gallup Organization in Romania, in a 2011 study carried out at the request of the National Authority for the Administration and Regulation in Communications (Autoritatea Nationala pentru Administrare si Reglementare in Comunicatii [ANCOM]), found that 46 percent of Romania’s population has access to the Internet. Whatever the exact percentage of those who have access to the Internet, Romania is still in one of the last places among European Union countries when it comes to the availability of and access to Internet connections. While major news outlets have an Internet presence and blogs have been established, the study of Romanian web-based media is yet to develop.

<p>Ion Iliescu and what became the Social Democratic Party (PSD) were one of the main political forces in Romania, controversial for the leadership’s roles during the communist period and for its illiberal and corrupt approaches to ruling the country. The opposition consisted of a rag-tag coalition that managed to elect Emil Constantinescu to the presidency in 1996, only to dissolve in 2000 amid charges of recrimination and failures. The PSD returned to power in 2000 and continued in great measure its pre-1996 policies. In 2004, Traian Basescu was elected president and a coalition of more politically diverse parties (comparative to those in the Constantinescu government) ascended to the government.</p>

Plausibility means that no parties are ostracized, so that many alterative governments can potentially be created. It is measured by the average seat shares of plausible parties.

Vocation for voluntary servitude, combined with the irrepressible will to indefinitely mystify. The thought that in the epoch of full culpability the truth could only be found by starting with sincerity. Romanians accepted the lie, and because its permanency conferred immunity to their own conscience, they declared lies to be truth, black to be white, and they constructed their interior on this crude falsification of the world, that is essentially a counter-Genesis.” See also Pop-Eleches and Tucker (July <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1940161212450562">2011</xref>) for a discussion of postcommunist legacies, values and behavior.</p>

<p>Huntington ([1996] 2006, 140) is worth quoting in full: “To cope successfully with modernization, a political system must be able, first, to innovate policy, that is to promote social and economic reform by state action. Reform in this context usually means the changing of traditional values and behavior patterns, the expansion of communications and education, the broadening of loyalties from family, village, and tribe to nation, the secularization of public life, the rationalization of authority structures, the promotion of functionally specific organization, the substitution of achievement criteria for ascriptive ones, and the furthering of a more equitable distribution of material and symbolic resources. A second requirement for a political system is the ability to assimilate successfully into the system the social forces produced by modernization and achieving a new social consciousness as a result of modernization.”</p>

Consensus democracies, in contrast, are highlighted by power sharing on the basis of a broad coalition cabinet, a proportional electoral system, a multiparty system, federal and decentralized government, strong bicameralism, and other institutions.</p>
