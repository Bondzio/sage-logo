<abstract>
<p>Background and Importance: High-flow spontaneous vertebral arteriovenous shunts in patients with fibromuscular disease (FMD) are rare. Onyx embolizaton of the recipient veins with shunt disconnection and preservation of the affected vertebral artery in a patient with FMD has not been reported. Clinical Presentation: A 59-year-old female presented with progressive dizziness, pre-syncopal episodes, and tinnitus. Catheter-based angiography identified features of fibromuscular dysplasia and a high-flow right cervical vertebral artery arteriovenous shunt. Onyx embolization of the principle draining veins was performed with initial detachable coil placement. Complete disconnection of the shunt was achieved without sacrifice of the parent vertebral artery. Conclusion: Spontaneous high-flow vertebral arteriovenous shunts can be successfully occluded with Onyx/detachable coil embolization of the principle recipient veins.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 59-year-old female was evaluated for progressive dizziness and tinnitus. No prior personal or family history of a connective tissue disorder was noted. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and was otherwise noncontributory.</p>
<p>A magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examination demonstrated a singular arteriovenous shunt between the right cervical vertebra artery and contiguous muscular veins with the absence of vertebral arterial flow distal to the shunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412452156">Figure 1</xref>). A catheter-based angiographic examination demonstrated a singular high-flow right cervical vertebral artery arteriovenous shunt with extensive contiguous muscular, epidural, contralateral, and ipsilateral internal jugular venous drainage. No vertebral arterial flow distal to the shunt was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412452156">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>The procedure was performed under endotracheal general anesthesia. Access to the right brachial artery was acquired and a 5F guide catheter was inserted into the right cervical vertebral artery. An Echelon-14 microcatheter (eV3 endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, Minnesota) in tandem with a Synchro2-14 microguidewire (Boston Scientific, Fremont, California) was navigated through the shunt, located at the C6 level, into the cephalad aspect of the large recipient vein. A series of guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) were detached within the recipient vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412452156">Figure 2</xref> B). Onyx-18 (Onyx liquid embolic system, EV-3, Irving, California), was injected (2 cc) through the microcatheter within the coil mesh and retrograde filling to occlude the aspect of the vein caudad to the shunt was allowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412452156">Figure 2C</xref>). Complete disconnection was achieved with additional coil placement with the shunt segment. Distal right cervical vertebral arterial flow was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412452156">Figure 2D</xref>). The patient’s tinnitus and dizziness resolved on follow-up after the procedure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cervical vertebral arteriovenous fistula present most commonly with tinnitus, followed by vertigo, neurologic defect, and pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412452156">1</xref>
</sup> The angiographic occurrence of fibromuscular disease (FMD) ranges from 0.53% to 1%, with vertebral artery involvement in 13% to 42.8%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412452156">2</xref>
</sup> Spontaneous fistulae are found to more commonly involve the upper cervical vertebral artery, at or above the level of C2, contrary to the location of the case presented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412452156">3</xref>
</sup> Other etiologies for nontraumatic spontaneous cervical vertebral shunts in adults include neurofibromatosis type 1, Marfan syndrome, and Ehler Denlos syndrome type IV.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412452156">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Endovascular occlusion of high-flow cervical vertebral arteriovenous shunts has become the preferred method of treatment, as surgical intervention is challenged by the anatomy, definitive location of the fistula, and frequent failure in preserving the vertebral artery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412452156">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412452156">4</xref>
</sup> The largest study evaluating the endovascular management of high-flow cervical vertebral arteriovenous fistula reported an occlusion rate of 91% with utilization of detachable latex balloons. Limitations of this technique included partial shunt closure and vertebral artery sacrifice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412452156">5</xref>
</sup> Occasional case reports using detachable coils with complete durable occlusion have been described, some with vertebral artery sacrifice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412452156">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412452156">6</xref>
</sup> A report describing the only other case of ethylene vinyl alcohol (Onyx liquid embolic system, EV-3) embolization with concomitant detachable coil embolization in the literature was characterized by initial failure of shunt closure with subsequent disconnection after vertebral artery sacrifice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412452156">7</xref>
</sup> Vertebral artery sacrifice may not be feasible if not tolerated or if the affected vessel is the only viable supply to the posterior circulation. Placement of stent grafts across the fistula has been reported with preservation of the vertebral artery. This technique, however, may result in incomplete closure due to poor wall apposition of the stent. This is likely to occur particularly with disparate proximal and distal vertebral arterial calibers across the shunt or in vessels with marked tortuosity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412452156">1</xref>
</sup> angiographic features typical of FMD. We describe onyx and detachable coil embolization of the recipient veins cephalad and caudad to a high-flow cervical vertebral artery arteriovenous shunt with complete closure and preservation of the parent vertebral artery in a patient with FMD.</p>
<p>An adequate Onyx plug at the distal microcatheter tip within the feeder vessel is required for subsequent antegrade propagation of the embolysate into an arteriovenous malformation nidus or fistula and can be potentially complicated by catheter retention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412452156">8</xref>
</sup> Onyx and coil embolization with retrograde venous access is a recognized method of dural shunt disconnection without embolizaton of the arterial feeder vessels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412452156">3</xref>
</sup> Placement of detachable coils with the recipient vein with arterial access through the fistula, in our case allowed for the formation of a framework that impeded uncontrolled distal migration of the embolic agent and allowed for fixation of the Onyx within the vessel, assuring complete venous occlusion. Additionally, after establishing an antegrade plug, the retrograde reflux proximal to the microcatheter tip was allowed to occur so that occlusion of the vein caudad to the shunt could be achieved. Concern for microcatheter adherence was mitigated as it was positioned in a large vessel. Removal of the microcatheter after onyx embolization was uneventful, despite significant reflux. Augmented embolization with Onyx was considered, as coils alone can produce incomplete occlusion of the fistula due to reduced thrombogenicity and failure of achieving adequate packing density.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412452156">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>High-flow cervical vertebral artery arteriovenous shunt occlusion can be safely achieved with coil-assisted Onyx embolization of the recipient vein proximal and distal to shunt with preservation of the parent vertebral artery in a patient with FMD.</p>
