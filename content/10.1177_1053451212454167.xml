<p>Teachers, clinicians, and caregivers are all aware of bullying. They hear about it on the nightly news, see it in schools and clinics, and make it a part of their conversations more often than they would like. Bullying is a form of aggression that manifests itself in the abusive treatment of another person who is weaker than the bully or thought to be so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454167">Olweus, 1994</xref>). On a national survey, 30% of adolescents in the United States reported that they were involved in bullying as a bully, the victim of a bully, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454167">Juvonen, Graham, &amp; Schuster, 2003</xref>). Bullying is serious, hurtful, and for many adolescents—including those with disabilities—it is a part of their lives.</p>
<p>Even though most educators and caregivers are aware of bullying, few are aware of a unique form of it called <italic>ostracism</italic>. Bullying is often envisioned as an overt act that inflicts physical and psychological pain upon its victims. Bullies punch, pinch, threaten, intimidate, and/or harass. When they are bulling, bullies pay attention to their victims, but ostracism is different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007b</xref>). Ostracism is the complete shutting out of another. Those who ostracize pay no attention to their victims and there is no outward sign of harm. Ostracism leaves no visible scars, but, like bullying, it leaves psychological and emotional pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454167">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>). The terms <italic>ostracism, social exclusion</italic>, and <italic>rejection</italic> are used interchangeably. Social exclusion occurs when someone is left out of a group and must work alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212454167">Twenge, 2001</xref>). Rejection occurs when an individual or a group declares that they do not or no longer wish to interact with or be in the company of another individual or group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454167">Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, &amp; Schreindorfer, 2005</xref>). To be harmful, ostracism does not have to occur for a long period of time or be performed by someone the victim knows or cares about. An adolescent can be ostracized by strangers or by people she or he dislikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454167">Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>Like bullying, cases of ostracism are increasing in number, intensity, and duration, and students with learning and behavioral challenges are often the ones feeling its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454167">Newman, 2004</xref>). The purpose of this column is to make educators, clinicians, and caretakers aware of ostracism, understand why it matters, learn ways to prevent it, and learn ways to intervene when it occurs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212454167">
<title>Why Ostracism Matters to Adolescents</title>
<p>To thrive and grow physically, cognitively, and emotionally, children need to be attached to their caregivers, and this need continues even as they move into adolescence. To be healthy and productive, adolescents and adults need human contact and a sense that they belong. These needs are so important they are called basic human needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454167">Furrer &amp; Skinner, 2003</xref>). Given this, it is understandable why ostracism can be so harmful. Ostracism threatens one’s need to belong, to have control over one’s environment, to feel safe, to have self-esteem, and to be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454167">Williams, 2011</xref>). Threats to these needs can cause emotional, cognitive, and psychological harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212454167">Santrock, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Belonging and esteem needs are especially important to adolescents because social connections matter so much to them. Adolescents spend approximately 16% of their day socializing, so being excluded is particularly devastating to them. Not being invited to a party or being shut out of a Facebook page hurts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212454167">Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2012</xref>). Adolescents define themselves by their acquaintances, and they use their friends to ease the turmoil and challenges they face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454167">Dobbs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212454167">Nelson &amp; DeBacker, 2008</xref>). This idea also applies to adolescents who have learning disabilities (LD) and/or emotional/behavioral disabilities (EBD). Students with LD and/or EBD are more at risk for ostracism than their typical peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454167">Twyman, Saylor, &amp; Macias, 2008</xref>). This is especially true for students with autism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454167">Baumeister, Shulman, and Agam (2003)</xref> found that students with autism reported feeling higher degrees of loneliness than their nonexceptional peers. In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212454167">Twyman et al. (2010)</xref> asked 294 children, ages 8 to 17, with and without disabilities about their experience with ostracism and discovered that students with autism, attention challenges, LD, and health and behavioral issues were ostracized and bullied more often than their typical peers.</p>
<p>Ostracism threatens the basic needs of adolescents with disabilities, and because of this, their bodies and brains react (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451212454167">Williams &amp; Zadro, 2005</xref>). An adolescent who is ostracized experiences a rush of cortisol and adrenalin, a rise in blood pressure, and blood flow to their extremities. These physiological changes prepare them to fight or flee. An adolescent who is being ostracized is likely to be hypervigilant or withdrawn. In either case, he or she will be more focused on the ostracism instead of the task at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454167">Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, &amp; Twenge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454167">Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams 2007</xref>). Even 5 minutes of ostracism can produce feelings of sadness, despair, and anger, and these can change an adolescent’s mood from positive to negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007a</xref>). Given ostracism’s potential impact on learning and behavior, it is important that educators, clinicians, and caregivers work to prevent it and stop it when it occurs. However, if one turns to the literature for specific strategies, one will find that few exist. The remainder of this article is designed to fill this gap.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1053451212454167">
<title>Preventing Ostracism</title>
<p>There is no quick or foolproof way to prevent ostracism because it can happen quickly, without warning, in many places, and in many subtle ways. However, like bullying, ostracism is less likely to occur in settings where there is adult guidance, structure, and care. Caregivers must make it very clear that ostracism is not allowed and make sure no individual or group profits from ostracizing another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454167">Williams, 2011</xref>). The following strategies are offered as starting points.</p>
<sec id="section3-1053451212454167">
<title>Be attuned</title>
<p>Attunement is being aware of and responsive to another person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212454167">Perry, 2009</xref>). To do this, listen to what adolescents have to say about each other and observe how they interact. Pay special attention to nonverbal cues because they can tell a lot. Remember that ostracism is unlike bullying. Bullies physically abuse their victims, but those who ostracize leave no physical scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007b</xref>). If ostracism is suspected, collect data through observations and questionnaires. Suspect ostracism if an adolescent is seen turning his or her back on a peer who is trying to engage in a conversation, or if a group deliberately ignores someone trying to join in. Also watch for attention and mood changes. Ostracized adolescents ruminate on their situation and feel sad, desperate, or angry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454167">Baumeister et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454167">Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212454167">Wright, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Another way to collect data is with a <italic>socio-gram</italic>, or diagram of group interaction patterns and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212454167">Wolfgang, 2001</xref>). To do this, draw circles on a piece of paper to represent each of the adolescents, then record interactions by drawing a line each time a connection/interaction is made. Record these patterns for a period of time looking for friends, cliques, and isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212454167">Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Providing a way for adolescents to express their views is another way to gain insight. Develop an anonymous questionnaire with open-ended questions like, “Where do you see peers being excluded?” “Whom do you see being rejected?” and “Have you ever been the victim of ostracism?” Answers to these questions can be valuable if adolescents are given the opportunity to complete the survey anonymously and if data are kept confidential. If data indicate ostracism is happening, teachers should be responsive and intervene with the strategies provided later in this column.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212454167">
<title>Empower with language</title>
<p>To prevent ostracism, adolescents need to develop a lexicon that will let them (a) define ostracism, (b) identify it when it happens, and (c) know what to do if it occurs. To do this, teachers can have adolescents develop definitions of ostracism, social exclusion, and rejection; check their ideas for accuracy; and then provide their own examples and nonexamples. Once everyone knows what ostracism is, the students can generate four or five anti-ostracism rules like the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1053451212454167" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Work together</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Respect and include everyone</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reach out to victims</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Report harmful behaviors</p></list-item></list>
<p>Make sure adolescents understand they can report instances of ostracism without embarrassment or repercussions. Ostracism can be prevented, or stopped, if there is a plan and if adults care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212454167">Wright, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053451212454167">
<title>Make recognition a part of the day</title>
<p>Adolescents want approval, so make it a point to know the names of the adolescents and acknowledge each one every day in some small way (e.g., a smile, brief conversation). Respect and acknowledgement are simple preventive measures and well worth the time they take (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212454167">Wright, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451212454167">
<title>Focus on the positive</title>
<p>Affirm the strengths adolescents bring, and believe they can and will do good things. The path to safer, less violent schools lies less in adult control over adolescents than in appreciating their need to control their lives, have an effect on others, not feel invisible, and know and feel others care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454167">Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 2010</xref>). Create ways for adolescents to gain these feelings by having them work on tasks that are meaningful to them (e.g., projects to save the environment, working with homeless children), on tasks in which they have a say; and provide them with opportunities to take age-appropriate risks and show they are responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454167">Leary et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451212454167">
<title>Use literature</title>
<p>Another way to prevent ostracism is with literature. Books with interesting characters allow adolescents to step into a character’s shoes and feel the emotions he or she feels. Entering imaginary worlds improves adolescents’ ability to take another person’s point of view, learn to be empathetic, and understand how important it is not ostracize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212454167">Oatley, 2011</xref>). Offer interesting books to adolescents and discuss these books with them. For example, <italic>The Outcasts</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212454167">John Flanagan (2011)</xref> tells the story of several boys who are cast out of their world. Yet, being ostracized does not stop this crew from banning together and overcoming those who are trying to overpower them. This book helps adolescents understand that it may take courage to battle those who ostracize you, but with persistence it can be done.</p>
<p>Another interesting book is <italic>The Mostly True Story of Jack</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454167">Kelly Barnhill (2011)</xref>. In it Jack feels invisible around his family and peers. As a matter of fact, Jack is so invisible the bullies in his town do not bother him and he has to make up imaginary friends. Jack feels rejected, but when he gets sent to live with his relatives in Iowa, three astonishing things happen. He gets beaten up by the town’s bully; makes real, not imaginary, friends; and becomes the victim of a plot. Thanks to the move, Jack gets recognized, but he has to figure out why. This book contains a twist of fate, and books like it can be used to make adolescents aware of ostracism. Discussion questions to use with books like these include</p>
<list id="list2-1053451212454167" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What challenges did the character(s) face?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What were the character’s reactions?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have you or someone you know, ever been ostracized?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What did you/they do?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can we work together to create a setting where no one feels ostracized?</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451212454167">
<title>Discipline with dignity</title>
<p>To learn and thrive, adolescents need to feel safe and believe that if they make an error, they will be disciplined with dignity in a fair and consistent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212454167">Perry &amp; Szalavitz, 2007</xref>). Harsh discipline that robs an adolescent of self-esteem does no good. Adolescents with learning and behavioral disabilities often struggle to control inappropriate impulses. Misbehaviors need to be stopped, but depending on the level of infraction, there are good and bad ways to do this. Research shows that if reprimands are loud enough so that the entire class hears them, the inappropriate behavior will likely continue or escalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454167">Williams, 2011</xref>). Instead of overtly scolding, teachers can discuss the infraction quietly, calmly, and privately with the student. Adolescents who are allowed to save face will be more likely to think about and rectify what they did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451212454167">Woolfolk, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053451212454167">
<title>Avoid social isolation</title>
<p>Adolescents observe what adults say and do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454167">Schunk, Pintrich, &amp; Meech, 2008</xref>). If adults isolate an adolescent for misbehavior, her or his peers will do the same. Social connections matter to adolescents, and when they are excluded, they feel humiliated and get angry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454167">Dobbs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212454167">Nelson &amp; DeBacker, 2008</xref>). Yet, social isolation or timeout is often used despite the fact that it is one of the most controversial methods for decreasing undesirable behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454167">Kazdin (2008)</xref> noted that punishment of this sort should be used sparingly and always be part of a two-pronged plan that includes (a) enforcing the punishment to suppress the unwanted behavior and (b) providing immediate opportunities for the adolescent to display prosocial behaviors (Santrock, 2008).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-1053451212454167">
<title>Intervening When Ostracism Occurs</title>
<p>Preventing ostracism is key to stopping its harmful effects, but sometimes, despite all efforts, ostracism occurs. Groups that ostracize others can bond with one another and become more cohesive. This often leads to more and meaner episodes (Santrock, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007a</xref>). Most instances of ostracism escalate and do not go away without intervention. When ostracism happens, it is crucial that teachers, clinicians, and caregivers act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454167">Williams, 2007b</xref>). The ideas that follow are potential starting points.</p>
<sec id="section11-1053451212454167">
<title>Encourage interdependence</title>
<p>Social networks are important to adolescents, with friends supplying the companionship and support adolescents need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212454167">Porter, 2000</xref>). If an adolescent is being ostracized, it is important that he or she has opportunities to make new friends. To do this, teachers can create supervised occasions that focus on a meaningful problem-solving task. Cooperative-learning tasks accomplish this through encouraging interdependence. To create cooperative learning occasions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454167">Johnson and Johnson (2009)</xref> suggested the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1053451212454167" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Setting both academic and social objectives, determining the size and composition of groups, defining the assigned tasks, gathering materials, and setting up the room.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Explaining the assignment/task, positive interdependence, group and individual accountability, and criteria for success.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Systematically observing and collecting data on each group as it works. Pay special attention to whose voices are accepted and who is not given a chance to contribute.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intervening when necessary so students now how to successfully complete the task and work effectively in groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evaluating learning and helping students understand how well their group functioned.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1053451212454167">
<title>Encourage creative outlets</title>
<p>Ostracism causes the brain and body to become alert. When ostracism is detected, physiological changes occur (i.e., release of stress hormones, rise in blood pressure, blood flow to outer extremities). If adolescents are being ostracized, encourage them to relieve this stress in positive ways. Journals, drawing, playing music, and exercise are all positive stress relievers (Santrock, 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1053451212454167">
<title>Use online resources and programs to teach social skills</title>
<p>Sometimes both ostracizers and their victims need to develop better communication and social skills. One good resource for this is the <italic>Not in Our School</italic> website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niot.org/nios">http://www.niot.org/nios</ext-link>). It contains videos, lesson plans, and activities educators can use regarding stereotyping, intolerance, and hate. Sample lessons include the following:</p>
<list id="list4-1053451212454167" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Public Art as an Avenue for Respect and Social Justice</italic> is a lesson that uses art as a way for adolescents to learn about diversity, respect and tolerance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Facing History and Ourselves</italic> is a lesson aimed at combating racism, anti-Semitism, and religious prejudice by using history to teach tolerance and the lessening of ostracism in classrooms around the globe. It contains a short video called “Spread the Peace” that shows how students in Massachusetts responded to growing violence in their community.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1053451212454167">
<title>Use literature again</title>
<p>There are many books, like those mentioned earlier, that can be used to prevent ostracism and there are also books that can be used to stop ostracism. For example, <italic>The Sneetches</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454167">Dr. Seuss (1989)</xref> is the story of how the absence of a star on one’s belly causes one to be ostracized. Sneetches with a star on their bellies are part of the “in crowd,” whereas Sneetches without stars are isolated and shunned. This book can be used to make adolescents aware of the painful effects of ostracism. Additional discussion questions include,</p>

<title>Closing Thoughts</title>
<p>The purpose of this article is to make educators, clinicians, and caretakers aware of ostracism, understand why it matters, and learn ways to prevent it and lessen its effects. Understanding ostracism is important because it is a growing problem in schools and because adolescents with disabilities are often the ones feeling its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454167">Twyman et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212454167">2010</xref>). Preventing and stopping ostracism for these adolescents is important because it is so socially and emotionally damaging to them. Ostracism makes adolescents feel unwanted and unloved, and these feelings do little to help them cope with their own cognitive or behavioral challenges. Educators, clinicians, and caregivers must be vigilant and act if ostracism occurs.</p>
