<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Innovation depends on imagination and experience. It also depends on asking “what if” and evaluating possible outcomes. With exponential growth in data volume and advances in computational power, an increasing number of biomedicine’s complex what-if questions are being evaluated using computer-based modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). For example:</p>

</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Although M&amp;S is still in its infancy in biopharmaceutical development and health care management, applications like these demonstrate its potential to expand knowledge at the molecular level, to increase efficiencies in clinical research, and to inform health care policy and decision making.</p>
<p>At present, the biopharmaceutical industry’s most mature application is pharmacokinetic modeling for dose determination. New applications are growing up quickly and the opportunities are enormous. They are based on an explosion of health data, the rapid growth of computational power, and increasingly sophisticated analytic tools that are allowing researchers to ask medicine’s toughest what-if questions.</p>
<p>Driven by biopharma’s need to increase productivity and health care’s need to improve outcomes and reduce costs, M&amp;S is now poised to transform drug development across the entire life cycle of therapeutic innovation, from discovery to commercialization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2168479012471831">
<title>Transformative Power Across Industries</title>
<p>Natural systems can be extremely complex and difficult to understand. Models are created to explain the behavior observed within systems. Models are based on historical observations but are commonly used to look forward to predict a future outcome or state. Models can be either deterministic or probabilistic (stochastic). Simulation is a method that uses a model to test how variability within a system can affect outcomes. In particular, simulations can use more extreme model inputs than have been previously observed to help understand the range of future potential outcomes. In this way, simulation can be used to better characterize risk and identify opportunities to optimize outcomes.</p>
<p>M&amp;S practice evolved to solve problems that could not be addressed using direct observation and measurement. The classic example comes from atomic physics. In 1946, researchers at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory needed to determine the distance neutrons would be likely to travel through various materials. Stanislaw Ulam solved the problem using a mathematical model and simulating a succession of movements by millions of particles in what he called the Monte Carlo method. Today, computer-based mathematical models and simulations are advancing such diverse fields as physics, chemistry, engineering, economics, meteorology, and even musical composition.</p>
<p>Enabled by supercomputing, M&amp;S has become a transformative tool for innovation in industries like aeronautics. To reduce development costs for their 1903 flyer, the Wright brothers modeled and tested wing shapes in a wind tunnel. A century later, 800,000 simulation hours on the Cray Supercomputer replaced most physical prototypes in the design of the 2003 Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Computer-based M&amp;S reduced the number of prototype wings tested from 77, for the earlier Boeing 767, to only 11, for the Dreamliner, which is acknowledged as an important advance in aircraft design.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479012471831">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In meteorology, computer-based atmospheric models and simulations now predict events from localized tornadoes to global atmospheric movements. In 2011, the modeled path of Hurricane Irene was constantly adjusted until landfall, after which Irene followed the M&amp;S-predicted track up the East Coast. IBM’s “Deep Thunder” simulation not only delivers precise forecasts up to 3 days ahead of time but also predicts possible storm damage to municipal or business infrastructure to provide “personalized” forecasting.</p>
<p>In financial modeling, behavioral models use simulation to quantify the tradeoffs between quantifiable risks and returns. Models take into account financial and business variables, and then simulations present a range of possible outcomes used to make business decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2168479012471831">
<title>Biopharma Modeling and Simulation: Barriers and Progress</title>
<p>Biopharma lags behind other industries in its application of M&amp;S. Despite important advances in clinical trial designs and technologies, today’s drug development remains an inefficient, high-risk enterprise with poor predictability. The biopharmaceutical industry cannot sustain its present business model of high development costs and low product yield. New tools and approaches are urgently needed to make research more informative and efficient.</p>
<p>Inefficiencies in drug development are due in large measure to the fact that the scientific underpinnings of so many aspects of therapeutics, the nature of disease, and the biological systems in which they act are still unknown. One of the objectives of clinical research is to “discharge risk” through the controlled study of investigational medications using rigorously designed experiments that yield insight into the true effect of medicines on individuals and populations. M&amp;S can help developers better plan and design these experiments by exploring and quantifying risks prior to clinical trials.</p>
<p>M&amp;S can help to optimize the clinical development process—and improvements cannot come too soon. The FDA confirms that clinical trials are growing in size and duration, trending toward databases of 5000 subjects.<sup>

</p>
<p>Solutions through computer-based drug discovery and development have been a dream for decades. What if we could screen potential drugs in virtual biosystems? What if we could learn more about therapies via virtual patients? What if we could accurately predict health outcomes and costs in real-world medical practice? Three barriers have limited progress toward these goals: the vast complexity of biological systems; the lack of data on a population level; and the reluctance of drug developers to invest in approaches with uncertain regulatory outcomes. Now these barriers are beginning to fall.</p>

<title>Data, Data Everywhere</title>
<p>An explosion of data—from gene banks to electronic health records—is facilitating the construction of models. Evaluation of real-world drug effects and health outcomes has been hampered by the lack of population-level data. This deficiency is now being overcome by data from large observational databases and surveillance systems such as FDA’s Sentinel System. Sentinel expects to access data from 100 million patients by 2012.<sup>

<title>Regulatory Support</title>
<p>In the 2004 report that launched the Critical Path Initiative, the FDA cited M&amp;S as an important opportunity to improve drug development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2168479012471831">19</xref>
</sup> In 2009, the agency issued its <italic>Guidance for Industry: End of Phase 2A Meetings</italic>, which encourages use of “trial simulation and quantitative modeling of prior knowledge to design trials for better dose response estimation and selection.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2168479012471831">20</xref>
</sup> The UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises drug sponsors that “probabilistic analyses are preferred.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2168479012471831">21</xref>
</sup> In November 2011, US and EU regulators met with industry representatives to share ideas about how best to use M&amp;S in drug development.</p>
<p>Regulatory support is having a significant impact. At FDA, the number of new drug applications using M&amp;S has increased 6-fold in 10 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479012471831">2</xref>
</sup> A 2011 review of 198 submissions between 2000 and 2008 reported not only that M&amp;S is influencing regulatory decisions but also that FDA is using M&amp;S to extend clinical findings and guide additional clinical testing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2168479012471831">22</xref>
</sup> Dramatic regulatory endorsements include FDA’s initiatives to develop open-use models for drug and medical device developers: one is aimed at predicting species-specific variations in liver toxicity as a means to improve dosing decisions; another will enable device developers to preevaluate devices such as hip and knee joints.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479012471831">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This changing landscape sets the stage for life cycle M&amp;S to play a major role in revolutionizing therapeutics and health care delivery. Twenty-first century medicine is advancing on two frontiers of knowledge: deeper understanding of causality and broader understanding of real-world outcomes. M&amp;S is an essential tool in both arenas and can increase connectivity between drug development insights and drug impact in real-world medical practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2168479012471831">
<title>Deeper Knowledge: Role of Modeling and Simulation in Understanding Relationships in Biology</title>
<p>Expanding knowledge at the molecular level is increasing understanding of biology and disease processes. Resources are growing in massive genetics databases such as the US National Institutes of Health’s GenBank, which currently holds more than 680,000 nucleotides and 606 gene sequences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2168479012471831">23</xref>
</sup> Research surrounding genetic linkages, proteomics, and cellular lineages and environments is generating a new definition of disease as a constellation of changes in an individual’s network of genes, proteins, and biochemical pathways.</p>
<p>This is giving rise to new therapeutic approaches that focus on more individualized intervention at the molecular level. Targeted therapeutics rely on biomarkers to identify specific patient populations that experience increased safety and effectiveness. One example is the breast cancer drug Herceptin, which targets the HER2 gene variant found in about 25% of breast cancer patients. Biomarkers and pharmacogenomics strategies make it possible to develop drugs like Herceptin whose therapeutic effects are masked in the broad population but seen clearly when targeted to specific subpopulations.</p>
<p>Gene therapy, stem cell therapy, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering are no longer futuristic ideas but clinical realities. In just one 2011 example, virologists used zinc finger nucleases—which act as molecular scissors to snip out bits of DNA—to create human stem cells that lack the CCR5 receptor necessary for HIV to invade CD4 immune cells. In mice, the engineered stem cells are giving rise to HIV-resistant immune cells, suggesting a strategy for a functional cure for AIDS.<sup>

</p>
<p>In discovery and early-stage development, computer-based M&amp;S is playing an ever greater role in advancing and using knowledge at the molecular level in lines of research ranging from systems biology to drug screening.</p>
<sec id="section8-2168479012471831">
<title>Systems Biology</title>
<p>Computational modeling is a core discipline in the emerging field of systems biology, which has the potential to produce a new paradigm in drug discovery. Systems biology integrates huge volumes of molecular and genetic information with large-population clinical data sets to create predictive models of disease and biological systems. Simulations can then bring to life the what-if questions posed by researchers and be used to assess potential results based on a range of assumptions. The resources required for these models are so large that some are being created by consortia for open use in a “precompetitive” research space. One example is the $6.7 million partnership between Sage Bionetworks and the National Cancer Institute to build computational models to predict breast, colon, liver, and pancreatic cancer.<sup>

<sec id="section9-2168479012471831">
<title>Genetics</title>
<p>Computer-based modeling is helping to identify potential drug targets. In one example—the largest multiple sclerosis genetics study ever attempted—a research consortium compared DNA from more than 9700 patients with multiple sclerosis to that of 17,300 healthy controls and identified 29 new genetic variants that are associated with susceptibility to the disease. Modeling principles pointed researchers to genes related to the immune system, including 2 involved in vitamin D metabolism.<sup>

<title>Drug Screening</title>
<p>Increasingly sophisticated computer models are identifying better development candidates faster. The Cresset Group, for example, has developed multidimensional modeling software that models compound interactions. In a recent project, a Cresset model screened a virtual database of 3.8 million compounds to generate 500 “hits” for candidates that could inhibit an enzyme targeted for obesity therapy.<sup>

<title>Broader Knowledge: Role of Modeling and Simulation in Understanding Outcomes</title>
<p>Spanning drug discovery, drug evaluation, and real-world drug use, life cycle M&amp;S applications will increase with the availability of health data. Observational and health-transaction databases will collect and quantify real-world health and treatment experience, generating data that can be used to model everything from disease screening programs to medication adherence. Sophisticated analytics will be used to ask what-if questions at the population level. Simulations will test-run interventions and treatment options to predict outcomes and guide health policy, not only to address therapeutics but also to understand and increase positive health behaviors.</p>
<sec id="section12-2168479012471831">
<title>Team-Based Approach</title>
<p>M&amp;S requires the creation of a multidisciplinary team that includes key stakeholders in the development program. This team determines the objectives of the M&amp;S exercise and determines the models, assumptions, and prior information used for the simulation inputs. To investigate the sensitivity and robustness of the conclusions, it is recommended that a team evaluate several data generation models representing optimistic, pessimistic, extreme, and “real-world” opinions about the drug effect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2168479012471831">26</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2168479012471831">27</xref>
</sup> In cases in which little is known about a drug or class of drug, M&amp;S can use subjective model inputs by applying an appropriate elicitation process to translate team members’ beliefs about uncertain quantities into probability distributions.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2168479012471831">29</xref>
</sup> Uncertain quantities might include expected and extreme rates of adverse events that should be considered; expected and less likely dose-response relationships that should be modeled; and expected outcomes for subjects who discontinue a study early.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2168479012471831">
<title>Simulating Trials</title>
<p>The beginnings of M&amp;S-informed trial design, therapeutic evaluation, and health care policy can be seen in current applications of simulated clinical trials aimed at predicting health outcomes and comparing alternative interventions. Researchers now are modeling clinical trial populations by matching subject characteristics and inclusion and exclusion criteria. One advantage is that simulated trials can model and incorporate clinical trial subjects’ adherence to study drug—a factor that has major impact on results but often is not sufficiently considered—to achieve better predictions of likely outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2168479012471831">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Trial simulations are being used to support team decisions regarding study design. Traditional approaches can be sufficient to guide the design of a trial when a treatment’s safety and efficacy profile is well known. However, if there is uncertainty—as is often the case—the team can simulate a likely range of safety and efficacy profiles and run trials <italic>in silico</italic> to explore advantages and disadvantages of possible trial designs. Simulation results then can be evaluated by the whole clinical development team.</p>
<p>There are also M&amp;S approaches, such as the simulated trials offered by the health care modeling company Archimedes Inc, that enable researchers to refine clinical trial strategy by elucidating the impact a drug is likely to have in real-world use—for example, the impact on long-term health outcomes and on health system utilization. This is becoming increasingly important within the clinical-commercial convergence arena to guide development decisions that maximize both the therapeutic and commercial value of biopharma company assets.</p>

<sec id="section14-2168479012471831">
<title>Predicting Health Outcomes</title>
<p>M&amp;S offers a promising tool to predict drug safety and to evaluate the impact of various interventions on health outcomes in real-world medical practice. For example, a recent simulated trial of a modeled Medicare population compared a variety of health interventions to learn which had the greatest impact on cardiovascular and diabetes outcomes at 3 time points—in 10, 20, and 30 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479012471831">31</xref>
</sup> Interest in such applications is growing. For example, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is expanding government use of health care modeling to forecast quality and cost outcomes. HHS recently contracted with Archimedes to make modeling tools available to government agencies to conduct large-scale analyses of treatment effectiveness and health care spending.<sup>

<title>Informing Health Policy</title>
<p>M&amp;S can provide predictive evaluations of cost-effectiveness necessary to guide health policy and improve health care value and delivery. The attraction of M&amp;S for the payer is that it can provide estimates of cost that reflect the numerous uncertainties pertaining to real-life outcomes and costs. For example, researchers in Ireland conducted a health technology assessment that modeled and simulated outcomes to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various options for a colorectal cancer screening program.<sup>

<title>Development/Commercial Convergence</title>
<p>For the biopharma industry, M&amp;S can help bridge the needs of drug development and commercialization. Better decisions are needed to guide the selection of drug candidates for development based on a host of factors surrounding potential benefit, long-term outcomes, risk, cost-effectiveness, and the competitive environment. M&amp;S can evaluate tradeoffs and inform product portfolio decisions aimed at maximizing the commercial value of drug products.</p>

<p>In drug development, the most advanced M&amp;S application is the use of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data for dose modeling. PK/PD modeling has been streamlining clinical trials for a decade, has proved its value, and has won widespread industry and regulatory support.</p>
<p>Identifying the optimal exposure-response relationship for a drug is the single most important thing to get right in drug development: If the exposure is too high, the result is toxicity; if too low, the drug fails to achieve effectiveness. Suboptimal dosing is a major challenge in drug development. A 2002 study of 499 new molecular entities approved by the FDA between 1980 and 1999 found that 1 in 5 of those evaluable (354) required dosage changes after introduction; 4 of 5 changes were reductions for safety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2168479012471831">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Traditionally, exposure (ie, the relationship between dose and concentration) is determined in a series of phase I single- and multiple-ascending dose (SAD and MAD) trials conducted in stages over a period of 9 to 12 months. The range of exposures determined in phase I can then inform phase II dose selection for patient testing to get an initial characterization of the exposure-response relationship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2168479012471831">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>PK/PD dose modeling has dramatically improved the costly, time-consuming, and often imprecise process of dose selection. PK/PD data from preclinical and phase I research are used to build mathematical models of drug actions in the body. Simulations of drug effects at different dosage levels are used to select optimal doses for clinical testing. Models are iteratively adapted and improved as more data are acquired, beginning with preclinical data and advancing with data derived from first-in-human SAD and MAD studies continuing through phase II/III.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2168479012471831">20</xref>
</sup> This is often referred to as the “learn-and-confirm” cycles of M&amp;S.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2168479012471831">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In traditional clinical development, clinical pharmacologists concerned with PK/PD analysis had limited input into designing trials and analyzing results. Recognizing the importance of PK/PD modeling, more drug developers are incorporating this discipline into their M&amp;S teams to leverage early data and improve decision making downstream. In phase II, M&amp;S can test assumptions to gain insight into the potential impact of drug exposure on efficacy end points. In therapeutic categories such as oncology and central nervous system (CNS), where correlations between exposure and end points are not well defined, PK/PD modeling can help to affirm or reject the suggested relationship.</p>
<p>Simulations also can test assumptions regarding the impact that biomarkers have on clinical outcomes. For example, if a cancer biomarker is assumed to be highly predictive, what is likely to be its relationship with tumor growth? Then in phase III development, population PK/PD data can be modeled to predict dose adjustments for target populations, including obese patients, patients with impaired liver and renal function, children, the elderly, and ethnic groups, using a population-based approach.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2168479012471831">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Population PK/PD models incorporate covariates that are often helpful in guiding dose adjustments in the package labeling. Population PK/PD models typically are used in cases where dosing needs to be adjusted for weight (eg, enoxaparin, heparin, and fondaparinux), renal function (gentamicin and vancomycin), and cytochrome P450 genotype-related drug-drug interactions.</p>
<p>A powerful example is FDA’s use of existing PK/PD data from clinical evaluation of the influenza drug peramivir to model and simulate a safe, effective pediatric dose. Peramivir had never been tested in children. To make therapy available during the 2008 H1N1 flu epidemic, FDA approved the intravenous pediatric dose based solely on the simulation. Results from later pediatric trials confirmed the simulated outcomes.</p>
<p>The power of PK/PD M&amp;S to predict safety is also evident in QT modeling and E14 analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2168479012471831">38</xref>
</sup> FDA now expects to see concentration QT analysis as a part of any thorough evaluation of the cardiac safety of noncardiac drugs. Such analysis may also be required in the future for additional therapeutic areas, such as CNS drug evaluation.</p>

<title>Biopharma’s Growing Practice</title>
<p>Industry faces some significant challenges in the broader adoption of M&amp;S. Models and simulations take additional time to develop, add cost to lean research budgets, and often require special technology and expertise. In addition, regulators frequently require thorough and careful prespecification for the use of models and simulations. Despite the great potential of M&amp;S applications, biopharma has been slow to embrace them—especially those beyond PK/PD modeling that are less familiar.</p>
<sec id="section19-2168479012471831">
<title>Capabilities and Costs</title>
<p>Necessary capabilities include expertise in clinical pharmacology (eg, pharmacometricians); biostatisticians with experience in both study design and operational optimization; access to data, together with proficiency in data set programming; M&amp;S software; computing power; and technical support. In some cases, external data must be purchased. M&amp;S software can be expensive. For example, the yearly per-seat license for one widely used trial simulator can cost as much as US$40,000. However, significant changes are underway as more applications move to less costly open-source software, such as The R Project and Open Bugs.</p>
<p>Costs vary widely depending on the application. For example, the project cost of developing a population PK/PD model to guide dose adjustment for a target population typically ranges anywhere from US$100,000 to US$500,000. Although large biopharmas have resources to develop capabilities in-house, small and medium-sized companies may have to rely on external providers for M&amp;S analyses.</p>
<p>M&amp;S-related services are becoming more affordable, however, and growing experience with M&amp;S is demonstrating cost savings. The cost of computing is decreasing. For example, a recent simulation project using R at Quintiles was conducted in the Microsoft Azure cloud on 1000 cores, reducing computational time from 2 months to less than 1 hour, for less than US$1200. Pfizer cited savings of US$100 million in 2007 based on the company’s Enhanced Clinical Trial Design Initiative to reduce phase II and phase III trial costs. Pfizer demonstrated savings from smaller dose-response studies where power calculations were based on dose-response models instead of pairwise comparisons, in addition to conducting interim analyses and stopping trials early for futility.<sup>

<title>New Ways of Working</title>
<p>M&amp;S practice requires more profound collaboration, breaks down traditional research silos, and reduces reliance on intuition and experience in favor of data-driven decision-making processes. To implement well-informed M&amp;S, it is necessary to leverage data and knowledge across previously isolated departments and operations. When integrating PK/PD modeling, for example, clinical pharmacologists (who have extensive mechanistic knowledge of drug action) work closely with biostatisticians (who have expertise in trial design and clinical efficacy analysis) and with trial clinicians (who have extensive knowledge of the disease, patients, and clinical operations) to determine the most advantageous study design. M&amp;S improves the decision-making process by quantifying problems and providing a common basis for informed interdisciplinary discussion and assessment. In addition, M&amp;S provides opportunities for regulatory expertise and commercial thinking to be incorporated much earlier into the development process. Application of M&amp;S testing and analysis adds work at each developmental step, but the resulting improvement in incremental decisions leads to more efficient allocation of resources and greater likelihood of successful outcomes.</p>

<title>Regulatory Expectations</title>
<p>The FDA and other regulatory agencies have embraced “model-based drug development”—the use of preclinical and available clinical data to create pharmacostatistical models of efficacy and safety—as an important tool to improve development knowledge, processes, and decision making across the full spectrum of drug development. In the 2009 <italic>Guidance for Industry: End-of-Phase 2A Meetings</italic>, FDA encouraged sponsors to seek regulatory meetings to discuss clinical trial simulation and quantitative modeling as a means to make more informed decisions about trial design and dose selection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2168479012471831">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A report from the Pharmacometrics Division of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation Research (CDER) cites a dramatic increase in the number of new drug applications that include M&amp;S, as well as an increase in the impact of M&amp;S on FDA decisions. The agency uses increasingly sophisticated PK/PD models, together with patient characteristics, to guide decisions on labeling, safety and effectiveness for approval, and requirements for and design of additional studies.</p>
<p>FDA is developing its own models and simulations for open use to speed development and evaluation processes. Computer Models for Human Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI-sim) is an FDA-industry collaboration to build models that can predict species differences in liver toxicity. DILI-sim models will help distinguish between drugs that have the same toxic liver effects in humans and animal models such as mice and drugs that may be safe in one or more nonhuman species but not in humans. Development of the agency’s Antiviral Information Management System will include an automated tool for modeling and trial simulation linked to a database of hepatitis C and HIV clinical trials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479012471831">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Regulatory leadership is influencing the industry’s increasing use of M&amp;S. A 2010 survey of 10 large and midsize biopharma companies found that M&amp;S is achieving broad applications in early and late phase development, where it is significantly influencing corporate decisions. Responder companies expected to increase their applications of all types of M&amp;S, especially in PK/PD exposure response, study design simulation, and disease progression.<sup>

<title>Realizing the Potential of Modeling and Simulation</title>
<p>With data resources, computational power, and regulatory positions now coming into alignment, life cycle modeling and simulation is poised to enable the expansion of knowledge-based drug design and evaluation. Experts suggest that full realization and exploitation of computational models and simulations could reduce the overall cost of drug development by as much as 50%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2168479012471831">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These advances will require new ways of working—a breaking down of traditional silos and a transition to interdisciplinary operations. Throughout drug development and across the broader health care arena, drug innovators, providers, payers, and policy makers will use M&amp;S to collaborate in efforts to improve patient outcomes and control costs. Experts from diverse fields must come to the table with data and knowledge to frame questions and quantify assumptions for testing. Such M&amp;S-informed collaboration will undoubtedly enrich drug development and lead to better, more informed decision making.</p>
