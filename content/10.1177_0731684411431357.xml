<p>Experimental and numerical characterizations of sandwich materials are required to fully exploit the benefits offered by these materials and efficiently design them. In this study, the flexural behavior of resin-infused composite sandwich structures was investigated. Panels with two different polyvinylchloride foam densities and thicknesses were studied. The S-2 glass fabric face sheets were resin-infused and bonded to the core in a single-step process using epoxy resin. Sandwich beams machined from the panels were subjected to three- and four-point bending tests. Finite element-based simulations predicting the flexural response of the sandwich panels were performed and compared with experiments. Excellent agreement in finite element-predicted failure loads and experiments were observed.</p>

<p>Composite sandwich structures have been used extensively for aerospace, marine, and ground vehicle applications due to their high specific strength and stiffness, high shock resistance, and resistance to corrosion. Polymeric foams derived from materials such as polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyurethane, polyethylenterephtalate, and expanded polystyrene slabs are gaining attention as the core material for sandwich structures for a variety of applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411431357">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684411431357">3</xref></sup> A wide range of characterization and resulting properties of sandwich structures are possible, depending on the materials used, their configurations, and testing schemes. An experimentally validated simulation-based approach can eliminate the costly trial-and-error experiments and can be used as a design tool for such complex materials and structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684411431357">4</xref></sup> Such an approach is being implemented in this study with respect to the flexural behavior of sandwich structures.</p>
<p>Although extensive research has been devoted to the flexural behavior of composite laminates, the flexural behavior of sandwich structures is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684411431357">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684411431357">8</xref></sup> In this context, considerable work describing the static flexural behavior of sandwich beams has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684411431357">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684411431357">11</xref></sup> It is commonly agreed that the failure of a sandwich structure can occur through several damage mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684411431357">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684411431357">17</xref></sup> such as (1) skin compressive/tensile failure, (2) core shear failure, (3) delamination, i.e., skin-core de-bonding, (4) local skin wrinkling, and (5) core indentation. One of the main issues limiting the accurate modeling of the sandwich structures is the intrinsic anisotropy and the non-homogeneity of the sandwich structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684411431357">18</xref></sup> This issue can be overcome by conducting detailed experimental characterization and accurate modeling. Additionally, it is reported that the presently available data on mechanical properties necessary to allow a correct and reliable design of complex sandwich structures are not sufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684411431357">18</xref></sup> One way to address this issue is to develop and implement experimentally validated simulations. A limited number of critical experiments are performed and computational simulations that accurately and realistically model the behavior of the components are created. These simulations are validated by the experiments, and then can be used as a design tool to extrapolate the experimental matrix. The use of this approach is attempted in this study and the developed simulations are compared with actual experimental response.</p>
<p>Considerable work on theoretical and numerical analysis of sandwich panels exists and is well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684411431357">18</xref></sup> Also, the failure modes of sandwich beams under static<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684411431357">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684411431357">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684411431357">20</xref></sup> and cyclic loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684411431357">21</xref></sup> have been investigated. The numerical models that study the progressive collapse of the sandwich structures have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684411431357">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684411431357">24</xref></sup> The data reported in the literature show a large variation depending on the type of materials used, material and experimental configurations, parameters sought, and applications. Nevertheless, it is commonly agreed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684411431357">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684411431357">24</xref></sup> that the accuracy of the simulations depends on the realistic modeling and accurate properties of the constituents. Hence, the simulations performed in this study use experimentally characterized material properties and are compared with experimental flexural responses of the various experimental tests.</p>
<p>In this study, sandwich panels created with foams having two different densities and thicknesses were studied. Additionally, the thicknesses of face sheets (skins) were varied depending on the core thicknesses and the test setup as per ASTM C-393 requirements. Finite element-based simulations using experimentally characterized material properties were used to study the flexural behavior of the VARTM-infused composite sandwich panels. The details on materials, vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) infusion, sample preparation, testing schemes, simulations, and results are provided in the following sections. Overall, experimentally validated simulations can be used to predict the performance of novel sandwich panels beyond the existing experimental data, and hence as an efficient design tool.</p></sec>

<p>The reinforcement used for the face sheets was <italic>Owens Corning</italic> ShieldStrandS, S2-glass plain weave fabric with areal weight 818 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The core material comprised <italic>DIAB</italic>® Divinycell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684411431357">25</xref></sup> non-porous H130 and H250 PVC foams with thicknesses 25.4 and 12.7 mm, respectively. The distribution medium was AIRTECH Advanced Materials Group Resinflow 60 LDPE/HDPE blend fabric.

<sec id="sec4-0731684411431357"><title>Resin infusion</title>
<p>The sandwich panels were fabricated using VARTM. A steel mold (609.6 mm × 914.4 mm) with point injection and point vent was used to fabricate 304.8 mm ×609.6 mm sandwich panels. A schematic of the VARTM layup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684411431357">Figure 1</xref>. The number of layers of glass fabric in each face sheet depends on the thickness of foam core. For 25.4-mm thick foam panels, four plies of glass fabric were used on both the face sheets, but for the 12.7-mm thick foam, only two plies on each side were used according to design criteria specified in ASTM C-393.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684411431357">26</xref></sup> Two layers of resin distribution medium were used over the top face sheet and only one layer of distribution was used under the bottom face sheet. This was done to equalize the resin infiltration times for the top and bottom face sheets, resulting in uniform flow and reproducible manufacturing of the panels. After the materials were placed, the mold was sealed using a vacuum bag and sealant tape. The mold was then infused under vacuum with a pressure of 1 atm. The resin-infused sandwich panel was cured in a convection oven at 60°C for 2 h and post-cured at 94°C for 4 h.

Both three- and four-point flexural tests were conducted on panels containing both H130 (25.4 mm thickness) and H250 (12.7 mm thickness) foams. A schematic of three- and four-point flexural tests are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684411431357">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>The flexural testing was performed on MTS Insight 100 material testing workstation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684411431357">Figure 3</xref> shows the experimental setup for both three- and four-point tests. All the supports and loading bars used cylindrical pivots, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684411431357">Figure 4</xref>. The test setup consisted of a base comprised of a steel beam with a T-slot that allowed movement of support blocks to vary the span. The support block holds 12.7 mm diameter steel bars (cylindrical pivot) that allow free rotation of the specimen at the loading and support points. Rubber pressure pads were used on the flat steel loading block to prevent any local failures at the face sheets. The rubber pads having a Shore A durometer of 55 and thickness of 3 mm were glued to the loading block to prevent slipping. The loading and support bars were 75 mm long, equaling the width of the test specimens. A laser extensometer was used to measure the midspan deflection of beams.

<p>The test specimens were carefully placed on the support bars to ensure that the loading was symmetric and that the sample was level. The test was performed at a loading rate of 6 mm/min and data were recorded at a sampling rate of 2.5 Hz. An average pre-load force of (100 N) was initially applied to ensure that the loading bar was also level and symmetric with the test specimen. The specimens were tested until failure occurred. The flexural stiffness was then calculated as per procedure described in ASTM standard D 7250.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684411431357">28</xref></sup></p></sec></sec>

<p>Micross® automatically generates the finite element mesh for the assembled sandwich panel corresponding to the loading and the boundary conditions. The mesh consists of hexahedral elements for the core and shell elements for the facing sheets. The core and facing elements share the same nodes at the interface. The interaction at the interface is simply tied and does not include sliding conditions or cohesive zones. The models had approximately 3200 elements with an average element size of 5 mm. Also, the failure theories to predict skin failure used based on maximum allowable stresses and global failure theories used based on Tsai-Wu, Tsai-Hill, and Azzai-Tsai-Hill theories are in-built in the software to predict the failure loads, stress/strain states, and the locations of failure. In this study, the flexural response corresponding to the experimental tests were simulated. Hence, four cases were simulated: (a) three-point bending with 12.7 mm H250 foam, (b) three-point bending with 25.4 mm H130 foam, (c) four-point bending with 12.7 mm H250 foam, and (d) four-point bending with 25.4 mm H130 foam. The peak loads at failure and the flexural response were compared with experimental values.</p></sec>

<p>Six specimens were tested in three-point bending for each type of core. The only acceptable modes of failure were compressive facing failure due to bending on the top or tensile facing failure due to bending on the bottom. The applied load vs. deflection data sets for successful tests corresponding to the panels with H250 foam cores are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684411431357">Figure 5</xref> along with a photograph of a representative failed specimen.

As expected, the H130 response was found to be different compared to H250 foam core panel. The curve was linear until an average applied load of 6 kN and then tended to become non-linear due to core crushing as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684411431357">Figure 6</xref>. This is mainly attributed to a low density of H130.

<p>The flexural behavior of sandwich panels corresponding to various experimental tests was simulated. For brevity, the comparison and discussion of predicted flexural response from the simulations and experiments are reported only for the four-point bending cases. A similar analogy applies for the three-point cases. Nevertheless, for the sake of completion, the peak flexural loads from all four cases are reported. The software used to perform the numerical simulations (Micross®<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684411431357">29</xref></sup>) allows three mesh-refinement levels: (coarse (~1000 elements), standard (~3000 elements), and fine (~9000 elements).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684411431357">29</xref></sup> Initial mesh-refinement study revealed that the results from standard and fine meshes agreed well both in terms of capturing the failure mode and the load-carrying capacity. All the following simulations followed standard mesh-refinement and were found to agree well with experiments.</p>

The loading and boundary conditions are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684411431357">Figure 10</xref>. Similar images for longitudinal strains and stresses were obtained for the other cases and they are not shown here for brevity purposes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684411431357">Figure 11</xref> compares the predicted flexural response with experiments for the sandwich beams subjected to four-point bending. An excellent agreement between experiments and simulations was observed throughout the complete flexural response for sandwich panels with H250, 12.7-mm foam thickness. This agreement was not observed for the case of H130, 25.4-mm foam beams, wherein good agreement was found only in the linear regime. At applied loads near the ultimate, the simulation predictions deviate from the experimental response. This was expected as the simulations were performed with linear elastic properties for both the core and the facing sheets, thereby resulting in a linear response. In reality, at loads near the ultimate, complex mechanisms such as local shear deformations in the foam and micro-cracking contribute to softening and increase in the total displacements. Similar results have been reported by Feldhusen et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731684411431357">32</xref></sup> thereby supporting the results in this study. Also, the core used in the 25.4-mm H130 beams is less dense than the 12.7-mm H250 foam, causing higher non-linear deformations in the core. Nevertheless, the simulation-predicted failure type (face sheet) and peak loads agreed well with the experimental values.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684411431357">Figure 12</xref> compares the experimental and predicted ultimate failure loads for the various sandwich beams studied in this study. The simulation-predicted failure loads agreed well with the experimental ones. Also, the numerical predictions were slightly higher than the experimental ones for all cases except for the case of sandwich beams with 25.4 mm core subjected to three-point bending. In this case, the failure was caused by excessive deformation of the core. Experimental observations revealed that the deformation in the core-induced local buckling of face sheet followed by compressive failure of the face sheet. These complex interactions including non-linear deformations of the core are currently not simulated. Models that address these issues will eliminate the discrepancy observed and further increase the accuracy of the simulations. Overall, the simulation predictions agreed well with experiments in both the failure loads and modes of failure. These experimentally validated simulations can be used to further extrapolate the results beyond existing experiments. Also, the experimentally validated simulations can be used as a design tool and eliminate the costly trial-and-error approach of developing efficient structural sandwich panels.

<sec id="sec11-0731684411431357" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>An integrated experimental and numerical program was carried out to evaluate the flexural properties of foam core composite sandwich panel resin-infused by a single-step VARTM process. The flexural behavior for sandwich panels with two different core thickness and foam-densities were studied using three- and four-point bending tests. Finite element models simulating the tests were performed using accurate material properties for the cores and facing sheets. Results revealed excellent agreement between simulations and experiments in predicting failure loads. A wide range of characterization is possible depending on the constituents, material layout/configuration, and testing schemes. Hence, experimentally validated simulations that successfully predict both the failure mode and the capacity, such as the ones developed in this study can be used as a robust design tool to predict the properties of sandwich beams beyond the experimental matrix and to develop efficient, novel structural sandwich composites. Similar approach can be extended to other structural materials and components.</p></sec>
