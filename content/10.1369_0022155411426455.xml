<abstract>
<p>Pig models of cystic fibrosis (CF) have recently been established that are expected to mimic the human disease closer than mouse models do. The human CLCA (originally named <italic>chloride channels, calcium-activated</italic>) member hCLCA4 is considered a potential modifier of disease severity in CF, but its murine ortholog, mCLCA6, is not expressed in the mouse lung. Here, we have characterized the genomic structure, protein processing, and tissue expression patterns of the porcine ortholog to hCLCA4, pCLCA4a. The genomic structure and cellular protein processing of pCLCA4a were found to closely mirror those of hCLCA4 and mCLCA6. Similar to human lung, pCLCA4a mRNA was strongly expressed in porcine lungs, and the pCLCA4a protein was immunohistochemically detected on the apical membranes of tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells. This stands in sharp contrast to mouse mCLCA6, which has been detected exclusively in intestinal epithelia but not the murine lung. The results may add to the understanding of species-specific differences in the CF phenotype and support the notion that the CF pig model may be more suitable than murine models to study the role of hCLCA4.</p>

<p>The complex mechanisms of disease in cystic fibrosis (CF, mucoviscidosis) are still poorly understood, and specific therapies that target the basic genetic defect are currently out of reach. With the recent generation of porcine CF models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155411426455">Rogers, Stoltz, et al. 2008</xref>), these aims may be achieved more easily because CF pigs develop all hallmark features of human CF, including developmental changes in the respiratory tract and lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155411426455">Meyerholz, Stoltz, Namati et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155411426455">Meyerholz, Stoltz, Pezzulo et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155411426455">Stoltz et al. 2010</xref>). Thus, the porcine CF model may have numerous advantages when compared to the murine models, which are far less than optimal to mimic the complex human CF pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155411426455">Scholte et al. 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>CLCA proteins, originally named <italic>chloride channels, calcium-activated</italic>, mediate a constitutively expressed endogenous chloride current when heterologously expressed in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155411426455">Loewen et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155411426455">Hamann et al. 2009</xref>). Some of these proteins, including the human hCLCA2, are anchored to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155411426455">Elble et al. 2006</xref>), whereas others are secreted, non-transmembrane proteins, including the human hCLCA1, the murine mCLCA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155411426455">Gibson et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155411426455">Mundhenk et al. 2006</xref>), and the porcine pCLCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2009</xref>). A modulatory role has been discussed for several CLCA proteins in human CF and murine models of CF. The human <italic>hCLCA1/hCLCA4</italic> gene locus acts as a modifier of residual anion conductance in rectum biopsies of CF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155411426455">Ritzka et al. 2004</xref>), and a <italic>hCLCA1</italic> allelic variant is associated with the severity of the intestinal CF phenotype in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155411426455">van der Doef et al. 2010</xref>). A modulatory role has also been demonstrated for their murine orthologs. Experimental overexpression of the murine ortholog to hCLCA1, mCLCA3, ameliorates the intestinal pathology of CF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155411426455">Young et al. 2007</xref>). Furthermore, mCLCA6, the murine ortholog to hCLCA4, is coexpressed with the murine CFTR protein in non–goblet cell enterocytes and possibly interacts with CFTR-associated pathways in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155411426455">Bothe et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Several CLCA members have been discovered in different species, including human, mouse, pig, rat, cow, horse, and dog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155411426455">Cunningham et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155411426455">Gandhi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155411426455">Gruber, Elble, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155411426455">Gruber, Gandhi, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155411426455">Gaspar et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155411426455">Loewen et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411426455">Anton et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411426455">Jeong et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411426455">Loewen and Forsyth 2005</xref>). Although the family is highly conserved in mammals, there are significant species-specific differences in the genomic structures and tissue expression patterns of direct CLCA orthologs. For example, the human gene cluster consists of four members, whereas there are eight murine <italic>CLCA</italic> genes instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155411426455">Patel et al. 2009</xref>). Recently, we reported that the porcine <italic>CLCA</italic> gene locus consists of five distinct <italic>CLCA</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2009</xref>). As an additional example for species-to-species variation, the human hCLCA1, the murine mCLCA3, and the porcine pCLCA1 are direct orthologs belonging to one phylogenetic cluster and are expressed in mucus-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155411426455">Gruber, Elble, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155411426455">Gruber, Gandhi, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411426455">Agnel et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155411426455">Leverkoehne and Gruber 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2009</xref>). However, there are major differences in their tissue and cellular expression patterns. Neither hCLCA1 nor mCLCA3 has been found in the pancreatic or salivary ducts, the gall bladder, or the common bile duct despite strong expression of pCLCA1 in the respective porcine tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155411426455">Gruber, Elble, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155411426455">Leverkoehne and Gruber 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411426455">Loewen et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2009</xref>). In contrast, pCLCA1 has not been detected in the genital tract, whereas the mCLCA3 protein was found in uterine goblet cells and hCLCA1 RNA was detected in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411426455">Agnel et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155411426455">Leverkoehne and Gruber 2002</xref>). Interspecies variance is also obvious when comparing the expression patterns of the murine mCLCA5 with that of its human counterpart hCLCA2. The latter was localized to the basement membranes of basal epithelial cells, whereas mCLCA5 was detectable in keratohyalin granules of squamous epithelia only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155411426455">Connon et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155411426455">Braun et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Species-specific differences in the anatomy, physiology, and expression patterns of relevant proteins are of prime interest for characterizing and interpreting animal models. For example, in a direct comparison of human, murine, and porcine CFTR proteins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155411426455">Ostedgaard et al. (2007)</xref> identified important differences among the three species in the processing of this protein. Several mouse models have been intensely characterized, and the murine phenotype of CF is overall dominated by the intestinal disease. Neither lung disease nor fibrotic lesions of the pancreas typically seen in human CF patients are present in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155411426455">Davidson and Rolfe 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155411426455">Scholte et al. 2004</xref>). Furthermore, interspecies variations have been observed in several other models of human diseases, including murine models for the characterization of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022155411426455">Zitnik et al. 1997</xref>) and in studies on osteogenesis and tissue engineering of bone from murine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155411426455">Pereira et al. 2009</xref>). In recent years, pigs have emerged as promising models for human diseases, due to the excellent comparability of their anatomy and the biochemical and genomic organization largely shared between humans and pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155411426455">Rogers, Abraham, et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The porcine CF model may also become important to identify and study modifier genes, particularly those that may play a role in modulating pulmonary CF. Knowledge on their expression patterns in the pig and interspecies variances will be indispensable for interpreting CF in the pig. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize the genomic organization and protein processing, as well as mRNA and protein expression patterns, of pCLCA4a—the porcine ortholog to the putative human CF modifier hCLCA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155411426455">Ritzka et al. 2004</xref>). We then compared key characteristics potentially relevant for CF with the human and murine orthologs hCLCA4 and mCLCA6, respectively.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic Characterization of the pCLCA4a Genomic Structure in Comparison to hCLCA4 and mCLCA6</title>
<p>Exon–intron structures of the human, murine, and porcine CLCA orthologs were compared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2009</xref>). In brief, recently identified sequences from porcine bacterial artifical chromosomes CH242-148M17 and CH242-483E7 were aligned with the mRNA sequence of the human hCLCA4 by BLAST search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi</ext-link>). Exon structures of the pCLCA4a were identified by their analogy to the described structure of hCLCA4 (GenBank accession no. NM_012128.3) and to the structure of mClca6 (GenBank accession no. NW_001030737) as well as the structure of the splice donor and acceptor sites in the porcine bacterial artifical chromosome sequences.</p>

<title>Cloning and Sequencing of pCLCA4a</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from a porcine jejunal sample using the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, including a digestion with DNase I (Qiagen). In sum, 750 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed (IScript; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA) at 25C for 5 min, 42C for 30 min, and 85C for 5 min. PCR primers were designed (GenBank accession nos. CU694822 and CU469041) to amplify the open reading frame of pCLCA4a (upstream 5′-GAAAAGCCTCAACAAG-3′; downstream 5′-ATTTKATGAATGATC-3′). High Fidelity Polymerase (Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany) was used for PCR amplification (1.5 units per 25 µl of reaction). PCR conditions were 10 cycles of 94C for 3 min, 94C for 30 sec, 44C for 30 sec, and 68C for 3 min 20 sec and 25 cycles of 94C for 30 sec, 44C for 30 sec, 68C for 3 min 20 sec, with a time increment of 10 sec per cycle and a final extension at 68C for 10 min. PCR products were controlled for specificity by endonuclease digestion with restriction enzymes <italic>Eco</italic>RV and <italic>Hind</italic>III (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>T-addition to the <italic>Eco</italic>RV-digested and linearized pcDNA3.1 expression vector and A-addition to the pCLCA4a open reading frame were performed using GoTaq Flexi DNA Polymerase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and 10 mM dTTP or dATP, respectively (Invitrogen) in the presence of 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min at 70C.

Two oligopeptides were synthesized per immunogenicity prediction, one located in the amino-terminal cleavage product of pCLCA4a (p4a-N-1, corresponding to aa 355–368, DLIQITGSNERDKL) and one located in the predicted carboxy-terminal cleavage product (p4a-C-1, corresponding to aa 866–879, EADYTPDDSHPDPG). Oligopeptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for standard immunization of two rabbits each. Preimmune sera were collected before immunization and used as control in the immunodetection experiments. The four antisera obtained were designated p4a-N-1a, p4a-N-1b, p4a-C-1a, and p4a-C-1b.</p>

<title>Immunoblot Analyses and Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>HEK293 cells were transiently transfected as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2009</xref>). Twenty-four hr after transfection, the cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 2% glutamate for 5 hr. Medium was removed, and cells were lysed on ice in 100 µl of standard lysis buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% DOC, 0.5% Triton X-100) and supplemented with protease inhibitor tablets (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). To remove cellular fragments, medium samples were spun at 2,400 × g for 5 min at 4C, the pellet discarded, and the cell culture supernatant spun at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4C. The second supernatant was ethanol precipitated overnight at −20C, spun at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4C, and pellets were resuspended in 100 µl of standard lysis buffer. All tissue samples were homogenized in 1 ml of standard lysis buffer as described above using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (peqlab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Forty µg of tissue lysates were subjected to immunoblot analyses.</p>
<p>Medium and lysate samples were boiled in standard 3-fold SDS-PAGE Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Subsequent electroblotting onto PVDF membranes was followed by blocking the membranes in 1× Roti-Block (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 1 hr at room temperature. The membranes were probed at 4C over night with anti-pCLCA4a antibodies p4a-N-1b or p1-C-1a, the preimmune sera, or the specific antibodies preincubated with their respective peptides as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2010</xref>). Briefly, antibodies were preabsorbed using 20 µg/ml of the respective specific peptides or an irrelevant peptide for 1 hr at room temperature under vigorous shaking. Specific and control antibodies were diluted 1:5000. Membranes were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 hr, and protein labeling was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). In a second step, membranes were stripped using stripping buffer (1.5% w/v glycine, 0.1% w/v SDS, 1.0 v/v Tween 20, pH 2.2) for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently probed overnight with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) diluted 1:100,000 at 4C.</p>
<p>pCLCA4a-transfected HEK293 cell lysates and medium were immunoprecipitated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155411426455">Mundhenk et al. 2006</xref>). In brief, after preclearing of medium and cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich), the protein was precipitated using either the anti-carboxy-terminal antibody or the anti-amino-terminal antibody diluted 1:1000.

<p>Tissues were either fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde for 24 hr and embedded in paraffin or shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80C. Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut at 3-µm thickness, mounted on adhesive glass slides, and dewaxed in xylene, followed by rehydration in descending graded ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was performed using either 15 min of microwave heating (600 W) in 10 mM citric acid, pH 6.0, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 or a pretreatment with protease (AppliChem, Darmstadt) for 10 min at 37C, as well as both methods combined. Frozen tissues were cut at 5-µm thickness, mounted on adhesive glass slides, and stored at −80C until further use. Cryostate sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min, rinsed in PBS for 10 min, and peroxidase blocked as described above. The slides were washed in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 20% normal goat serum for 30 min. Slides were incubated overnight at 4C with anti-pCLCA4a antibodies, preimmune sera, or antibodies that had been preincubated with 50 µg/ml of the corresponding peptides or an irrelevant peptide, respectively. Antibody dilutions ranged from 1:500 to 1:10,000 with optimal results for 1:2000 for p4a-N-1b and 1:1500 for p4a-C-1a. Sections were washed repeatedly in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 hr with biotinylated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:200. Color was developed by incubating the slides with freshly prepared ABC solution (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA), followed by repeated washes and exposure to DAB (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ascending graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped. Consecutive sections from each tissue sample were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Each of these experiments was repeated at least two times.</p>

<title>Genomic Structures of pCLCA4a, hCLCA4, and mClca6</title>
<p>Species-specific differences in genomic structure and variability of genes are of prime importance when animal models are used for studying CF. Comparison of the exon–intron structures of pCLCA4a and its orthologs in humans and mice revealed a common structure consisting of 14 exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411426455">Fig. 1</xref>). Regular open reading frames are present in all three orthologs, with minor differences in total protein lengths. While the pCLCA4 protein contains 927 predicted amino acids, the hCLCA4 protein is 917 amino acids long and mCLCA6, 924. Gaps in the amino acid sequence alignment were found in the terminal exons, resulting in differences in the leader peptide in exon 1 as well as the carboxy-terminus in exon 14. Both regions of the protein also show relatively low homology within the three species as well as to other CLCA4 orthologs in different mammals (data not shown). In contrast, the other regions of the protein representing 88% of the total alignment revealed high amino acid homologies to hCLCA4 and mClca6, 76.8% and 71.2%, respectively. The rate of similarity is 87.8% to hCLCA4 and 84.7% to mClca6. All exon–intron boundaries are conserved, including a rare GC-splice donor site at the 3′-end of exon 4. The functionality of this exon–intron structure is supported by the presence of a GC-donor site carboxy-terminally to exon 4 in the horse, dog, cattle, mouse, rat, man, macaque, and marmoset (data not shown).</p>

<title>Generation of Antibodies and Protein Characterization by Cellular Transport and Glycosylation Assays</title>
<p>A common feature of all known CLCA proteins is their posttranslational cleavage of a precursor protein into a larger amino-terminal and a smaller carboxy-terminal product at about aa 700 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155411426455">Patel et al. 2009</xref>). Thus, two different antibodies were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411426455">Fig. 2</xref>), one directed against an epitope within the predicted amino-terminal segment (p4a-N-1b) and one directed against an epitope within the predicted carboxy-terminal segment (p4a-C-1a). The antibody directed against the amino-terminal cleavage product (p4a-N-1b) recognized a 130-kDa precursor protein and a 110-kDa amino-terminal cleavage product on immunoblots of cell lysates from pCLCA4a-overexpressing HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411426455">Fig. 3</xref>, upper panel). The antibody directed against the carboxy-terminal cleavage product (p4a-C-1a) also recognized the 130-kDa precursor protein and two carboxy-terminal cleavage products of approximately 52 kDa and 40 kDa in the cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411426455">Fig. 3</xref>, bottom). Preincubation of the antibodies with their respective peptides used for immunization abolished the specific protein bands on the blots but no unspecific protein bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411426455">Fig. 3</xref>, right panels).</p>

The amino-terminal cleavage product was also detected in the supernatant (medium). The anti-carboxy-terminal antibody p4a-C-1a detected the precursor molecule and two different carboxy-terminal cleavage products of approximately 52 and 40 kDa in the cell lysate, whereas no specific bands were detected in the supernatant.

</fig>
<p>To date, CLCA proteins can be classified into one of two classes: first, fully secreted proteins, with both cleavage products being secreted by the cell; second, partially secreted proteins, with the amino-terminal protein being released by the cell and with the carboxy-terminal fragment remaining associated with the plasma membrane via an integral transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155411426455">Patel et al. 2009</xref>). The classification of the CLCA proteins into different classes is important to draw conclusions about their possible functions as signaling molecules, components of the mucus, or transmembrane proteins possibly interacting with adjacent cells. In this study, the pCLCA4a 110-kDa amino-terminal fragment was detectable in only the supernatant by the amino-terminal antibody, whereas the carboxy-terminal cleavage products were undetectable in the supernatant of transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411426455">Fig. 3</xref>), thereby suggesting that pCLCA4a belongs to the group of membrane-associated and only partially secreted CLCA proteins.</p>
<p>To further corroborate a carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain, we performed computational analyses on the predicted amino acid sequence of pCLCA4a. The SignalP 3.0 software identified a single hydrophobic, amino-terminal, cleavable signal sequence, most likely between aa 20 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411426455">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, all six programs used for transmembrane prediction consistently predicted one carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain between aa 885 and 912 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411426455">Fig. 2</xref>, gray box). The DAS program revealed an additional transmembrane domain between aa 617 and 627. For prediction of N-linked glycosylation sites within the pCLCA4a protein, we used the NetNGly software, which identified eight consensus glycosylation sites at aa 74, 85, 282, 337, 501, 533, 829, and 834, with six located in the larger amino-terminal part of the protein and two in the smaller carboxy-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411426455">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Cellular transport assays of the murine ortholog to pCLCA4a, mCLCA6, have previously identified a cleavage of the CLCA precursor protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by a transport of the cleaved products through the Golgi apparatus where they become complex glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155411426455">Bothe et al. 2008</xref>). To test whether pCLCA4a is processed and transported similarly, the cell lysate and medium of pCLCA4a-transfected HEK293 cells were treated with the endoglycosidases endo H and PNGase F, respectively, and immunoblotted using either the anti-amino-terminal or the anti-carboxy-terminal antibody. In the cell lysate, the 130-kDa precursor protein was sensitive to endo H and PNGase F, resulting in a reduction in size by approximately 15 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411426455">Fig. 4A</xref>, left panel). Obviously, the precursor protein has not passed the Golgi and is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum as an immature glycoprotein with high-mannose-type glycosylation. For the amino-terminal cleavage product, a small proportion was found to be endo H sensitive, but the major part was sensitive to only PNGase F. The amino-terminal cleavage product detected in the medium was sensitive to PNGase F only, consistent with a secreted protein of complex glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411426455">Fig. 4B</xref>, left).</p>

<p>The anti-carboxy-terminal antibody (p4a-C-1a) detected a 130-kDa precursor protein sensitive to endo H and PNGase F and thus confirmed the data obtained with the antibody p4a-N-1b (not shown). The 40-kDa carboxy- terminal cleavage product was reduced to a 34-kDa fragment by endo H and PNGase F, indicating that this cleavage product was mannose-rich glycosylated, located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the 52-kDa carboxy-terminal cleavage product was sensitive to PNGase F treatment only and shifted to a 34-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411426455">Fig. 4C</xref>, left panel). Obviously, this cleavage product is a complex glycosylated form that has reached the Golgi apparatus. Thus, the cellular transport of pCLCA4a appears similar to that of its murine ortholog mCLCA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155411426455">Bothe et al. 2008</xref>).

<p>Immunohistochemical analyses using the two antibodies, p4a-N-1b and p4a-C-1a, yielded virtually identical results for all tissues and animals tested. Despite different antigen retrieval methods and different antibody dilutions, the pCLCA4a protein could not be detected on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Hence, all experiments were conducted on cryostate sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155411426455">Fig. 6</xref>). Both antibodies generated against either the predicted amino-terminal cleavage product (p4a-N-1b) or the predicted carboxy- terminal cleavage product (p4a-C-1a) resulted in identical staining patterns, indicating strict colocalization of both cleavage products. Strong and consistent staining for the pCLCA4a protein was observed with both antibodies in the apical membranes of non–goblet cell enterocytes of the enteric villus tips throughout the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155411426455">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155411426455">B</xref>). Specific staining was not observed in the deep crypt cells or in any of the large intestinal segments.

Staining of bronchial smooth muscle cells was considered unspecific because virtually identical staining was observed with the preimmune sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155411426455">Fig. 6F</xref>). This assumption was supported by a similar staining of smooth muscle cells in other organs independent of any pCLCA4a mRNA detection—for example, in the small intestine or the urinary bladder (not shown). In contrast to that in the intestinal tract, the pCLCA4a protein was detected in non-goblet and goblet cells of the respiratory epithelium. No protein was detected in the alveolar walls, the interstitium, serosal linings, or lymphatic tissues of the lungs. The submucosal glands were either unstained by immunohistochemistry or showed unspecific background that was also present in sections incubated with preimmune sera or after precincubation of the specific antibodies with the antigenic peptide (not shown).

Even after immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from organs that had a specific signal in immunohistochemistry, no specific bands were detected by either of the antibodies used, despite clear and consistent bands after immunoprecipitation of pCLCA4a-overexpressing HEK293 cells (not shown).

<p>Of additional interest is the comparison of the pCLCA4a protein expression with that of the porcine CFTR protein. In fact, the respiratory cellular expression pattern of pCLCA4a is virtually identical to that of the porcine CFTR protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2010</xref>). A modulatory role of pCLCA4a in the pathogenesis of the CF respiratory disease or other diseases of the respiratory tract is therefore conceivable. Furthermore, a recently published study of CF pig models that carry the common CFTR-Δ508 mutation revealed a partial transport of the porcine CFTR protein to the respiratory apical membrane, resulting in a residual CFTR conductance of 6% compared with the wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155411426455">Ostedgaard et al. 2011</xref>). Despite this residual conductance, these pigs develop the characteristic intestinal and lung disease. It would be of prime interest to compare the localization and quantity of pCLCA4a in the CFTR<sup>Δ508/Δ508</sup> pigs with a wild-type control group. Future studies are needed to examine differences in the expression pattern of pCLCA4a in these promising new animal models of CF and to investigate a possible functional or regulating interaction between the mutated pCFTR protein and pCLCA4a.</p>
<p>In contrast to the respiratory tract, the cellular expression patterns of pCLCA4a and pCFTR in the intestine appear to be slightly different. Both proteins are expressed in enterocytes, but the pCFTR protein has been found predominantly in the crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155411426455">Plog et al. 2010</xref>), which fail to express the pCLCA4a protein. The consequences of this partially overlapping expression patterns will have to be addressed in future studies on the pig model of CF.</p>
<p>Interestingly, pCLCA4a exhibits a broader tissue expression pattern on the mRNA level than on the protein level. In contrast to strong mRNA expression in the stomach, large intestine, eye, and uterus, no pCLCA4a protein was detected in these tissues. A similar discrepancy has been reported for other CLCA members. For example, the murine mCLCA5 mRNA was found in the corneal epithelium without detectable protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155411426455">Braun et al. 2010</xref>). As a possible explanation, a posttranscriptional regulatory event preventing protein synthesis in specific tissues might be responsible. Alternatively, a lower sensitivity of the immunohistochemical assay must be taken into account, compared to the highly sensitive RT-PCR. It is important to note that the pCLCA4a protein was only detectable on cryostate sections but not on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues in light of the fact that immunohistochemistry on cryostate sections is generally known to be more sensitive. The pCLCA4a protein may therefore be undetectable in tissues with low protein abundance using immunohistochemistry. The lack of pCLCA4a detection on immunoblots of whole tissue lysates supports this notion.</p>
<p>In terms of its genomic structure, protein structure, and protein processing, the porcine pCLCA4a is very similar to its human und murine orthologs. The genomic structure of the <italic>pCLCA4a</italic> gene did not significantly differ from its human und murine orthologs. The number of exons and their distribution indicate a close synteny among the three species. Similar to its murine ortholog mCLCA6, the pCLCA4a protein can be assigned to the CLCA group of heterodimeric glycoproteins of which only the larger amino-terminal subunit is secreted by the cell, whereas the smaller carboxy-terminal subunit is anchored to the plasma membrane by an integral transmembrane domain. In this regard, pCLCA4a is similar to its murine ortholog mCLCA6. Also similar to mCLCA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155411426455">Bothe et al. 2008</xref>), the protein is cleaved within the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cleaved protein products reach the Golgi apparatus, where they become complex glycosylated. Unfortunately, experimental data on the protein processing of the human hCLCA4 are not available to date. However, in silico analyses of its amino acid sequence argue that hCLCA4 can also be assigned to the group of CLCA proteins with a transmembrane domain (data not shown). Thus, with respect to the cellular protein processing and structure, there seem to be no considerable differences between pCLCA4a and its human and murine orthologs.</p>
<p>In summary, the genomic organization, overall protein structure, and protein processing of pCLCA4a appear to be similar to its human and murine orthologs hCLCA4 and mCLCA6, respectively. However, considerable species-specific differences exist in their tissue and cellular expression patterns, with closer homology of the lung expression of pCLCA4a to the human hCLCA4 than to the murine mCLCA6. This argues that the novel porcine CF model may be more suitable than CF mouse models for studying the proposed modulatory role of hCLCA4.</p>
