<abstract>
<p>This qualitative study presents a retrospective analysis of how a cohort of young men, who as boys were assigned to residential care in Malta, perceive the citizenship education that they received while ‘in care’ as having empowered them – as boys, adolescents, and eventually as young adults. Rather than focusing on citizenship education that is derived from formal schooling, this study is focused on analysing the meaning that the participants attributed to experiences of daily living at the care home alongside the cooperative activities that were organized for them by the staff so as to enable them to learn about one another, share responsibilities, and develop feelings of group-solidarity among themselves. The study thereby explores whether the participants see themselves as having an increased repertoire of social competencies, including cooperative decision-making and the ability to forge effective interpersonal relationships, as a result of their being in care. Using an ecosystemic approach, it looks into how other related agents of socialization including their schooling also had a bearing on their lives. The study uses interviews and focus groups to give the particpants a ‘voice’ in describing reality as they perceive and understand it. It shows that, to provide meaningful citizenship education to vulnerable, at-risk children and young people, it is important that they are provided with skills and opportunities to share personal stories and events with one another, and to support each other’s growth. Since boys in care can be extremely conscious that they are in care, this implies that effort needs to be made to help them foster greater links with the outside community, particularly with their family, friends and other adults. It is therefore recommended that young people in care are given opportunities to develop greater self-confidence as this would allow them to promote greater cohesion among themselves and empower them to be more agentic and proactive in wider society.</p>

<title>The context</title>
<p>This study focuses on appraising the long-term influence of citizenship education on a cohort of young men who, as boys, were in residential care, thereby enhancing our understanding of the influence of educational processes imparted in residential settings. It relies on young people’s retrospective accounts of how being in care enabled them to develop their social skills, forge trustful relationships, act respectfully towards others, handle conflict effectively, deal with such challenges as those presented by schooling, adopt a healthy approach to their school-to-work transition (or related transitions) on reaching the compulsory school-leaving age of sixteen, and cope with life’s sometimes irreconcilable demands as they approached their adult years. The study thereby falls within the wider ambit of emotional literacy, which is often regarded as integral to citizenship education. Since there are families all over the world that fail to meet the socio-behavioural, emotional, educational, or safety needs of their children (including families with parents or caretakers who are abusive or grossly negligent), residential care provision for children and young people is widespread. Possibly aligned to this, out-of-home care has attracted much scholarly and policy attention in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477878512437459">Daining and DePanphilis, 2007</xref>) and has become a subject of interest to social pedagogists, teachers, lecturers in further and higher education settings, and child welfare practice personnel world-wide.</p>
<p>Previous research on children and young people in care has focused on the negative aspects of the provision of care, including the undesirable influences of deviant peers and the separation of children and young people in care from their families and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477878512437459">Lee and Barth, 2009</xref>). It has also focused on revealing how these children and young people generally originated from homes that tend to be disadvantaged by multiple socio-economic deprivations and how they had a poor start educationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477878512437459">Crozier and Barth, 2005</xref>). Other areas on which such research has been concentrated are those of the poor academic outcomes of children served by the child welfare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477878512437459">Hair, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477878512437459">Yu et al., 2002</xref>) and the inability of child welfare services to meet children’s and young people’s needs effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477878512437459">Barth, 2005</xref>). Broadly speaking, these studies tend to be characterized by deficit-based, needs-based, or risk-based perspectives.</p>
<p>Conversely, the current study focuses on the strength-based narratives of children and young people in care, and on how these narratives have been consolidated by the citizenship education imparted at the residential home to which they had been assigned during their growing-up years. Moreover, since there is a relative dearth of qualitative studies that focus on extrapolating and presenting the views of young people directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477878512437459">Hyde and Kammerer, 2009</xref>), this study contributes to existing literature on the subject by offering an empirical exploration of the participants’ reality as they perceive and describe it. Borrowing insights from self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477878512437459">Ryan and Deci, 2000</xref>), the study also focuses on exploring how, as boys, the participants developed their inclinations and interests over time, and how, as young people subject to ‘the complex interactional, intellectual and situated processes that constitute learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477878512437459">Ball et al., 2000</xref>: 9), their strength-based narratives came to be co-created with staff and with other boys during their childhood and adolescence – alongside inputs from other agents of socialization.</p>
<p>The residential set-up on which this article focuses is St Patrick’s Home in Malta. It offers residential care to boys who are between nine and sixteen years old. St Patrick’s Home is run by the Salesians, a Roman Catholic religious order. Its staff is constituted of both ‘religious’ (priests and brothers) and ‘lay’ personnel. The lay personnel are employed by the Salesians in order to help in the running of St Patrick’s Home. They are generally qualified in child care, youth work, or related areas of practice. Most of the boys at St Patrick’s Home attend St Patrick’s School, which is located in the same building. St Patrick’s School is a specialized school that offers tuition to boys who are poor achievers academically, or, who for some reason, are particularly disruptive in a mainstream school setting. St Patrick’s School is also run by the Salesians. Alongside the boys in St Patrick’s Home, the school accepts day students who are seen to merit the special attention that it gives its students. Since many of the boys in care at St Patrick’s Home present educational problems, this school is particularly suited to attending to their educational needs and requirements. While it is indeed difficult to pinpoint a generalized reason why boys in care tend to underperform at school, this tends, most commonly, to be attributed to their disruptive pasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477878512437459">Vacca, 2008</xref>). The boys who do not attend St Patrick’s School but are resident at St Patrick’s Home essentially fall into two categories. The first of these categories consists of boys who show clear academic promise, and who thereby benefit more from attending schools where the curriculum is more academically demanding. The second category is made up of boys who were already attending other schools before they were assigned to St Patrick’s Home, and where it is thought that a change of school would be a disruptive experience for them. In practical terms, attending a school outside the precincts of St Patrick’s is enabled by Malta’s small size geographically – the whole island is only just over 300km<sup>2</sup>; no school is too far away for the boys to attend.</p>
<p>Just as the staff at St Patrick’s Home try to ensure that a child’s schooling is not interrupted, they insist on continuity of care. It is unusual for a boy to be transferred from St Patrick’s to another (residential) home once he has been placed there. This is in stark contrast to what sometimes happens, for instance in the UK, where young people may have to change homes, sometimes at critical stages of their lives or schooling. This may arise from the requirements of the home – rather than the needs of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512437459">Aldgate, 1994</xref>). However, it is also possible for a child in Malta to change homes particularly when younger, either as a result of management exigencies (as in the UK) or, as is most often the case, because children are placed in different homes according to their age. Unlike the situation in countries such as the UK, where the majority of children entering care for the first time do so after the age of fourteen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512437459">Allen, 2003</xref>), those in Malta would more commonly have spent most of their childhood and adolescence in care.</p>
<p>The languages spoken in Malta are Maltese, which is considered the national language, and English, which although seen by most Maltese nationals as a ‘foreign’ language is also recognized legally as an official language, and acknowledged to be so in the country’s Constitution. While certain Maltese people speak English as a first language, the overwhelming majority speak Maltese. However, the distinction is somewhat blurred as the vast majority of Maltese people are bilingual. How well people communicate in either or in both of these languages differs among different socio-economic groups. The middle and upper classes are the most likely to be conversant in both languages. The lower classes generally speak Maltese only. This is either because they cannot understand English well or because they feel most comfortable speaking in Maltese and thereby lack practice in speaking and communicating in English. Maltese people who do not speak English tend to be at a disadvantage in the local schooling system since many textbooks are in English. Moreover, particularly at a higher level of study, there is a very narrow selection of textbooks that are written in Maltese. The relatively small size of the population may result in a restricted market for such books and may also bring about a situation where it is not cost-feasible to update them as often as necessary. Added to this, certain subject-specific words from English do not occur in the Maltese lexicon.</p>
<p>Since Maltese is the language most widely spoken at St Patrick’s Home, this possibly reflects both the working-class background of many of the families-of-origin of the boys and the everyday usage of Maltese as the primary language of communication in residential care settings in Malta. However, some boys have a better mastery of English than others, depending on the extent to which they have learnt it at school or elsewhere. This can be evidenced by a number of boys having furthered their education at a post-secondary school level after leaving St Patrick’s Home. They would have to know English to obtain the requisite school-leaving examinations to satisfy the entry requirements for these courses. It is practically impossible to pursue further studies in Malta without having an adequate knowledge of English. A particular context in which English came to be used as a language of communication at St Patrick’s Home was when boys from asylum-seeking families in Malta were sent to live there and the Maltese boys needed to speak to them. These children came from countries that were at war and where English tended to be spoken to some degree by the foreigners, even though it was not their native language.</p>
<p>Apart from dealing with the language issue, the staff needed to make a concerted effort to ensure that <italic>all</italic> the boys, both Maltese and asylum seekers, experienced a home-like atmosphere. For this to ensue, they had to generate an atmosphere of ‘care’ wherein every person would feel significant and valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477878512437459">Spiteri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477878512437459">Spiteri and Zammit, 2011</xref>). Owing to the age of the boys and young people who were residing at the Home, this could only be achieved if healthy and growth-inducing discipline was used.</p>
<p>Generally, this balance between care and discipline not only stemmed from the overall manner in which the Home was coordinated and run, but also through engaging the boys in sharing responsibilities and in developing feelings of group solidarity. This active engagement of the boys in their own learning was achieved by organizing cooperative activities for them on a regular basis, an approach which is consistent with the ideals of Father John Bosco (a Catholic priest, writer, and educator of the nineteenth century, who founded the Salesian Order). Father Bosco was a strong proponent of promoting contexts through which young people could acquire pertinent social skills while making others increasingly central in their lives. Father Bosco insisted that children and young people, particularly if they came from poor or socio-deprived backgrounds, needed not only to be loved but to know that they are loved. In many ways, he could be said to have founded his religious order on this one essential tenet from which he developed a so-called preventive system of education based on involving young people in pro-social activity and industry.</p>
<p>The reasons why some Maltese children end up in care are many and various. Some come from homes where there is persistent poverty and high socio-economic deprivation, something that is neither particular to Malta, nor restricted to current social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477878512437459">Mapstone, 1968</xref>). Others come from homes where the parent or parents, though willing to bring up their children, are unable to do so, generally for reasons of severe or chronic ill-health, which at times also serves as a trigger for poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477878512437459">Spiteri and McKay, 2008</xref>). Such children are also likely to be vulnerable to multiple deprivations. Others are brought into care by means of a care order following the intervention of social workers, normally after the children have suffered neglect or abuse inflicted on them by their parents, guardians, or other family members.</p>
<p>Given that children may be brought into care at different phases of childhood and adolescence, and that they each have their own character, individuality, and exhibit different degrees of agency in different ways, it can be clearly seen that young people who are in care are not a homogeneous group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477878512437459">Forrester, 2009</xref>). This carries a number of implications for when they leave care. Primarily, they may not all manage to acquire the same level of psychological adjustment while in care. This can be for different reasons: some may be more disposed to certain mental illnesses including post-traumatic stress related disorders (most likely related to the reasons they are in care in the first place) and some may be more emotionally or intellectually disadvantaged (or advantaged) than others.</p>
<p>Other influencing factors are whether they see themselves as having had a relatively stable looked-after experience or a traumatic time while in care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512437459">Allen, 2003</xref>). Changes in the care workers and the priests – who over time are transferred to different duties, assigned to further studies, or engage in programmes of personal and spiritual development (sometimes away from Malta), or who resign – can further compound the ‘rootless’ feeling that the boys may experience at St Patrick’s Home. Moreover their period in care ends in a somewhat arbitrary manner, as on turning sixteen these young people, in common with looked-after young people in other European countries, are forced to face a ‘premature and abrupt . . . self-sufficiency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477878512437459">Daining and DePanphilis, 2007</xref>:1158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477878512437459">Forrester, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477878512437459">Osgood et al., 2005</xref>). This implies that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477878512437459">Biehal et al. (1994)</xref> point out, the ages at which young people who have been in care are expected to manage to live independently ‘contrasts strongly with the patterns of household formation for the . . . population more generally’ (241). Consequently, there is a risk that they may be vulnerable to unemployment and being homeless. They might also be exposed to certain peer pressures where, particularly at a young age, they may be easy prey for being enticed into crime, drug-abuse, or participation in other illegal or anti-social behaviour, which risks bringing about long-lasting (or even life-long) consequences, particularly if it has a negative impact on their physical or mental health.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477878512437459">Forrester (2009)</xref> points out that it is difficult to replace the care and support that is offered by a family within the care system, since care is not seen as a system of family support for those with long-term issues. He therefore advocates a shift in perception that would not only involve the care system but also ‘our whole approach to services for vulnerable families’ (211). This would necessitate further long-term resources being developed for care leavers. While Forrester’s recommendation needs to be seen in the light of policy perspectives, fostering arrangements that accompany the boys’ stay at St Patrick’s Home sometimes subscribe to this ‘long-term care provision perspective’. This is because, even though there is nothing obliging foster parents to offer assistance to a child when he becomes an adult (the government offers foster carers benefits until the fostered young person turns eighteen), certain foster carers do so. In such cases, they usually see the young men they fostered as family members.</p>
<p>As much as possible, arrangements are made for all the boys at St Patrick’s Home to be fostered, although different fostering arrangements could be in place, where some foster carers would be assigned more time with the boys than others. Generally speaking, however, foster parents would be asked to look after the boys on weekends or during the official school holidays. While the intention is to create, as closely as possible, a family-like setting for the boys, some may have more successful foster-care placements than others, depending on how well they get on with their foster families, and also on how responsive the families are to their needs.</p>
<p>While some foster parents care for young people past the age of eighteen, other foster placements are terminated prematurely. This type of termination could occur for a number of reasons. These include foster parents wishing to opt out of the fostering process, the death or illness of one or both foster parents, and the young person failing to fit in the ‘new’ family structure and thereby coming to be assigned to a different foster placement. (This would be after relevant assessments and other formalities are made by social workers to determine why the first placement ‘failed’ and to decide how best to proceed.) An important consideration that remains to be mentioned in this context is the relationship that the boys establish with their natural or (as they sometimes refer to them in order to explain themselves) their ‘biological’ parents. Even though some of the boys visit their (natural) parents at home or the parents come to see their son(s) at St Patrick’s Home, these visits are usually rarer than those by foster parents. However, some of the boys go to live with their natural parent(s) on turning sixteen. Some live with another close relative (possibly a grandparent, uncle or aunt), and some live independently, usually through finding work and renting a place to stay. A small number live in other residential homes in Malta. These residential homes cater for older men (generally people who are homeless and do not have the financial means to rent accommodation elsewhere). One of these homes is also run by the Salesian Order. Where the boys end up living is influenced by a range of factors such as if they have relatives who are willing to put them up, or if they have the desired skills and motivation to work and can carry on with their lives more or less ‘independently’ and succeed in doing so.</p>
<p>The physical structure of St Patrick’s Home is unlike a ‘home’ as normally thought of in everyday life. It remains reminiscent of the institutions that characterized the early twentieth century when the complex in which it is located was constructed. It has long corridors and dormitory-sized rooms. In the mid-1990s, efforts were made to de-institutionalize the home as much as possible, for instance, by erecting partitions between beds so that it did not appear that the boys were sleeping in dormitories. Despite these efforts, overall the building still reflects the style of architecture and internal layout of rooms that prevailed in institutionalized settings in an earlier time. As a result, the building may be seen as conveying mixed messages. On the one hand, it tends to be seen by the boys as not a home but merely somewhere they were sent to live for a short period of their lives. On the other hand, based as it is on a Salesian philosophy, it is structured on the clear norms, values, and expectations characteristic of religious institutions, and it promotes specific, substantive ideas of what is the apt, correct and good thing to do and to strive for.</p>
<p>It is most likely that the overall message thereby transmitted is that the boys are in a ‘process’ of being prepared for adult life while at St Patrick’s Home. This ‘process’ is associated with a sense of movement and flux which is induced by their knowing that in the space of a few short years they will be moving out of St Patrick’s Home to live elsewhere. The way in which the staff at St Patrick’s Home prepare the boys for this ‘process’ is by providing a type of moral education that is framed in socio-religious discourse. Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477878512437459">Willems et al. (2010)</xref> point out that ‘being a good citizen can be seen as part of being a good person’ (217), likewise, the boys at St Patrick’s are taught that how they behave toward one another reflects their disposition towards themselves and also their relationship with God, and that their relationship with God is not only something that lasts for a lifetime but for eternity. This is why pictures of Father Bosco are seen hanging prominently on the wall in different sections of the St Patrick’s complex.</p>
<p>This study finds that, while none of the participants makes any direct reference whatsoever to Salesian philosophy, nonetheless, the different issues that they bring up are all influenced by the Salesian ethos which promotes both the boys’ thinking for themselves and their leading a life which is built on Christian values. These issues include how they express autonomy through seeking to be independent in managing their own lives and how they aspire to participate in sports or in other social activities in order to feel involved and connected to a wider society. It is also evident that their years in care helped them to generate self-confidence and the ability to be responsive to others, as is discussed below.</p>

<title>Research method</title>
<p>The research undertaken adopts a qualitative methodology and employs a phenomenological approach that is based on the ‘discovery, description and meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477878512437459">Osborne, 1994</xref>: 168) of people’s lived experiences. It provides an in-depth analysis of the boyhood experiences of a cohort of young men who lived at St Patrick’s Home, and what impact this had on their acquiring an effective citizenship education that they could then apply after leaving care. The article is informed by the ‘new sociology of childhood’ which presents children and young people as social actors who both shape and are shaped by their circumstances and related factors that impinge on their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477878512437459">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477878512437459">James and Prout, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The study was conducted by recruiting eleven Maltese young people who had lived at St Patrick’s Home in the mid-1990s alongside a person from Iraq, Ibrahim, who also had been sent to live there at the time. (His parents, who were also living in Malta, could not look after him. They were seeking refugee status. Today, Ibrahim is permanently settled in the USA, having lived there since leaving St Patrick’s Home at the age of sixteen.) The participants were enlisted with the assistance of Kriss Law (KL), a friend of the author, who had been in care at St Patrick’s Home during this time. He traced the Maltese participants by purposefully selecting them from an eligible group of people he knew personally and felt comfortable relating to. It was assumed that having this ‘trustful’ relationship would contribute to the validity of this heuristic study. KL also took it into his hands to contact the young people who came from asylum-seeking families when they were boys and who were staying at St Patrick’s Home at this time. He managed to contact Ibrahim by telephone after communicating with him initially by means of the social network site, Facebook. He did not succeed in contacting two people from Serbia and Bosnia, who were the remaining asylum seekers at St Patrick’s Home during this period. Consequently, they could not feature as participants in this study. For ethical reasons, the participants’ names have been changed. KL’s contribution was restricted to solely that of assisting the author during the interviews; he does not feature as a participant in the study.</p>
<p>The interviews and focus groups were carried out with KL co-interviewing and co-moderating with the author; three focus groups were moderated, two containing four participants and one containing three. The focus groups were conducted in a relatively free-flowing and unstructured manner. They provided a group context which allowed the Maltese participants to present issues that they considered important. The focus groups also enabled the author, together with KL, to further explore the data presented in the interviews – when it was believed that further clarification or explanation of these data would result in a clarification of what had been stated. Since focus groups are less interviewer-centred than interviews are, they carry the added advantage that, in all likelihood, they generate fewer ‘left-out data’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477878512437459">Freeman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477878512437459">Kevern and Webb, 2001</xref>), especially since the participants would feel less constrained to answer interview questions in a specific manner, and the researchers would have less need to come up with all the ‘right’ questions for the interviewees to answer.</p>
<p>The focus groups were carried out after all the interviews had been completed. The data presented during the interviews and focus groups was recorded using a tape recorder and transcribed on completion. All the participants were assured that any information collected would remain anonymous, that their identity would not be disclosed in the study, and that any data collected would be destroyed once the study was completed. The focus groups and interviews were conducted in Maltese (the author being bilingual in Maltese and English). The data were transcribed and subsequently translated into English by the author. The telephone interview with Ibrahim was conducted in English.</p>
<p>A limitation of this research is that it is, in many ways, retrospective. This means that due acknowledgement has to be given to the passage of time between when the participants lived at St Patrick’s Home and when the research was conducted. The participants could have been affected by experiences derived from subsequent life-events or by their picturing the world differently as they grew older; this could have influenced what they said during the interviews or focus groups. In research of this nature, particularly when recounting past experiences, participants will usually choose to revise their experiences. Then, to further compound matters, researchers normally also classify or re-order the data they are given in an effort to present their study ‘empirically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477878512437459">Denzin and Lincoln, 2005</xref>). This means that the overall impression of the situation that the participants intended to convey and that which the study presents may be somewhat discordant. Saying this, this ‘hurdle’ may have been overcome – at least, partially – through KL’s assuming a relatively active part in the research process, as he was more likely to understand hidden meanings and thereby could clarify matters during the interviews and focus groups in a way that the author could not (since the author had never been in care). No claims can be made to suggest that findings from the study can be directly applied or generalized to other care contexts, even though ‘the disparate demands for resilience, maturity and independence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477878512437459">Hyde and Kammerer, 2009</xref>: 266) that society places on young people who grow up in, and leave, care are not particular to the Maltese context. This lack of particularity does, however, imply that the perspectives of the participants could inform research, policy and practice in a manner that is not restricted to Malta, even though the focus of the study is essentially on the educational inputs of a particular cohort of young people living in a specific care setting located in Malta.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The initial analysis was approached by examining the transcripts extrapolated from the interviews and focus groups, and breaking down the data presented therein into different categories. This was done in such a way that the main categories could then be linked to different sub-categories associated with them. This was consonant with the guidelines laid down by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477878512437459">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</xref> on qualitative research. Three categories appeared recurrently in the participants’ narratives: ‘self-sufficiency’, ‘masculinity’, and ‘overall insecurity about the future’.</p>
<p>In terms of <italic>self-sufficiency</italic>, the participants believed, when they were in care, that they had learnt that they needed to be relatively self-reliant early on in life. The participants understood, at least conceptually at their young age, that they had to develop healthy social networks to help them along and that they had to befriend people who would empower them rather than lead them astray. They also knew that they could not take it for granted that they would be handed anything they needed on a silver plate. Rather they believed that they would have to work hard in order to have these needs met. On a social and emotional level, they acknowledged that they needed to have fun, relate to other people, possibly engage in sports activities, and perpetuate their friendships by remaining in contact with one another in order to give each other support when needed.</p>
<p>The emphasis on ‘<italic>masculinity’</italic> stemmed from all the participants being male. This possibly triggered their engaging in some degree of gender-loaded language in their interviews and focus groups. Using tenets derived from a positive psychotherapy model for boys and men that has been put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477878512437459">Kiselica and Englar-Carson (2010)</xref>, it has emerged from this study that the participants attribute importance to their forming part of a group, being accepted by that group and also showing concern for others in the group (thereby perpetuating their friendship with group members). This manifests male relation styles that are often goal-centred, instrumental and (as in this case) possibly constructed through such means as participating in sports and camps. As noted above, the participants also safeguard their personal autonomy; they need to decide certain things in a relatively independent manner, and thereby aspire to be as self-reliant as possible. In terms of their labour market aspirations, the participants present work as being a significant aspect of their lives. This reflects the provider tradition in men that tends to be widely associated, across different cultures, with male self-esteem.</p>
<p>Finally, the participants also engage in positive risk-taking, by being willing to carry on living their lives without feeling impeded by the lack of resources they have in comparison with some young people raised by their families in their respective homes. Positive risk-taking is also a masculine gender-based activity since certain males tend to achieve popularity and status by taking risks; for instance, boys who play football tend to differentiate themselves from other groups of boys who work hard in class. As a rule, the latter lose popularity unless they also participate in sports, particularly the more competitive ones, to compensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477878512437459">Martino, 2000</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477878512437459">Weaver-Hightower (2003)</xref> points out that there are a considerable number of different types of masculinities and there are some that can allow certain boys to acquire more power or dominance over others who they see as different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477878512437459">Connell, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477878512437459">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477878512437459">Denborough, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477878512437459">Martino and Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477878512437459">Mills, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477878512437459">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477878512437459">Willis, 1977</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477878512437459">Connell (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477878512437459">1996)</xref> notes, however, there is no single version of masculinity that leads to the creation of an unchanging gender regime or to the ascription of a hierarchy of statuses that never changes – as masculinity is an ongoing social construction within a particular context. Therefore, if someone at St Patrick’s Home, for instance, considers himself powerless or not accepted by some of his peers, it is possible that he may feel more comfortable and find himself in a relatively more advantaged position when he is with another group of people at the same Home.</p>
<p>The feelings of <italic>insecurity about the future</italic>, which often feature in this study, can be traced to the particular vulnerabilities provoked by being in care. When at St Patrick’s Home, the participants had to integrate different inputs from foster carers, parents (and therefore the different family set-ups with which they came to be involved), the school; and also what they had been told by different professional staff such as social workers, care workers, and the ‘volunteers’ (usually university students) who purposely came to St Patrick’s Home to help them with their homeworks. The participants explained that so many contributions from multiple sources, some of which appeared contradictory, were at times very confusing and this is why they needed each other’s empathic support in order to help them cope. Retrospectively, they also said that they aspired then to retain contact with the other boys at St Patrick’s when they all left. Through expressing their need to disclose to one another, most especially as young adults, the participants are clearly showing their awareness of the need to be adequately equipped to operate as effective citizens within wider society; and of their recognition of the support that they can offer each other in order for that to happen.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that if young people leaving care are developmentally unprepared and have few guaranteed supports, they can present numerous challenges to their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437459">Courtney et al., 2010</xref>). All of the participants stated that having someone who showed that he or she cared about them in a genuine way made a great difference to them. They particularly praised the efforts of a care worker who had also been in care at St Patrick’s Home as a child. The participants were thereby once again emphasizing the importance they attributed to empathy, alongside the carers’ active involvement in their lives, both of which are reflected in the cardinal social-work values of treating each child or young person as an individual, of allowing him to share his feelings and to express them purposefully, and of ensuring that he feels accepted by his carers even if they disapprove of some of his acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477878512437459">Biestek, 1961</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477878512437459">Howe (2008</xref>: 181) notes that ‘people change as they engage with others. They need to trust the (care) worker and feel safe before they can move on and address specific problems, whether these problems are intrapersonal, interpersonal, or to do with the business of just trying to live and cope’. The participants explained that this sense of trust in the staff was particularly important when the refugees came to live at St Patrick’s Home. They reported that the care workers encouraged them to befriend the refugees so that they would not feel isolated or part of two separate cliques. Often, sport, particularly football, served as a medium for them to ‘break the ice’ and relate to one another.</p>
<p>A common defining thread in what the participants presented is a desire for a life that is congruent with the values that they internalized at St Patrick’s Home and that they could thereby integrate with their particular background as looked after children and young people. In acknowledgement of this, the core theoretical category proposed is that of <italic>constantly developing resilience</italic>. Even though all the participants experienced a certain emptiness (as they were conscious of not being brought up in a family setting), they used the resources available to generate the resilience necessary to cope with any associated arising negative feelings. This will be elaborated upon further below.</p>
<sec id="section4-1477878512437459">
<title>Constantly developing resilience</title>
<p>The extent to which resilience is linked to citizenship education stems from the way in which resilience has been expressed and manifested by the participants. The participants’ need for acknowledgement and empathy, during their growing-up years, shows not only their desire to have other people communicate an awareness and affirmation of their feelings; but, also, as is characteristic of empathic communication, of their communicating the particular meanings that are attached to these feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477878512437459">Mearns and Thorne, 2007</xref>). As stated above, the participants missed being brought up in what they considered an ordinary family and described how being in care (while seen as a viable alternative as their natural family could not look after them) did not serve as a replacement. As Michael put it ‘you are always conscious that you are different from everybody else outside St Patrick’s’. During one of the focus groups, David reported regularly experiencing ‘a feeling of emptiness’, which he attributed to what is sometimes referred to as ‘father hunger’, after his father left Malta never to return. This ‘father hunger’ is traceable to children’s deep longing for physical and emotional contact with their father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477878512437459">Herzog, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>David was also subjected to mother wounds as a result of the emptiness and loss that came about when his mother refused to have any contact with him from shortly after his birth. He said that, while at St Patrick’s Home, he learnt what an ordinary family was like – thanks to his foster carers (he had had the same carers since early childhood); yet, all the same, he believed that his family-of-origin could have offered him greater access to them by allowing him to go ‘home’ occasionally. He thought that he would have been able to forge ‘close bonds’ with them if some form of contact had been retained. As in David’s case, where the sense of gratitude to his foster parents was pronounced, the type of citizenship education to which the boys were exposed through the fostering process came about through the attachment and obligation to their foster families, which translated into loyalty to abiding to the norms of wider society. This type of family-based bonding would have otherwise been absent in their childhood and adolescence. The boys’ appreciation of this was manifested by their constant reference to their foster carers, who can be assumed to have been influential agents of socialization in their upbringings. This assumption is based on their being widely acknowledged to have praised the participants’ pro-social activities and behaviours.</p>
<p>The socialization of the participants was also influenced by the many varied informal and outdoor educational activities organized for them while at St Patrick’s Home. They saw these outdoor activities as having promoted a sense of commitment, a sense of purpose, and overall ability to give and receive trust, especially since successfully engaging in these activities was based on their cooperating and using teamwork skills. In this context, Malcolm and Ian referred to both <italic>what</italic> they felt as individual people and <italic>how</italic> what they felt connected them with others. This was evidenced particularly when, during a focus group, they had the following exchange on the impact that these activities had on their lives and how they were reinforced by the positive interventions of their foster carers. Malcolm said: ‘I always used to look forward to judo. I remember once I had this opportunity to take part in this competition abroad. Everything was paid. However, my foster parents gave me some extra money to take with me. I was so happy, I appreciated this gesture so much, that I won the competition. I still have this desire to be a fair winner today in all that I do.’ To this Ian responded: ‘At camps, they showed us how to prepare barbeques. My foster parents wanted to organize a barbeque for the family. They did not know how to do it. They left it in my hands. I felt very important. I still like to try out things till today. What I do not know, I read about on the internet, or I ask, or I see someone doing something and I do whatever that person does. I remember, the first time I made a barbeque, my friends showed me what to do. From then on, I knew what to do.’</p>
<p>Malcolm and Ian are emphasizing the involvement of significant others as proving to be crucial in building up their motivation. At first sight, in terms of behavioral theory, it appears that Malcolm was motivated by his being given extra money to take abroad with him (an external or extrinsic motivator). Ian was motivated more explicitly by being trusted (an internal or intrinsic motivator). At a somewhat deeper level, in terms of self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477878512437459">Deci et al., 1999</xref>), it could be said that the motivation of both these young people also stemmed from enjoying what they were doing, deriving satisfaction from the experience of success or competence in doing it, and the expression and enhancement of positive relations with others. In further explanation of this, while Malcolm’s acknowledgement of judo as something valuable and important was triggered by his having a sense of sportsmanship (as demonstrated by his healthy competitive nature and his desire to win fairly), Ian’s organizing a barbeque offered him reassurance that he was important, masterful and competent. This could be interpreted as manifesting how Malcolm’s aspiration to be a fair winner was a source of ‘integrated regulation’ whereby his satisfaction did not depend as much on what others thought about his actions as on what he thought about them, even though other people’s thoughts and opinions were given the merited attention due to them. Ian, on the other hand, defined his self-worth by attributing far more emphasis to how others judged what he was doing, thereby illustrating ‘identified regulation’. While both these types of regulation are based on the expression of autonomy, in the former, it is expressed more intensely than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477878512437459">Niemiec and Ryan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The participants also described how they had gradually been taught to relate to others meaningfully by engaging in different types of decision-making at St Patrick’s Home and through progressively being assigned greater responsibilities as they grew older. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477878512437459">Crick (1998)</xref> presents the imparting of this type of social responsibility as being linked to enhancement of young people’s community involvement and their adoption of a greater repertoire of political literacy associated skills. An illustration of this came about when the participants noted, for instance, that through sports, they learnt to behave responsibly to one another. They pointed out that they then progressed to taking the initiative to organize things for one another, and from there, to help in overall decision-making in the context of making things happen. Josef explains this by saying that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I came from a background at home of intense abuse and I was locked in my own world. I had no interest in other people, no real interest. That was given to me at St Patrick’s Home. I was always good at sports, at football, and this helped me. I was encouraged to play football at school and I was always playing football at the Home. This helped me. It gave me relief. It was a release. I used to feel safe. I used to enjoy the game. I used to get lost in it. Gradually, I learnt to show people they were important to me and I needed them. Even if you are the best footballer in the world, like me, you cannot play without the rest of the team. As I grew older, I learnt how to do things for others, even if it was preparing for an outing. As I am sure you know when boys take an interest in something and disagree, they fight. I was always fighting. Then, Father . . . told me not to fight, to say to myself stop, think and then act. Instead I started speaking, discussing, arguing [he laughs], maybe sometimes insulting in one or two words, but not fighting. I then started to get involved in boy scouts; my foster parents helped me to join, and I started helping with the young ones. I used to help them when they had disagreements, I used to help them to decide things peacefully. I felt so useful. I felt satisfied. I felt I could change something. I felt I mattered in other people’s lives. I felt I could share in their happiness and unhappiness. Today, I am still involved with odd pieces of voluntary work. I also have a happy relationship with my girlfriend, we discuss, we argue [laughs again] – by the way, I have learnt not to insult people. I love her, mind you. But, St Patrick’s gave me a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the influence of citizenship education on wider culture is acknowledged widely by educators and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477878512437459">Westheimer and Kahne, 2004</xref>), the above narrative shows that learning that is linked to citizenship education also has an influence on personal growth. Josef starts by mentioning a home culture characterized by abuse. Then he speaks about the holistic St Patrick’s culture, which he sees as incorporating both his active participation in sports and his increased acknowledgement and awareness of the plurality of the experiences of the other boys alongside his own. Then he discusses his active engagement in the civic life of the wider community, through his participation in scouts and through his helping out with ‘the young ones’.</p>
<p>This implies that even though the effectiveness of (formal) education in bringing about students’ civic efficacy has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477878512437459">Hillygus, 2005</xref>), it can be deduced from what is stated above that, through preparing young people ‘to engage in collective, community-based efforts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477878512437459">Westheimer and Kahne, 2004</xref>: 243), even if within the confines of St Patrick’s Home, it is highly likely that they would find the motivation to develop their self-efficacy and employ it to achieve their desired objectives in other ways. This ability to engage in agentic activity can be traced to the emotional literacy that the participants acquired as a result of their increased sensitivity to their own feelings, and those of others (as shown in the narrative above). It could also be traced to the manner in which they accomplished their ‘masculinity’, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477878512437459">Butler’s (1990)</xref> theory of gender performativity. This theory does not focus on the biological aspect of gendered practices but rather emphasizes the repertoire of behaviours associated with gendered norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477878512437459">Haines et al., 2009</xref>). The references to ‘football’, ‘desisting from fighting’, ‘boy scouts’, ‘being a boy’, and ‘having a girlfriend’ that Josef associates with success, are all gender-laden concepts and ideas. In further elaboration of this, the participants saw their communicating with different people at St Patrick’s Home in a positive manner as compensating for negative experiences that they endured, particularly, in the early stages of care, as outlined in the following narrative.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As far as I was concerned, at my foster home, my foster parents wanted a soft toy or a pet dog and instead they got ‘me’. I remember being beaten by them over and over with a dog-leash whenever they saw me as disobedient. No matter how much I used to cry, they used to beat me over and over. Then I went to this care-home and the priest who was in charge also used to beat me. Then, I came to St Patrick’s and instead of the priest beating me, I used to get beaten up by the boys. Yet St Patrick’s was not all negative. There were the good times as well; for instance, there were some of the boys who befriended me, especially when we went on outings and attended camps. They used to ask me what I enjoyed doing and I used to tell them. Then, I suddenly realised that I needed to ask them what they enjoyed doing, and I asked them this back. We became friends. We used to form a small group of our own and I used to enjoy myself with them. There were times when I used to cry with happiness. I was happy to be included, to feel like one of the others. When I was much younger, when I was in the big group, I used to feel a fish out of water. I used to feel I did not belong. With these other boys, we used to spend a lot of time together, and because of this, they helped me to find the courage to do things in the big group, like carrying boxes or lamps from the van, for instance, if we were camping. Some of these boys were the refugees. Looking back, I suppose they understood me, because they wanted to feel included as well. Sometime after that, I took my own initiatives. I used to tell the others ‘let’s do this and let’s do that’. Then, as I grew older, I found the confidence to confront the boys who hurt me, with the help of the staff, and tell them how they were hurting me and show them that I was hurt. However, when these boys used to see me taking initiatives, they did not used to bully me, and gradually they became friends also. I look at St Patrick’s as a place where, on the one hand, I was bullied, but on the other hand as a place where I made friends – these friends are people who are still my friends today. We meet regularly, we go camping, we go to Chris’s boathouse together to meet up around once a month, something we have done since leaving St Patrick’s. St Patrick’s made us a family.</p>

<p>The importance of using peers or staff members to integrate oneself within a care setting is given emphasis in a publication written specifically for young people in care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477878512437459">Voice for the Child in Care, 1998</xref>). In this publication, a person who had been in care advises other young people who are in care currently that ‘the hardest thing in the world is to hope and to trust; to overcome the feeling that everyone and everything is just a pointless waste. If you can link in with someone and begin to talk about your experiences, then you can gain the strength to move on from there’ (12). Within the context of this study, it appears that not only has this communication taken place (since the participants related to one another and reinforced each other’s socialization as a result) but it is also recollected vividly.</p>
<p>This shows that though citizenship education has been discussed from various perspectives – including those of moral and character development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437459">Althof and Berkowitz, 2006</xref>), politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477878512437459">Giroux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477878512437459">Martin, 2008</xref>), religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477878512437459">Kunzman, 2005</xref>) and multicultural education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477878512437459">Banks, 2008</xref>) – the importance of its intersection with a critical pedagogy based on engaging students in interrelating (and also on reflecting on the quality of their friendships, and asking one another questions to generate a greater mutual understanding) needs to be present to create an atmosphere of harmony and mutuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477878512437459">Castro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477878512437459">Dilworth, 2008</xref>). Indeed, as shown throughout this study, its importance and relevance cannot be underestimated. From the perspective of self-determination theory, what is most salient in the findings of this study is that the young people concerned were supported in developing social competence – the ability to form and sustain positive relationships with others – while internalizing new knowledge, skills and related acumen through processes of socialization consistent with their autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477878512437459">Niemiec and Ryan, 2009</xref>). They were able to satisfy their basic psychological needs for relatedness, autonomy, and competence; and they forged a spirit of relatedness with the care staff of St Patrick’s Home. As a result, they developed coping abilities for when they would live elsewhere, possibly independently, on turning sixteen. This does not mean that life was always a bed of roses for them. While some, as young men, occasionally brushed with the law, these nevertheless seemed to be transient occurrences. By the time they were about twenty years old or older, they appeared to be more focused on their aspirations. Many of them became fathers and emphasized their paternal role even in cases where they had split up from their child’s or children’s mother(s). Nonetheless, although some had concrete plans for the future in comparison with when they were younger, some said that they still felt ‘lost’, since, for instance, the job that they had was not a permanent one, or they had experienced a break-up with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>On the level of interpersonal relationships, two of the participants kept in contact with Ibrahim via Facebook, but all of them had lost contact with the other refugees. They all think that this is ‘a pity’ since they believe that retaining contact with one another can only prove to be beneficial – so much so, that they see their friendship as a type of social capital. Their ongoing friendship is deemed by them to be something positive, or as Mark put it, ‘almost therapeutic’. As a group of young men, they feel safe enough to share things together that they might find themselves hesitant to share with outsiders lest they be misunderstood. Some of the participants are in regular contact with their foster carers and some are finding support from their natural parents. There are some who find support from both.</p>
<p>When asked how they thought St Patrick’s Home served as a preparation for adult life, the participants’ answers were mostly centred on its enjoining them to adopt pro-social behaviours and attitudes, and on developing the skills, resources, disposition and resilience to cooperate with others meaningfully. On one level, the participants are perhaps showing that the underlying spirituality of Father Bosco has been influential enough to become part of their habitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477878512437459">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). The habitus is a person’s innermost inclination which essentially creates dispositions to act, think and also to interpret experiences in a particular way, thereby serving to ‘suggest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477878512437459">Ritzer, 1996</xref>: 405) what people choose to do. This choice is influenced by their subjective interpretation of past happenings in their lives. On another, perhaps more decisive, level, the participants are showing that they do not see residential care as having been a negative experience. Conversely, they see St Patrick’s Home as having given them an emotional literacy that has enabled them to forge a competent disposition to face life’s challenges with greater confidence than would have been otherwise possible.</p>
