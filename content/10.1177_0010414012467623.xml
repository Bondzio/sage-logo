<p>The political and sociological study of Saudi Arabia is in much better shape today than it was a decade ago. With <italic>Awakening Islam</italic>, Stephane Lacroix further raises the bar for researchers of the kingdom. It is the empirically richest and conceptually most nuanced book on Saudi Arabia to date and is set to become a standard reference in the debate about political Islam more generally.</p>
<p>The core objective of <italic>Awakening Islam</italic> is a sociological account of Al-Sahwa Al-Islamiyyah, Saudi Arabia’s main Islamist social movement, which emerged in the late 1960s as a hybrid of local Wahabi theology and imported political ideas from the Muslim Brotherhood. In the early 1990s, the only serious political opposition modern Saudi Arabia has ever encountered emerged from the ranks of the Sahwa, and despite its political defeat, its organizational and ideological legacy continues to define Saudi political Islam.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework of the book draws on a wide range of social movement theorists and political sociologists, but most notably Bourdieu, specifically his concept of sociological “fields.” Lacroix argues that Saudi society is divided into a number of “fields” constituted by separate social networks, different norms of behavior, and ideological objectives.</p>
<p>The main sectors of interest to him are the intellectual field, traditionally dominated by “modernist,” liberal intellectuals who have been the Sahwa’s main macro-level rivals; the religious field, historically dominated by the Saudi ulama; and the political field, which is dominated by the Al Saud. The political field sits astride all other fields, controls the resources they draw on (p. 27), but otherwise lets them operate in parallel, with a sometimes surprisingly high level of internal autonomy.</p>
<p>The Sahwa has roots in both the intellectual field—in the shape of Islamist intellectuals with secular education and a fundamentally political agenda—and the religious field, in the shape of (usually lower-level) ulama with a stake in the Sahwist agenda of religious and social reform. The Sahwa’s roots in different fields allowed it to temporarily mobilize large numbers of young adherents from 1991 on—but it also explains its quick disintegration as a political movement in 1993-1994, when the divergent objectives of its protagonists came to the fore.</p>
<p>To situate the Sahwa in its broader social context, Lacroix provides a veritable social history of Saudi Arabia’s post–World War II intellectual life. Drawing almost exclusively on previously unused primary sources in Arabic and a wide range of interviews, Lacroix explains how exiled Muslim Brothers from Arab republics took control of the modern Saudi education system as well as important parts of the kingdom’s charitable sector from the 1960s on. Drawing on well-honed organizational skills and ample state resources, they introduced the political thought of authors such as Sayed Qutb to large cohorts of young Saudis, whose religious education previously had been limited to classical Wahabi sources and focused solely on purity of belief and individual demeanor.</p>
<p>Lacroix investigates the organizational structures of different ideological trends in detail. These include notably the Sahwist “jama’at,” widespread but secretive Islamic study groups melding Wahabi orthodoxy with the Muslim Brotherhood’s political outlook, but also the Sahwa’s rivals such as the literalist Ahl al-Hadith movement and its loyalist and violent successors, and the international jihadist movement emerging in 1980s Saudi Arabia to support the anti-Soviet struggle in Afghanistan. Woven through all this is a nuanced understanding of the wider social context, in which membership and objectives of different movements often corresponded to the steep hierarchy of generations, regions, and kinship networks in Saudi society.</p>
<p>Different from standard accounts, the book sees the presence of U.S. soldiers on Saudi soil during and after the 1990–1991 Kuwait war just as a trigger, not the main cause of the 1991-1994 political contestation between Sahwa and the regime. Instead, it was the socioeconomic crisis of the 1980s that produced a lost and angry generation of young Sahwists facing sudden mobility closure, ruled by an older generation of liberally minded technocrats. Although their ire was initially directed against liberal intellectuals patronized by the Al Saud, it was increasingly aimed at the regime supporting the latter and their supposed secularizing agenda.</p>
<p>During the post-1990 conflict, the major Islamist movements in the kingdom temporarily cooperated, including jihadists and radical Ahl al-Hadith followers. The mobilization petered out inexplicably from 1993 on, however, and Lacroix argues cogently that neither state repression nor the regime’s support for countermovements such as the loyalist “jami” trend of the Ahl al-Hadith can fully account for this.</p>
<p>Instead, it was the internal contradictions of the Sahwa that led to its demise as a political movement. Sahwist ulama, of secondary rank in the official clerical order, were interested not in political power per se, but rather in establishing and controlling an independent religious establishment. Sahwist intellectuals sought an Islamic state in a more encompassing sense, ideally a conservative Islamic democracy. This put them beyond the pale of the Saudi political system and eventually isolated them. When the jama’at, embedded in Saudi Arabia’s state-financed educational and religious institutions, decided to withdraw their support from the Sahwist challenge, the latter lost its main mobilizational backup.</p>
<p>The opposition in exile that emerged in 1994 consisted of a small number of intellectuals who lacked the doctrinal support from clerical leaders. The leading Sahwist ulama, by contrast, emerged from the contestation—and their temporary incarceration—as a socially powerful if politically co-opted force who have to some extent replaced the old establishment ulama as popular religious leaders.</p>
<p>The book concludes with an overview of the Sahwa’s political successors in Saudi Arabia. These are on one hand “Islamo-liberal” intellectuals who have broken with the ulama and pushed for both political liberalization and a rethinking of the exclusivist Wahabi orthodoxy that dominates Saudi education and public space. On the other hand, there are “neo-jihadists” who unleashed a wave of anti-Western terror attacks in the kingdom from 2003 on. Both groups, although very different, have remained small and without wider public resonance. As a social movement, however, the Sahwa and its jama’at continue to exist on a much wider scale and could, under the right circumstances, become a potent political force again.</p>
<p>Beyond the nuanced understanding of the social and ideological bases of political Islam in the kingdom, the book provides a sweeping account of the deep fragmentation of Saudi society. “Modernists” and Sahwists have been separated by ideology, but they live segregated lives also in spatial, behavioral, and sartorial terms, and are ultimately attached to very different parts of the huge and fragmented Saudi state apparatus.</p>
<p>The maintenance of such parallel and in principle conflicting spheres has arguably been possible only thanks to the kingdom’s huge oil rents—a theme that is beyond the remit of Lacroix’s already wide-ranging study, but that nonetheless bears some reflection against the background of his rich empirical material. The regime’s vast patronage resources allowed it to isolate important parts of state and society from conventional modernization processes: Saudi Arabia has never gone through the wrenching history of economic modernization and class formation that has unified other developed societies.</p>
<p>Instead, Saudis of different stripes were relentlessly drawn into the orbit of patronage of an omnipresent state, which itself in the course of co-optation grew flabby and deeply divided, catering to (and often creating) radically different constituencies. As a result, some Saudis live the socially liberal life of American suburbia in the compounds of national oil champion Saudi Aramco, whereas others strive in Islamic universities to re-create the mores of 7th-century Arabia.</p>
<p>From this statist perspective, the “field” concept most of all denotes access to different state-provided organizational and material resources; Lacroix provides ample evidence of how the core regime’s decisions to reallocate resources could dramatically affect the fate of different movements. In this context, the core cause for the Sahwa’s political disintegration—the jama’at’s abstention from the opposition movement—was perhaps less the outcome of the different “professional” orientations of Sahwist ulama and intellectuals. Instead, it might just have resulted from the jama’at’s instinct for self-preservation, which had come to rely on state organizations and resources for their survival.</p>
<p><italic>Awakening Islam</italic> is an excellent case study of the rentier state itself as a political arena: On one hand, the rootedness of different ideological networks in the Saudi state makes for a surprising degree of pluralism within a strictly authoritarian regime. The state’s resources and its capacity to accommodate very different social agendas in different sections of the state apparatus make negotiations with the regime on any but the most political objectives attractive for otherwise resource-poor social movements. This explains why the original Sahwa was a form of “state Islamism” (p. 266).</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the embeddedness of ideological networks in the state gives the core regime wide means of control short of repression, including over the careers of (mostly state-employed) activists, and the organizational and material resources they depend on. As the book shows, the Al Saud quickly tightened their political control over the education sector after the early Sahwist mobilization and created the “jami” countertrend to the Sahwa almost ex nihilo. Even before that, the rapidly shifting fortunes of different ideological movements were usually an outcome of the regime’s patronage decisions—to an extent that it is hard to imagine in a nonrentier context. Although the day-to-day internal autonomy of different sectors might give their leaders social legitimacy, this masks an underlying material dependence.</p>
<p>We may hope that Lacroix will be able to deepen some of the comparative observations he makes in the final part of the book, in which he alludes to analogous failures of “multisectoral” Islamist movements outside of Saudi Arabia. This will help us understand to which extent the politics of different “fields” in Saudi Arabia is rentier politics and to which extent there is a general model that passes muster for Islamic politics in the whole world. In either case, this book will remain required reading for any student of Arabian politics or political Islam.</p>
