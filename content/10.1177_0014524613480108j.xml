<p>This handbook, written primarily by scholars working at British Universities, presents a series of glimpses into the long and fascinating reception history of the Bible. At the same time, it emphasizes that the current interest in what the Bible has meant for various faith communities over the centuries should never overshadow the message that its original authors sought to communicate.</p>
<p>The first quarter of the book offers twelve articles, each devoted to a key biblical book (Genesis, Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Judges, John, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Revelation). As an example, Sawyers’s article on Isaiah identifies key passages of the book and highlights how they have been understood in Jewish and Christian traditions. Turning to modern scholarship, Sawyers surveys issues pertinent to (1) historical-critical scholarship, (2) canonical readings of Isaiah, and (3) reader-oriented approaches to the book. The article ends with a list of the works cited and suggestions for Further Reading. Joyce’s article on Ezekiel is another example. Joyce first surveys the theological message of the book, and then explores how later traditions have made use of Ezekiel.</p>
<p>The rest of the book contains an eclectic, yet also representative, selection of thirty-one articles. Their combined scope demonstrates the enormous impact over all aspects of life that the Bible has had over the last 2000 years. Four articles explore how select parts of the Bible have been interpreted by various Christian scholars (Augustine, Mediaeval interpreters, Luther, and Barth). Another article looks at interpretations of the Bible by Christian groups considered to be heterodox and/or showing a Gnostic attitude towards the Hebrew Bible (e.g. Valentinian readings, Sethian texts). Ten articles are devoted to political and ideological interpretations. Three of them focus on aspects related to Judaism: how has the New Testament been used to increase anti-Semitism, how did Hitler and the Jewish community utilize Esther during the Holocaust, and how did post-holocaust theologians relate to Job? Another four of them look at how religious and political groups (select millenarian groups, the Nations of Islam, the Seventh-Day Adventists) have appropriated specific parts of the Bible to further their cause. The last three explore the role of the Bible in discussions of evolution and warfare (military action, passive resistance, and pacifism). Six studies are devoted to the use of the Bible in media: in literature (Dante, Ruskin), in art (iconography, William Blake), and in popular culture (Bob Dylan’s lyrics, Dan Brown’s portrayal of Jesus and Mary Magdalene). Another five articles can be categorized as dealing with geographically influenced Christian readings of the Bible: Uchimura in 20<sup>th</sup> century Japan, Christian evangelists in 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century Southern USA, and contemporary African-American communities, as well as the use of the Exodus narrative in 20<sup>th</sup> century USA and in Latin America. The remaining five articles range from studies of Kierkegaard’s understanding of Matt 6, Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s <italic>The Woman’s Bible</italic>, the reception of Gen 19 and the issue of homosexuality in the Anglican community, to issues of Bible interpretation and modern literary theory.</p>
