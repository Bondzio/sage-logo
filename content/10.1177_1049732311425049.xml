<abstract>
<p>Recently, health care workers (researchers, academics, policy writers, clinicians) have begun to view ethnography as an acceptable research methodology for informing public health work. This corresponds with a change in public health practice toward population health, wherein identifiable groups are examined to identify the group-level and contextual factors that affect their health statuses. Although population health-based methodological and outcomes-focused examinations have already occurred regarding ethnography, no extant literature scrutinizes the incorporation of ethnography into mainstream public and population health work from a sociopolitical viewpoint. Consequently, such an investigation occurs here using Foucault’s concepts of discipline and Lupton’s advancement of Foucault’s ideas about the imperative of health. The outcome of this investigation is the assertion that ethnography is a strategic method for disciplining populations that do not respect the imperative of health. In other words, ethnography helps generate the data that can be used to normalize large groups of people.</p>

<p>A new strategy to enhance public health, which is defined here as the health of the general public, has been to focus on population health. This means that a recently adopted approach to improving the health status of the general public has been to address the competing health needs of specific and identifiable populations, such as gay and bisexual men, African and Caribbean women, visible minorities, homeless youth, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425049">Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC], 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311425049">Shah, 2003</xref>). Even though many items have likely influenced this change in focus, one contributing factor of interest is that some recent research has suggested that improved public and population health outcomes often occur when interventions are grounded in group-specific data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311425049">PHAC, 2010a</xref>). Indeed, many health interventions that are developed using group-specific knowledge rather than general assumptions about people’s behavior yield intended outcomes relating targeted actions and activities—particularly as this relates to safer sexual practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311425049">Fenton &amp; Bloom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425049">Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425049">Lawrence &amp; Fortenberry 2007</xref>; Shah). As a consequence of these outcomes, some authors have begun advocating for cultural studies, which in this context is loosely captured by the term <italic>ethnography</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732311425049">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond establishing the benefits of using ethnography to inform health-related initiatives and strategies, however, the incorporation of this data collection strategy into mainstream public and population health work has not been sufficiently examined. Methodological discussions have occurred about the suitability and purpose of this type of research in public and population health initiatives, but, for the most part, theoretical analyses are lacking from a sociopolitical perspective. Questions consequently remain about the social role, purpose, and function of ethnography, and about how and why this form of research has become increasingly popular as a research approach. To address these questions, the incorporation of ethnography in public and population health work is examined using a Foucauldian lens. This starts with an overview of how the ideas of health and ethnography are understood in the mainstream public and population health domain, and proceeds with a delineation of Foucault’s concepts of bio-power and discipline. Thereafter, Foucault’s work is used to examine the use of ethnography in public and population health work. This last section is the crux of the article.</p>

<title>Part I: Mainstream Public/Population Health and Ethnography</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732311425049">
<title>The Mainstream Definition of Health</title>
<p>Before addressing the incorporation of ethnographic research in public and population health work, the definition of health that guides/pervades conventional health care practice is discussed to help ground this analysis. Simply put, in mainstream health work, this concept is understood as a state of optimal well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311425049">Shah, 2003</xref>). It is, according to the World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311425049">WHO, 1948</xref>), “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Health, therefore, is neither dichotomous nor exclusionary; it is a continuum that focuses on well-being. The presence of disease or disability does not unconditionally signify poor health, because one might be impaired, but might nevertheless be healthy based on personal perceptions, attitudes, and efforts. The main problem with an individual’s health status thus arises in relation to his or her willingness and dedication to maintain and improve his or her health status. Problems are not related to a person’s actual state of illness, disease, or infirmity; rather, they relate to attitude and effort.</p>
<p>Although it is not stated overtly, a fundamental pillar of the mainstream definition of health is the pervasive and uncritical acceptance of what Deborah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton (1995)</xref>, building on Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311425049">Foucault’s (1980)</xref> work, called the imperative of health—the belief that health is irrefutably and indubitably something that everyone wants, and therefore must strive for. From this Luptonian (1995) perspective, health is an all-consuming and overwhelming priority for “a state of complete . . . well-being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311425049">WHO, 1948</xref>). One’s health should be enhanced for its own sake and at all costs. Any and all barriers to optimal well-being should be removed or overcome.</p>
<p>Such an underlying assumption permeates many of the theoretical frameworks that are widely accepted and implemented in public and population sexual health work; for example, the Rational Actor Model, the Health Belief Model, the Stages of Change Model, the Consumer Information Model, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425049">Lawrence &amp; Fortenberry, 2007</xref>). Moreover, this definition of health, including the imperative-of-health subtext that accompanies it, is evident in the belief that there is nothing more beneficial to both individuals and society than improving health—and this is because, as noted above, health is considered to be something that everyone naturally wants, even if they are not consciously aware of this desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1995</xref>). To summarize, the mainstream comprehension and use of the term <italic>health</italic> is two-pronged: first, it describes an optimal state of well-being that is purported to be inherently neutral and devoid of all politicization; second, health is considered an imperative: “at once the duty of each and the objective of all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311425049">Foucault, 1984</xref>, p. 277; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425049">Osborne, 1997</xref>). It is both something to strive for and something that one must strive for.</p>

<title>Health Outcomes and the Increased Use of Ethnography</title>
<p>With the idea of good health having become something that can apply to everyone, in relation to the inclusivity of optimal well-being, and which seems to be promulgated as though it must apply to everyone, regarding people’s imperative to be healthy, it is now important to examine how and why ethnography entered into the fray, and consequently became an acceptable method of knowledge production. To address these items, the following two points are addressed first: one, the argument that ethnography has become better accepted must be substantiated; two, an explanation about why this acceptance occurred must be offered.</p>
<p>In relation to the first item, ethnographic research has in fact begun to occur more frequently; this increased frequency of ethnographic studies can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732311425049">Figure 1</xref>, which presents a CINAHL and MEDLINE search (no language or date restrictions) using the keyword <italic>ethnography</italic>. What can be seen in these data is that individuals working in the health sciences have begun to undertake a small but nevertheless growing amount of ethnographic research since the early 1980s. Although there continue to be fewer than 100 peer-reviewed articles published each year with the term <italic>ethnography</italic> listed as a keyword, there has nevertheless been a progressive increase in the number of such publications over the last three decades. Moreover, a review of funding decisions by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) reveals a similar finding: increased monies have been devoted to ethnographic research proposals. A review of the CIHR’s last three posted funding decisions (Fall 2008, Spring 2009, Fall 2009) reveals that $2,679,595 (CAD) of funding was granted for 21 studies that were described as ethnographic.</p>

</fig>
<p>Regarding the second point (i.e., Why might this increase have occurred?), the answer that is put forward here relates to some of the health outcomes that have been associated with ethnographic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311425049">Huby, Hart, McKevitt, &amp; Sobo, 2007</xref>). Namely, research results show that ethnographic data have helped inform the development of efficacious health interventions for specific groups, especially in relation to sexual behavior (see, for examples, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311425049">Stanton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311425049">Wainberg, Alfredo Gonzalez, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311425049">Wainberg, McKinnon, et al., 2007</xref>). The postulation put forward here, therefore, is that ethnographic research has become more common among public/population health researchers because the data which have emerged from these studies can be used to inform generally successful initiatives—a situation that has led some authors to argue that such culture-based research should become even more common than it already is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311425049">Fenton &amp; Bloom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425049">Lawrence &amp; Fortenberry, 2007</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425049">Global HIV Prevention Working Group (2006)</xref>, for one, has endorsed ethnography, stating that such a research design (a) highlights important factors about target populations, and (b) generates useful data to inform interventions for these distinct groups. A second source of support for the increased use of ethnography arises from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311425049">Wainberg, Alfredo Gonzalez, and colleagues (2007)</xref>, whose research about transferring health interventions to secondary populations led them to conclude that public/population health workers must examine the cultural characteristics of new target groups before attempting to implement already-available health strategies with these secondary populations.</p>
<p>In combination, the foregoing information highlights that the increased use of ethnography demonstrates a change in attitudes toward what health researchers, practitioners, and policy workers accept as viable and valuable sexual health research. There is an increased openness and awareness that this form of knowledge development could contribute to improved population/public health, and there is also a noticeable increase in the number of ethnographic studies being funded and published. As noted above, however, this increased use of ethnography has not corresponded with a rise in sociopolitical analyses that examine the nature and purpose of such culture-specific research. Indeed, the sociopolitical aspects and implications of this topic have remained relatively overlooked in both the theoretical and methodological domains. Consequently, the current perception and use of ethnography signals the need for critical analysis in this domain.</p>

<title>Part II: A Critical Viewpoint</title>
<p>Notwithstanding the overwhelming acceptance of what is defined in the first part of the previous section as the mainstream public/population health perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1995</xref>), dissenting opinions about the nature, status, and meaning of health do exist. One, for example, follows the work of Michel Foucault, who sought to identify the myriad of sociopolitical factors that contribute to what might be called the essence of a given time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311425049">Mills, 2003</xref>). As part of writing and lecturing on this topic, Foucault outlined the importance of understanding the inter-/intrapersonal, social, economic, and political items that give specific meanings to particular items during distinct periods of time. One question that Foucault examined using this approach was, for example, “How is human sexuality conceptualized during different historical periods?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311425049">Foucault, 1990</xref>). In this context, such a sociopolitical perspective is assumed. Ideas about public/population health and ethnography are examined to provide one possible reason about how and why mainstream researchers in contemporary society have increased their acceptance of this qualitative strategy. This analysis, therefore, constitutes a discussion about certain aspects of ethnography that have not yet been considered in sufficient detail.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732311425049">
<title>Foucault and Social Order</title>
<p>To ground the current analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault’s (1975)</xref> concept of bio-power will be used. Simply put, this idea describes the processes of maintaining social order by working with, rather than against, the inherent power of life. Bio-power is a particularly functional concept for such an analysis because it explains how contemporary society, in part, achieves governance by means of the interrelated processes of examination and normalization. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault’s (1975)</xref> work highlights how a system of enhanced obedience and compliance operates based on (a) in-depth descriptions of social and behavioral norms at the group level, (b) detailed examinations of each individual, and (c) the subtle correction (i.e., normalization) of each person based on a comparison of his or her personal examination findings and the results from the in-depth, group-level descriptions.</p>
<p>Therefore, because this system is based on in-depth understandings about human norms, and is not the outcome of the sovereign’s will and whim, data are of central importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault, 1975</xref>). Knowing population norms and the reasons why certain individuals and groups have certain beliefs and behaviors is essential. If normalization is to be used to ensure social order, then norms have to be established: What is a normal weight, height, like, or dislike? What are the practices, preferences, and behaviors of most people? The importance of these data is paramount, because it is not until normative states are understood that, first, those who do not accord with these norms can be identified and, second, corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault, 1975</xref>). Although the data that emerge from many research methodologies can/are used to achieve Foucauldian normalization in contemporary society, ethnography can be considered one of the more newly accepted strategies for continuing the process of normalization. It is also an approach that is not traditionally associated with Foucauldian discipline and governance.</p>
<p>Before examination and normalization can be used to analyze the currently increasing use of ethnography, however, one must appreciate the historical development of this strategy of discipline and governance. In <italic>Discipline and Punish</italic>, specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> insisted that prior to the 18th Century, social governance was achieved by means of a sovereign’s spectacular display of power. The king would publicly mutilate and maul, to the point of death if need be, anyone who contravened his will—and this destruction continued after death, with the writings about an offending person being drafted in the king’s favor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> identified three major problems with this form of rule. First, it was an overt display of power, which presented evidence of cruelty, tyranny, and despotism, in many cases. Second, this form of rule was easily disregarded because of its spectacular nature; without subtler techniques of control and power, people needed only to avoid the scaffolding to resist this strategy of governance. Third, the sovereign rule only required superficial compliance: Offending people did not forsake their beliefs that offended the king; they were, instead, simply executed. As history shows, these three points incited rebellion and resistance in many places—whether this was the execution of Louis XIV in France or the gradual displacement of the monarchy in England. The outcome was that the old style of rule, the divine right of kings, was disposed of in favor of a new system of order. This is not to say that the mechanisms of sovereignty have disappeared, but rather that they are not the main strategies of governance in today’s society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425049">Deleuze, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> identified that the new social apparatus achieves governance through discipline, by creating and regulating behavior in nonviolent ways; i.e., by means of examination and normalization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> insisted that discipline was most likely to yield socially dictated outcomes when it was based on a process of (a) in-depth group understanding, (b) in-depth individual understanding, and (c) individualized correction. Consequently, nonnormative practices on the individual level are identified after a group-level examination has occurred, and deviations are to be corrected in a subtle and helpful manner. The goal is not to destroy the body, but rather, to realign people’s beliefs, ideologies, and practices so that the allegedly nonnormal person is helped, and reformed in accordance with social dictates and desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425049">Rose, 1999</xref>). The inherent power of each person (their biological power, that is) is therefore to be harnessed (Rose). Instead of fighting people, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> emphasized how the present-day approach is one of focusing and optimizing productivity.</p>
<p>The outcome of such suggestive correction is that social interference with individuals and groups whose beliefs and practices are deemed undesirable appears to be beneficent. It is generally accepted that examination and normalization is undertaken in the best interests of the people who are targeted for change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault’s (1975)</xref> insights are useful, however, in identifying how the current processes of discipline mask its sociopolitical functions; the abolishment of deviance and the continuation of a specific system of order might not benefit the individual(s) who is/are being disciplined. Consequently, even though the contemporary system of discipline has an innocent appearance—i.e., it seems as though people are helped toward a state of normalcy that is both optimal and ideal, regardless of actual outcome of purpose—it is questionable whether or not such correction actually benefits the people who are subjected to its processes of examination and normalization.</p>
<p>As the last item of importance, as part of describing discipline, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> also posited that so-called normal action alone is no longer sufficient. Instead, assimilation must be total. Unlike the sovereign system of rule, which permitted people to die while maintaining their contra-mainstream convictions, in the disciplinary system, normalization must be thorough. Both inside and out (in thought, belief, and behavior, that is), people must conform to the dictates of the social system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311425049">Holmes &amp; O’Byrne, 2006</xref>). Each person must wholeheartedly adopt, endorse, and promote the mainstream system of order. This signals that the processes of examination and normalization function not only to ensure the external manifestation of certain behaviors, but also the internal adoption/belief in mainstream social ideations and values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732311425049">
<title>Ethnography, Health, and Governance</title>
<p>If one adopts a Foucauldian lens and analyzes the increasing incorporation of ethnography in mainstream public health/population health work, the ensuing analysis is not necessarily about how ethnography can shed light on discipline and governance, but rather, it is about how ethnography functions as a technique of discipline and governance. Flowing from this vein of thinking, two points of interest arise. First, it can be argued that we are witnessing the increased production of sociobehavioral norms, many of which are extremely precise and group specific, and second, it can be suggested that researchers who undertake qualitative, culture-focused studies, i.e., ethnography, can and do, even if unknowingly and/or unintentionally, contribute to the social discipline and governance of these researched groups.</p>
<p>The first point identified above is that more sociobehavioral norms have appeared, particularly as this relates to public and population health practice. This assertion signals that target populations are becoming progressively smaller, with each being recognized as unique, distinct, and therefore, with its own set of attributes. The current population health practice of focusing on sexual subcultures, and its pervasiveness within public health work, exemplifies this postulation. For example, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) dedicates special sections of its sexual health resources to outlining how policy makers and clinicians can provide group-specific care for inmates, male and female youth, men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, immigrants, refugees, and so forth. Based on the current trend of increased ethnographic data collection, it is likely that future work by PHAC (and other health agencies around the world) will continue to expand this list of identified subpopulations. What can be seen in the current population/public health approach, therefore, is that it focuses on the identification (and construction) of multiple population norms, not the establishment of one overarching norm that applies to everyone in all situations. Measurements of the whole population are thus important, but are only considered to be one figure among many.</p>
<p>This modification from one norm to many norms suggests that the methods by which discipline and governance are exercised in the present day have become even more subtle and penetrating than they used to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311425049">Buduru &amp; Pal, 2010</xref>). One notable change that marks this process is that the archetypal molds that Foucault identified, e.g., the student, the soldier, and the factory worker, have moved beyond the limited set of characteristics which had previously rendered each of these subjectivities unique and identifiable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425049">Deleuze, 1992</xref>). There is no longer a single compendium of attributes and qualities for the student or the worker. Instead, each individual, based on time, location, and heritage, to name a few modifying factors, belongs to an identifiable subgroup that needs examination and study—the mature student, the foreign student, the distance student, for example. People’s specific context, the influence of their environment, and their group-level perceptions about freedom, health, and personal choice must be known to ensure the proper execution of discipline and governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425049">Rose, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some might argue that the foregoing changes conflict with Foucault’s work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425049">Deleuze (1992)</xref> insisted that this is not the case. In no way, he stated, does the acceptance of more norms negate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault’s (1975)</xref> arguments about discipline and governance. What maintains the system that Foucault outlined is the outcome: Although governance is executed in more subtle and suggestive fashions in contemporary society than it might have been previously, social order is nevertheless maintained by means of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425049">Rose (1999)</xref> called the appearance of freedom and choice by means of nonviolent and non-overtly-oppressive discipline. To explain further, the limited number of behavioral norms that Foucault had once described has simply multiplied to the point that many previously overlooked subgroups have become important populations for investigation and examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425049">Campbell &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>). What was once considered an abnormal subgroup has become a unique entity with its own distinct norms. The outcome of this process of progressive division and examination is not only the production of more norms, but also the creation of more norms that describe specific target populations in greater detail—intricate attributes and features that were previously unknown are brought into the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311425049">Buduru &amp; Pal, 2010</xref>). Ultimately, these new norms are based on smaller subsets, and each is much more representative and descriptive about its representative group. This new approach penetrates each group to greater depths, exposing intimate information about its members and group-level behavior that was previously unknown.</p>
<p>An important aspect of this social change is that, at a first glance, the progressive division that we are observing appears to be an expansion of acceptance; previously marginalized groups are validated and accepted as they are. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311425049">Deleuze and Guattari (1987)</xref> warned, however, that this process is actually one of capture and control. It is the same process that Foucault originally described when he discussed discipline and governance—one that does not make additional groups free from governance, but rather, which makes each group, and all of its members, more precisely subjugated to the social gaze and its control. The only difference in current society is that because more options are available, many people fail to notice that the option to say “No” is absent. Although a choice is possible, a full array of options is not. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425049">Deleuze (1992)</xref>, the outcome is an illusion about autonomy: People appear to, and might even feel that they do in fact, make free and informed choices, but they actually do not. Although people are increasingly permitted to dress and act in a variety of ways in public, this is only to a point, whereafter correction and intervention occurs. The option not to wear clothes, for example, is neither viable nor valid; some form of clothes must be worn, and likely, this selection of garments must be relatively mainstream. The option to say “No” is therefore not truly an option: one must make a choice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425049">Deleuze (1992)</xref> thus stated that free choice only exists if/when people’s comportment is deemed acceptable—and the same holds true for individuals who belong to nonmainstream or fringe populations. As a second example, even though women who have sex with women are less likely to be marginalized in many jurisdictions, and a variety of different types of homosexual or lesbian women are now accepted socially (e.g., the lipstick lesbian, the blue jeans femme, the bull dyke, to name a few), other minority sexual subcultures are still marginalized. In Canada, for one, whereas gay marriage is legal, polygamy remains illegal; this lifestyle continues to be deemed unacceptably different from mainstream social and political standards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425049">Deleuze’s (1992)</xref> nuance is therefore an important one: nonmainstream groups are only granted the freedom to make choices when it is more or less certain that the members of these groups will make what is considered by the members of mainstream society to be the correct choice.</p>
<p>As this relates to the intersections between ethnography, discipline, and governance, to ensure such obedience, culture or group-specific data can be exceedingly useful because they inform interventions that often yield targeted outcomes. In other words, the in-depth and penetrating nature of ethnographic data renders them ideal in facilitating such soft governance because, when more and more options are considered normal, individuals are presented with an expansive list of options. The lack of an option to say “No” is effaced by sheer number. One would need to actively seek, reflect, and critically examine the landscape to notice that the choice to resist mainstream dictates is never actually offered.</p>
<p>Consequently, as part of contributing toward the achievement of desired health-related outcomes, ethnographic research enhances governance because it gathers in-depth information about specific subgroups. In the health domain, this includes groups of individuals who fail, even in ways that are specific to their particular subculture, to follow mainstream ideations about the imperative of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425049">Campbell &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>). In other words, when the members of certain groups make choices and decisions that can/do produce negative health sequelae, these individuals and their practices are judged by members of mainstream society, such as public health authorities, to be improperly enjoying their freedom. Rather than punishing such behavior, however, the contemporary system that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> described, of which public health is an important component, operates by means of understanding and constructive feedback. As described above, people are examined and normalized in ways that enhance their bio-power. Ethnography answers questions about how health initiatives can be implemented in culturally specific and culturally sensitive ways to ensure that the groups which resist the imperative of health are better governed. How bio-power can be optimized to ensure that the members of certain groups are better governed becomes the question. The answer is that people must be allowed to act as they wish, provided that their behavior respects certain overarching beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311425049">O’Byrne &amp; Holmes, 2009</xref>). In the sexual health domain, an example of this process could be the increased acceptance of nonheterosexual sexual relationships, as long as these sexual contacts maintain the doctrine of safer sex and reduced sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission.</p>
<p>Building on this last example, it is relatively clear that the imperative of health remains a common benchmark for analyzing nondominant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1995</xref>). The behavioral norms of many nonmainstream subpopulations, such as those outlined by PHAC above (e.g., inmates, refuges, gay men/women), are scrutinized to determine how/why the members of these groups do not behave in ways that would maintain their health at its optimal status—as determined by measurements of health that have been established by mainstream Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1995</xref>). What has arisen, consequently, is not an entirely new approach to public health, but rather, one in which progressively smaller groups, not individuals, are seen as the important unit for measurement and evaluation. In this new system, there is an acceptance that different groups behave differently for a variety of reasons, but there is no acceptance of any behavior that does not maintain and optimize health. Individuals are likely encouraged to explore alternative sexual expressions, but only if this is done in a way that will maintain the person’s health status; sexual contacts that enhance STI transmission continue to be proscribed. Consequently, it is unsurprising that ethnography would be recognized as valuable from a mainstream perspective; it is simply a new form of data collection that produces valuable data for governance, the maintenance of social order, and the generalized imposition of the imperative of health.</p>
<p>The foregoing point about how health researchers are producing an increased number of group norms yields a second item of interest: the assertion that researchers who undertake ethnographic research, and other forms of qualitative research that focus on specific subcultures as well, often contribute, regardless of purpose or intent, to the overall array of social mechanisms that discipline and govern particular subpopulations and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311425049">Kipnis, 2008</xref>). Put in another way, ethnographers produce important data in the form of in-depth and nuanced understandings about their subpopulations of study, which inform the disciplinary processes of normalization and examination that underpin what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425049">Foucault (1975)</xref> described as the contemporary system of bio-power, discipline, and governance.</p>
<p>As this relates to the role and function of ethnographic researchers, one possible conclusion is that the investigators who undertake culture-focused studies might serve as unsuspecting disciplinary agents within an overarching society and system of discipline and governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425049">Campbell &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>). These researchers who aim to generate rigorous, thorough, and comprehensive socioculture investigations, function in this perhaps undesirable role because they identify the norms, which might be called research themes, findings, or results, which pervade and permeate given target populations. Ethnographers thus generate the knowledge that operates within and ultimately underpins the Foucauldian power/knowledge sequence of discipline and governance, because these researchers inspect, analyze, and dissect the intricate and intimate details associated with many previously overlooked groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311425049">Kipnis, 2008</xref>). Just as madness was once “brought into the light” by medical practitioners such as Philippe Pinel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311425049">Foucault, 2006</xref>, p. 530), it now appears as though ethnographers have joined this disciplinary process of exposure and scrutinization; i.e., examination and normalization.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that this outcome often occurs as part of the research process and not as a result of any ethnographer’s desire to enhance discipline or governance. In many instances, in fact, ethnographic researchers might wish to address and minimize issues related to social justice, empowerment, or discrimination. What is important to consider, nevertheless, is that unintended outcomes can and do occur. Despite best intentions, governance can increase. For example, although many ethnographic researchers might never engage in any form of Foucauldian normalization, they still serve as agents in this disciplinary system because the findings they produce can be used ex post facto, i.e., beyond, after, and outside of the control of these researchers, to guide the delivery of culturally specific care for members of the investigated target groups in clinical, policy, and service delivery situations. The outcome in the public/population health domain is that the findings which arise from some ethnographic studies are drawn on during subsequent situations when clinicians, policy makers, and others attempt to have the members of certain nondominant groups achieve the same health status outcomes that are enjoyed by individuals from mainstream society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425049">Campbell &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1995</xref>). This sequence of events is apparent when one considers how Canada’s Public Health Agency adopts the findings of ethnographic and other culture-focused qualitative research during the design and/or implementation phases of sexual health service provision for the specific subcultures; e.g., refugees, inmates, youth, and so forth.</p>
<p>The consequence of this process is that, whether intentionally or not—and even in cases when a researcher’s purpose for engaging in cultural research is to challenge the supremacy of one group over others, as might occur in poststructuralist ethnography—ethnographic data can contribute to the governance and discipline process. Consequently, ethnographic researchers generate the norms that can be used in the examination and normalization process, notwithstanding intention. The data that arise from this form of research are thus both ideal and necessary for informing the techniques and system of discipline and governance because of the in-depth, penetrating nature of these research findings; they describe the specific nuances about different groups, about the local narratives and insider perspectives about specific behaviors, practices, and other phenomena, and they permit sophisticated comparisons to be made between specific subgroups and the norms of the overarching mainstream society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311425049">Ferguson, 2002</xref>). In this way, ethnography serves a disciplinary goal. It is an examination that determines in-depth, intimate, and group-specific data that can be used after the fact to identify how/why certain groups differ from or fail to achieve the dictates of mainstream society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, however, one must be careful not to automatically reject or condemn ethnography because its results can be used in the disciplinary, governance, and bio-power processes of examination and normalization. Instead, it is important to recognize that a relationship exists between these items, and to remain cognizant of it if and as one executes this form of research. An outright rejection of this data-collection method would be to disregard a useful approach to research that has demonstrated both effectiveness and strategic benefit. Accordingly, it is an awareness that this data-collection strategy, which some people believe is outright emancipatory, and the Foucauldian processes of discipline and governance, that is important.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because ethnography has become an increasingly accepted data-collection method, it is important to critically analyze the meaning and significance of such incorporation. If one assumes a Foucauldian perspective for such an analysis, then, in some situations of public and population health work, ethnography has become a subtle method for decreasing the occurrence of practices and behaviors that contravene the imperative of health ideology—a system of thinking that pervades mainstream society and health work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425049">Lupton, 1995</xref>). It is a strategy wherein members of the majority can learn the specific cultural norms of minority/ marginalized groups, and then use this information to help these nonmainstream individuals behave according to the dictates of mainstream society. Considered in another way, ethnography can be considered a research method that enables in-depth data collection about the specific cultures that do not, in whatever way, correspond with the ideals, standards, and/or values of the hegemonic group. It is a research approach which, regardless of one’s paradigmatic perspective, generates the information that is needed to design health-related interventions that realign the practices and beliefs of the members of a group with the overarching idea about the importance and imperative of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311425049">O’Byrne, 2007</xref>). From this perspective, ethnography has become a disciplinary and bio-political tool. It permits the processes of normalization and examination because it identifies the benchmarks that can be used thereafter as the basis of comparison. Indeed, properly executed ethnographic studies should discern cultural norms; they should reveal mainstream beliefs, practices, likes and dislikes; they should highlight the perspectives, beliefs, and values of target populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425049">Hammersely &amp; Atkinson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The consequence of this situation is that researchers who undertake ethnographic studies must be cognizant that their work might be incorporated into a larger strategy to assimilate, not empower, the members of many minority groups. Ethnography might, therefore, become a tool by which nondominant ideologies, beliefs, and systems of thought are understood and eradicated in the name of beneficence. In the realm of sexual health, public health authorities can use one’s culture-based studies about minority subgroups to help the members of these groups achieve specific health outcomes that are deemed important and worthwhile by members of the mainstream society; for example, the reduction of STI transmission. As noted above, however, such a situation does not signal any need to abandon ethnographic research approaches. Instead, it simply constitutes a warning: If one’s goal in undertaking ethnographic research is to resist mainstream social dictates, then methodology is not enough. If resistance is one’s goal, one cannot rely uncritically on certain qualitative research strategies which might at one point have been considered contra-mainstream. As the system of discipline and governance changes, the outcomes and effects of one’s work must also be addressed—and it is such a call for action and analysis that is called for here. As previously marginalized research strategies gain greater acceptance within mainstream research, academic, and health circles, new forms of resistance must be developed. It is now the time for such change to occur; beforehand, however, further analysis on this topic is required.</p>
