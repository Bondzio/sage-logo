<abstract>
<p>Indigenous People’s Organisations (IPOs) are emerging agents in Nepal. The Nepal Chepang Association (NCA) is a well-known IPO actively involved in development projects. It is also led by a member of the Nepalese Constituent Assembly who is himself closely affiliated with an outside political party. NCA members juggle non-political responsibilities, such as those relating to development with political responsibilities, thus requiring them to navigate different situations. It is through development projects that NCA attracts its members, yet keeping members satisfied when development projects have reached their end is a challenge. Based on interviews with NCA members, staff, leaders and non-Chepang supporters, this article will illustrate NCA’s different roles and changing perceptions towards the Chepang in Nepal.</p>
