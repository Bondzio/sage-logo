<p>On a sunny day in May 1983 a section of the youth of Mamfe-Akuapem in south-eastern Ghana – reeking heavily of alcohol and marijuana, armed with machetes and pick-axes and angrily singing war songs, drumming and dancing – went to the residence of Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III, their queen mother. Their mission was very simple. They were to inform her of their plans to demolish the billboard which welcomed motorists and visitors on their arrival in the town. According to them, the billboard was inhabited by an evil spirit responsible for the general incidence of unemployment and the absence of development in the town.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On a sunny day in May 1983, the youth of Mamfe-Akuapem in southeast Ghana marched angrily to Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III, their queen mother, at her residence. They reeked heavily of alcohol and marijuana, were armed with machetes and pick-axes, and sang war songs, drummed and danced. They informed the queen mother that they had detected their town and destiny had been ‘bracketed’ by witches. When the queen mother demanded proof of their allegation, they pointed to the billboard welcoming motorists and visitors as evidence (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III; and Mamfehemea [queen mother of Mamfe]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611427014">1</xref></sup> They further pointed out that they believed the town’s bewitchment accounted for their unemployment and the general lack of development in the town. They were, therefore, going to exorcise the devilish ‘bracket’ so as to reverse its curse on them in order for them to succeed in life. Who created the ‘bracket’ and for what purpose is one of the subjects of this article. In addition, the article will look at how the youth intended to exorcise the ‘bracket’. Moreover, the article will also highlight the outcome of the youth’s visit to the queen mother’s house.</p>
<p>I argue that the onset that the youth’s predicament was associated with the historical development of Mamfe, one of the 17 principal towns in the Akuapem state. In addition, I argue also that the youth’s action was a reaction to national development instead of a local one. Although they did blame the billboard per se, they rightly identified the billboard as a marker of national development that left some communities without links to the national and international economy.</p>
<p>The youth’s march to deal with what they considered an impediment to their wellbeing was instructively akin to similar actions on the national front at the same period. This was the era of Ghana’s 31st December revolution that, according to Paul Nugent, was designed initially ‘to unite a diverse constituency, including the lower echelons of the armed forces, workers, radical intellectuals and the peasantry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611427014">1995</xref>: 40–1). The revolution was staged to overthrow the democratically-elected government of ex-president Hilla Liman. It was led by Flt. Lt. Jerry John Rawlings backed by other junior officers of the military. It was used to ‘draw a circle around sections of society that were regarded as bastions of the old order,’ represented by businessmen, professionals and especially chiefs who had exploited and dehumanized the masses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611427014">Nugent, 1995</xref>). Under the controversial slogan, ‘we no go sit down’ (we shall not sit unconcerned), junior military personnel, workers below managerial level, and the youth were emboldened to question and/or challenge people in high places over policies and actions which they considered detrimental to national development and inimical to workers’ interest and welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611427014">2</xref></sup> That the youth of Mamfe took inspiration from these developments to execute their plans is an understatement. As a matter of fact, most of the youth were members of the revolutionary organs – the People’s Defense Committee (PDC) established in the wake of the 31st December Revolution held secret meetings to plan their activities. This notwithstanding, the youth’s actions were an important departure from national ones. For instance, whereas across the nation, the organizations’ actions were antagonistic to chiefs and traditional leaders, the one by Mamfe youth was not. After planning and mobilizing resources and logistics in secrecy, the youth sought to seek the blessings of their traditional leaders for their action. In spite of the fact that Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III defused the problem, I further argue that the youth saw the traditional leaders as indispensable allies in the fight to revoke a curse hanging on the town and its people. Moreover, their approach demonstrated the fact that youthful revolutionary zeal does not always have the power to challenge established authorities, especially in rural contexts where elites such as the queen mother were adept at defusing the problem. Herein lies the importance of the literature on revolutionary youth, especially that of Jay Straker to this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611427014">Straker, 2009</xref>). The Mamfe youth – like Straker’s youth in Sekou Toure’s Guinea – in spite of believing in the revolutionary ideals of their time, had different perspectives and aspirations that did not interlock with the agenda of their revolutionary mentors. In effect, the 1983 incident in Mamfe amply demonstrated that there were actually many different levels of revolution in Ghana at the time.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the practices of blaming spiritual forces as the cause of one’s predicament and the attendant need to exorcise it has an insightful historical precedence in Ghanaian socio-cultural development. From the early to mid-20th century, Akan societies in southern Ghana were flooded with anti-witchcraft shrines where witchcraft accusations and exorcism took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611427014">Debrunner, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611427014">Parish, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611427014">2000</xref>). This development, that later spread into the interior of the country, including Asante, has received wide attention by several scholars (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611427014">Goody 1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611427014">1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611427014">McLeod, 1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611427014">1975</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611427014">McCaskie, 1981</xref>). The widespread nature of the practice coupled with the modus apprendi of most practitioners has understandably contributed to generalizations regarding the origins and explanation, a development Thomas McCaskie rightly regards as presenting ‘a resistant difficulty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611427014">McCaskie, 1981</xref>: 125). In their quest to provide explanations to the phenomenal spread of anti-witchcraft hunting, these works failed to take into account local dynamics and variations in terms of personnel and interpretations and/or remedies offered by the cults to their clients. This cannot be said of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611427014">McCaskie’s (1981)</xref> work that brilliantly uses a case-study approach to establish the historicity and the rationale behind the cases he talked about. Much as the Mamfe episode revolved around belief in witchcraft, I am hesitant to situate it within the context of those discussed by McCaskie. In its peculiar setting, the Mamfe youth were faced with a perceived threat from witchcraft. However, they did not seek remedies from a cult or a shrine but, in the spirit of the revolutionary era already pointed out, decided to exorcise the evil spirit through their own agency, albeit with the help of the ancestors. It was for this reason that they mobilized the necessary ‘weaponry,’ including pickaxes and machetes. As we would see later, they ‘failed’ to bring about the change they sought, though Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III succeeded to ‘exorcise’ their stomachs.</p>
<p>Studies that establish a correlation between the cocoa industry and the high incidence of witchcraft accusation provide an insightful framework for this article. Here the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611427014">Margaret Field (1960)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611427014">Hans Debrunner (1961)</xref> are very important. According to these authors, the cocoa industry resulted in corruption of the traditional social system and generated anxiety in societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611427014">Debrunner, 1961</xref>: 61–75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611427014">Field, 1960</xref>: 174; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611427014">Ishii, 2005</xref>). On the one hand, successful cocoa producers like their equally-successful young literate folks became the envy of their less unfortunate compatriots who sought to ruin the former through witchcraft (Interview, Opanin Kofi Manteyaw).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611427014">3</xref></sup> At the same time, the era of unprecedented wealth generated by cocoa-producing communities, including Mamfe, opened the flood gate for individuals who could not situate themselves in the emerging cocoa and allied economy to blame other forces for their predicament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909611427014">4</xref></sup> An intriguing twist to the development was that it offered lazy and irresponsible people, especially men, the chance to hide behind the blame of witchcraft to cover up their self-inflicted predicament. The same scenario I argue underscored the action of the Mamfe youth. While not dismissing the presence of a considerable number of employed youth in town at the time, there was a considerable number of youth who, even when offered opportunity of employment in Accra and Koforidua – the two immediate neighboring urban centers and where a number of their compatriots had gone to work – failed or refused to take advantage of it. Similarly, they ‘turned down’ invitations from their compatriots who had gone to Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire to seek greener pastures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909611427014">5</xref></sup> Instead they chose to stay home and blame evil forces (Interview, Prof. MA Kwamena-Poh).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909611427014">6</xref></sup> Some of the blame for the lack of employment was the responsibility of the youth. But Mamfe township in general, as we shall see later, was a victim of the economic downturn in Mamfe brought about by the unexpected decline of the cocoa industry in the Akuapem area. Their condition was further worsened by the construction of the Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi motor highway that was constructed to ease traffic pressure on the winding and hilly road across the Akuapem area and also to shorten the long distance from the interior to the coast.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909611427014">7</xref></sup> The development of the ‘new’ road network marked the downturn of Mamfe’s pastry and related industries and, subsequently, the stagnation of the town, resulting in the youth march on the queen mother.</p>
<p>Finally, this article speaks to the larger scholarship on recent African history, particularly on trade, migrations, borders and socio-cultural and identity formations in the historical development of African people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611427014">Amin, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611427014">Chapman and Prothero, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611427014">Curtin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611427014">Hart, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611427014">Langevang and Gough, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611427014">Manuh, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611427014">2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021909611427014">8</xref></sup> Particularly relevant to this article is the work of Toyin Falola and Aribidesi Usman discussing people who, for one reason or another, choose to stay back home when others move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611427014">Falola and Usman, 2009</xref>). The history of Mamfe was shaped by the movement of its people pursuing economic opportunities at home and abroad for their wellbeing and the development of the town. As a result, those who left home to work occasionally sent remittances to their families back home. This notwithstanding, those who remained at home deemed it proper to help themselves. It was understandable therefore that, when that became impossible, the youth – as in the episode under discussion – felt they owed it to themselves and the town at large to liberate themselves from the bewitchment that has impoverished them and not to always depend on their diasporan friends and relations. For this reason, this article would further argue that remittances, though helpful, were not a substitute to the agency of the youth as they sought to fulfill their aspirations. Though they may fail in their efforts as it happened in Mamfe, it cannot be denied that they made an effort to confront their adversary, albeit unsuccessfully.</p>

<title>Belief in Witchcraft</title>
<p>To the average Mamfe citizen, like other Ghanaians, witchcraft and the power of witches to cause misfortune are a reality (Interview, Opanin Adjei Yeboah);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021909611427014">9</xref></sup> Ghanaians, when faced with sudden and unexpected sickness, epidemic diseases, child sickness or alcoholism tend to attribute these to witches and wizards. Also attributable to witchcraft are: conjugal problems; reproductive difficulties like barrenness and impotence; unemployment, crop and business failure; and motor accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611427014">Adinkra, 2008</xref>: 301). These attributes notwithstanding, Mamfe society distinguished between beneficent witches – <italic>bayi fitaa</italic> (white witchcraft) – and maleficent witchcraft – <italic>bayi fi</italic> (disgusting witchcraft; Interview, Opanin Adjei Yeboa).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021909611427014">10</xref></sup> Whereas the former is credited with using its spiritual power for the advancement of its people, mostly the individual him/herself, family members and members of the community, the latter is accused of using its power to cause harm to its victim(s). Of the two, <italic>bayi fitaa</italic> obviously is the most desired and cherished, and therefore left undisturbed; but the same cannot be said of <italic>bayi fi</italic> (Interview, Opanin Adjei Yeboah). It has to be ‘hunted’ from wherever it may be, and exorcised, if not killed (Interview, Opanin Adjei Yeboah).</p>
<p>It is also believed that witches and wizards are nocturnal. For this reason, they operate by transmogrifying themselves from human form to non-human creatures (Interview, Opanin Adjei Yeboah; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611427014">Adinkra, 2008</xref>: 308). Likewise, they transform their victims and together ‘travel’ with them in the air to their ‘meeting’ places where they execute their diabolical intentions. The meeting place can also serve as their permanent abode. Such belief explains the predictable hunting and exorcising of witches through spiritual means, a development that became widespread in the Gold Coast (Ghana) in the early part of the 20th century. Although the Mamfe youth decided to hunt the witches and wizards who had ‘put’ the town in brackets, they opted for a different approach. They planned to pull down the billboard and set it ablaze with the hope that, by so doing, the demon in it would be expelled and eternally destroyed.</p>

<sec id="section3-0021909611427014">
<title>Role of Queen Mothers</title>
<p>The power and status of women in traditional governance in Africa have received considerable attention by scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611427014">Odotei, 2006</xref>: 81).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021909611427014">11</xref></sup> As a result, there have emerged two schools of thought whereby one seeks to portray queen mothers as subordinates and therefore of inferior status in relation to chiefs, who are predominantly males. The second school is based on dual or separate spheres of authority and sees queen mothers as occupying positions that are parallel and complementary to those of chiefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611427014">Odotei and Awedoba, 2006</xref>: 81). While I do not intend to delve deeply into the debate in this article, I would argue that the power and status of queen mothers in a given society is dependent on the mode of succession to office and the inheritance of property. Generally, among the Akan people of Ghana, the queen mother is considered the female counterpart of the chief who in most cases was a male. In that regard, among other roles, she has the power to act in the absence of the chief. Moreover, she is considered the mother of the community and therefore has the right to admonish troublesome members, including the youth of the community. She also provides food and drinks to the people, especially during festivals and emergencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021909611427014">12</xref></sup> Although Mamfe was a Guan town, it has since the 1730s been governed along the lines of the Akan-type chieftaincy institution that allows its queen mother to perform such roles. It was for this reason that the youth on that fateful day had to interact with Nana Ansa Sasraku III in their bid to ‘liberate’ themselves from the perceived curse.</p>

<sec id="section4-0021909611427014">
<title>Brief History of Mamfe</title>
<p>Mamfe, located midway on the Accra-Aburi-Koforidua motor highway, is generally recognized as a Guan town. According to oral tradition, it was founded by four trading friends: Kwadwo Toku from Adanse; Abbey from Grand Popo; Akote from Gyaman; and Asamoah from Sehwi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021909611427014">13</xref></sup> These men were later joined by Guan people from Larteh and neighboring towns who had been farming in the area, and by Krobo ‘exiles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021909611427014">14</xref></sup> Mamfe, like the existing Guan communities on the Akuapem Hills, was an independent city-state governed by priestly rulers who maintained powerful shrines, including the present day <italic>Topre</italic> shrine located at the south-eastern corner of the town close to the Mamfe-Akropong highway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Crucial to the development of Mamfe was the rise and expansion of the Akwamu Empire which, at its peak, dominated the whole of the Akuapem hills and the greater part of the south-eastern Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 15, 20, 21–8, 136–8; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611427014">Wilks, 2001</xref>). The initial result of the Akwamu presence in the area was the displacement of the priestly rulers and the eventual emergence of the Akan-type chieftaincy institution established by Akyem ‘settlers’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611427014">Ayesu [2011]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh [1973</xref>: 45–71] for discussions on the evolution of the Akan-type chieftaincy institution in Akuapem). Incidentally, the coming of the Akyem settlers to Akuapem was made possible following the invitation extended to them by the Guan priestly leaders to help defeat their Akwamu overlords. Before then, the former’s attempt to overthrow the overlordship of the latter did not succeed (for developments leading to the coming of the Akyem ‘settlers’ to Akuapem see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611427014">Ayesu, 2011</xref>: 100–53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 21–44; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611427014">Wilks, 2001</xref>). But the Akyem ‘settlers’ were able to do that and thereafter established the Akan-type chieftaincy institution to administer the state. As part of the administration, the Akuapem area was divided into five divisions with the Akyem ‘settlers’ made the paramount division with its headquarters at Akropong. The other group was made the <italic>Gyaase</italic> division and stationed station at Amanokrom. Mamfe was placed under what became the <italic>Benkum</italic> (Left) division of the new state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 45–71; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611427014">Ayesu, 2011</xref>). In addition, the day-to-day administration and welfare of the people of Mamfe, like all the other Akuapem towns, was placed under a chief who was assisted by a council of elders, including the queen mother (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III and Osabarima Ansa Sasraku). The chief and his elders were responsible for the security of their people; their people went to them in times of calamities and threats from all forces, including witches and wizards. Herein lies the reason why the youth of Mamfe sought to inform Nana Ansa Sasraku III of their plans to destroy the controversial billboard. And when it turned out that the latter was out of town at the time he was needed, the former went to the queen mother, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Akwamu presence and the subsequent emergence of the Akyem ‘settlers’ on the Akuapem hills brought Mamfe into the limelight of the Europeans’ trading activities on the Gold Coast. From Mamfe and surrounding areas Akwamu merchants, in addition to annual slaves obtained from the area, were able to supply Danes and Dutch traders in Accra food stuffs including maize and palm products (Interview, AA Anti and Nana Addo Birikorang; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 95–6). The trading links with the Europeans at the coast strengthened following the overthrow of the Akwamu imperial order and the creation of the Akuapem state in the 1730s. By and large, the establishment of a centralized administration under the Akan-type chieftaincy institution brought to an end the large-scale enslavement of the people by Akwamu. The people were therefore free to go about their farming activities without fear.</p>
<p>Before then, Mamfe, in spite of its former status as one of the vassals of the Akwamu Empire and its proximity to the coast, did not benefit directly from the European trade (Interview, Prof. Kwamena-Poh). This was because the town, like other Akuapem towns, was reduced to an outlying area where Akwamu obtained foodstuffs and slaves to sell to the Europeans. Moreover, in spite of the fact that Akwamu stationed a resident at Aburi, not far from Mamfe, it placed a high premium on the operations of its residents in Accra where it had direct contacts with the European traders whose forts and castles stood close by.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021909611427014">15</xref></sup> All this changed when Asante took over control of the Akuapem hills. For instance, Mamfe became effectively the eastern corridor for the transportation of people and goods to the coast from the Asante territory and vice versa. Moreover, it was relatively less troublesome than the western corridor which passed through hostile Fante inland states; and Akyem Kotoku, a traditional ‘brother’ state of Akyem Abuakwa, both of which had repeatedly resisted with fluctuating success Asante’s imperial advancement to the coast (Interview, Prof. Addo-Fening; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611427014">Fynn, 1971</xref>). Occupying such an advantageous position, Mamfe therefore experienced tremendous growth as its people traded and provided services to the north- and south-bound traders passing through the town, a condition which persisted until the late 1960s when the Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi highway (discussed earlier) was constructed.</p>

<title>The Basel Mission in and Around Mamfe</title>
<p>Mamfe became a beneficiary of yet another development on the Akuapem hills. This was the advent of the Basel Mission during the first half of the 19th century. The Basel Mission, which had until then operated unsuccessfully at Osu, near Accra, moved to the Akuapem hills, under the leadership of Andreas Riis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 112–16; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611427014">Beeko, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611427014">Smith, 1966</xref>). Agents of the mission, after establishing rapport with the Akuapem paramountcy, set out to evangelize and to win souls for Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 2005</xref>). After initial setbacks, including the deaths of Riis’ pioneering colleagues, the mission started winning converts and started a vigorous expansion into other Akuapem towns. Mamfe became one of the first out-stations with the establishment of a church in 1859 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 1973</xref>: 115, 116–23). In addition to the establishment of churches and schools, the mission introduced European-type architecture and a nursery for the cultivation of fruits and crops, including cocoa that was not indigenous to the Gold Coast.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021909611427014">16</xref></sup> The outcome of these developments was the emergence of artisans and agriculturalists trained by the mission to provide the needed labor for its projects. While the artisans constructed houses for both converts and non-converts of the town, the nursery assistants made available to their kinsmen and the general public, obviously for a fee, their acquired skills in crop cultivation (Interview, Clement Atiemo).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021909611427014">17</xref></sup> The mission’s agricultural activities provided the people of Akuapem in general with a head start in the production of cocoa, when the crop was first introduced, on a large scale by Tetteh Kwasi (Quarshie) of Mampong in 1876 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Mamfe Women: Domesticated, Yet Independent</title>
<p>Another by-product of the Basel mission presence in Mamfe was the birth of the confection industry. This started first as a housewifery initiative that was geared towards the training of the ideal Protestant wife and mother and was part of the broad civilizing agenda which has recently engaged the attention of scholars, including Jean Allman and many others, as they study the varied aspects of colonization in Africa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611427014">Allman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611427014">van Tol, 2007</xref>). Under the program, European women – especially spouses of mission agents – were encouraged by the mission boards back home in Europe to teach their African counterparts the making of confections, including cake, bread, coconut cookies (<italic>polo</italic>), doughnuts, meat pie and tarts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021909611427014">18</xref></sup> The training offered to these females quickly spread and was taken up by many Mamfe women. An intriguing outcome of this, something that has not been given much attention by scholars, was the backlash against the idea of domesticity of women. Mamfe women in particular and Akuapem women in general participated actively in the training program. They acquired the techniques in every facet of the production line and took advantage of the large volume of traders passing through the eastern corridor to produce and/or sell confections. As a result, they acquired wealth and made their dependence on husbands, and men in general, unnecessary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021909611427014">19</xref></sup> The confection industry, though ongoing in Mamfe, is much less significant since the construction of the Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi highway.</p>
<p>The cocoa industry offered Mamfe yet another boost in its development. Armed with the skills from the Basel mission agricultural enterprise, Mamfe citizens, like their Akuapem compatriots, took a pioneering role in cocoa production to establish large farms on the Akuapem hills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611427014">Kwamena-Poh, 2005</xref>). So phenomenal was Mamfe and Akuapem’s patronage of cocoa farming and production that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611427014">Polly Hill (1970)</xref> has aptly described the development as a ‘silent revolution. They took to cocoa farming first on an experimental basis but were quick to realize its potential and therefore soon engaged in full-scale farming. In most cases it became a family industry, but outsiders were hired from time-to-time to assist, especially when the family became overwhelmed with the volume of work due to the size of the farm, and/or the indisposition of a member, or both. Usually the men were responsible for the initial clearing of the bush to prepare the grounds for planting. Women were assisted by their older children to nurse the seedlings until they were due for transplanting, usually after a period of six weeks (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021909611427014">20</xref></sup> The transplanting followed the process of division of labor and it involved active participation of women and children, who transferred the seedlings and planted them on the farm. The men for their part prepared the ground by digging and spacing holes in which the seedlings were planted. After planting, the main task left behind was the occasional weeding (brushing) around the young plants until their fruits (pods) matured to be harvested. Here again, the women and their older children transported pots harvested by the men to designated areas for the cocoa beans to be spilled from the pots. The beans were then left to ferment, after which the women and children transferred them to the house to be dried under observation (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III). They would again assist in carrying the dried beans to the marketing center in the middle of the town where mostly men were in charge of the sale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021909611427014">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were setbacks, though. The hilly nature of Akuapem lands coupled with the weak porous nature of its soils could not sustain a prolonged cultivation of cocoa. In the face of this development, Mamfe citizenry, like other compatriots in Akuapem towns, migrated to other places, especially nearby Akyem Abuakwa, and as far as Wassa and Twifo in the central region of Ghana. In addition, some went to Asante (Akropong) and Brong Ahafo regions. The forest cover of these areas was thick, making soils richer in nutrients and ideal for prolonged cocoa farming. Like the beginnings of the industry in Akuapem, the movement to these areas was significant and created competing migration as no one wanted to be left behind in search for wealth, a development that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611427014">Hill (1970)</xref> has instructively discussed.</p>

<title><italic>Offie</italic> (Home Town) and the Farmstead: Mamfe (Akuapem) Migrants</title>
<p>This article’s departure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611427014">Hill’s (1970)</xref> work as far as Mamfe is concerned is the paradox of the migratory story. On the one hand, the foreign lands provided the migrants with a fresh beginning in cocoa production and accumulation of wealth. With their wealth they went back home to attend funerals of relatives and loved ones (Interview, Opanyin Asare Manteyaw).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021909611427014">22</xref></sup> Additionally, they went home to participate in the annual <italic>Ohum</italic> and <italic>Odwira</italic> festivals (Interview, Opanyin Asare Manteyaw, Opanyin Kwasi Anakwa, and Madam Abena Kroma)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021909611427014">23</xref></sup> Mindful of their migratory status, Mamfe citizenry glorified their Akuapem origins which they called <italic>Offie</italic> (Home; Akuapem migrants were often heard telling their neighbors ‘me ko offie’ [I am going home]). <italic>Offie</italic> became the repository of the wealth from cocoa. For instance, at the end of each cocoa season, which coincided with Ohum and Odwira festivals, migrants sent money home from which they built new houses or renovated old ones (Interview, Opanyin Asare Manteyaw, Opanyin Kwasi Anakwa, and Madam Abena Kroma). Furthermore, they made donations to bereaved families, especially for funerals they could not attend due to pressure of work on their farms. Some also took steps to marry, preferring a ‘home’-based marriage to marrying the ‘foreigners’ they lived with (Interview, Opanyin Asare Manteyaw, Opanyin Kwasi Anakwa, and Madam Abena Kroma).</p>
<p>The migration, in addition to taking away a sizeable portion of Mamfe population, also took away job openings for youth who had been employed to supplement family labor on the farms (Interview, Prof. Kwamena-Poh, Nana Ansa Sasraku III, and Opanin Afoakwa Pobi). In addition, operators of auxiliary industries, including flour and corn mills associated with the confection business, curtailed their operations or worked below their normal capacity (Interview, Prof. Kwamena-Poh, Nana Ansa Sasraku III, and Opanin Afoakwa Pobi). These trends effectively retarded the development and created mass unemployment of the youth who, for various reasons, could not join the ‘cocoa exodus’ (Interview, Mr CA Ofori, and Mr Gladstone Williams).</p>

<sec id="section8-0021909611427014">
<title>The Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi Highway</title>
<p>The economic downturn in Mamfe was further exacerbated by the construction of the Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi highway. Following the government of Ghana’s decision to further develop the existing road network in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it embarked on comprehensive road rehabilitation and expansion to meet challenges posed by the country’s ailing railway system and the increasing use of articulated trucks (Interview, Prof. Kwamena-Poh).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021909611427014">24</xref></sup> One such road was the Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi road that ran parallel close to the historic Accra-Mamfe-Kumasi one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021909611427014">25</xref></sup> The people of Mamfe were apprehensive when plans for the road became public. Driving through the historic eastern corridor involved traveling on a winding, narrow and hilly network that was not good for articulated trucks loaded with goods. To this end, the new road, with its relative broad and flat network, had become more attractive to motorists carrying goods to and from the northern sector of the country. Consequently the Mamfe route was left with remarkably limited patrons, a development that worsened its economic decline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0021909611427014">
<title>Mamfe Billboard</title>
<p>Another development associated with the government’s road program and which is central to this article was the erection of billboards and road signs. Under this segment of the program, billboards and road signs were to be repaired or given facelifts and, where not available, were to be erected for the purpose of directing motorists and beautifying the roadsides (Interview, Mr CA Ofori, and Mr Gladstone Williams). Mamfe has two historical billboards. One of these was located in the intersection of the Accra-Mamfe-Akropong and Mamfe-Adawso-Koforidua roads and it directed motorists traveling to any of these towns which direction to take. The other one, located on the Mamfe-Amanokrom common boundary, had ‘Mamfe’ written on it to welcome motorists and travelers to the Mamfe township. The two billboards were dilapidated wooden structures that had not been repaired or painted for decades, and therefore needed to be repaired or replaced by the government. As a result, officials of the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA), the government agency responsible for road maintenance, replaced them with ‘beautiful’ new ones (Interview, Mr CA Ofori, and Mr Gladstone Williams). In an apparent effort to underscore the beautification aspect of the road program, the GHA officials, without any consultation with the people, went ahead to erect a ‘custom-made’ billboard with special borderlines around the town’s name, ‘Mamfe’. Ironically, the borderline incited the ire of the youth and led to their march to Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III on that fateful day in May 1983.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0021909611427014">
<title>Aesthetics and Representation</title>
<p>To the youth, there was nothing beautiful about the billboard welcoming motorists and travelers to the town. Instead they saw the borderline as parenthesis (brackets), and argued instructively that there is nothing good about putting words in parentheses because they saw the design as an evil omen (Interview, Kwame Date Baah [aka ‘No Danger], Kwasi Akote, and Kofi Koram).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021909611427014">26</xref></sup> More specifically, the youth drew a correlation between the absence of employment avenues in Mamfe on the one hand, and the high incidence of alcoholism among the youth on the other. They were therefore unanimous in their conclusion that a curse had been invoked on Mamfe and its people (Interview, Kwame Date Baah [aka ‘No Danger], Kwasi Akote, and Kofi Koram).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0021909611427014">27</xref></sup> To this end, they resolved to uproot and burn the objectionable billboard. They also agreed that they would perform special rituals to revoke the curse on the town, believing that mere destruction of the billboard would not bring about the change in fortune they so desired (Interview, Kwame Date Baah [aka ‘No Danger], Kwasi Akote, and Kofi Koram). They decided not to inform Nana Ansa Sasraku III, Mamfehene (Chief of Mamfe) and Kyidomhene (Chief of the vanguard) of Akuapem and his elders of their ‘findings’ and their intended action until all necessary preparations had been made, fearing that the chief whom they considered ‘too gentle’ and pacifist would object to their action (Interview, Kofi Koram and Kwasi Akote).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0021909611427014">28</xref></sup> To this end, they alternated venues of their meetings, which they held in secrecy, and swore to one another that they would not divulge their plans even to their wives or girlfriends. However, they agreed that they would bring on board their female counterparts on the day of execution of their plans (Interview, Kofi Koram, Yaa Sika, and Kwasi Akote). All this while, the youth held secret meetings during which they formulated their modus apprendi and sourced for logistics including machetes, pickaxes, shovels, alcohol, tobacco and marijuana. In addition they purchased two cocks, black and white, which together with alcohol and gunpowder would be used for a ritual to overturn the curse (Interview, Kofi Koram, Yaa Sika, and Kwasi Akote).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0021909611427014">29</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section11-0021909611427014">
<title>‘Chief or No Chief’: Mamfe’s Day of ‘Liberation’</title>
<p>Satisfied with their preparations, the youth decided to put their plans into action. On the appointed day, they assembled at a designated spot and sent a delegation – including two women – to pay a secret visit to the chief’s residence to find out if he was available before they went there to inform him of the day’s program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0021909611427014">30</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the main body of the youth amidst singing of war songs, drumming and dancing, and clad in red from head to toe, went on a procession through the streets of Mamfe, a development which caught the older people of the town by surprise and left them wondering as to the reason behind the unfolding drama.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0021909611427014">31</xref></sup> Before then, the youth were briefed by their leaders on how their plans would be executed, and were also cautioned not to attack or cause harm to motorists or visitors coming to or traveling through the town. This precautionary measure possibly was intended to prevent the police and security agencies in the town from stopping them in their tracks. The procession at one stage degenerated into a heated argument when some of the leaders decided to call off the program. This was after the delegation sent to the chief came back with information that the latter had not returned from Accra where he had another residence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0021909611427014">32</xref></sup> Eventually, they decided to inform Nana Ansaa Sasraku III, the queen mother, who incidentally is also the biological aunt of the chief; and the next in command in the event of the chief’s absence from Mamfe (Interview, Kofi Koram and Yaa Sika).</p>
<p>Thereafter, the youth regrouped and their leaders poured libation to ask for the support and protection of the ancestors and gods of Mamfe. In addition, they took turns to drink touts of akpeteshie, a locally-made gin (Ghana’s version of America’s ‘moonshine’) ostensibly to energize themselves. Likewise, the smokers among them took turns to smoke all imaginable products including marijuana (Interview, Kofi Koram and Yaa Sika; this was confirmed by <italic>Ka na wu</italic>). Finally, they set off to the queen mother’s house amidst the singing of the ever-popular Ghanaian highlife music by AB Crentsil, and what they termed their song of liberation, ‘You devil, go away from me!’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0021909611427014">33</xref></sup> Naturally, one would at this point dismiss the youth’s action as coming from a misguided drunken/high group. But that was not the case. For they contended that exorcising the evil was a daunting task which required the drinking of alcohol and smoking of marijuana that they believed would energize them for the task ahead. Moreover, the Mamfe youth, like their counterparts in other parts of Ghana, attribute manliness to the drinking and smoking: two vital stimulants widely credited with the tendency to arouse bravery in a hitherto-docile group in the face of difficulties (For more on Ghanaian youth and alcohol, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611427014">Akyeampong, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>‘Exorcise Their Stomachs, You Exorcise the Curse’: Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III Fetes ‘Agitated’ Mamfe Youth</title>
<p>They took Nana Ama Sasraku III’s house by storm. On reaching the outskirts of the house they intensified their singing of war songs, dancing and drumming and forced their way through a narrow gate. A young attendant who was the first to sight what he described as a mob to the queen mother tried without success to stop them from entering the house. His action infuriated the youth and compelled some of them to scale the fence-wall of the house to get in (Interview, Opanin Ofosu Reynolds).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0021909611427014">34</xref></sup> The overwhelming numbers of the youth compelled the attendant to eventually open the gate to allow the queen mother’s ‘unexpected’ guests to enter the house. Once in the house, they first treated its occupants with their liberation song ‘You Devil’ and an additional 10 or so different war songs that they had rehearsed earlier at their secret meetings to give them a foretaste of their state of mind. After awhile, they demanded to see the queen mother who, ignorant of the youth’s intentions, had understandably locked herself up in one of the storerooms in the house. She had early on observed the struggle between her attendant and the youth from one of the windows in her bedroom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0021909611427014">35</xref></sup> She came out reluctantly after she realized that the youth were not ready to either leave the house or stop their singing and dancing (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0021909611427014">36</xref></sup> In a swift turn of events, she was met by instantaneous applause by her ‘guests’ (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0021909611427014">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>A pleasantly surprised Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III thereafter inquired from the youth their mission and the cause of their agitation. Without mincing words, Ka na wu (say and be dammed [not his real name since he wanted his identity to be protected for security reasons]), who had all along played the role of the spokesperson of the youth, told the queen mother what the borderline of the billboard represented and that they were in her house to inform her of it and also of their plan to uproot and burn it. The queen mother received their worrying story with apprehension and wondered how they came by their interpretation of the controversial borderline. While acknowledging Mamfe’s worsening economic condition, she, however, made a passionate appeal to them to desist from carrying through with their plans (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0021909611427014">38</xref></sup> Her noteworthy stand against their plan was that the offensive billboard was government property that could not be removed or destroyed without government consent. Moreover, she could not trust the youth’s conduct if they were to move to the site of the billboard right by the highway. But the incensed youth insisted that they would go ahead with their plans and reminded her that they did not come to ask of her permission but only inform her of what they intended to do (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III). In an apparent show of distaste of the latter’s stand, the youth spontaneously resumed the singing of war songs and threatened to ‘deal’ with her before they dealt with their target.</p>
<p>In an insightful show of diplomacy and to an instantaneous applause from the youth, Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku agreed to the demands of the youth and offered to lead and supervise the intended action (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III, Ka na wu, and Mr Anakwa Manukure). In addition, she also proposed to provide them with food which she had surreptitiously mobilized her attendants to prepare while she was talking the youth into stopping (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0021909611427014">39</xref></sup> Her offer was accepted appreciatively by the youth. They therefore stopped the singing and dancing, and abandoned their drums, machetes, pickaxes and all other implements. Thereafter, they washed their hands and sat down to be served by the queen mother who was assisted by her attendants. At the end of it all, the youth forgot their mission, and without any prompting, probably having ‘exorcised’ their stomachs with food and drinks, dispersed happily to their respective homes (Interview, Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To the youth of Mamfe Akuapem, the apparent absence of development in the town and their state of unemployment was the handiwork of witches who had put the town in ‘brackets’. While the tendency to blame witches for failure in life dates back to the early 19th century, the stand of Mamfe youth marked a remarkable departure in terms of dealing with the ‘problem’. Whereas the victims of the earlier episodes sought the services of witch-hunt shrines, the Mamfe youth looked elsewhere for a solution. They sought to use their own agency to exorcise the perceived curse on their heads. That they failed to exorcise the curse due to the queen mother’s ‘intervention’ speaks volumes of the persuasive power in the handling of crisis in the community. Their action sought to alleviate their situation. Apparently they saw Nana Ama Ansaah III’s diplomacy coupled with food and drinks as immediate satisfaction. The youth’s modus apprendi underscored the differing approaches to witchcraft ‘hunting’ in Mamfe, and for that matter Akuapem communities.</p>
<p>Mamfe youth, in a fashion similar to that of the organs of the 1980s revolution in Ghana, rejected the perpetual degradation they found themselves in and therefore resolved to ‘liberate’ themselves from the yolk imposed on them by witches. Different from their cadres, however, they refused to act without the involvement of their chief. The youth held secret meetings that did not involve their chief but in the end sought his counsel before embarking on their liberatory activity. Their actions reveal the still-important relationship between traditional leaders, especially the chiefs, and their people. Historically, the welfare of the people has been the responsibility of their leaders. Whereas the priestly class provided essential needs of the people in the prior to the 1730s, following the creation of the Akuapem state, the chiefs provided for the people. Thus the Mamfe youth did not see chiefs as the impediment to their progress but rather as the potential source of sustenance, and they were proved right when Nana Ansaah Sasraku III, acting in the absence of her nephew, Nana Ansa Sasraku III, chief of Mamfe, fed them.</p>
<p>But then, the plight of Mamfe was not the cause of witches and/or any curse. It was more the result of the dramatic dwindling of its fortune, starting with the decline of the cocoa industry in the Akuapem area. As Mamfe and Akuapem farmers abandoned Akuapem’s worn-out lands for new and fertile lands elsewhere, the economic potential of Mamfe declined. With Mamfe no longer providing employment for the people, especially the youth, its confectionary and allied industries declined as the people’s purchasing power diminished. Although its migrants came back to participate in festivals and funerals, their return was short-lived. This was because they all returned to their farms and vocations after the festivals were over. Thus the development of Mamfe – as is the case of most cities in Ghana and elsewhere – is closely linked to the movement of its people.</p>
<p>Finally, the construction of the Accra-Nsawam-Kumasi motor highway further compounded the plight of Mamfe. The relative broadness and level grade of that road as against the historic, narrow and hilly Accra-Mamfe-Kumasi one made traveling on the former faster and easier and therefore the most preferred by motorist transporting passengers and goods to and from northern Ghana. As more and more motorists took to the ‘new’ route, Mamfe’s attraction as a transit point disappeared. Consequently, whatever little trading and commercial activities were left behind by the cocoa migration were drastically reduced. This economic decline brought into sharp focus the importance of road networks to the socio-economic development of Ghanaian communities, Mamfe-Akuapem included. Thus if Mamfe and Mamfe youth had been ‘bewitched’ – and I believe they had – the real ‘witches’ were the declining fortunes of the cocoa industry in the area and the construction of an alternate route that linked southern and northern Ghana. Though a positive development, the planning and execution of the alternate route followed the proverbial top–down approach with little or no consideration for the aspirations and interest of the local people, Mamfe youth included, living around the old route.</p>

<p>I first heard of the story from Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III, Mamfehemea (queen mother of Mamfe) and a principal character in the episode under discussion in May, 1997. This happened when I visited her in her residence at Mamfe. The visit was part of my exploratory visit to Akuapem towns to establish the existence, or otherwise, of <italic>Asafo</italic> companies, a pre-colonial institution associated with the Akan-type chieftaincy institution. A noteworthy development from the exploratory visits was that I was able to identify several <italic>Asafo</italic> companies in Akuapem and consequently research into their activities which culminated in the writing of my M. Phil dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611427014">Ayesu, 1998</xref>) and a full scale research in Akuapem Chieftaincy which led to my PhD dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611427014">Ayesu, 2011</xref>) in partial fulfillment for the award of Doctor of Philosophy. A significant product of these studies is this article on Mamfe youth and for which I am eternally grateful to my royal informant, Nana Ama Ansaah Sasraku III. Meanwhile, I am also grateful to Prof. Kathleen Smythe at the History department of Xavier University, Cincinnati, OH, USA, who read the first draft of this article and offered meaningful suggestions. Her suggestions tremendously improved the article for which I am eternally grateful.</p>

<p>While not dismissing the existence – and for that matter malfeasance – of witches and wizards, a number of respondents I interviewed in Mamfe and elsewhere in Akuapem blamed some of the youth also as being too lazy to work with their hands. In fact, one respondent – Madam Dora Anakwa, a farmer and resident of Saforo, a village on the Mamfe-Adawso-Koforidua highway – argued that witches would always look for fear of being blamed for one’s predicament, and would always look out for an ‘opening’ before attacking its victim (January–February 1998). Her assertion contradicts the general notion that witches usually attack hardworking and successful people out of envy. This notwithstanding, it is worth noting that some people in Mamfe and Akuapem in general do not blame witches solely for the woes of the youth.</p>

<p>Following Ghana’s economic problems in the late 1970s, many Ghanaians, especially the youth, were forced to emigrate to Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire to work. At the time, the economies of the two countries were doing well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611427014">Falola and Usman, 2009</xref>: 14–15). For instance, the former at the time was making a lot of money from its emerging oil industry. Infrastructure expansion provided employment avenues for migrants from the West African region. Incidentally, Ghanaians’ experience in Nigeria was a mixed bag, as reflected in Ghanaian popular culture which was best portrayed in Yaw Brenya’s <italic>Ninety-nine Days in Agege: Yaw Brennya’s Experience</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611427014">1980</xref>) and the music of Abirekyieba Kofi Sammy, ‘Yellow Sister’ on his album <italic>Africa</italic>, released in the late 1970s and reproduced in 2003 by Azzurra Music Production.</p>

<p>Some of these illuminating works established the historicity of women rulers in African societies and traced it back to the period long before the European encounter on the continent. One could therefore conclude that the office, like other indigenous institutions – including priesthood – evolved as a result of local conditions. Among these works are: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611427014">Berger and White (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611427014">Johnson-Odim and Strobel (1992)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611427014">Wilks (1993)</xref>. On the other hand, a number of other works examine the authority structure and/or the role of queen mothers in the day-to-day lives of communities. A remarkable feature of these works is the showcase of form and order in female leadership. For more on this see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611427014">Akosua (1977)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611427014">Stoeltje (2003)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611427014">Wilks (1988)</xref>. Meanwhile, I would like to point out that, in spite of these scholars’ Asante focus, their subject matter generally conform to queen mothers elsewhere in at least Ghana, with that of Mamfe included. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the office of queen mother is part of the Akan-type chieftaincy institution commonly practiced with local adaptations in Ghana.</p>

<p>According to Nana Ama Ansaa Sasraku III, hardworking women did not have to wait for their husbands or boyfriends to buy them cloth and jewelry. They also did not need men to tell them what to do. And those who consulted their men on issues did so holding on to the adage that ‘two heads are better than one’. Her assertion was corroborated by several women I interviewed in the course of researching for this article. To substantiate this claim, an elderly woman in her late 80s showed me one of cloths she bought from her baking project. The cloth, typical of most cloths, was named ‘<italic>Obarima nye sumi na wode wo ti ato so</italic>’ (man is not a pillow to rely on). The name of the cloth spoke volumes of how independent women had become following their wealth from their trading activities.</p>

<p>Nana Ansa Sasraku III, unlike most other Akuapem chiefs who live in their palace, instructively lives in his father’s house. This is because the old Mamfe palace has been pulled down for a new one, which has been under construction for over a decade. The long delay in the completion of the new palace was one of the grievances of the youth and was considered as an ample attestation of their claim regarding the curse invoked on the town as manifested by the billboard which has put ‘Mamfe’ in brackets.</p>

<p>Nana Ansa Sasraku III is the Executive Director of Capricorn Impex Ltd, an Accra-based building and civil engineering construction firm. Like most Ghanaian chiefs, Nana Ansa Sasraku III, in addition to his educational background (in his case a degree holder from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi- KNUST), contrary to tradition, and like numerous other chiefs in Ghana, works full time at his company. This has become necessary in view of the fact that some of them have to ‘pay school fees, health bills and police bail, besides the cost of rituals and ceremonial services’. Thus in the words of George Hagan, chiefs ‘had to become capitalist entrepreneurs or employees to make ends meet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611427014">Hagan, 2006</xref>: 669). In retrospect, in pre-colonial times chiefs had their needs met by their people who were, responsible for his living including housing, clothes and leisure. In addition, the people were responsible for the provision of ritual items. However, these provisions ceased following the introduction of a cash economy – spearheaded by the cocoa industry in the Gold Coast – by colonial administration. The development has its obvious unmitigated results which are beyond the objective of this article.</p>
