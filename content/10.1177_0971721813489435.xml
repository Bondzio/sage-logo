<title>Introduction</title>
<p><sc>KOREA HAS ACHIEVED</sc> phenomenal economic development during the past half century, transforming itself from an agricultural economy into a technology-intensive one. Korea was one of the poorest countries in the 1960s, but it rapidly learned, adapted and created the advanced technologies necessary for the successful transformation of the economy. The actors in this rapid economic development were mainly the Government, academia and private companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971721813489435">Chung, 2002</xref>, p. 487). It was critical that the Government imported technology and funded research and development (R&amp;D) consortia in the early stage of the economic development which paved the road for the industrial growth of Korea afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971721813489435">Ahn and Mah, 2007</xref>, p. 377).</p>
<p>As explained in the endogenous economic growth models, R&amp;D activities are critical to innovation, which leads to the development of technology-intensive industries and economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971721813489435">Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0971721813489435">Ulku, 2007</xref>). The management of interactions among the actors of R&amp;D activities such as R&amp;D-related departments, academia, public institutions and private companies, together with the analysis of R&amp;D inputs and outputs, is referred to as the national innovation system (NIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489435">OECD, 1997</xref>). In general, it consists of ‘all interrelated institutional actors that create, diffuse and exploit innovations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971721813489435">Chung, 2002</xref>, p. 486), whereby not only the active role of each independent institute is crucial but also the interaction among these institutes.</p>
<p>During the development of the NIS and economic growth, <italic>chaebols</italic>, i.e. the large conglomerates in Korea, emerged into the spotlight for Korean industrial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489435">Kim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0971721813489435">Lee and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0971721813489435">Wang and Tsai, 2010</xref>). Lee and Lim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0971721813489435">2001</xref>, p. 471), for instance, extended the argument by stating that there was no structured government help except for the few trivial centres related to the industry. Nagano (2006, p. 665) contended that, while the Government’s effort in terms of R&amp;D did exist, the actual achievement of flourishing production with increasing exports and commercialisation of Korean industry was due to the private firms’ R&amp;D investment. Wang and Tsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0971721813489435">2010</xref>, p. 1415) asserted that the public research institutes played a relatively insignificant role.</p>
<p>Although it might be true that Korean <italic>chaebols</italic> played an important role in industrial development and afterwards, the Korean Government generated experienced researchers and established and maintained research institutes and centres even in the 1960s and 1970s, which was far before the private sector actors, such as <italic>chaebols</italic>, began to increase their own R&amp;D expenditures in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489435">Kim, 1997</xref>, p. 202). Therefore, it is reasonable to divide the Korean NIS into two periods, that is, an earlier period from the 1960s to the early 1980s during which the Government was mainly in charge and the latter period starting from the 1990s when the private sector led (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489435">Kim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0971721813489435">Park, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489435">Sohn and Kenney, 2007</xref>, p. 993). In the earlier stage, the Government set the foothold for the private sector to upgrade its technological capabilities by building up some necessary public research institutes and investing in education and R&amp;D. In the latter period, the private companies, big firms like <italic>chaebols</italic> in particular, led the NIS. However, even during the latter period, the Government played its own part in solidifying the national R&amp;D structure. The Government has continued to facilitate the relationship among the three main actors—government, universities and private firms—to achieve synergy from the investment—and provide firms in the technology-intensive industries with tax and financial incentives.</p>
<p>The current article explains the R&amp;D policies of Korea that the Korean Government pursued to develop industries during the process of rapid economic growth and reveals how the Korean Government has utilised public institutes in the national R&amp;D system along with its transformation of economic policies from the 1960s to the present. In addition, this article draws implications from the experience of Korea regarding the role of governments in promoting innovation and developing technology-intensive industries. The structure of the current article is as follows. The second section discusses the evolution of the R&amp;D policies of Korea. The third section shows the concrete performances of the R&amp;D policies implemented by the Government, including: R&amp;D expenditure; researchers; patents; technology exports; and the establishment of science parks, that is, so-called <italic>innopolises</italic>, to develop indigenous technologies. The fourth section provides implications for developing countries pursuing the development of more value-added technology-intensive industries with R&amp;D policies in the light of the experience of Korea. Conclusions are provided in the last section.</p>

<title>Establishment of R&amp;D-related Institutes</title>
<p>In the 1960s, as a country overcoming the aftermath of the Korean War, the Korean economy was based on labour-intensive, light industries, such as textiles and garments, taking advantage of cheap labour. Considering the lack of appropriate technology to make products, the Korean Government had to encourage turn-key capital imports along with technology learning from abroad, Japan in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489435">Jang, 2011</xref>). Since the country was at the stage of taking off and lacked its own ability to create and develop new technology, the Government did not focus on indigenous innovation but rather supported private firms in acquiring, importing and absorbing foreign technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489435">Sohn and Kenney, 2007</xref>, p. 993).</p>
<p>The Economic Planning Board (EPB) was established in 1961 to formulate, coordinate and implement the economic development plan. Its function was to establish and control economic policies, including the Five Year Economic Development Plan, which did not focus specifically on R&amp;D. However, realising that R&amp;D plays an important role in economic growth in the long run, the Government comprehended the necessity of systemised science and technology policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489435">Lim, 1999</xref>, p. 135). Therefore, it started to carry out pilot R&amp;D programmes, establishing some key institutes that were to become the main actors of R&amp;D in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489435">Sohn and Kenney, 2007</xref>, p. 997). During the 1960s, the central role of the Government was to distribute the technologies imported from advanced countries. As Lee and Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971721813489435">2006</xref>, p. 1049) showed, the Government’s R&amp;D support in the early stage of development played a significant role in all the categories of innovation in the latter period. Such a role of the Government during the 1960s set the basis for private sectors to develop their own technologies starting from the middle of 1980s.</p>
<p>The Government established the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), the first multidisciplinary research institute in Korea, in 1966 and it began to operate in 1969. As the first public research institute, it played a leading role in the technological development of automobiles, electronics, machinery, shipbuilding, petroleum refinery, steel, nonferrous metal products and other export industries. It generated tens of spin-offs that provided state-of-the-art information and technologies to experienced R&amp;D personnel as well as industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0971721813489435">Lee, Bae and Lee, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0971721813489435">KIST, www.kist.re.kr, accessed on 10 August 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the KIST constituted the centre of Korea’s national R&amp;D system and acted as an infrastructural model by providing technological feasibility studies, especially for the heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s. Realising the limit of labour-intensive industries and considering the rising wage level, the Korean Government aggressively began to promote more value-added heavy and chemical industries from 1973. The aggressive promotion of the heavy and chemical industries continued until the end of the 1970s and the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489435">Mah, 2007</xref>). Some of the main industries promoted were iron and steel, machines, shipbuilding, electronics, petrochemicals and non-ferrous metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489435">Korea Industrial Technology Association, 1986</xref>, p. 213). Immediately after the establishment of the KIST, the Ministry of Science and Technology was established in 1967 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489435">Lim, 1999</xref>, p. 135–139). Throughout this period, internalising imported technology and reverse engineering had been the main science and technology policy in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489435">Jang, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) was established in 1971 and has educated many young and talented scientists. The KIST had performed R&amp;D activities until the middle of 1970s but it seemed to be difficult for one institute alone to meet the massive future technology demand from the industries. Thus, the Government enacted a law promoting the establishment of specialised government-supported research institutes that could provide technologies to each specific industry in 1974<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0971721813489435">1</xref></sup> and established the public research institutes during the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971721813489435">Chamarik and Goonatilake, 1994</xref>). Some of the government-funded research institutes established and promoted after the law enacted are representatively, KAIST, Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS), Korea Ginseng &amp; Tobacco Research Institute, Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Evaluation and Planning and others. Appendix shows the major laws relating to science and technology of Korea.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0971721813489435">Table 1</xref> shows the changing tendency of the budget allocation to and areas of research of KIST and KAIST. Although the R&amp;D budget allocated to KIST was as small as .5 billion Korean won, it increased by 48 times to 22 billion Korean won in 1990. It increased rapidly during the 1990s in particular despite economic crisis in 1998. It reached 245 billion Korean won in 2011. The amount of R&amp;D budget allocated to KAIST increased significantly as well from 90 billion Korean won in 2002 to 261 billion Korean won in 2011.</p>

<p>To support various industries belonging to the heavy and chemical sector, the Government established the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, the Korea Institute of Chemical Research and the Korea Research Institute of Shipbuilding, among others, in the middle of 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0971721813489435">Lee, Bae and Lee, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971721813489435">Daedeok <italic>Innopolis</italic>, 2012</xref>), which was just after the announcement of the Heavy and Chemical Industries Promotion Plan. Those public research institutes provided the heavy and chemical industries with technologies and enabled such industries to become leading Korean export industries a few decades later.</p>
<p>In the early stage of economic development, the Korean Government encouraged the importing of technology<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0971721813489435">2</xref></sup> from foreign countries considering that foreign direct investment (FDI) was not effective for learning and disseminating advanced technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0971721813489435">3</xref></sup> Most Korean enterprises in the 1960s and 1970s were not able to accommodate FDI and the Government was protective of domestic industries desired to be developed for which the FDI on the industries was restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489435">Yoon, 2006</xref>). In this respect, the Government enacted the Foreign Capital Inducement Act of Korea to limit the foreign capital inflows, while the demand for advanced foreign technologies was essential for development in the heavy and chemical industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971721813489435">Chamarik and Goonatilake, 1994</xref>). It was in the late 1970s that the Government gradually liberalised technology and capital investment by slowly liberalising provisions of the Foreign Capital Inducement Act from foreign countries as it recognised that, for further economic growth, it was imperative to handover its technological learning to corresponding industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0971721813489435">4</xref></sup> Therefore, starting from the middle of 1970s, the Government tried to attract major foreign-invested enterprises to promote technological development providing special incentives to foreign firms to establish companies in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971721813489435">Nagano, 2006</xref>, p. 654).</p>
<p>The Korean Government transformed its economic policy once again to become an advanced industrialised country developing high technology on its own during the 1980s. Korea’s R&amp;D policy began to encourage the supply of endogenous technology by promoting research capabilities, expanding tax incentives for private and industrial R&amp;D activities and increasing the amount of reserve funds for technology development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489435">Yoon, 2006</xref>). Thus, assembly and processing industries such as electronics parts, computers, semiconductors, general machines and automobiles began to flourish during the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489435">Korea Industrial Technology Association, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489435">Jang, 2011</xref>). The Korea Institute of Electronics Technology (KIET) was established in 1976 as an institute fully devoted to developing technologies related to the electronics industry. Operating with close consultation with private companies, KIET took part in all imported technology negotiations between Korean firms and foreign firms and accommodated itself to the need of the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489435">Kim, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the many institutes involved in the national R&amp;D projects, the ETRI was established in 1985 as a result of a merger between the KIET and the Korea Electronic Technology and Telecommunications Research Institute (KETRI). It became an evident supporter of the electronics and telecommunication industries and has implemented many national projects since its establishment such as projects related to 8-bit computers, electronic telephone exchanger TDX-1,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0971721813489435">5</xref></sup> and 4M DRAM<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0971721813489435">6</xref></sup> in 1986, CDMA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0971721813489435">7</xref></sup> in 1991, ATM<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0971721813489435">8</xref></sup> in 1996 and DMB<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0971721813489435">9</xref></sup> and WiBro<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0971721813489435">10</xref></sup> in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971721813489435">Ahn and Mah, 2007</xref>, p. 368). The ETRI continued to develop new technologies to promote development in high-tech industries by developing a wireless home network in 2006 and 4G-LTE<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0971721813489435">11</xref></sup> advanced technology in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971721813489435">ETRI, 2012</xref>). In short, these government research institutes mostly initiated, planned and coordinated the targeted research by administering imported technology, facilitating licensing and managing foreign consultants for business enterprises as well as establishing human capital, thereby upgrading training and education to overcome bottlenecks in supply of skilled workers as industrialisation progressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489435">Kim, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The Government realised that the creation of indigenous and core technologies is the major factor in long-run economic development. Starting to change the science and technology policy by establishing the Korea Basic Science Institute in 1988 and the National Fusion Research Institute in 1995, the Korean NIS has systemised and globalised science and technology programmes since 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489435">Jang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971721813489435">Daedeok <italic>Innopolis</italic>, 2012</xref>). As a result of such efforts, the information and communication industries and knowledge-intensive technologies have flourished from the middle of 1990s.</p>

<title>Tax Incentives for R&amp;D Activities</title>
<p>To reduce the R&amp;D costs borne by private firms, the Government prepared a Reserve Fund for R&amp;D in 1973, began to provide tax exemption and applied a special depreciation rate to purchases of R&amp;D equipment in 1976. In the early 1980s, the Government began to place an emphasis on the private sector-led innovation system and the development of technology-intensive industries. In 1981, the Technology Development Promotion Law of 1972<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0971721813489435">12</xref></sup> was revised to encourage the establishment of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and laboratories of big firms, which led to the rapid expansion of private R&amp;D expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971721813489435">Nagano, 2006</xref>, p. 654). Due to the tax and financial incentives, implementing the Law encouraged business enterprises to finance their own R&amp;D activities independently and jointly with public research institutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489435">Kim, 1992</xref>). Not only the private R&amp;D expenditure but also that of government-financed research institutes increased sharply due to two main national projects: the Government Projects and the Government-Industry Joint Projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971721813489435">Chamarik and Goonatilake, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Beginning from the middle of 1980s, the private sector became the main actor in national innovation, while the Government transformed itself into a supporter of R&amp;D activities and a bridge of actors in order to adapt to the changed international economic environment. First, Korea lost its competitiveness in low-wage-based labour-intensive industries as its real wage rose at an annual average growth rate of 5.8 per cent in the 1960s and 7.5 per cent in the 1970s. Second, developed countries such as Japan became increasingly reluctant to transfer technology to Korea as Korean companies attempted to enter industries that they dominated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489435">Kim, 1997</xref>, pp. 33–34). Because of such changes in the global atmosphere, the Korean Government needed to set out a major economic policy shift, mainly opening towards the market mechanism rather than government intervention and development of the state-of-the-art technology-intensive industries.</p>
<p>Therefore, many types of tax benefits began to be provided in the 1980s, representing an attempt by the Government to transfer its leadership of technological development to private companies; for instance, the elimination of the upper limit to tax benefits on the Reserve Fund for R&amp;D; tax exemption for R&amp;D and training expenses; exemption of local real estate tax on buildings plus land or R&amp;D institutes in 1981; reduction of import duties on R&amp;D equipment in 1982; and tax credit on spending for human resource development in 1986. In addition to granting tax benefits for R&amp;D activities, a general reduction in profit tax rates from the top rate of 40 per cent in 1980 to 30 per cent in 1988 also contributed to the private sector’s ability to stretch its wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489435">Kim, 1994</xref>, p. 98; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971721813489435">IBP USA and USA International Business Publications, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Tax credit for investment in technology-related facilities and the development of human resources began to be provided in the 1990s. Meanwhile, due to the progress of globalisation during the 1990s with the inauguration of the WTO system, it was indispensable for the Government to pursue deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489435">Kim, 1997</xref>, p. 35). As a result, some of the tax incentive programmes practiced during the early industrialisation period were no longer allowed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0971721813489435">Table 2</xref> shows various types of tax incentives provided by the Government to promote R&amp;D-related activities.</p>

<p>During the 2000s, tax credit for the development of technology and manpower began to be provided. As of August 2012, some tax incentives are available regarding R&amp;D and technology transfer. To name a few, there are tax exemption for income from technology transfer, tax incentives for newly established SMEs and tax credit for investment in facilities for technology and human resources development. To elaborate, companies purchasing patents or utility model rights are eligible for tax credit of up to 3 per cent (7 per cent in the case of SMEs) of the total price and 3 per cent of the amount of acquisition is exempt in the case of machinery, equipment, installation of an information management system at points of sale and information protection systems. As the Government has promoted SMEs ever since the 1970s, they have been provided with tax incentives, which include the reduction of income tax or profit tax for SMEs in areas outside Seoul by 50 per cent for 4 years from the year of establishment and the reduction of local taxes consisting of property tax reduction by 50 per cent for five years and registration and acquisition tax exemption for two years to promote balanced regional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971721813489435">Ahn, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Gwangju <italic>Innopolis</italic> and Daegu <italic>Innopolis</italic> comprise certain districts newly established, introducing institutes and compares as well as those, with the existing universities, public institutes and companies. Thus, the Korean Government has tried to link the NIS to the regional technology hubs. It assigns specialised technology to each <italic>innopolis</italic>, promoting the public research institutes and private companies related to those technologies to cluster and develop interactively. The Chungchong area where Daedeok <italic>Innopolis</italic> is located, develops new information technology (IT) such as mechatronics, high-tech components and battery technology, while the Honam area, the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula, where Gwangju <italic>Innopolis</italic> is nestled, promotes information appliances, automobile components and shipbuilding distributions. Green energy, herbal medicines and culture and tourism are the key industries in the Dae-kyung area, the southeastern part of Korea, focusing on Daegu <italic>Innopolis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971721813489435">Kim, 2011</xref>, p. 35). Through building a cooperative system between the national spoke and the regional hubs and specialising in technologies in each region, the Korean Government is initiating balanced technological distribution and economic development simultaneously.</p>
<p>Currently, the Korean Government is focusing on developing indigenous technology and promoting knowledge-intensive industries. With already-established institutes and <italic>innopolises</italic>, the Government is systemising its science and technology programmes to solidify the foundation of R&amp;D activities carried out by public research institutes, universities and private companies. Recently, the exporting or globalising of Korea’s own technology has become the integral objective of the science and technology policy. Some of the technologies used in the industries developed in the 1990s and 2000s, such as electronics and telecommunication industries, are being exported to other developed as well as emerging countries (Jang, 2011).</p>

From 1970 to 1980, it grew from 10.5 billion Korean won to 211.7 billion Korean won, which is approximately a 19-fold increase in only a decade. Such an increase reflects the effort of the Government to establish various research institutes and support the Heavy and Chemical Industries Promotion Plan during the 1970s.

<p>As the attention of the industrial policy of Korea changed from one that targeted the promotion of certain sectors, that is, heavy and chemical industries, to R&amp;D promotion that did not target specific industries directly in the early to middle of 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489435">Mah, 2007</xref>), the R&amp;D expenditure jumped during the transition period of the NIS of Korea. It increased from 212 billion Korean won in 1980 to 3.4 trillion Korean won in 1990. That is, the amount of R&amp;D expenditure increased by 16 times and the R&amp;D expenditure/GDP ratio more than tripled to 1.87 per cent during the 1980s. In 2008, Korea’s R&amp;D expenditure as a share of GDP, 3.36 per cent, was the fourth highest and much higher than the OECD members’ average of 2.33 per cent. It can be compared with that of the US, 2.79 per cent and the EU, 1.90 per cent, which indicates that Korea allocates a larger amount to R&amp;D activities relative to the other major developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0971721813489435">OECD, 2011b</xref>). R&amp;D expenditure accounted for 3.74 per cent of the total GDP in 2010.</p>
<p>Even though the R&amp;D expenditure has grown rapidly since the economic reform in the 1960s, its composition regarding the public and private sectors has changed significantly during the period. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0971721813489435">Table 6</xref>, public sector R&amp;D expenditure/GDP amounted to 0.30 per cent and 0.28 per cent, respectively, in 1980. The former tripled to 0.94 per cent in 2010. Meanwhile, the latter increased by 10 times to 2.80 per cent in the same year. Therefore, although the share of the public sector was more or less the same as that of the private sector in 1980, the latter apparently dominates the former currently.</p>
<p>The Government led the NIS until the end of the 1970s, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0971721813489435">Table 7</xref>. Due to the expansion of the private sector in R&amp;D activities in the 1980s, the share of the Government apparently decreased in the early 1980s to lower than 20 per cent since 1985. The pattern of the proportion of the R&amp;D expenditure borne by the public and the private sector has not changed since then. During and immediately after the Asian financial crisis, the amount of the R&amp;D expenditure borne by the private sector decreased, while that of the public sector increased. Consequently, the proportion of the latter increased slightly to 28 per cent in 2000. That is, although the private sector decided to reduce its R&amp;D expenditure by more than 10 per cent in 1998 due to the critical situation during the financial crisis, the public sector complemented and continued to promote R&amp;D activities. During the 2000s, the share of R&amp;D expenditure accounted for by the public sector remained between 24 per cent and 29 per cent. Throughout the period since the 1970s, the government laid the foundation of enhancing the science and technology capacity. With economic development, the private sector has led R&amp;D activities in general.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0971721813489435">Figure 2</xref> shows that the absolute amount of the government budget allocated to R&amp;D has also increased since 1976, except for the period of the economic crisis in the late 1990s and a few years in the late 2000s. Korea’s R&amp;D budget shared 1.02 per cent of the GDP in 2010, while the ratio was 0.75 per cent for the OECD countries in general in 2009, 1.18 per cent in the United States in 2009, 0.74 per cent in the case of Japan in 2010 and 0.67 per cent for 27 countries in the European Union in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0971721813489435">OECD, 2011b</xref>). Thus, the Korean Government spends a relatively greater proportion of its budget on R&amp;D than most of the other developed countries.</p>

<title>Patents</title>
<p>Inputs into R&amp;D activities, such as the amount of R&amp;D expenditure, began to kick off in the 1970s and have gradually increased since then. Such R&amp;D activities started to lead innovations during the 1990s. During the 1990s, the number of patents increased significantly. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0971721813489435">Table 8</xref> shows that the number of patents issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) increased from 236 in 1990 to more than 3,000 in 1998, that is, an increase of about 13 times. Between 1998 and 2011, it quadrupled to almost 13,000. The rapid increase in the number of patent applications suggests the improvement of Korea’s capability to develop core and indigenous technologies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0971721813489435">Table 9</xref> shows that according to the number of patents filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Korea ranked fifth, following the United States, Japan, Germany and China. Such data indicate that there are active R&amp;D activities and innovations taking place in Korea and that the technology level has improved.</p>

<title>Human Resources</title>
<p>R&amp;D expenditure is not the only factor that has expanded with economic growth. Investment in human resources has also skyrocketed, producing many researchers and intellectuals. Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) showed that the level of initial human capital stock is positively correlated with subsequent accumulation of the physical capital through the analysis of cross-country data along with the evidence that the growth rate of total factor productivity is affected by human capital stock of a nation. In addition, Borensztein, DeGregorio and Lee (1995) argued that human capital is an important factor for developing countries to achieve technological progress, as it plays a significant role in managing and adopting technology inflows from the developed countries. To achieve better nation building and economic growth, therefore, raising more educated people seemed to be crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971721813489435">Barro and Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971721813489435">Kuznets, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971721813489435">1981</xref>). In Korea, the Education Law was enacted in 1949, making primary education compulsory and its tuition free with an increasing budget allocated to education after the Korean War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489435">Lim, 1999</xref>, p. 49). In addition, middle school education became compulsory in 1985 and gradually expanded to all middle school students in Korea by 2004. Currently, Korea shows one of the highest percentages of the population attending colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971721813489435">OECD, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from encouraging higher education, building human resource through vocational training programme has also been a part of the effort of the government. As a country pursuing export-oriented industrialisation, the Government took several human resource management programmes from vocational training to secondary technical schools in the 1960s and 1970s. In particular, the Vocational Training Law enacted in 1967 allowed the government to build 26 public vocational training institutes from none before and educated more than 350,000 people who shared about 3 per cent of the whole labour force in 1986. Granting subsidies to private firms relating to in-plant training programmes facilitated the implementation of necessary skills specific to each industry. In the 1980s, two-year junior technical colleges and four-year universities to educate skilled workers and technicians have increased in order to supply the labour force necessary for the technology-intensive industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489435">Kim, 1997</xref>, pp. 60–67; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971721813489435">Lee, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The Government established the KAIST in 1971 with full financial support for its operational budget to produce masters and PhD holders in science and engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489435">Lim, 1999</xref>, p. 69). Many young male scientists and engineers have been given the privilege of exemption from military service duty, which lasts up to two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489435">Mah, 2007</xref>). Various kinds of scholarship opportunities have also been provided to college and graduate students to attract talented students to the science and engineering field. With the effort of the Government, the number of researchers has grown consistently.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0971721813489435">Table 10</xref>, the number of researchers has increased from fewer than 12,000 in 1976 to more than 100,000 in 1995 and then to 264,118 in 2010. Most of them have a master or PhD degree in Korea. In 1976, when the Government started to establish research institutes, the number of researchers per 1,000 population was only 0.33. It increased to 1.53 in 1990 and then to 5.01 in 2009. Such an increase in the number of researchers in science and engineering has enabled innovation and technological progress for the past decades. There are on average about 7.6 researchers per 1,000 economically active populations for the OECD members in 2009, while there are 10 researchers per 1,000 employees in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0971721813489435">OECD, 2011b</xref>). This shows that Korea has succeeded in educating scientists and engineers.</p>

<sec id="section10-0971721813489435">
<title>Technology Trade Balance</title>
<p>Despite the achievements and rapid progress in R&amp;D, Korea has a long road ahead in terms of technology trade, as Korea has faced deficits in this in every industry. Although its size has increased, the amount of technology trade of Korea has still been far lower than that of other developed countries, such as the US, Germany and Japan. The amount of technology trade of Korea in 2008 compared with those countries was 1/17.8, 1/11.8 and 1/3.3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971721813489435">OECD, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0971721813489435">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The technology trade deficits continued to increase in absolute values from US$2 billion in 2001 to near US$5 billion in 2009. This implies that even as of 2009, Korea did not have a comparative advantage in innovation and technology-intensive industries in general. The industry showing the largest amount of deficits in technology trade is electronics, although it records the largest amount of technology exports, 68.5 per cent of all technology export. For instance, it accounted for about half of the total technology trade deficits of Korea throughout the 2000s. The machinery industry is the second-largest exporter of technology, with a share of 20 per cent. Even though the electronics industry has led technology exports, it imports a large amount of technology from foreign countries, accounting for 58.4 per cent of the total technology imports in 2009, for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971721813489435">OECD, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0971721813489435">2010</xref>). Even if the export values of the electronics industry are substantial relative to those of the other industries, the absolute amount of technology exports lags behind that of technology imports.</p>
<p>Besides technology trade per se, the direction of R&amp;D policies of Korea can be related to export of technology-intensive products. R&amp;D policies of Korea have actually contributed to development of technology-intensive industries of Korea since the middle of 1980s. IT industry developed in this manner began to lead Korea’s exports since the 1990s. For instance, together with automobiles, IT products such as semi-conductors, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and mobile handsets lead Korea’s exports nowadays.</p>

<title>Lessons for Developing Countries</title>
<p>Since the beginning of industrialisation, the R&amp;D promotion efforts of the Korean Government have been accompanied by remarkable economic growth. As a country that has experienced dramatic economic success and has changed from one that was highly dependent on labour-intensive industries with almost no production facilities immediately after the Korean war in the early 1960s into one of the leading countries in capital- and technology-intensive industries, the experience of Korea can provide some meaningful lessons for developing countries that are pursuing R&amp;D promotion policies and economic growth in general.</p>
<p>First, the Korean Government has regarded human resources as a crucial factor in R&amp;D. This is consistent with the endogenous economic growth theory by Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), Aghion and Howitt (1992) and others, which states that an increase in the level of resources devoted to R&amp;D will increase the growth rate of the economy. Without essential natural resources or a cutting-edge technology level for economic development, the Korean Government realised that it was imperative to foster many intelligent engineers and scientists. In this respect, it established science and technology-specialised academic institutions such as the KAIST in 1971, the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in 1993 and the DaeguGyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology in 2003. For example, the KAIST was founded under government funding and initially staffed by a number of Korean engineering and science faculty educated in advanced countries, mainly the United States. These returning scholars led to the current technological development of Korea. Therefore, establishing the science and engineering-specialised academic institutions and attracting able scientists and engineers to build the foundation of the R&amp;D system are essential to developing countries that are pursuing technology-based economic development.</p>
<p>Second, the Korean Government not only educated young scientists and attracted scholars from abroad, but also established many research institutes in which scientists and engineers could further research and implement R&amp;D policies. Beginning with the KIST in the early stage of economic development, the Korean Government has founded research institutes developing advanced, indigenous technologies and collaborating with the other actors in R&amp;D. Developing countries also need to build specialised research institutes devoted to analysing and implementing R&amp;D activities to achieve technological development effectively. Also, as was the case in Korea, industry-specific research institutes need to be established to target the development of the industries. As it is shown in the Korean history of establishing and promoting research institutes like KIST and KAIST for more than two decades to create science and technology capacities in technology transfer to industries, human resource and collaboration among economic actors, there is no short-cut in developing indigenous science and technology capacities of developing countries.</p>
<p>Third, efficient collaboration between the Government and the private sector is also crucial. In developed countries, in general, the private sector bears a larger proportion of R&amp;D expenditure. Therefore, establishing public research institutes would not guarantee sustained R&amp;D activities. Rather, public research institutes need to assist the private sector, which is what the Korean Government undertook in the latter period of the NIS. During the early stage, it is necessary for the government to initiate technological development, while in the latter stage, the government needs to work as a bridge between private sectors, between universities and business and between public and private institutes to enhance the NIS.</p>
<p>Fourth, financial benefits, such as tax incentives for R&amp;D activities, are necessary to encourage institutes and firms to take risks and invest in R&amp;D. The Korean Government provided tax benefits in the 1970s to 1980s in particular to develop value-added capital-intensive industries. It also granted tax incentives to technology-intensive industries in the 1990s to 2000s. In order to provide incentives for firms, SMEs in particular, to take the risk of investing in R&amp;D activities, it was necessary for the Government to step forward to let them initiate the business at the beginning. Some critics have argued that the Korean Government was too protective and less market-oriented during the period of rapid economic growth; however, the economic development of Korea shows the significance of providing appropriate incentives to encourage R&amp;D activities. As the Government has provided incentives to the private sector, the latter has pursued R&amp;D activities actively and greater synergy has been achieved through active cooperation between the Government and the private sector.</p>
<p>In this respect, fifth, the construction of <italic>innopolises</italic> provides another important lesson for developing countries. The Korean <italic>innopolis</italic> project targets two things: cooperation among public research institutes, universities and private firms and balanced economic and technological development across the nation. To reduce the regional inequality problems and enhance economic growth in the process of promoting R&amp;D activities, developing countries may consider projects like building science parks or technology development zones similar to the <italic>innopolises</italic> in Korea to develop indigenous technology and facilitate the communication among the actors in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it is necessary for developing countries to understand the changing comparative advantage and direct the attention of R&amp;D policies one step ahead. With cheap labour in the 1960s, the Korean Government developed labour-intensive industry. However, as the Korean economy became inferior to China and some South-east Asian countries in terms of the wage level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489435">Lim, 1999</xref>, p. 102), the Korean Government quickly changed its industrial policy to promote the heavy and chemical industries by importing technologies from advanced countries. To support its development, the Government established related research institutes in the 1970s. Reflecting the transition of the industrial structure to technology-intensive industries, during the 1980s, the Korean Government shifted the focus of its industrial policy from sector-oriented to R&amp;D-oriented support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489435">Mah, 2007</xref>). Therefore, initiating and executing proper public policies on science and technology including laws and implementation mechanisms fitting the social environment is also a meaningful lesson that developing countries need to work on. Even if Korea faces a long road ahead with respect to technological development, its R&amp;D system has successfully transformed from imitation to innovation. Therefore, it would be helpful for developing countries’ R&amp;D policies to find ways to develop value-added technology-intensive industries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0971721813489435" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In-house R&amp;D institutes in private companies started to be established in the middle of 1980s when they were committed to upgrading their own productivity and bargaining power in technology transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489435">Lim, 1999</xref>). The reason that <italic>chaebols</italic> and certain SMEs could set up their own private R&amp;D institutes was that the Government had laid the foundation for R&amp;D promotion since the 1960s. The research institutes established and tax incentives given to the firms by the Government paved the way for firms to innovate their own R&amp;D activities when they faced globalisation, such as the inauguration of the WTO system protecting intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>In the second half of the NIS, during which the Government has functioned as a supporter of private companies, the Government established nation-wide research institutes to achieve balanced development and tried to link them to universities and private companies, expecting greater synergy in industrial development. As Chung (2002) and Lee and Park (2006) argued, collaborative R&amp;D among downstream firms, universities and the Government improves the chance of success and the Government can act as a bridge among these R&amp;D actors. In the meantime, it would be necessary for the Government to establish a more concrete science and technology policy to find the crossing point and prompt the active exchange among the actors.</p>
<p>As a country overcoming a situation of devastation after the Korean War, Korea can act as a guide for many developing countries in terms of R&amp;D promotion and economic development. Without natural resources or appropriate social infrastructure, the Korean Government first generated skillful and intelligent human resources through building up science- and technology-specific academic institutions and providing incentives for young and talented students to major in science and engineering. In addition, it established tens of public research institutes from the early stage of R&amp;D promotion.</p>
<p>Establishing public research institutes and attracting the attention of the private sector to develop its own R&amp;D activities by the provision of tax and financial incentives have played an essential role in leading the country towards becoming a technologically advanced economy. Along with the development of both public and private research initiatives, the Government has actively built collaborative programmes whereby the actors in R&amp;D can produce synergy by working together. As part of the effort, it has constructed nation-wide <italic>innopolises</italic> promoting cooperation among academia, public research institutes and private companies. Through such active policy measures of the Government and foresight regarding the changing comparative advantage in the global R&amp;D environment, Korea has been catching up with the advanced technology level of the major developed countries.</p>
<p>The experience of R&amp;D promotion policies of Korea provides many policy implications for developing countries. First, establishing science and engineering-specialised academic institutes is critical for developing countries in building the foundation for an R&amp;D system. Second, developing countries need to build specialised research institutes devoted to analysing and implementing R&amp;D activities. In Korea, the public research institutes were established and maintained for over two decades to create science and technology capacities. Thus, there is no short cut to endogenous science and technology capacities. Third, it is necessary for the government to initiate technological development, while in the latter stage of development, it needs to work as a bridge between private sectors, between universities and firms and between public and private institutes. Fourth, the experience of Korea shows the significance of providing appropriate incentives to encourage R&amp;D activities in the private sector. Fifth, developing countries may consider projects like building science parks to develop indigenous technology and facilitate the communication among R&amp;D actors. Finally, it would be helpful for developing countries to find ways to develop value-added technology-intensive industries via R&amp;D promotion policies. In this process, it is also necessary to prepare and implement the laws enabling such policies.</p>
