<p>The terrorism in Oslo and at Utøya, Norway, in July 2011 sparked widespread popular discussion of multiculturalism across the Internet and in the press. Those critical of multiculturalism perceived a threat to their position and defensively made plain their distance from the political contortion that produced Anders Breivik, the Norwegian who spent many years plotting his crimes. Defenders of multiculturalism pointed out that Breivik was taking up in extreme form a thread of hostile opinion relating to European multiculturalism that enacted the underlying potential for violence present in all xenophobic thought. This discussion was not new. Since the attack on the twin towers in New York in September 2001, several European countries that had begun to develop a set of public policies fundamentally acknowledging that the demographic landscape of Europe had changed dramatically now grew more cautious. </p>
<p>Gradually, across the past decade, prominent European political leaders – not just the predictable mavericks on the far right – voiced strong reservations about multiculturalism. Indeed, seen in the context of the hostility to multiculturalism internationally throughout the 1970s, 1980s and well into the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312444985">Hewitt, 2005</xref>), the window of time during which multicultural discourse enjoyed international support looks today very small indeed. Multiculturalism never was the dominant, confident and accepted discourse that its critics sometimes claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312444985">Lentin and Titley, 2011</xref>). </p>
<p>Yet the underlying demographic reality of migration into and across Europe remains, and the notion that there is anything ‘experimental’ about the ethnic and racial diversity evident today – when several generations of the same migrant families have been born, raised and educated in Europe, have achieved economic success, political representation and legal rights –sounds sociologically naive and politically callow. For Europe, the need for clarity over both established and emergent multicultural societies has never been more urgent and for that reason alone publications that seek to analyse the underlying issues should be received with some measure of gratitude. </p>
<p>The two books reviewed here approach different aspects of multiculturalism and engage with both sociological and philosophical literature in doing so. For both authors the work of Will Kymlika is taken as an initial liberal foil from which their arguments are elaborated and both authors share a certain amount of commonality in seeking/proposing a multiculturalism that does not incorporate but which nevertheless manages to encompass individual peculiarities. Thus both deal with the issues of group membership and individuality and both are concerned with examining the discursive framework of multiculturalism. Beyond that, however, there is considerable distance between them and in the intellectual engines that drive them. </p>
<p>Gressgård’s <italic>Multicultural Dialogue</italic> may sound like another foray into the arena of how ‘common ground’ is to be found in diverse societies; however, this is no bland, well-intentioned exercise in social amelioration, as the subtitle begins to make clear. There are dilemmas, paradoxes and conflicts galore in this careful exploration of an intellectual terrain rarely trodden with such scrupulous attention to hidden implications and sins of omission. Gressgård’s starting point is what lies behind the debates between ethnocentrism and cultural relativism, which she comes to equate with democratic liberalism and communitarianism. The initial platform for these deliberations is her analysis of Norwegian White papers and other government policy documents concerned with managing integration. Here, she produces material to demonstrate how, in accordance with a democratic liberalism concerned with advancing the welfare and rights of all a polity’s members above any claims made on the basis of culture, these documents represent ‘the extent to which the state should tolerate cultural diversity and the kind of diversity that should be tolerated’ (p. 6). She adds that neither of the two most significant White Papers on immigration and diversity contain arguments for the recognition of cultural distinctiveness. Furthermore, in her introduction to the book Gressgård emphasizes her view that ‘liberal-democratic tolerance is a tool for managing – that is a mode of incorporating and regulating – the presence of the threatening ‘other’ within’ (ibid.). This process finds procedural expression through a form of ‘planned pluralism’ in which the ‘ostensible acceptance – the pseudo-recognition – of cultural distinctiveness in public policy’ acts as a ‘normalising measure in a nation-building project’.  Hence, we arrive at the first ‘multicultural paradox’ introduced:<disp-quote>
<p>[P]lanned pluralism seems to promote neither equality nor distinctiveness. Cases that concern equality of a socio-political nature are overshadowed by the focus on cultural distinctiveness, in so far as cultural distinctiveness is equated with deviation and hierarchical subordination. At the same time, recognition of cultural distinctiveness evaporates due to the emphasis on equality, in so far as equality is equated with normalization and assimilation.</p>
</disp-quote> The question that emerges as the real starting point of the book, therefore, is whether, if recognition involves the right and opportunity to speak for oneself and to be entitled to discuss the very terms of recognition, it is possible to recognize the ‘others’ in their own terms within the parameters of egalitarianism. From this point of departure, Gressgård explores a series of related issues, primarily through a prospective dialogue with a number of texts, returning again and again to search out the conditions under which radical otherness can or cannot be congruent with different facets of the egalitarian ideal. This ideal is inevitably already configured by colonialism and leads to the question of ‘how “others” can be recognized as culturally distinct without being constrained by the language of the dominant party’ – an issue at the heart of post-colonial theory and closely linked here to notions of dual subjectivity. At this early point in her argument Gressgård shifts the theoretical terrain away from the familiar political–philosophical literature behind multicultural theory into a crucial discussion of what she calls a ‘modern metaphysics of purity’ which generates the disparity between the Protestant/Enlightenment notion of the abstract human being on the one hand and the unique human being on the other. </p>
<p> In making this move she opens up a much larger discussion of modern subjectivity, leading us, with one eye on Foucault, through the familiar notions concerning purity/impurity and inclusion/liminality of Mary Douglas and Arnold van Gennep via Victor Turner. The point of arrival is where modern political ideologies confront a modern human comprising both a universal subject and an autonomous (unique) subject, plus the inconvenient gap between the two which, according to Gressgård, both liberal and republican political ideologies need/seek to eliminate. Only when the curtain is raised on this issue does the real arena of discussion become fully visible. From here on the book comprises a series of arguments excavating themes emerging from the central paradox of multiculturalism and its relationship to the modern human subject. </p>
<p>The first lengthy engagement with a single author is with Louis Dumont and particularly his essay ‘On value, modern and non-modern’ which Gressgård uses to explore how holism is a constitutive element of modern egalitarian ideologies and ultimately how these have become transformed into a form of totalitarianism. The chapter becomes the model for the engagements that follow in all the later chapters, i.e. a series of exegetical commentaries on certain texts. Scott Lash’s chapter ‘Reflexive Judgement and Aesthetic Subjectivity’ in his 1999 book <italic>Another Modernity: A Different Rationality</italic> together with Kant’s <italic>Critique of Judgement</italic> is the next in line in a fine, but very complex, chapter which works towards an understanding of the bases for envisioning a community based on difference. The other texts considered in subsequent chapters include works by Lyotard and Deleuze, then Derrida and circling back again on Lash all with the same relentlessness of exploration. </p>
<p>In the penultimate chapter, following a discussion of Lyotard on the subject of heterogeneity, Gressgård concludes that, ‘the multicultural dilemma comprises a reductive totality whereby dialogue is reduced to monologue and difference is suppressed in the name of some unitary notion of the “human”’ (p. 105). She attributes this insight to Lyotard’s philosophy of difference, adding: ‘How this problem can best be handled on a practical–political level, however, is an entirely different matter.’ The final chapter – ‘On the Conditions for Dialogue’ – continues the same tenacious engagement and attempts again to review the issue of incommensurability and multicultural dialogue. Here the argument looks beyond Gadamer’s fusion of horizons, with help from Hans Kögler’s work on critical hermeneutics, and Christopher Falzon’s book on Foucault and social dialogue, where again, dilemmas and conflicts abound but the paradoxes seem to be thinning out. </p>
<p>What is important about this book is less the conclusions that are arrived at than the rigour and depth with which the conditions of social being are examined. Sometimes Gressgård’s focus seems perhaps a little willful and even arbitrary, and sometimes she is more in dialogue with secondary accounts of primary texts, which may leave her somewhat exposed. For example, there is little evidence that she has engaged with Donald Davidson’s work, but she is still content to reproduce the common view of his ‘rejection of incommensurability’. There is also a tendency to be authoritative at one moment and a little naïve the next; for example, pulling poor Caliban from Shakespeare’s <italic>The Tempest</italic>, on stage yet again, to serve a post-colonial argument he has served for many years now. Nevertheless, the care she brings to her task enables the reader to trust enough the twists and turns of her attention and to roll with the arrival of new texts and issues introduced. It is a journey well worth making with her.</p>
<p>Ganesh Nathan’s <italic>Social Freedom in a Multicultural State</italic> is not in the least concerned with paradox, but is situated firmly within the tradition of political theory where the underlying configurations of liberal democracy are not at issue, unless it is to make way – to some carefully guarded degree – for the arguments of republicanism. Thus, in closing the Introduction, Nathan tells us that: ‘This book is intended neither to defend republicanism nor to develop a multicultural theory of the state, although it does critique some aspects of liberalism and incorporates some key features of republicanism in deriving the set of normative criteria.’ Thus on the theoretical side the book opens with a good measure of Will Kymlika, who is largely critiqued for his insistence on the significance of cultural belonging which is seen primarily as the gateway to simplistic identity politics. </p>
<p>For sociological theory Nathan makes the unique move of taking on board the ideas of Wilhelm Dilthey – not just a little but heavily and throughout the book. Surprisingly, he makes the statement that ‘Dilthey’s works may not be the obvious point of reference with regard to multiculturalism’ (p. 3), seemingly unaware of the impact Dilthey had on founder of American anthropology Franz Boas and thence on Ruth Benedict, author of one of the ur-texts of liberal multiculturalism – <italic>Patterns of Culture</italic> (1934). Indeed the line from Herder through Dilthey to Boas and Benedict is a primary historical source of modern multicultural theory. For Nathan, Dilthey’s importance primarily lies in his notions of cultural systems and interacting social organizations rooted in social life, which Nathan claims allows for both social heterogeneity and individual agency within a coherent concept of the multicultural state. The notion of cultural systems is almost content-less for Nathan, being seen primarily in terms of constraint, yet it is the very thing that links Dilthey’s work directly to multiculturalism. The title of Benedict’s book is the give-away and a direct reference to Dilthey’s theories. </p>
<p>Thus, Nathan misses much of the potential richness of Dilthey’s relevance and the depth of his commitment to symbolic systems, hermeneutics, the problem of meaning and the relation between culture and mind. Nathan is more attracted to those parts of Dilthey that he can selectively utilize in his overarching objective of creating normative criteria, which can be used as an instrument for adjudicating claims for justice in a multicultural state, where, according to him, liberal multiculturalists and communitarians get it wrong. Nathan’s blind spot, however, seems to be the very core of multiculturalism – culture itself. It is ignored almost as if he saw culture as a thin ‘steel bands and chapati’ residue rather than as the dynamic socially woven and weaving force it is. This gaping omission may make it easier for him to send communitarians packing, like Lord Nelson putting his telescope up to his blind eye and saying, ‘I see no ships, Mr. Christian’. </p>
<p>Part One of this book opens with a long restatement of various critiques of Kymlika’s analysis of the multicultural state, in particular homing in on the essentialism claimed to inhere in his theorization of minority groups and in particular his distinction between immigrant groups and national minorities. This critique draws heavily on the work of Seyla Benhabib, Joseph Carens, Ann Phillips and other writers, adding little if anything. At the same time, he comes to equate essentialism as both endemic to liberal multiculturalism and, through that agency, a primary source of marginalization and oppression for national and immigrant minorities. He closes the first chapter with a commitment to demonstrate how Dilthey’s ‘idea of social systems allows us to deliberate about cultural practices without solidifying a culture as a monolithic entity’ and subsequently goes on to account for what he feels the contribution of Dilthey to theorization in this area might be. </p>
<p>It appears that there are two emphases Nathan finds in Dilthey’s work that he sees as of particular importance, one is on the complexity and multifaceted nature of human interactions and an intrinsic absence of social homogeneity. The other is the greater role these ideas allow for the <italic>individual</italic> in, for example, the relevance he allows to individual conscience alongside external (system of morality) constraints. This emphasis recurs frequently throughout the book. Dilthey, we are told, ‘presents us with a much less rigid account of social structures while always recognizing the important roles they play’. However, the very variety of human attributes, beliefs and capacities inevitably leads to asymmetrical power relations through dominance and dependence. </p>
<p>By this line of argumentation we soon arrive at a very common-sensical vision that begins with the sentiment ‘as there will always be economic inequalities, we need to know the threshold of economic inequality that would impede parity of participation. This is not easy to determine’ (p. 147) and ends in an endorsement of self-respect over self-esteem which he comes to associate ultimately with anti-social behaviour (p. 156). In contrast to these psychological characteristics of self-esteem, self-respect has an intellectually respectable pedigree: ‘I shall argue that egalitarian reciprocity should mean treating one another as citizens of equal status rooted in self-respect …[S]elf respect is constituted by autonomy, character and conduct … [R]ecognition should be normatively grounded on self-respect of individuals and should go beyond the liberals’ idea of tolerance and non-discrimination without reifying identity, group and culture …’ (p. 155). Fine sentiments no doubt, but they do give a moralizing flavour to the book in parts and somewhat vitiate the more expository passages on these issues.</p>
<p>Nathan’s book has the merit of being an impassioned and elaborated argument against essentialism which he recognizes has been treated in the literature before but which he still sees bodied out in activist’s and other’s popular statements. Unfortunately, his audience is bound to be an academic one where flogging a dead horse has never been in fashion. Nevertheless, on the way there are some interesting discussions of the ways in which republican positions can be useful in constructing defensible arguments concerning, in particular, freedom, responsibility and justice in multicultural states and where the derivative nature of other parts of the book can be comfortably forgotten.</p>
<p>It is not easy to evaluate the relationship either of these books might have to the brute fact of anti-immigrant terrorism, or to the shrinking-away from multiculturalism by some European leaders mentioned at the outset. In a sense only the profound existential realities addressed in Gressgård’s book are capable of comprehending the horror of the Oslo–Utøya massacre, and perhaps only through the dialogue between liberal democracy and republicanism evident in Nathan’s can the gap between European politicians’ discourses and strategic calculations on the one hand, and the demographic realities of contemporary European life on the other be translated into a language where many can have a voice.</p>
