<p>There is much to like about James Chapman’s book. The work spans the late 19th century to the early 21st. He gives a potted history of British comics and offers some more detailed analytical set pieces on specific comics. Nonetheless, the work has some limitations.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the book disposes of the pre-Second World War history of British comics in 20 pages of text and eight of illustrations. Chapman gives a short account of the shifting fortunes and social function of the lead character in the eponymous <italic>Ally Sloper</italic>, one of the first comic strips in the world. He discusses the rise of the Amalgamated Press on the back of <italic>Comic Cuts</italic> and touches on D.C. Thomson and their two main comics, <italic>Beano</italic> and <italic>Dandy</italic>. He rounds the chapter off with a glimpse of the popular Second World War strip <italic>Jane</italic>. However, it would have been good to have a few more words on <italic>Beano</italic> and <italic>Dandy</italic> in place of the three pages of <italic>Jane</italic> illustrations.</p>
<p>Chapman gets to the ‘golden age of British comics’ (p. 75) in the next two chapters, where he deals with the establishment of <italic>The Eagle</italic>, its lead feature <italic>Dan Dare</italic> and the many competitors in the field of boys’ adventure comics. He gives a brisk account of the anti-comic campaign in the 1950s, the Christian origins of <italic>The Eagle</italic> and <italic>Dan Dare</italic>, and changes in the publishing industry, including the consolidation of comics’ publishers under the IPC corporation in the early 1960s. Chapman sets the advent of <italic>2000 AD</italic> and its star character, Judge Dredd, in the context of the continuing popularity of Second World War comics and the launch of <italic>Warlord</italic> and <italic>Battle</italic> in the mid 1970s by Thomson and IPC respectively. These two comics along with IPC’s <italic>Action</italic> set the stage for <italic>2000 AD</italic>. Chapman’s discussion of these comics and their content is on the whole engaging, as are his chapters on British superheroes, alternative comics, and the <italic>Viz</italic> phenomenon.</p>
<p>Chapman is most convincing when he deals with British boys’ adventure comics. His chapter on girls’ comics is rather anaemic and it is odd to read a discussion of these comics that does not deal with the scholarship of Angela McRobbie on <italic>Jackie</italic>, even if only to point to areas of disagreement, as Martin Barker has done. Chapman hints that the renewed availability of American comics in Britain in 1959 changed the dynamics of British comics but does not address this satisfactorily (p. 178). Although IPC consolidated a number of publishers under a single umbrella, it was not until the late 1960s that the separate divisions were rationalized. In the mid 1960s the Olhams division published a line of comic books with titles like <italic>Wham, Pow</italic>, and <italic>Smash</italic>. These comics combined British content, by former <italic>Beano</italic> artist Leo Baxendale, with reprints of American material. These comics suggest that American comics posed significant problems for British publishers to the extent that they tried to contain that threat by incorporating it into their fare and catching readers as they made the transition from children’s comics to adolescent comics. When that effort failed, it seems that British publishers had to look for other models to address the American threat. These industry machinations better explain the context of something Chapman pointed to: ‘the American influence on <italic>2000 AD</italic> can be seen as a strategy to attract readers of American comic books’ (p. 149). Entitling the book <italic>British Comics</italic> in the absence of a sustained discussion of <italic>Beano</italic> and <italic>Dandy</italic>, two of the four British comics in continuous publication along with <italic>2000 AD</italic> and <italic>Judge Dredd</italic>, is at the very least a poor title choice. In the introduction he does at least acknowledge a bias towards boys’ adventure comics over funnies and girls’ comics (p. 14).</p>
<p>Chapman makes some stunning errors. He for instance thinks that most American comic books like <italic>Detective Comics</italic> were published quarterly in the 1930s and 1940s (p. 10), when in fact both the latter and Action Comics were published monthly. G.I. Joe was not a 1950s war comic but a toy introduced in 1964 (p. 82). He confuses two different Captain Marvels, the Fawcett character in the 1940s and the Marvel Comics character in the 1960s (p. 104). Wonder Woman did not fight Nazis as Chapman thinks (p. 172). Stan Lee was not an artist but a writer (p. 174). Riot Grrrls were not a band but a social movement associated with the band Bikini Kill who did not, as he thinks, dress akin to the title character of the <italic>Tank Girl</italic> strip (p. 236). This discomfort with things American may explain his blind spot in understanding a contributing cause of transformation in British comics.</p>
