<abstract>
<p>As a part of the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise, the originators (or their collaborators) of three-dimensional failure theories applied their methods to 12 carefully selected challenging problems (test cases). In this article, the ‘blind’ theoretical predictions from 12 failure theories, making the backbone of Part (A) of the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise, are compiled in a structured manner. Key features in each theory are identified including: types of failure models employed, whether linear or nonlinear analysis was carried out, reliance on software and numerical methods, allowance for thermal stresses and identification of modes of failure. The results (failure envelopes and stress–strain curves) have been superimposed to show similarities and differences between the predictions of the various theories. In addition, bar charts have been constructed to demonstrate the levels of agreement between the predicted failure stresses and strains. Sources of differences between the predictions of the various three-dimensional failure theories are discussed. Further publications are planned in Part B in which comparison will be made between the predictions described here and the experimental results.</p>

<p>The need to challenge and expose the strengths and weaknesses of contemporary failure criteria for fibre reinforced polymer composites, and to refine and extend their applicability is considered to be crucial for establishing firm, well-founded steps toward obtaining reliable and mature design methodologies. Such methodologies vital in maintaining the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry and its supply chain partners such as software vendors and R&amp;D groups. In particular, they can be used as building blocks for developing numerical or analytical tools for ‘virtual testing’ for composite structures. In it, a designer aims at obtaining optimal shape, weight and cost of a component or an assembly without resorting to the traditional but slow and expensive of ‘make and test’.</p>
<p>Commercial software and computer codes usually contain a large number of failure models and failure criteria. Yet, developers and users of software and computer tools are normally faced with a difficult problem deciding which failure model should be selected or used in a particular application. Consequently, the situation requires a conscious ‘operator intervention’ to make that selection, based on an examination of the problem to be analysed but otherwise with very little further guidance available currently to help make an informed decision. From a designer’s perspective, the preference would be the provision of modelling tools with assured resilience that predictions would be accurate in all circumstances.</p>
<p>As a result of the first World Wide Failure Exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449887">1</xref></sup>, crucial gaps were identified. The authors of the first exercise (Hinton and Kaddour) organised a new activity, called the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE-II) to bridge some of those gaps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312449887">2</xref></sup> In Kaddour and Hinton,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312449887">2</xref></sup> the organisers described the background to the WWFE-II, highlighted the challenging issues facing the composite community and set out a plan for carrying out all stages of the exercise. The strategy used in the first exercise was adopted for the second exercise as it was proven to be robust and mature and able to handle with a wide range of challenges and eventualities.</p>
<p>The WWFE-II was set up to assess the maturity of failure criteria for predicting the strength and deformation of materials under three-dimensional (3D) stresses (triaxial loadings). It runs into two parts, referred to as Part (A) and Part (B), where Part (A) deals with comparison between blind predictions of various theories and Part (B) deals with comparing the blind predictions with experimental results.</p>
<p>In Part A, 12 leading theories were employed by their originators (or their representatives) to solve 12 problems (test cases). The test cases are described in detail in Kaddour and Hinton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312449887">3</xref></sup> and the results of the individual theoretical predictions are described in various other references.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312449887">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312449887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312449887"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312449887">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>Prior to describing the theories it is worth providing a brief outline of the selection of the test cases analysed by the participants. The WWFE-II was set up to assess how the current failure models can predict failure under 3D stresses. For this reason, the originators of failure theories were provided with 12 test cases, selected and provided by the organisers. These test cases are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312449887">Table 1</xref> and they include tests on an unreinforced matrix, a unidirectional laminate and multi-directional laminates both unidirectional (UD) lamina and multi-directional laminates. They include five lay-ups: an isotropic polymer material, UD laminae, cross-ply laminate, angle-ply laminate and quasi-isotropic laminate. Six different fibre/matrix combinations were used and these are: an epoxy, T300/epoxy, E-glass/epoxy, S-glass/epoxy, AS Carbon/epoxy and IM7/8551 materials.

<p>The coordinate system used to describe the stresses in a lamina is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312449887">Figure 1</xref>(a), where directions 1, 2 and 3 coincide with fibre direction, transverse direction and through-thickness direction, respectively. In the present analysis, the application of equal triaxial compressive stresses is commonly referred to as hydrostatic compressive loading where: (<italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub>) = (<italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub>) = (<italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub>) = −<italic>P</italic> where <italic>P</italic> is the equivalent hydrostatic pressure. Similarly, the application of equal triaxial tension (i.e. (+<italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub>) = (+<italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub>) = (+<italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub>)) causes an analogous hydrostatic tensile state (i.e. +<italic>P</italic>).

<p>Column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449887">Table 3</xref> indicates whether a three-dimensional laminate theory (3DLT) alone or combined with a finite element (FE) program was used in carrying out the predictions. All of the contributors utilised 3DLT as the main ‘calculation engine’ on which to base their theory. A number of the participants utilised finite element methods (Pinho, Tsai–Ha, Puck and Hansen).</p>

<p>All of the participants were aware of the presence of the thermal stresses. However, a significant portion of the participants (Christensen, Pinho, Wolfe, Bogetti, Cuntze and Hashin) did not take residual thermal stresses into account in some or all in Test Cases. Other contributors did consider the thermal stresses, but not all in the same way or to the same extent. For example, Huang was the only contributor to provide an analysis that considers residual stresses at the micromechanics (i.e. resin and fibres) level.</p>

<p>All of the theories were able to discriminate between a minimum of two modes of failure and, in general, a wide variety of modes was postulated including:- fibre failure (tension, compression or shear) to matrix failure (due to transverse tension, transverse compression, shear or a combination of these three). In most cases the theories used the lamina properties (provided to all participants) from which to predict the modes of failure rather than constituent (fibre or matrix) properties. However, Hansen, Huang and Tsai–Ha used the constituent fibre and matrix properties (also provided to all participants) for determining failure.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021998312449887"><title>Micromechanics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449887">Table 3</xref>, Column 7)</title>
<p>The majority of models consider the failure behaviour of the matrix to be different to that of the UD lamina. However, some of the methods (Huang, Carrere, Tsai–Ha, Hansen) rely on suitable micromechanics relationships to predict the behaviour of the lamina and the laminates from that of the matrix and the reinforcing fibres.
<list id="list1-0021998312449887" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Huang’s theory relies on micro mechanics for determining the UD lamina properties. Huang used the nonlinear shear stress/strain curves of the matrix to determine the nonlinear behaviour of the lamina. Using a ‘bridging’ model, he adjusted the constituent properties to give lamina properties close to those provided in the exercise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hansen’s and Tsai–Ha’s theories are micromechanics based. Finite element analyses were employed to predict lamina properties from constituent properties, assuming linear elastic fibres and non-linear elastic matrix behaviour and allowing one constituent to fail while the other remains intact. Tsai–Ha also adjusted the constituent properties to give lamina properties close to those provided in the exercise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Others (Cuntze, Rotem, Pinho) have used micromechanics to obtain modified elastic constants, and occasionally strength data, of a lamina under hydrostatic pressure.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec11-0021998312449887"><title>Post-initial failure degradation models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449887">Table 3</xref>, Column 8)</title>
<p>This entry specifies whether or not the theory used any degradation model to account for post initial failure behaviour. Multidirectional laminates subjected to uniaxial, biaxial or triaxial stresses may still be capable of carrying load after first ply failure or initial failure has occurred. Modelling post failure behaviour of a laminate requires that certain assumptions be made regarding the properties of the degraded lamina. All of these models shared the following common features:
<list id="list2-0021998312449887" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>All rely on ply-by-ply analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All assume that fibre failure, be it in tension or in compression, constitutes final failure. In certain instances, and in order to take into account hydrostatic pressure effects, the models introduced a pressure dependency term to the fibre compression failure strength, making the lamina too strong to fail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Almost all models distinguish between failures under transverse tension and that under transverse compression. Here the term ‘transverse’ is used to refer to the direction perpendicular to the fibres, i.e. direction 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312449887">Figure 1</xref>, in a UD fibre-reinforced lamina.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The majority of the models were unable to take into account any differences in the strengths of the lamina in the through-thickness and in the transverse directions (ie the models were based on assumption of transverse isotropy).</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec12-0021998312449887"><title>Title of computer program used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449887">Table 3</xref>, Column 9)</title>
<p>In view of the complexity of many of the theories, most of the participants have developed their own computer code and the entry in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449887">Table 3</xref> lists the name of the computer program used by the participants. For the test cases corresponding to UD plies (test cases 1–7), some of the participants obtained their predictions using a simple explicit code (Fortran, MATLAB, MathCad, etc.) that solves the lamina constitutive relations together with the appropriate failure criteria used. For the multi-directional laminates (test cases 8–12), and owing to the fact that the loadings involves 3D stresses, some participants employed 3D explicit finite element code to calculate the 3D ply stresses, as these were seen to impossible to obtain from classical lamination theory.</p>
<p>In summary, the participants have either coupled their analysis into a commercial code (Tsai–Ha, Hansen, Puck and Pinho), or written their own (Bogetti, Hashin, Rotem, Huang, Cuntze, Wolfe, Carrere and Christensen). These latter codes were written in various languages (Visual Basic, Fortran, Matlab, MathCad, etc.).</p>

<sec id="sec14-0021998312449887"><title>Modifications made to theories used in the WWFE-I</title>
<p>Eight of the 12 theories were employed and assessed in WWFE-I and these are marked in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312449887">Table 2</xref>. However it is worth noting that originators of some of these theories have had to make modifications in order to extend what were essentially 2-D formulation's that (arguably) sufficed for WWFE-I into a 3-D formulation that could be employed in WWFE-II. In those instances, it leaves an open question as to whether the reformulated 3-D variants would give the same or different predictions to those made by the 2-D variant against the original WWFE-I test cases. In at least one instance (Huang) the contributor has carried out that comparison (paper in draft and awaiting publication) and we encourage the other contributors to do likewise in due course.</p>
<p>A summary of the key changes that were made in the eight ‘original WWFE-1' theories is as follows :-</p>

<p>It can be concluded that the majority of the eight theories that were employed in WWFE-I received significant revision to cater for failure prediction under 3D stress states. The largest modifications have taken place in the Tsai–Ha theory. The new theory, referred to as micromechanics of failure (MMF) is fundamentally different to that originally developed by Tsai.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449887">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>All the theories predicted an increase in the laminate strength under triaxial compression (i.e. under combined −<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>, −<italic>σ<sub>y</sub></italic>, −<italic>σ<sub>z</sub></italic> loadings. The degree of enhancement varied from one theory to another with Cuntze predicting the largest enhancement and Christensen predicting the lowest.

</list></p>
<p>Some of these factors are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<sec id="sec47-0021998312449887"><title>Differences between through-thickness and transverse strengths</title>
<p>The organisers provided the participants with data that showed that, for some composite materials, the direct strength in the through-thickness direction is different to that in the transverse direction. The majority of the models employed were unable to account for differences between the through-thickness and transverse strength values of a UD lamina. The formulation of these models (ie employing transverse isotropy assumptions) did not allow for these differences.</p>
<p>One of the models that showed a peculiar dependency on the through-thickness strength is that of Christensen. The model assumes that the through-thickness shear strength <italic>S</italic><sub>23</sub> plays a major role in determining the magnitude of biaxial and triaxial failure stresses. This strength is given in terms of the transverse tensile (<italic>Y<sub>T</sub></italic>) and transverse compressive (<italic>Y<sub>C</sub></italic>) strength where the following condition must be satisfied: <inline-formula id="ilm1-0021998312449887"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021998312449887"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>23</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The model did not take into account the through-thickness strengths (<italic>Z<sub>T</sub></italic> and <italic>Z<sub>C</sub></italic>). In addition, the data provided by the organisers did not satisfy the above relationship. Consequently, Christensen assumed a convenient value for <italic>S</italic><sub>23</sub> in order to carry out the analysis. As a result, some of the low compressive strength predictions for some of the test cases were affected by the choice of the value of <italic>S</italic><sub>23</sub>.</p>

<sec id="sec48-0021998312449887"><title>Differences between failure criteria for isotropic and anisotropic materials</title>
<p>In order to assess how the models were used to predict the behaviour of both homogeneous and orthotropic materials, the organisers provided the participants with two key test cases. Test case 1 deals with an isotropic material subjected to a range of triaxial compressive stress states and test case 5 is concerned with a UD lamina subjected to the same conditions. The test cases selected here are important building blocks in our understanding of traditional, high performance, continuous fibre, laminated composites which typically contain 60% fibre volume fraction in order to gain both stiffness and strength.</p>
<p>It is accepted that a number of failure models rely on micromechanics to model the behaviour of the composite starting from that of the constituents, namely fibres and matrix. For this reason, a full understanding of the response of resin matrix is crucial for gaining an insight into how these micromechanics models tackle the behaviour of one of the main constituents of a composite material.</p>
<p>The two cases are interrelated insofar as the epoxy polymer material studied in test case 1 is the same resin matrix used in making the E-glass/epoxy composite laminate in test case 5. Hence, in choosing test cases 1 and 5 these will begin to illuminate the assumptions made in each theory regarding the treatment of material isotropy/anisotropy and material heterogeneity. The mechanical properties are provided in Kaddour and Hinton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312449887">3</xref></sup> where the epoxy exhibits isotropic stiffness but anisotropic strength properties, with a uniaxial tensile strength that is lower than the uniaxial compressive strength.</p>
<p>As there are many stress combinations that can be applied under 3D loadings, test cases 1 and 5 deal with a section through the 3D space and the state of stress consists of the following:</p>
<p><bold>For case 1</bold>: Combined <italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub> (= <italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub>): The stresses applied are such that those in 1 and 3 directions are equal while that in 2 direction varies proportional to that in 1 direction.</p>
<p><bold>For case 5</bold>: Combined <italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub> (= <italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub>): Where <italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub> is applied parallel to the fibre direction, <italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub> is applied in the through thickness direction and <italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub> is applied in the transverse direction.</p>

These will be referred to as ‘seamless’ models and they include Bogetti’s and Hashin’s models. In one of these models (Hashin’s), the application of the composite criteria to isotropic material resulted in two sets of predictions, depending upon the interpretation of the stresses applied. Based on these two sets of prediction, the innermost (i.e. most conservative) envelope, resulting from the interaction between the two curves, was considered in the present work, as recommended by the participants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysis type 2 (switched models):These theories use different sets of equations, one for the isotropic material (test case 1) and a separate set for the anisotropic material (test case 5 and all the other test cases). These will be referred to as ‘switched’ models. It can be then concluded that the majority of the participants used ‘switched’ models.</p></list-item>

<p>The participants have employed a wide range of failure criteria on a lamina level. In addition, extra terms were introduced to account for the pressure effects on the strength (and occasionally the modulus and the failure strain). Hansen, Rotem, Pinho and Cuntze have used various terms to account for the pressure effects. One of the consequences of doing so is that the lamina strength under triaxial compression was increased and in some instances there was no failure.</p>
<p>In addition, it was noted that some of the participants introduced various forms of cut-offs in the envelopes in the tension-tension space for some test cases (e.g. test cases 1 and 5). These were introduced to indicate the dominance of different modes of failure.</p>
<p>For those models using micromechanics, their results showed noticeably a wide range of predictions that were different to those from other theories. These models include Hansen, Tsai–Ha and Huang. Some of the extreme predictions observed in all the test cases were from these models. For instance, 19 of the 33 cases analysed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0021998312449887">Table 7</xref> identified Hansen, Tsai–Ha and Huang models as those giving either highest or lowest predictions.</p>
<p>The use of maximum strain theory (Bogetti’s model) gave different results to all of the other models. In general, the theory produced some of largest predictions under tension–tension–tension stresses (in cases 1, 5–7) and the lowest predictions under compression–compression–compression stresses (cases 1, 2, 5–8). It also gave the lowest prediction for the through-thickness compressive strengths in test cases 10-12.</p>
<p>Similarly, Christensen’s theory gave some of the lowest predictions in test cases 2, 3, 5–8. As the data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0021998312449887">Table 7</xref>, Christensen’s theory gave a total of 12 of the lowest predictions, see column 5. These were the result of the use of a single second order quadratic failure criterion for the matrix and the assumptions made regarding the relationship between the through-thickness shear strength and the transverse tension and compression strength of a lamina. The selection of the value of <italic>S</italic><sub>23</sub> was seen to be crucially important for the prediction of this theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec50-0021998312449887"><title>Residual thermal stresses due to curing</title>
<p>Another major factor that affected the strength prediction of the laminates was thermal stresses. All the participants were aware that residual thermal stresses could arise in composite laminates that were made at elevated temperatures and then cooled to the operating temperature. However, only a few of the contributors attempted to consider the effects of thermal stresses on their predictions.</p>
<p>Those contributors who took thermal stresses into account used conventional laminate theory to calculate the effects of differential thermal contraction between layers. Only Huang allowed for differential contraction between fibres and matrix within a layer.</p>
<p>It was striking that the effects of thermal stresses on the strength and strain predictions were quite considerable where the difference between the strengths with and without residual stresses was up to 100%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0021998312449887">Table 9</xref> shows the effects of thermal stresses on the predicted strength and ultimate failure strains for some of the test cases as obtained by some of the participants.

<p>The results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0021998312449887">Table 9</xref>, and from the individual papers of those participants who considered thermal stresses, show the following features:
<list id="list37-0021998312449887" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Thermal stresses can affect the strength and deformation under through-thickness and triaxial stresses in a manner similar to that under in-plane loading.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effects can be magnified when nonlinear behaviour is employed. For instance, the stress–strain curves in test case 12 are predicted to be nonlinear by some participants, especially in the loading direction:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The results from Puck’s, Christensen’s and Carrere’s models show that the strength of the laminate in test case 12 is reduced by around 10%, due to inclusion of thermal stresses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results from the nonlinear analysis of Puck’s and Carrere’s models showed that the failure strain is reduced, due to the inclusion of thermal stresses, by 28%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results from Huang’s model, which showed smaller nonlinearities, indicated that the strength is dropped by 34% and the failure strain by 14%, due to the inclusion of thermal stresses.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The experimental measured properties of the UD laminae used as input data would include some effects of residual stresses arising during curing but the issue of residual stresses seems to be important and has not been thoroughly addressed in this exercise.</p>
<p>It may be concluded that the effects of thermal stresses could play a role in the correlation between the various predictions.</p>

<p>
<list id="list38-0021998312449887" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A comparison has been made between 12 leading theories employed, by their originators (or their supporters) in the WWFE-II for the prediction of 3D strength and deformation response of 12 challenging test cases. The latter involve various isotropic and fibre-reinforced polymer laminates (0°, (0°/±45°/90°)<sub>s</sub>, (±35°)<sub>s</sub> and (0°/90°)<sub>s</sub> laminates) subjected to a range of through-thickness and triaxial loading conditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The majority of the eight theories that were employed in WWFE-I received significant revision to cater for the failure prediction under 3D stress states analysed in WWFE-II. It is perhaps a sign that the science has moved on significantly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No two models gave identical predictions for any of 12 test cases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was a lack of consensus regarding the effects of pressure on the elastic constants, strength behaviour and shear stress–stress curves of the composite lamina.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To avoid the complexity of using closed form solutions for the 3D stress analysis of laminates, some participants used finite element codes to obtain the 3D stresses and deformations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was a clear tendency among the participants to use micromechanics for the predictions of the test cases. The results of the various micromechanical models showed large divergence, when compared with each other.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The overwhelming majority of theoreticians (9 out of 12) employed separate equations to delineate between isotropic and heterogeneous materials. This appears not to be an opaque feature of the models employed and rather it appears to require a conscious ‘operator intervention’ to make that selection, based on an examination of the problem to be analysed. From a designer’s perspective, the preference would be for the provision of modelling tools with assured resilience that predictions would be accurate in all circumstances without undue (and ideally any) operator intervention).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was significant diversity between the theoretical predictions in terms of whether or not the envelopes should be open under equal combined compressive through-thickness and transverse stresses and under equal triaxial compressive stresses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No consensus was achieved on how to predict the nonlinear lamina shear stress–strain curves under high levels of hydrostatic pressure. A variety of methods were employed and the predicted failure shear strain at −600 MPa pressure ranged from 3% to 27% and the shear strength from 50 to 300 MPa.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The models gave a relatively wide range of predictions for the uniaxial through-thickness strengths of the laminates in test cases 10 and 11. Differences in the prediction of the through-thickness tension and through-thickness shear strengths were up to 200% and those in the prediction of through-thickness compression were around 300%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was a general consensus among many theories that the application of compressive through-thickness stress leads to an increase in the shear strength of a UD lamina and in the through-thickness shear strength of a multi-directional laminates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In this article, we have concentrated on drawing attention to differences between the various theories and particularly to differences between their predictions for the selected laminates and biaxial loading cases. The fact that a theory predicts different results from all of the other theories does not necessarily mean that it is incorrect. Any judgements as to which theoretical approach is the best should be suspended until the comparison with experimental results is conducted and commented upon in Part B of WWFE-II.</p></list-item>
