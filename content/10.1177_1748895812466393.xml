<abstract>
<p>Over the past four decades the police service strength in England and Wales grew by nearly a third. This was at a time when the population grew by just 10 per cent. This sustained period of growth came to an end with the 2010 spending review which called for a 20 per cent cut in government funding of the police. In this paper the expansion of the state police is examined, expansion that is all the more remarkable coming at a time of increased competition and – from the mid-1990s onwards – falling levels of recorded crime. But not only did the number of police officers increase, so too their roles and responsibilities, reflective of Simon’s (2007) governing through crime meta-narrative and symptomatic of the criminalization of social policy – or more specifically the ‘policification’ (cf. Kemshall and Maguire, 2001). In this context it is argued that enforced contraction could be a positive opportunity to reappraise what the state police ought to be doing. The policing task is conceptualized as being either wide policing or narrow policing. Examples are given where narrowing may be both possible and beneficial. It is acknowledged that other agencies are facing similar cuts and may not be able pick up tasks left by the police. However, it is argued there are tangible benefits of having a state police that is more focused.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the election of a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895812466393">May 2010</xref>, British policing policy – and public policy more broadly – witnessed major shifts in priorities. First, there was increased emphasis on the development of local solutions to community problems in what Prime Minister Cameron called his ‘Big Society’ project. According to the new Home Secretary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895812466393">Theresa May (2010)</xref>, ‘[t]he solution to your community’s problems will not come from officials sitting in the Home Office working on the latest national action plan’; instead, ‘the people who are closest to the problem need to be driving the solution’. For May, the previous New Labour government had adopted a ‘top–down, bureaucratic, gimmick-laden approach’ to policing. Certainly, New Labour had embraced new public management and associated central targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895812466393">McLaughlin, 2007</xref>). What was proposed was a shift from top–down to bottom–up governance of crime and anti-social behaviour problems – at least in intention. The second shift was that there was a lot less money available. Within the context of the global financial crisis and the country’s massive deficit, the October 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895812466393">HM Treasury, 2010</xref>) called for major reductions in public expenditure in England and Wales, including an unprecedented 20 per cent cut in police funding by government by 2014–2015. This was accompanied by a freeze in police recruitment. For the police the boom years were over – when Chief Constables could successfully ask governments for increased police numbers and generous budgets.</p>
<p>Circumstances are clearly important in dictating demand for the police and in August 2011 large-scale urban rioting and looting in some of England’s major cities put extra pressure on police resources. Both during and after the disturbances there were numerous calls to rethink government policy on cutting police budgets. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895812466393">Simon Reed (2011)</xref>, Vice-Chair of the Police Federation, the riots demonstrated a ‘need for sufficient numbers of police officers who can be called upon as and when they are needed’. Reed went on to state: ‘I don’t know how the government decide what price they place on public safety but … our view [is] that cutting the police budget is inadvisable and could jeopardize public safety’.</p>
<p>There was also disquiet from within the Conservative Party, with London’s Mayor Boris Johnson claiming, ‘This is not a time to think about making substantial cuts in police numbers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895812466393">BBC News, 2011a</xref>). However, the coalition remained adamant that, in order to reduce the budget deficit, cuts were still needed – including in the police service. Further change came in November 2012 with the introduction for the first time of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) across England and Wales – albeit following an unprecedented low turnout of just 15 per cent, raising questions over the democratic legitimacy of the elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895812466393">Electoral Commission, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1748895812466393">Rogers and Burn-Murdoch, 2012</xref>). The new PCCs take office at a very difficult time with the police being asked to do more with less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895812466393">Millie and Bullock, 2012</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895812466393">Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC, 2011</xref>: 3) ‘The police service … is facing its biggest financial challenge in a generation. This could be seen either as an opportunity to innovate and refresh – or as a reason to continue as is and see services cut back’.</p>
<p>The focus for this article is the squeeze on police numbers in England and Wales. This is not to discount challenges to police budgets elsewhere. For instance, in Scotland, following the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, all eight police forces are merging into a single ‘Police Service of Scotland’ in the hope that this ‘reduces duplication and creates a new streamlined structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1748895812466393">Scottish Government, 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895812466393">1</xref></sup> The politics and complexity of England and Wales’ 43 forces made this less of an option. For England and Wales cuts have to be found elsewhere. In this article, rather than seeing this as necessarily a bad thing, it is argued that, if handled correctly, the state police might benefit from a new diet; that it might indeed be an opportunity to ‘innovate and refresh’.</p>
<p>The article considers the historic expansion of police numbers in England and Wales and related mission creep, leading to growth in the policing task. The policing task is conceptualized as being either wide policing or narrow policing. Examples of wide policing are given, including the police operating as probation/social workers, school workers, disaster managers and as providers of stewarding/event security. It is argued that state policing in England and Wales has become too wide. What could characterize a narrower form of policing is then considered. It is acknowledged that other agencies are facing similar cuts and may not be able to pick up tasks left by the police. However, it is argued there are tangible benefits of having a state police that is more focused.</p>

<title>Expansion in Police Numbers</title>
<p>In recent years a major challenge facing state policing in Britain – as elsewhere – has been its diminishing monopoly with the expansion of other ‘plural’ forms of policing and security provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895812466393">Johnston and Shearing, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895812466393">Jones and Newburn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1748895812466393">Zedner, 2006</xref>). As other providers have increased – ranging from private security guards to local authority employed wardens – it would be logical to expect the state police to have decreased. Yet the opposite has occurred with considerable growth occurring during both the 1997–2010 New Labour years and the previous Conservative administrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748895812466393">Figure 1</xref>). The pressure for expansion was not unique to British policing and in Western democracies such growth is not a new phenomenon. For instance, despite some local variation, state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States grew overall from 1992 to 2008 from 2.38 sworn officers per 1,000 people to 2.51 – an increase of a quarter in absolute terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1748895812466393">Reaves, 2011</xref>). In Canada the number of police personnel increased from 1.7 to 2.8 per 1,000 people between 1962 and 1977 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812466393">Ericson, 1982</xref>: 4). More recently in Australia, police numbers expanded across all states between 2000 and 2005. In particular, New South Wales witnessed growth of 10 per cent in police numbers over this five-year period, while the population increased by just 3 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895812466393">Australian Institute of Criminology, 2006</xref>). The former Commissioner of New South Wales Police, Ken Moroney, has commented that ‘recruitment for the future has to be more than just more police numbers and more police numbers – or as we say in this state, “more blue shirts and more blue shirts”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748895812466393">Millie, 2009b</xref>: 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895812466393">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>In Britain the approach to state policing for the past four decades has been, to borrow Moroney’s phrase, ‘more blue shirts and more blue shirts’. The police service strength for England and Wales<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748895812466393">3</xref></sup> in 1977 was just over 108,000. Ten years later in 1987 it was 11 per cent higher at nearly 120,500. Over the next 15 years the figure increased to over 127,000 in 2002. Even larger increases in police numbers occurred from 2002 onwards and by 2009 the police service strength for England and Wales was around 141,500 – nearly a third higher than it had been in 1977 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895812466393">Allen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895812466393">Dhani, 2012</xref>). In 2010 police service strength remained roughly the same, but by 2011 the freeze on recruitment had started to have some effect and by 2012 the figure was down to 134,100 – although still significantly higher than it had been a decade before.</p>
<p>The current fall in police service strength is due to the government cuts and freeze on recruitment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895812466393">HMIC, 2012</xref>). The question is why did the number of police officers increase so dramatically in the first place, and especially from 2002 onwards? As in other jurisdictions, the increase in police numbers cannot be explained solely by parallel increases in population. The population of England and Wales increased by roughly 10 per cent from 1981 to 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895812466393">Beaumont, 2011</xref>); over the same period the police service strength increased by 22 per cent. The increase in numbers was also not a response to increases in crime. All official measures of crime were already falling from 1995 onwards. As way of illustration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748895812466393">Figure 1</xref> charts 30 years of police service strength in England and Wales (1981–2011) alongside changes to the British Crime Survey (BCS) measure of crime, with both indexed at 100 for 1981.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748895812466393">Figure 1</xref> should not be interpreted as demonstrating cause and effect. Just as increases in police numbers are not due to increases in official crime rates, the falls in crime cannot be explained simply by increased police numbers – not least because the largest falls in BCS crime occurred <italic>before</italic> the largest increases in police personnel. This is not to say that the police had no impact in sustaining the crime drop, but increases in police numbers can only ever be part of any explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748895812466393">4</xref></sup> It is possible that crimes which are excluded from the BCS or are difficult for the police to record were increasing, such as internet frauds, business/white-collar crimes, and so on. However, the government and the police have tended to be primarily interested in crimes that get measured. The performance culture and targets characteristic of new public management have meant that ‘what gets counted will continue to get done’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812466393">Herrington and Millie, 2006</xref>: 154). If fewer ‘official’ crimes were counted from the mid-1990s onwards, there should be less for the police to do. However, although recorded crime was down, the state police found plenty to be doing.</p>

<sec id="section3-1748895812466393">
<title>What Were the Expanded State Police Doing?</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895812466393">Brodeur (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812466393">2010</xref>) the policing task can be divided between high policing and low policing. Low policing equates to everyday policing activities, often conducted by uniformed officers. High policing relates to the work of the intelligence community. This article’s focus is principally on everyday/low policing which is conceptualized as being either wide policing or narrow policing. Wide policing has diverse objectives, including catching criminals, reducing crime, tackling terrorism, addressing people’s fears, reassuring the community, and so on. Narrow policing concentrates on a more limited set of objectives. An especially narrow conception of policing is held by the coalition Home Secretary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895812466393">Theresa May (2011a)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>…the test of the effectiveness of the police, the sole objective against which they will be judged, the way in which communities should be able to hold them to account, is their success in cutting crime. I haven’t asked the police to be social workers, I haven’t set them any performance indicators, and I haven’t given them a thirty point plan, I’ve told them to cut crime.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Theresa May made a similar point at the 2011 Conservative Party Conference: ‘Some people question why we’re reforming the police. For me, the reason is simple. We need them to be the tough, no-nonsense crime-fighters they signed up to become’.</p>
<p>In this article I argue that the remit of the state police in Britain has become too wide and would benefit from having a task that is more focused – but not as narrow as that proposed by Theresa May. The police are there to be more than ‘no-nonsense crime-fighters’, although historically this has not always been recognized. For example, writing in the late 1970s, Maurice Punch observed that, ‘the police as an organization is often reluctant to acknowledge its latent social role, largely through fear of becoming a repository for too many diffuse and distasteful tasks shed by other agencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748895812466393">1979</xref>: 102). However, the police were acquiring a number of other roles and responsibilities and by the 1990s the Conservative government was keen to lighten their load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1748895812466393">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>). In 1995 the Home Office attempted to identify superfluous core and ancillary tasks that could be shed or moved to other agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748895812466393">5</xref></sup> Suggestions included: missing persons, schools work, lost property and stray dogs, noise nuisance, responses to alarms, public/sporting event stewarding, gaming, betting and licensing, court summons, warrants and other administrative duties, court security and immigration and other escorts. Further cuts were proposed for traffic police, including the introduction of private escorts for abnormal loads, a review of patrol and use of technology. Although the recommendations of the report were not fully implemented at the time, many of these changes have since taken place, such as local authorities taking responsibility for noise nuisance, the use of private security for aspects of court work and, from 2004, the introduction of Highways Agency Traffic Officers who took on some of the duties of traffic police.</p>
<p>Despite contraction in some areas, other activities remained and have been added to. There was continued development of specialist teams and operations that required the skills of highly trained officers. For example, while British policing has a long history of having to deal with terrorism, post-9/11 threats have stretched the roles and responsibilities of the state police in both ‘low’ and ‘high’ policing (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812466393">Brodeur, 2010</xref>), for instance through requiring them to operate with security partners to ‘pursue’, ‘prevent’, ‘protect’ and ‘prepare’ for terrorist threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895812466393">HM Government, 2011</xref>). The introduction of Community Safety Partnerships with the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act has also increased pressure on police resources and time. Perhaps most significant – in terms of the number of officers required – has been a greater emphasis on community policing. A shift to community styles of policing was partly driven by police management who, post-Scarman’s 1981 report into the Brixton riots, were keen to prove their mandate was more than merely controlling crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895812466393">Reiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1748895812466393">Savage, 2007a</xref>). However, by the turn of the century a ‘reassurance gap’ had been identified where recorded crime was falling, but the public still felt that crime was rising and were losing confidence in the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748895812466393">Millie and Herrington, 2005</xref>). According to HMIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1748895812466393">Povey, 2001</xref>: 167), this was in part due to ‘a performance culture that counts crimes and detections … [meaning] other components of reassurance have been largely ignored’. There followed increased focus on community styles of policing, first in the guise of ‘Reassurance Policing’ and then through ‘Neighbourhood Policing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895812466393">Innes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748895812466393">Millie and Herrington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1748895812466393">Savage, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895812466393">Millie, 2010</xref>). These approaches required large numbers of officers who were visible on patrol, accessible and familiar to local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1748895812466393">Povey, 2001</xref>). By 2008 there were reported to be 3,600 Neighbourhood Policing Teams across England and Wales consisting of around 13,000 police officers and 16,000 Police Community Support Officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895812466393">HMIC, 2008</xref>: 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1748895812466393">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1748895812466393">Savage (2007a)</xref>, such police reform has multiple drivers. Although the increasing focus on community styles of policing was partly driven by police management, it was also reflective of populist politics that called for ‘more bobbies on the beat’, and such populism dictated that a reduction in police numbers was a no-go area for government. During New Labour’s terms in office the party was keen to prove its law and order credentials and, maybe, overemphasized the importance of police numbers as something that is easy to measure and thereby to demonstrate apparent success. For the 2005 general election, for example, New Labour promised its vision of Neighbourhood Policing with dedicated and locally known officers patrolling each neighbourhood. Similarly, the Conservative Party promised the electorate an extra 5,000 officers per year, and the Liberal Democrats promised 10,000 more officers on the streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895812466393">Millie, 2008</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895812466393">Loader (2006</xref>: 207) the result was a ‘self-propelling circle whereby popular demands, and the numbers of police supplied in a bid to meet them, [were] both endlessly ratcheted up’.</p>
<p>At this time government policy also became increasingly focused on anti-social behaviour, especially among young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895812466393">Burney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748895812466393">Millie, 2009a</xref>). These young people thereby needed to be policed – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895812466393">Brogden and Ellison (2013)</xref> claim to be an example of police mission creep. Yet it is well documented that patrols only rarely deal with actual crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895812466393">Kelling et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895812466393">Clarke and Hough, 1984</xref>). In fact, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812466393">Ericson (1982</xref>: 6–7), ‘the primary function of the uniformed police has always been to patrol the petty … the more police one has the more petty matters will be pursued’. With a focus on anti-social behaviour there were plenty of comparatively ‘petty’ matters the newly expanded force of neighbourhood officers could focus on.</p>
<p>The state police have acquired further tasks through mission creep, or expanded areas of work that may be better suited to other agencies, community groups or volunteers – a process characteristic of wide policing. For other agencies to take over, funding would have to be directed there instead – which in the current fiscal climate is not an easy option. Yet such activities may be tackled more effectively if not by the police. At a time of budget cuts it is in these areas where there is scope for re-examining what the state police are responsible for, and what they are not. These activities may also be done more cheaply if not by the police. The recent Windsor Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1748895812466393">2012</xref>: 21) highlighted that state police officers receive between 10–15 per cent higher salaries than most public sector workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895812466393">Brogden and Ellison, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, handing over some responsibilities to community workers and volunteers would be politically attractive as it would tie in with the coalition government’s agendas on localism and ‘the big society’.</p>
<p>The greater involvement of the police in activities characteristic of wide policing is reflective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1748895812466393">Simon’s (2007)</xref> meta-narrative of ‘governing through crime’ with tackling crime becoming a justification for all sorts of state actions. As Simon has noted, ‘Across all kinds of institutional settings, people are seen as acting legitimately when they act to prevent crimes or other troubling behaviors that can be closely analogized to crimes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1748895812466393">2007</xref>: 4). Thus education and youth work are important because of their potential impact on the prevention of crime. Similarly, social welfare is important, as much for its impact on crime as for improving the life chances of the welfare recipient. The expansion of policing into non-traditional activities can similarly be seen as part of wider processes of the criminalization of social policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895812466393">Crawford, 1997</xref>), or in this case the ‘policification’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895812466393">Kemshall and Maguire, 2001</xref>), with police officers taking on more roles that are traditionally covered by other social or welfare agencies.</p>
<p>Four examples of such ‘wide policing’ are considered below, these being the police as probation or social worker, school worker, disaster manager and steward/event security. Police officers may be well suited and equipped for many of these roles; however, it is argued that these activities (and others) are not central to the policing task.</p>

<title>Police Officer as Probation Officer and Social Worker</title>
<p>The state police’s embrace of new public management led to greater emphases on risk management and public protection resulting in expansion into the role of offender supervision. From 1999 onwards closer working relationships between probation and police were witnessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1748895812466393">Nash, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1748895812466393">2008</xref>) to the extent that, ‘in a variety of settings, roles have been established which take individual practitioners some way from their roots in terms of professional practice and culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1748895812466393">Nash: 2008</xref>: 302). The limits of such partnership arrangements have been acknowledged with the police often becoming the dominant partner (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895812466393">Crawford, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895812466393">Kemshall and Maguire (2001)</xref>, the increased involvement of the police in probation work has led to the ‘policification’ of probation. For example, over the past decade the merging, or overlapping, of responsibilities has been evident in the risk-focused Prolific and other Priority Offender (PPO) strategy and Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPAs). For the PPO strategy some of the most prolific offenders have been mentored by case managers, and these are often police officers working as ‘Police Offender Managers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895812466393">Millie and Erol, 2006</xref>). For MAPPA, serious violent and sexual offenders are often jointly managed by the police and probation services (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895812466393">Kemshall et al., 2005</xref>). In both cases a wide definition of the policing task is used. Mentoring or managing serious offenders hopefully prevents further offending and police officers can be effective in such roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895812466393">Millie and Erol, 2006</xref>); yet there is potential for functional blurring with officers expected to adopt the social service/caring function of offender management whilst simultaneously maintaining the more traditional police role of intelligence gathering. For some clients this may prove difficult and would impact on the building of trust essential for such work. This is an area of wide policing that could be passed on to probation and social work staff who may be better equipped and trained for such a role – although at a time of budget cuts, their resources are as restricted as the police’s.</p>

<title>Police Officer as School Worker</title>
<p>Drawing on experiences in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1748895812466393">Simon, 2007</xref>) and, again, following a risk paradigm, Safer School Partnerships (SSPs) were introduced in England, with police officers routinely stationed within school premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895812466393">Bowles et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895812466393">Briers and Dickmann, 2011</xref>). Evolving from the 2002 Street Crime Initiative (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895812466393">FitzGerald, 2007</xref>), SSPs were originally concerned with problem behaviour in and around schools in high crime areas, although the scheme has since expanded. The police officers’ remit is both criminal and non-criminal (but problematic) behaviour and it is estimated that in England 20 per cent of primary schools and 45 per cent of secondary schools are involved in the scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895812466393">Briers and Dickmann, 2011</xref>: 175). The result was a move from school discipline as a problem for educators to one that concerned the police, sometimes as the first choice response. In a form of criminalization of education policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748895812466393">Millie and Moore, 2011</xref>) the risk is that police officers could find crime and anti-social behaviour where there is simple indiscipline. Furthermore, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895812466393">Police Foundation (2011</xref>: 8):<disp-quote>
<p>One concern is that although the original purpose of introducing police presence in schools was the reduction of crime and antisocial behaviour, the role has been widened to encompass identification of risk factors pointing towards future bad behaviour or extremism. This area should be approached with caution … it is worth remembering that most schools are well-ordered, crime-free environments where children come to learn and that some level of disruption should be viewed as normal childish behaviour rather than a sign of future criminality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The presence of police officers within schools fits a wide definition of the policing task. That some officers become involved in teaching classes and in minor discipline issues stretches the function of the police even further. In light of the current budget cuts, making police presence non-permanent has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895812466393">Police Foundation, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1748895812466393">
<title>Police Officer as Disaster Manager</title>
<p>The third example is the police’s role in disaster management. The police would, of course, be expected to be involved in disaster management, both during and after an event. For example, the police have roles in crowd control, riot prevention and post-disaster criminal investigation. Yet media coverage of any disaster reveals that the police do much more than this, and are commonly the agency ‘in control’. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895812466393">Davis (2012</xref>: 11):<disp-quote>
<p>… guidance confirms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748895812466393">7</xref></sup> the pre-eminence of the police in UK emergencies: co-ordinating other agencies, securing sites, recording evidence and processing casualty information … Police now also have important roles in Survivor Reception Centres, Family and Friends Reception Centres and Humanitarian Assistance Centres, where they will ‘tend to be the initial point of contact’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A recent example is a mining accident in the Swansea Valley in September 2011. After extensive rescue efforts the bodies of four miners were found. The announcement was made by Chief Constable of South Wales Police, Peter Vaughan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895812466393">BBC News, 2011b</xref>), who thanked Mines Rescue, Caves Rescue, the Mines Inspectorate with the Health and Safety Inspectorate, the emergency services, local authorities and volunteers. Despite others taking the lead with the rescue it was the police who were ‘in control’ and had the highest media profile during the tragedy. Of course, in such situations someone needs to be in control as without coordination there can be confusion and inadequate or overlapping responses. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895812466393">Davis (2012)</xref> noted confusion of roles between Police Family Liaison Officers and social services following the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999. Drawing on interviews with Metropolitan Police Officers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895812466393">Davis (2012</xref>: 12) also observed:<disp-quote>
<p>Police regard survivors’, relatives’ or witnesses’ disclosures to partner agencies as potential evidence and/or intelligence and argue that there can be ‘no absolute guarantee of confidentiality’ … The idea of ‘covert’ use of a family liaison ‘cover’ by anti-terrorism officers has raised debate among police themselves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the police taking the lead, certain minority or ‘suspect communities’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895812466393">Hillyard, 1993</xref>) may be reluctant to assist for fear of becoming targets of police action. It is possible that other more neutral organizations, such as the fire and rescue service, are better placed to take the lead in such situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1748895812466393">
<title>Police Officer as Steward/Event Security</title>
<p>The state police have a long history of security provision and managing large crowds at sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1748895812466393">O’Neill, 2006</xref>). However, the independent report into the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895812466393">Hillsborough Independent Panel, 2012</xref>: 8) demonstrated that the police do not always do a good job, having on that occasion a mind-set that prioritized ‘crowd control over crowd safety’, leading to tragic consequences.</p>
<p>Ever since the 1996 Police Act (s.25) the police can charge for event security as ‘Special Police Services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895812466393">ACPO, 2010</xref>). However, following Court of Appeal ruling (in 2007)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1748895812466393">8</xref></sup> forces can only charge for the immediate footprint of an event – the area inside the ground and some surrounding streets. In making judgement, Lady Justice Smith noted: ‘I do not see why the club should pay for services which it did not ask for and which the police provided of their own volition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895812466393"><italic>Manchester Evening News</italic>, 2008</xref>). The police may take a different view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895812466393">Chadderton, 2012</xref>). However, charging for ‘Special Police Services’ puts into question the universal and equitable distribution of security that the state police are called to provide. There are other examples where police services have been purchased by private interests, for example by social housing providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895812466393">Crawford et al., 2003</xref>) and retail malls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895812466393">Crawford, 2006</xref>). At a time of fiscal constraint, charging for services may be an attractive option and the huge burden on police resources presented by sporting events is an area in need of attention. Yet event security work is an example of wide policing that could be taken up by other providers.</p>
<p>Recent experience from the London 2012 Olympics shows that private security may not have all the answers. In this instance the security firm G4S failed to provide adequate numbers of security personnel and the armed forces had to fill the gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895812466393">BBC News, 2012</xref>). This put into question the outsourcing of certain police and security functions to private security firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895812466393">Kollewe, 2012</xref>). Yet the evidence from Hillsborough is that the state police are not always the best for the job either.</p>
<p>There are clearly no easy answers. It is a question of what is considered central or ancillary to the policing task; where policing can be made narrower. There are other examples of police work that could be narrower, or transferred elsewhere. For example, the state police are actively involved in the policing of immigration and asylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1748895812466393">Weber and Bowling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812466393">Cooper, 2009</xref>). More of these duties could be transferred to members of the UK Border Agency who have the necessary specialist expertise. The transfer of some traffic duties to Highways Agency Traffic Officers has been noted. There is scope for more responsibilities – including enforcement – to be transferred to the Highways Agency. This would be controversial and would require political, legislative and popular support, but could reap benefits – including cost benefits – and leave the state police to focus on a narrower version of policing.</p>

<title>What Should Characterize Narrower Policing?</title>
<p>From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812466393">Banton (1964)</xref> onwards, there has been much academic interest in what the police do and what they are for. The general view has been that, while the police ‘fight crime’, there is more to their mandate. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895812466393">McLaughlin (2007</xref>: 52) noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Despite the central position of this ‘cops and robbers’ model in both police culture and the popular imagination, ethnographic researchers confirmed that the exact nature and scope of police activity is in fact difficult to define and, for the most part, unrelated to law enforcement and criminal detection.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895812466393">Bittner (1990/2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895812466393">Manning (1978/2005)</xref> both famously defined the state police in terms of its legal use of force or violence. Of importance to this article, Manning also noted the police’s over-inflated mandate that, ‘the police have staked out a vast and unmanageable social domain. And what has happened as a result of their inability to accomplish their self-proclaimed mandate is that the police have resorted to the manipulation of <italic>appearances</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895812466393">1978/2005</xref>: 192, emphasis in original). A wide police mandate is not a new phenomenon. For example, 19th-century policing included, ‘such measures as the compulsory education of children, the reformation of criminals, the observance of sanitary and hygienic conditions, the control of liquor traffic, and the prevention of cruelty to children and animals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895812466393">Lee, 1901</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812466393">Banton, 1973</xref>: 19). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812466393">Banton (1973</xref>: 20), many of these tasks were taken over by other agencies, such as ‘school attendance officers, probation officers, public health inspectors, NSPCC and RSPCA and so on’.</p>
<p>Whilst many early responsibilities were subsumed by other agencies, the police are still responsible for a host of non-crime-fighting activities. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895812466393">Bittner (1990/2005</xref>: 150), the police are there to intervene in ‘every kind of emergency, without any exceptions whatsoever’; meaning they may be required ‘to do the work of thief-catchers and of nurses, depending on the occasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895812466393">1990/2005</xref>: 150). It is questionable whether the police really have the mandate to intervene in ‘every kind of emergency’, but the Dixonian idea of the caring law enforcer, both nurse to the community and tackler of crime, can be an attractive one. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1748895812466393">Morgan and Newburn (1997</xref>: 75) noted, ‘The police undertake crime control … But they also constitute an all-purpose social service’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895812466393">Theresa May (2011b)</xref> might have stated ‘I haven’t asked the police to be social workers’, but a social service function is integral to everyday policing activity. An example is the emphasis of British policing on a reassurance function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895812466393">Innes and Fielding, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895812466393">Millie, 2010</xref>). For the National Reassurance Policing Project that ran during the early 2000s, the aim was to tackle ‘anti-social behaviour and improved quality of life … fear of crime and improved sense of safety … public satisfaction with, and confidence in, the police; and improved social capacity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1748895812466393">Tuffin et al., 2006</xref>: xi). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895812466393">FitzGerald et al. (2002)</xref> there also needed to be parallel focus on reducing crime and disorder, that: ‘It is difficult to justify devoting limited police resources to policing activity that serves only to give people the <italic>impression</italic> they are safer from crime’ (p. 132, emphasis in original). Yet an emphasis on reassurance highlights that there is more to policing than a ‘tough no-nonsense’ approach to crime fighting. Thus the police can be said to have both a <italic>crime control</italic> and <italic>social service</italic> function – or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748895812466393">Punch (1979)</xref> once called it, a secret social service function (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895812466393">McLaughlin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Intertwined with the police’s crime control and social service functions is an <italic>order maintenance</italic> or peace keeping function – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812466393">Banton (1964)</xref> termed the role of being a ‘peace officer’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812466393">Ericson (1982)</xref> saw the police’s function to be the reproduction of order. From this perspective the state police are there not to change things; instead, ‘[t]heir sense of order and the order they seek to reproduce is that of the status quo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812466393">Ericson, 1982</xref>: 7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1748895812466393">9</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895812466393">Brogden and Ellison (2013</xref>: 9) go further by claiming that ‘state policing has always been committed to maintaining a divisive social order’. Policing is clearly an aspect of social control (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895812466393">Reiner, 2000</xref>: 2), but the social control function is conservative, to reproduce order in a form acceptable to those with political capital: the government, the media and – following the version of democratic policing offered by Police and Crime Commissioners – those above voting age who are eligible to vote, and likely to vote (which automatically excludes a lot of the population, including young people under 18, a group likely to be targeted by populist police action).</p>
<p>Related to this, Reiner has observed that ‘good policing may help preserve social order: it cannot produce it. Yet increasingly that is what is being demanded of the police’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895812466393">2000</xref>: xi). The distinction between preserving and producing order is a useful one. For example, parents and schools may ordinarily have roles in producing order by giving us citizens that adhere to norms of behaviour and value order. Of course, one would hope that young people are schooled and brought up to challenge the status quo when it needs to be challenged. But the police’s role is something different in enforcing agreed standards of behaviour – rather than producing (or challenging) order. The earlier example of the police’s involvement in school work is illustrative of the policing task expanding from preserving to producing order. Returning to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812466393">Ericson (1982)</xref>, he observed elasticity to the crime control product and that a wide definition can lead to a dispersal of police activities:<disp-quote>
<p>Regardless of [the police’s] success in other respects, they have been successful in using their crime work to increase their resources and the dispersal of their activities. Their ‘product’ of crime control is conveniently elastic, carries a virtuous ring, and cannot be easily assailed; who can deny a people’s desire for peace and security, or at least for a <italic>feeling</italic> of security? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812466393">Ericson, 1982</xref>: 4, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The policing task is composed of a combination of crime control, social service and order maintenance functions. If the task is defined too narrowly then the focus is only on part of these, such as Theresa May’s sole emphasis on ‘non-nonsense’ crime fighting. If the policing task is defined too widely, then the definitions of crime control, social service and order maintenance are stretched to encompass activities that may be better placed with other agencies, community groups or volunteers.</p>
<p>In England and Wales the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has outlined the roles and responsibilities expected of the police in a ‘Statement of Common Purpose and Values’, originally formulated in 1990 as part of John Major’s Conservatives’ consumerist agenda that also produced the ‘Citizen’s Charter’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895812466393">Gilling, 2010</xref>). According to this statement, the police aim:<disp-quote>
<p>… to uphold the law fairly and firmly, to prevent crime, to pursue and bring to justice those who break the law and to keep the Queen’s peace, to protect, help and reassure the community, and to be seen to do all this with integrity, common sense and sound judgement. (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895812466393">Jones, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These purposes overlap and relate to the three tasks of crime control (‘to prevent crime’), order maintenance (‘keep the Queen’s peace’) and social service (‘protect, help and reassure the community’). ‘Keeping the Queen’s peace’ is inherently conservative and tied to issues of power and control. However, the extent that such order maintenance is repressive will depend on the state of the police and government. Under each heading – crime control, order maintenance and social service – there is significant scope for expansion of roles and responsibilities. For instance, if the police have a responsibility to prevent crime, do they focus on crime prevention advice, or expand their repertoire to include probation and social work with offenders to prevent reoffending, or perhaps work in schools to produce ordered citizens and prevent future offending? All could be said to be activities that reduce crime but stretch the definition of policing.</p>

<title>Conclusions: Prospects for a Slimmer (and Fitter) Police</title>
<p>Following four decades of expansion, the current government’s cuts to policing have understandably been seen as a bad thing by the police, the media and other social commentators. However, if handled well the cuts could be an opportunity to reassess what the state police ought to be doing. It is more than a simple assessment of value for money (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1748895812466393">Savage, 2007a</xref>). Instead it is a question of what makes up the policing task. In this article it has been argued that policing is more than Theresa May’s narrow notion of ‘no-nonsense’ crime-fighters. Rather, it is composed of a mix of crime control, social service and order maintenance functions.</p>
<p>Through various processes of mission creep and ‘policification’/criminalization of social policy there has been a widening of the policing task with definitions of crime control, social service and order maintenance being stretched. Various examples of wide policing have been given including police involvement in probation and social work, schools work, disaster management and stewarding/event security. Other areas where policing can be viewed as wide are in immigration control and aspects of traffic police. It is argued that other agencies, community groups or volunteers may do as well as the police in these instances, and could do better (and may also be a lot cheaper). Of course, other agencies are facing similar budget cuts, and the experience of G4S at the London Olympics shows that, despite the growth of other ‘plural’ providers, outsourcing to private companies may not prove an effective alternative. However, by transferring or reducing the state police’s involvement in such activities there is the prospect for conflicts in priorities to be lessened – such as between intelligence gathering and caring for disaster survivors or probation clients; or between identifying risk of extremism and working alongside children in schools; or – as identified in the Hillsborough report – between ‘crowd control’ and ‘crowd safety’ in major sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895812466393">Hillsborough Independent Panel, 2012</xref>: 8). Such reassessment could be an opportunity to decriminalize social policy, to govern through crime <italic>a little less</italic>. Nearly 50 years ago Michael Banton observed that, ‘A cardinal principle for the understanding of police organization and activity is that the police are only one among many agencies of social control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812466393">1964</xref>: 1). This situation has not changed. In simple terms, the police do not have to be doing everything. There are others who are well equipped and qualified to take on some of the responsibilities that have been acquired by the police through expansion. It is a question of how wide or narrow the policing task is defined. As Moroney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748895812466393">Millie, 2009b</xref>: 4) was quoted as saying, policing has to be more than just ‘more blue shirts and more blue shirts’.</p>
