<p>The book is a collection of contributions which applies Western theoretical constructs to an understanding of heritage tourism and development in South-east Asia. This precipitously encouraged a juxtaposition of the two worlds which led to a confirmation or rejection of commonly held views in Western society regarding conflicts between governmental development agendas and the preservation of authentic identity. This well written and edited text is carefully anchored by the editors through the use of an overview which frames heritage and heritage tourism in its context and also through a conclusive chapter on heritage futures. The substance of the text is however contained in the contributions of chapters 2–12 which address specific locales and initiatives in South-east Asia.</p>
<p>Kathleen M. Adams presents a useful discourse on the local politics surrounding the emergence of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Indonesia. The political process surrounding the selection of a culturally authentic symbol in Toraja, Sulawesi, extends the discussion of authenticity but also reinforces that the emergence of heritage sites is not a ‘natural’ process but one that involves significant competition between many stakeholders. In particular, where there is a quest for World Heritage Site status, the competitive and collaborative landscape becomes more complex as this will now involve, in addition to local residents and governments, input from external international bodies. The key element here is that the notion of what is truly authentic is significantly influenced by internationally accepted ideas of what is true about the community’s identity.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of identity is further highlighted by Mami Yushimura and Geoffrey Wall who focus on the heritage of the Atayal in Taiwan. Their emphasis on reconstructed identity is somewhat different from the previous authors in that they discuss this construct in light of colonial suppression of authentic culture and the need to redefine identity and heritage in the tourism context. Colonialism and Neo-colonialism are analysed in terms of how they have shaped the post-colonial history and contemporary tourism development of the country. The key argument here is that multiple facets of culture are attributed to the colonizers and this makes it particularly difficult to recreate an identity and product that is worthy of consumption by tourists and more importantly that is real.</p>
<p>The introduction of the tourism development debate is extended by Michael Hitchcock and Nick Stanley who articulate from the position of nation-building that there are some gaps in the approaches taken to development. The struggle between the need to offer ‘pure education’ and at the same time ensuring that tourists are sufficiently entertained presents significant challenges. The emergent ‘edutainment’ which typically provides a snapshot of tangible and intangible elements of culture may be paralleled to Western notions of ‘staged authenticity’. This calls for a need for greater coherence in governance, politics, policies and ethno-cultural boundaries towards the protection of national interest.</p>
<p>Can-Seng Ooi explores the re-making of Singapore through histories, tourism and museums. In attempting to establish itself as the financial and cultural capital of the world, the country faces a challenge with conflicts in its perceived identity. While viewed by some as an authoritarian state, it is still considered to be ‘exotic and part of the romantic Orient’ (p. 83). In attempting to develop itself into a modern city, which is attractive to the Western psychocentric tourist, the destination has lost some of its Oriental charm which Western allocentrics have come to expect. There is now an attempt to re-shape and re-Orientalize Singapore through the use of museums. This is an interesting finding as most Western discussions surrounding tourism development tend to focus on mass development that runs counter to heritage tourism development. Lessons may be learned in the West from this re-Orientalization, which suggests that heritage tourism in its purest form may reintroduce elements of authenticity which have been lost and reclaim identities.</p>
<p>Keiko Miura reflects on World Heritage Sites as more than specific locales but rather as a new type of community which entails new values and accepted norms. The designation of World Heritage Site status therefore carries with it complex and dynamic processes of change which affect a multiplicity of stakeholders, not the least of which are local populations. This debate is not new but reinforces an important element of subscribing to some international standards. The point to be made from the perspective of development is that the already disenfranchised locals who are often victims of games played by government and private interests are now further marginalized by increased diversity of interests from international experts.</p>
<p>Nigel Worden re-introduces the national identity debate by looking at the interplay between tourism development and identity construction in Melaka, Malaysia. Similar to the earlier discourse on Taiwan, the colonial retentions in the tourism of that era in Malaysia reflected European activities. There has been a subsequent need to promote a distinctive ‘Malay’ cultural identity, which maintains oriental elements and still emphasizes differences from other tourist destinations in the region. Until very recently Melaka was repeatedly rejected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as its heritage representations did not receive universal acclaim. A very important developmental point is that carving out national identity while maintaining regional identity against a colonial backdrop is a complicated process. This is many times further exacerbated by the need for destinations to present themselves as historic and modern simultaneously. Gwynn Jenkins continues the Malaysian discourse by highlighting some effects of World Heritage Site status. These include expansion of the middle class, urbanization, single site emphasis and yielding to touristic demands. This is a representation of the ongoing Western and mainstream debates about modernization versus heritage conservation.</p>
<p>The remaining four chapters focus on Vietnam, with the final of those chapters also including Thailand. Key arguments from these chapters include the fact that Vietnam is a state in transition, where there is a question of whose values take pre-eminence in the determination of aesthetic and intrinsic value. It has also been concluded that ‘despite an intensely commercial approach there remains a profound sense of heritage that tends to be vested in the producer’s skills and knowledge rather than the finished product’ (p. 234). The most cutting-edge of these chapters, and arguably in the book, is the first of the Vietnam chapters by Mark Johnson which challenges Western notions of the ‘tourist gaze’, which involves the visual consumption of other cultures. This has been typically conceptualized as a negative ‘zoo-like’ activity, however the author recognizes that in this context this gaze is something that is aspired to by the tour guides in particular who seek the gratification of being intensely looked upon as the font of cultural knowledge.</p>
<p>Overall the text is a sound one, with a minor criticism of too much focus on Vietnamese cases. It provides clear discussions of issues which are oriental but also global and advances Western discussions on key constructs. This may be a useful collection for academics, governments, developers and heritage tourism enthusiasts.</p>
