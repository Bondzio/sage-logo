<abstract>
<p>School nurses provide an important role in the continuity of health care especially for adolescents who are at high risk for significant health concerns. The purpose of this study was to assess adolescents’ health information needs and identify their preferences for accessing health information. Using an inductive qualitative research design, 11 focus groups were conducted with a convenience sample of 101 junior high and high school students in suburban northeastern Illinois. The students identified a variety of health concerns and emphasized the need for accessible, high-quality, and personally relevant information. Most students favored taking an active role in learning about their health. They preferred to directly access information from qualified individuals within comfortable, trusting, and respectful relationships or to indirectly retrieve information from reliable resources. Finally, students emphasized the need for privacy and a variety of learning options depending on the specific health topic.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>School nurses are an integral part of the health care team. As first responders to children’s and adolescents’ health needs during the school day, they play an important role in promoting health, addressing health problems, and providing health education (American Academy of Pediatrics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512450916">2008</xref>). By providing comprehensive health services in the school environment, school nurses greatly influence students’ health, well-being, and potential for academic success (American Nurses Association and National Association of School Nurses [NASN], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512450916">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While considered a generally healthy population, adolescents experience significant health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512450916">English, Ford, &amp; Santelli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512450916">Jones &amp; Bradley, 2007</xref>). At this crucial developmental stage, adolescents are navigating changes in physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. They are confronted by a host of challenges, from puberty to peer pressure and from dietary choices to decisions about sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512450916">McNeely &amp; Blanchard, 2009</xref>). Adolescence is a time when personal choices can seriously impact future health and well-being. More than 70% of morbidity and mortality in adolescents are due to risky behaviors such as alcohol use, unsafe sex, and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512450916">Solberg, Nordin, Bryant, Kristensen, &amp; Maloney, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although adolescents regularly seek medical care for illness and injuries, they often have unmet health concerns and perceive they are not receiving the health information they need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512450916">Ackard &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2001</xref>). Those who do make contact with health services often are reluctant to discuss health information needs due to embarrassment and confidentiality concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512450916">Ackard &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512450916">Jones &amp; Bradley, 2007</xref>). Some adolescents may possess the knowledge necessary to be healthy but need support and encouragement to choose and maintain healthy behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512450916">Denehy, 2001</xref>). Clearly, health education and health promotion are key roles for school nurses working with adolescents (NASN, 2005).</p>
<p>Little current research exists regarding health needs from the adolescent’s perspective. Surveys in the early 1990s revealed that adolescents reported a wide variety of medical, psychological, sexual, and social health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512450916">Dubow, Lovko, &amp; Kausch, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512450916">Kowpak, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512450916">Weiler, Sliepcevich, &amp; Sarvela, 1993</xref>). Through the use of focus groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512450916">Skinner, Biscope, Poland, and Goldberg (2003</xref>) asked adolescents how and why they use technology to access health information. Participants most often searched for information about medical diseases, body image and nutrition, sexual and mental health, and violence. They also required information related to school, friendships, and social concerns (e.g., income, housing, and poverty). In a survey conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512450916">Cohall, Cohall, Dye, Dini, Vaughan, and Coots (2007</xref>), teachers revealed that the health topics they most often overheard adolescents discussing at school included medical problems, difficulties with peers, sex, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and mental health problems.</p>
<p>To find health information, adolescents have traditionally used personal sources including health professionals, family members, and peers as well as impersonal sources including television, radio, books, and pamphlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512450916">Gray, Klein, Noyce, Sesselberg, &amp; Cantrill, 2005</xref>). Adolescents increasingly report the use of technology to access health information, yet many are concerned about the quality of information on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512450916">Skinner, Biscope, Poland, &amp; Goldberg, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although adolescents report a wide range of health concerns and seek health information from a variety of sources, researchers suggest that a dissonance exists between what adolescents perceive as priority health concerns and what others think may be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512450916">Kowpak, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512450916">Sobal, Klein, Graham, &amp; Black, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512450916">Weiler, 1997</xref>). Further, few studies exist that directly ask teenagers about their health information concerns without prompting them with predetermined surveys or studying specific learning tools such as the Internet. The aim of this study was to assess adolescents’ health information needs and identify how they prefer to receive health information.</p>

<title>Study Subjects</title>
<p>Eleven focus groups, with a range of 7–11 students per group, were conducted with a convenience sample of 36 junior high and 65 high school health class students from two schools in suburban northeastern Illinois. Junior high students were eighth graders with an approximate age range of 13–14 years, while high school students were sophomores with an age range of 15–17 years. Of the 101 students, 59.4% were girls and 40.6% were boys. Student bodies of both schools were culturally diverse (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512450916">Table 1</xref>). No demographics were collected in order to increase students’ comfort level and minimize confidentiality concerns. The study was approved by the hospital system’s Institutional Review Board and the administrators of both schools.</p>

<title>Focus Group Process</title>
<p>Flyers and letters explaining the study were sent home to all health class students and their parents. Participation in focus groups was voluntary and students were selected on a first-come, first-served basis. Student and parental consents were obtained from all subjects. All focus groups were facilitated by the lead facilitator. A cofacilitator and a transcriber were also present. The facilitators and the transcriber were all female. At the beginning of each session, the lead facilitator reviewed the study purpose with students, answered students’ questions, and emphasized the importance of confidentiality. Students were then required to sign a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>On average, the duration time for the focus groups was 40 minutes. Focus groups were held in classrooms with the doors closed for privacy. Further, students were informed that they could disclose responses to study questions anonymously by writing answers on index cards and placing them in a locked box. Comments submitted via the locked box were not discussed during focus group sessions. The index cards were color coded so researchers could differentiate between junior high and high school students’ responses when analyzing the data. Teachers and school personnel did not participate in the sessions. School counselors and nurses were on call in the event that students might become emotionally distressed by discussing sensitive health concerns. Gift cards were given to subjects who completed the focus group interviews.</p>
<p>Seven focus group questions were identified by the researchers. Feedback regarding wording and sequence of the questions was gathered from discussions with several adolescents and modifications were made. Focus group questions (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840512450916">2</xref>) began with broad and less threatening questions and progressed to more specific and personal questions. At the end of all sessions, students were also asked to summarize their opinions about the best ways for teens to access health information.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Focus groups were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were downloaded into the qualitative analysis software, Atlas.ti. Using inductive reasoning and thematic analysis, open coding procedures were performed and a coding structure was developed based on emerging themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512450916">Polit &amp; Beck, 2010</xref>). Codes were applied to focus group transcripts and two independent researchers evaluated coding structure and application of codes to transcripts for consistency, validity, and reliability. Applying constant comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450916">Sandelowski &amp; Boshamer, 2011</xref>), individuals and groups were compared to each other throughout the analysis. Data collection continued until common themes repeatedly emerged to the point of saturation. To guard against selectivity and ensure that quotes were representative, the weight of key themes were based on the frequency of comments. Categories were generated and overarching concepts were compared to existing literature and evaluated for emergent fit.</p>

<sec id="section6-1059840512450916">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Focus group participants discussed in detail their learning needs and preferences for acquiring health information. Students responded candidly to questions and appeared comfortable sharing thoughts and feelings in mixed gender and cultural groups. Many expressed concern about their health and appreciation for being heard.</p>
<sec id="section7-1059840512450916">
<title>Greatest Teen Health Threats</title>
<p>Both junior high and high school students had similar opinions about health problems adolescents face, and substance abuse was most often reported as the greatest threat. Smoking, alcohol, marijuana, ecstasy, and prescription drugs were among the majority of substances identified. Students described related challenges, such as peer pressure to use drugs and ignoring the consequences. “<italic>People do say yes to peer pressure . . . I’ve seen this with my friends.</italic>” “<italic>When our teachers talk about smoking and drugs, they (peers) just ignore it. They know the consequences, they just don’t care.</italic>” Both age groups also viewed sexual health as a significant concern; however, junior high students emphasized puberty and lack of knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases, while high school students viewed lack of protection, teen pregnancy, and denial of possibly having sexually transmitted infections as especially important. The two groups also identified mental health problems such as depression, suicide, eating disorders, and high levels of stress. Many students acknowledged poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and insufficient sleep as common problems. A few students identified violence, including bullying, fights, and shooting as important health concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059840512450916">
<title>Health Topics of Interest</title>
<p>When discussing health topics, junior high and high school students’ responses were comparable. Many students expressed an interest in mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Also, students identified specific illnesses including diabetes and cancer because of a family history. Some shared an interest in health issues mentioned in the news, including teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and steroid use. Others discussed health or science topics they had studied in class including seasonal affective disorder and the effects of a carbonated beverage on the body. However, science topics discussed were not the same between the two age groups as subject matter studied at each school differed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840512450916">
<title>Specific Health Information Needs</title>
<p>Students from both schools expressed a wide variety of health information needs. Most often discussed were physical diseases, health behaviors, and mental health concerns. Although health information needs of both age groups were similar, the junior high students talked more about physical diseases, while high school students emphasized health behaviors.</p>
<p>Junior high students were especially interested in knowing whether they were at risk for specific diseases, particularly those with relatives who were diagnosed with cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, “<italic>My aunt went through breast cancer and survived it, I want to know how it can affect me.</italic>” A few were interested in learning more about conditions that they currently have or have had (e.g., eczema, food poisoning, or influenza). Many wanted to know more about leading healthy lifestyles emphasizing nutrition and exercise. Mental health concerns including depression, self-harm (e.g., “Why do people really cut themselves?”), and suicide were also identified as significant concerns. A few junior high students wanted to learn more about sexually transmitted diseases; one girl clarified, “<italic>I hear about STDs all the time but I don’t really know what they are.</italic>” “<italic>Body odor</italic>” and “<italic>periods</italic>” were the only topics found in the locked box that were not openly discussed by the junior high students.</p>
<p>High school students conveyed similar health learning needs; however, the older students’ answers were more detailed in their descriptions than their younger counterparts. Whereas younger students said they wanted to learn about nutrition, older students asked about nutrition for athletes and best foods for maximizing performance. Another student elaborated the need for eating right and having time for exercise. High school students were also interested in physical conditions, including asthma, cancer, and high blood pressure and their risk for developing these diseases. The effects of stress and lack of sleep were of particular concern for some high school students, “<italic>Like less and less sleep and we don’t have time and we have stress, it may affect our health and when we take school tests and stuff.</italic>” Depression was also highlighted, “<italic>It’s very common in teenagers. I’d like to know how can it be prevented or like if it’s genetics or if it could go away.</italic>”</p>
<p>One high school group discussed suicide more than other groups as a student reported the recent suicide of a classmate. Related concerns included, “<italic>How to tell if someone is depressed and how to cope with stress</italic>” and “<italic>How somebody our age could actually do it to themselves and how everyone copes with it afterward</italic>?” While not identified as the most pressing health information need for either age group, high school students discussed substance abuse more often than junior high students. Several were interested in “<italic>how bad</italic>” marijuana and alcohol affect the body, “<italic>It goes through your mouth but how does it go to your brain?</italic>” One written comment in the locked box read, “<italic>I think we should learn more about building a healthy self-confidence to say no to peer pressure and make healthier choices like saying no to drinking at a party or NO to sniffing the line of cocaine</italic>.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840512450916">
<title>Identified Stressors</title>
<p>The most common stressor identified by all students was difficulty with time management. One student explained, “<italic>Multi-tasking . . . like balancing your homework, your religious things and your tasks at home, it’s very hard.</italic>” Many related that their parents did not understand how much they had to do. For example, “<italic>They think oh it’s just tenth grade it can’t be that bad, it’s just a few homework assignments.</italic>” Students added that balancing activities and responsibilities affects their sleep, while a number of students admitted being so tired they sometimes fell asleep at school.</p>
<p>Familial and peer relationships were also described as stressful. Frequently reported were family conflicts such as marital disagreements “. . .<italic> if your parents are having personal problems, like with each other</italic>” and lack of communication and trust. “<italic>Sometimes my mom doesn't listen to me like she thinks I can't make choices on my own and like I'm too young to decide what I want</italic>” and “<italic>I hate when my parents like go through my cell phone and read all of the text messages and then they start questioning me about it.</italic>”</p>
<p>Romantic relationships, often viewed as “<italic>drama</italic>,” “<italic>rumors</italic>,” and “<italic>being picked on for going out with someone</italic>,” were common concerns among junior high students. In contrast, high school students expressed difficulty finding time for dating and dealing with “<italic>upsetting relationships</italic>.” The locked box revealed a note from one high school student that read, “<italic>the most stressful thing for me right now is that I’m afraid of unwanted pregnancy.</italic>”</p>
<p>Bullying was occasionally mentioned by junior high students and both age groups discussed the stress of “<italic>feeling left out</italic>” and “<italic>not fitting in.</italic>” Although they did not use the actual terms, a few high school students alluded to concerns about body image and lack of self esteem, “<italic>I think eating is huge for especially girls. We’re just in swimming now and I think I’ve heard basically ten of my friends come up to me and say, ‘Oh I’m not eating today’ because they don’t want to be showing fat.</italic>” One high school student submitted the following comment in the locked box, “<italic>Sometimes I wonder how much I can eat? I don’t have time to work out and keep fit. I’m not on a team because I feel I’m not good enough.</italic>”</p>
<p>Both age groups perceived pressure to succeed academically as a significant stressor. Relationships with parents were often described as strained because of these expectations. Expectations not only came from parents but also from teens themselves. Junior high students expressed fear about starting high school and apprehension about the future. High school students emphasized the pressure to get good grades as a requirement for college. In addition, coaches, teachers, and friends were also perceived as having high expectations. Being on a sports team was stressful to many. One student commented, “<italic>It’s the same with teachers, if you’re good at something that’s not enough</italic>.”</p>
<p>Cultural stressors and financial concerns were frequently cited by both age groups. Many felt their parents did not understand their stress because their parents did not have the same experience growing up. One student shared, “<italic>My parents went to their country’s school; they don’t know how hard it is over here</italic>.” Some also described the stress of having to translate for their parents who did not speak English. The most common financial concerns included needing money for gas, feeling pressure to qualify for scholarships, and helping parents pay off debts, “<italic>Both my parents work and I work so I help them to pay bills, pay the rent, buy stuff for the house, like food, …it’s not my responsibility but it’s like I want to because I see them struggling.</italic>”</p>
<p>Substantial time was spent discussing the impact of stress in their lives. The following comments reflect the profound significance of stress as a health concern for adolescents:<disp-quote>
<p>the mix is too hard; it’s a never ending vicious cycle; do they just expect us to explode?; when people take drugs, it’s like they want to get away from everything and have their own moment of peace; that’s why people take steroids and start throwing up in their bathrooms because their parents and their coaches expect so much.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One student concluded, “Stress is like the main fact of everything!”</p>

<sec id="section11-1059840512450916">
<title>Current Information Seeking Strategies</title>
<p>Students often reported using personal communication to find health information. They commonly consulted doctors, nurses, parents, teachers, and coaches, while aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings were occasionally mentioned. A majority in both age groups reported using the Internet as one way they seek health information. Many Internet sites were mentioned including broad search engines, popular medical websites, online chats, and social networking sites. Other methods included health classes, books, pamphlets, newsletters, television, movies, magazines, and posters.</p>

<p>When discussing how they would prefer to access information, both junior high and high school students repeatedly said, “<italic>it depends</italic>.” Students shared that their preferences depended on three variables: the attributes of health information they were seeking, the quality of relationship with the individual providing the information, and the preferred learning approach of the student. Further, the individuals with whom they preferred to speak and the learning approaches they favored differed depending on the specific health information being sought.</p>
<sec id="section13-1059840512450916">
<title>Attributes of health information</title>
<p>While students identified specific health topics of concern, discussions focused more on the characteristics of the health information they preferred to receive. Students clearly identified accessibility, complexity, personal relevance, quality, subject matter, and privacy as the main attributes.</p>
<p>Most students identified quick and easy access of health information as very desirable. Some preferred receiving information from doctors; however, they admitted that doctors are not readily accessible. A few high school students said they use their hospital-affiliated, school-based health center situated on the school’s lower level. However, one reason for not using the center included complaints that it was not conveniently located, “<italic>It’s too far . . . it’s in the dungeon.</italic>” Others disagreed, saying, “<italic>Not really, it’s just downstairs.</italic>” Many favored the Internet due to the ease of retrieval. As one student said, “<italic>It’s quick and easy. You don’t have to travel anywhere. You can take as long or as quick as you want and the information is there as fast as you need it</italic>.”</p>
<p>Students also preferred health information they could understand. Many favored pamphlets because they considered them to be short and to the point and they appreciated providers who explained health information in words they could comprehend. Some felt books are “<italic>too long</italic>” and “<italic>too boring</italic>” and would only read “<italic>books that are interesting with pictures and stuff</italic>.” Meanwhile, many highlighted their preferences for the Internet because “<italic>it explains more than the doctor</italic>.”</p>
<p>Many students emphasized the need for health information that applies to their lives in the here and now, “<italic>like relevant every day stuff.</italic>” Some favored a resource for teens with answers to common health questions. One high school focus group had a lively discussion regarding whether or not teens receive too much education about drugs in school; for example, “<italic>Most people will have a time of peer pressure…and that’s why I think everyone should be (taught) whether or not they should take the drug</italic>.” However, others argued that “<italic>health classes need to focus less on drugs because not everybody abuses them</italic>.”</p>
<p>Students expressed concern about receiving quality health information. They described quality in terms of reliability, accuracy, credibility, and currency of the information. Many said they wanted reliable information from someone with medical experience such as a doctor. Most acknowledged using the Internet to find health information, yet many were concerned whether the information was correct. “<italic>Like doctors or teachers should know the sites and places where we can get good information and they should tell us</italic>.” Some valued personal life experience; for example, “<italic>I think it's easier to ask your parents because they've gone through the stuff you're going through</italic>.” One student disclosed, “<italic>If someone did drugs that I thought of trying, I’d ask them because they are credible from their experience</italic>.” Students also desired current health information and some said they did not use the school library because of outdated resources.</p>
<p>For many students, the phrase “<italic>it depends</italic>” related to the personal nature of the subject matter. A junior high student said, “<italic>It would be easier to tell my mom I think I got strep throat than like tell my mom I think I got an STD (sexually transmitted disease) or something</italic>.” Several high school girls discussed their experiences about receiving birth control information from their mothers. However, when one girl asked male classmates whether or not they received condoms from their fathers, a boy concisely answered, “<italic>No, my parents, I would not talk to them</italic>.” Some students were also reluctant to speak with their doctors about confidential concerns. One student said, “<italic>It depends on the subject . . . if it’s going to be about smoking or about sex, some people won’t say that</italic>.”</p>
<p>Most students considered their health information to be private and favored discretion when accessing health information. Some preferred to obtain health information from their doctors, because they believed the doctor–patient relationship is confidential. Many students preferred the Internet because it’s “<italic>really easy and private</italic>” and “<italic>no one knows your question</italic>.” Even those who preferred books expressed privacy concerns. “<italic>I like books but it's kind of awkward to say, ‘Can I check this book out of the library</italic>?’” Another student concurred, “<italic>If you went to the library and looked for it (health information) in that section, it’s kind of like you’re broadcasting it</italic>.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1059840512450916">
<title>Quality of relationship</title>
<p>Junior high and high school students identified doctors, nurses, parents, teachers, and coaches as people whom they may ask for health information; however, the nature of these relationships were of great concern and impacted whether or not the student would prefer consulting the individual. Three descriptors of these relationships emerged during discussions: comfort, trust, and respect.</p>
<p>Students described feeling comfortable going to their doctors because of their familiarity and rapport with their provider; for example, “<italic>he’s been my doctor since the delivery room</italic>” and, “<italic>she (doctor) is kind of young and I feel like she’s a friend in a way</italic>.” Some students were more comfortable talking to their parents; for example, “<italic>There are some things only your parents can help you with.</italic>” However, many who described feeling comfortable going to their parents for health information said their parents were health care providers, “<italic>Sometimes I find out answers from my mom because she's a nurse and stuff so she knows like everything.</italic>” Students who felt comfortable consulting their teachers described these relationships as close and caring. However, for other students lack of familiarity was often detrimental to comfort; “<italic>I don’t even know who they (doctors) are so why would I talk to them</italic>?” Feelings of embarrassment or dislike also caused some to avoid doctors, parents, or teachers. Students who expressed discomfort receiving health information from these individuals often feared being judged.</p>
<p>Trust in an individual to keep health information private was valued highly; however, students had differing opinions about whom they could trust. Some reported trusting doctors while others preferred parents. Many argued that they would not trust doctors or parents with personal health information. Students were also divided on whether they would trust their teachers with sensitive health information. Some reported lack of trust of teachers. Others disagreed, saying, “<italic>You can trust some teachers not to judge you</italic>.” A few high school students were concerned about confidentiality and trust when using the school-based center, while others were positive about their experiences at the clinic. Some students also reported they did not trust friends or siblings to provide accurate health information.</p>
<p>Students expressed the desire to be heard and respected. One student related, “<italic>When teachers get down to like your level and speak to you not as a person of authority but as one of you then it seems like you can talk to them about anything</italic>.” Not all felt respected by individuals providing health information. “<italic>My first doctor, it was like I wasn’t there. He talked to my dad the whole time</italic>.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1059840512450916">
<title>Preferred learning approach</title>
<p>Finally, students discussed at length their preferred approaches for accessing health information. Many learning strategies and resources were cited with direct interactions and online options preferred most often. Approaches to accessing health information were categorized as active direct, active indirect, passive direct, and passive indirect (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840512450916">Table 3</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Most students preferred taking an active role when seeking health information by directly approaching specific individuals. As one student observed, “<italic>Sometimes you need people to explain it to you</italic>.” After a discussion about learning from the consequences of drug abuse, another student suggested “<italic>field trips to see the actual living environments of these people and being able to talk with them so they can tell you their story about how this all happened</italic>.” A direct approach did not always mean students preferred a face-to-face conversation. Some favored chat rooms, hotlines, or phone conversations with experts for accessing sensitive information as a way for collecting information without actually having to see them.</p>
<p>Many preferred actively searching for health information indirectly without interacting with another person such as reading a book or browsing a static webpage. Most students who preferred an active indirect approach were concerned about confidentiality as suggested by the following comments:<disp-quote>
<p>privacy . . . it depends on what you’re researching . . . like if you go to your parents and ask about a disease or whatever they’ll know but if you go on the Internet, they don’t really know; it's easier to go online . . .  it's like . . .  I'm just anonymous; pamphlets are what you need to know and then you can throw it away . . .  it doesn’t have to be a part of you, the pamphlet goes in the garbage and it doesn’t know anymore.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A few students preferred taking a passive direct approach, for example receiving information during a lecture. A key reason for this preference included embarrassment in actively consulting someone. A few others preferred a passive indirect approach, for example viewing a televised public service announcement by chance. One student who favored this strategy explained, “<italic>I think they should put in on TV because that’s what most kids watch</italic>.”</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section16-1059840512450916">
<title>Most Favored Strategies</title>
<p>Students had varied opinions about the best methods for accessing health information. The most common active direct approaches identified included communicating with doctors, teachers, and medical health professionals in person or online, especially if they were trustworthy. “<italic>My doctor would be the best for me</italic> . . .<italic> if he would guarantee that he would only talk to the people necessary to talk to.</italic>” Others preferred phone hotlines or online interactions, “<italic>Like a chat room or something. You can’t really see the person but you can get like what they think about it</italic>.” Several suggested interacting with people about their experiences. The most commonly preferred active indirect approaches included online sources for teens on school webpages or other websites, newsletters from hospitals, and pamphlets. Seeing the information visually was also important to many students, “<italic>The statistics aren’t enough for me; I want to see it with like my own two eyes</italic>” and “<italic>Like before and after pictures. Like people before they took drugs and how healthy they looked and after—they look skinnier and their eyes sag.</italic>” Those preferring books suggested “<italic>just having a (book) cart there</italic> . . . <italic>to know more about your health and no one’s watching</italic> . . .” Another student emphasized, “<italic>We need more than one way to get health information</italic>.”</p>

<sec id="section17-1059840512450916">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study adolescents were interested in learning about a wide range of health concerns. The health topics they identified were congruent with the myriad health concerns of youth reported by researchers over the years. Also consistent with other research was the dissonance between what students reported are the most important health concerns for themselves compared to what they believed are the biggest health concerns for other teenagers. This discrepancy could be due to students’ reluctance to share private concerns in a group setting facilitated by unfamiliar adults. However, it is important to note that students in this study were given the opportunity to share concerns anonymously. While some students used the locked box to report private concerns, many others openly discussed sensitive health concerns.</p>
<p>One health information topic identified by a few students but not reported by adolescents in older articles is the emerging trend of self-harm, for example “<italic>cutting.</italic>” This is notable because self-harm is common among adolescents, with 13.2% reporting engaging in self-harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512450916">Ougrin, Tranah, Leigh, Taylor, &amp; Asarnow, 2012</xref>). Further, cutting appears to be on the rise and actual incidence is hard to determine because adolescents who cut themselves are not always evaluated by health care professionals. Nonsuicidal self-injury is one way teenagers may cope with the stressful transitions of adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512450916">Hall &amp; Place, 2010</xref>). Although study adolescents spoke in detail about stress, only a few made the connection between the effects of stress on health and the need to learn more about how to handle stress.</p>
<p>Another finding that emerged in this study was the depth in which students discussed their preferences for accessing information, thus emphasizing the importance of relationships with people providing health information and the need for different methods depending on specific situations. While the health information needs and preferences for obtaining health information were similar in junior high and high school students, junior high students’ responses were not as detailed as those of high school students.</p>
<p>Students’ preferences for accessing health information ranged from two-way communications with individuals in person or online, to one-way sources of information such as static webpages, television, lectures, and print. The data support the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512450916">Skinner et al. (2003</xref>) who reported four domains in which adolescents find health information on a continuum from highly interactive to fixed information sources and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512450916">Gray, Klein, Noyce, Sesselberg, and Cantrill (2005</xref>) who described that information may be actively sought or passively absorbed. In this study, similar patterns emerged. Most students preferred to actively seek health information either directly from trusted individuals or indirectly from reliable resources, and few students favored passively receiving information directly from individuals or indirectly by chance.</p>
<p>Although most preferred actively seeking health information, students desired health information from a wide range of sources and a variety of methods depending on the situation. Preferences were dependent on the characteristics of the health information desired and the relationships with the individuals providing the information. Many students preferred an active direct approach if the individual providing the information was knowledgeable, trustworthy, and respectful. Moreover, students revealed they would not seek information from an individual with whom they were not comfortable or with whom they believed would judge them negatively for their requests. Many preferred an active indirect approach using reliable impersonal sources for sensitive health concerns. Finally, students favored an array of learning methods regardless of the health topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1059840512450916">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. First, the study included a convenience sample of health class students who volunteered to participate in the focus groups. School teachers and administrators of both schools indicated that the school milieu was one of mutual trust and open communication between students, teachers, and staff. Also, to supplement the school nurse office, the high school had a hospital-affiliated, school-based center funded in part by the state and private philanthropy. Thus the results of the present study cannot be generalized to other junior high and high school students. Second, all groups were of mixed gender and all facilitators were female. Although boys and girls appeared to share personal information, it is unclear whether students would have disclosed different health concerns had they been in groups of same-gender students and facilitators. Third, although wording and sequence of the focus group questions were modified based on feedback received from several adolescents, the questions were not validated or standardized. Finally, with rapidly changing technology, adolescent approaches to accessing health information may have changed.</p>
<p>Further research is warranted to evaluate adolescents’ health information concerns and preferences for acquiring health information. Recommendations for future research include replication of the study to refine the focus group questions; examination of specific adolescent populations to identify health information needs of particular groups (e.g., gender, culture, language, disability); further exploration of preferred learning methods for specific health topics; and longitudinal studies of health concerns throughout the adolescent years to evaluate how preferences change with age.</p>

<title>Assess learning needs</title>
<p>To make the most of health education encounters when valuable time is limited, assessing health concerns and learning preferences may help school nurses engage students in the learning process and provide health education more effectively. The importance of needs assessment to provide effective education has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512450916">Olson &amp; Hergenhahn, 2009</xref>). If students are ready to learn and engaged in learning about topics that are important and relevant to them, there is an increased chance that they will retain and act on the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512450916">Renninger, Hidi, &amp; Krapp, 1992</xref>). Astute assessments will also assist the school nurse in meeting the challenge of prioritizing learning needs within realistic education goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512450916">Denehy, 2001</xref>). In addition, it is important that educators and health professionals assess their own beliefs about adolescent health concerns as adolescents’ actual health concerns may not be the same (Kowpack, 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512450916">Sobal et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Many methods of assessing students’ health information needs are available to school nurses. Individual encounters may be preferable; however, when face-to-face discussions are not possible, anonymous surveys and audience polling software for aggregate real-time assessment of health information needs offer solutions that maintain privacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512450916">DeBourgh, 2008</xref>). Data from health records, community statistics, and parental and community questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512450916">Denehy, 2001</xref>) as well as choosing pertinent topics from current literature are also beneficial. It is essential for school nurses and teachers to assess how students are handling stress, identify behaviors signaling emotional distress, determine learning needs, and develop interventions that may strengthen their coping skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1059840512450916">
<title>Develop relationships</title>
<p>The development of emotional and social competence is a key milestone for adolescents. Studies demonstrate that interpersonal connections to role models can be protective in delaying risky behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512450916">McNeely &amp; Blanchard, 2009</xref>). Our findings suggest that adolescents may prefer to disclose personal health concerns to individuals with whom they have comfortable, trusting, and respectful relationships. Therefore, the process of connecting with adolescents is an important step in determining health information needs. These connections become even more crucial when addressing sexual health, substance use, stress, and mental health concerns. It seems that adolescent health care providers may reflect on their own personal comfort levels regarding sensitive teen health issues in order to most effectively and compassionately address these concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1059840512450916">
<title>Harness technology</title>
<p>Because many adolescents are comfortable with online technology, connecting with teenagers via e-health is a viable education strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512450916">Hassan &amp; Fleegler, 2010</xref>). Many health care providers are exploring this potential. Just a few emerging e-health techniques include personal digital assistants to screen adolescent health concerns before appointments, interactive computer programs to educate teens about substance abuse, mp3 players to teach teens about asthma, electronic reminders to take medications, and Twitter to send short, meaningful messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512450916">Barton, 2010</xref>; Hassan &amp; Fleeger, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512450916">Mosnaim, Cohen, Rhoads, Rittner, &amp; Powell, 2008</xref>). Given that more than half of the adolescents use the Internet to find health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512450916">Rideout, Foehr, &amp; Roberts, 2010</xref>) and 97% of youth have at least one social profile (Ypulse, ISIS Inc., &amp; Youth Noise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512450916">2008</xref>), it is necessary to direct students to teen-friendly, reliable websites and provide them with the tools necessary to evaluate the websites and social networks they use. As adolescents are often on the leading edge of technology, school nurses may keep abreast of the newest technologies attracting teens and incorporate them into health education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1059840512450916">
<title>Foster health literacy</title>
<p>Students who are health literate are able to access, interpret, and understand basic health information and services and have the skills to use that information to promote health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512450916">Joint Committee on National Health Education Standards, 2007</xref>). Adolescent health literacy is particularly relevant because teens are becoming more adept at processing information and taking more responsibility for their health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512450916">Manganello, 2008</xref>). By increasing students’ interest in health, educating them how to access health information, and providing health messages that are easy to understand and follow, health educators have an opportunity to foster the development of adolescents’ health literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512450916">Brown, Teufel, &amp; Birch, 2007</xref>). Because of their health education expertise and access to students, school nurses are in a unique position to conduct studies assessing adolescent health literacy. Thus, school nurses can have a significant impact on determining best practices to educate adolescents about their health.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The teens in this study were interested in their health and wanted to be heard. They desired accessible, personally relevant, quality health information they understood with the assurance that confidentiality would be maintained. Students emphasized the need to trust the source providing the health information as well as the health information itself. The majority of students wanted to take an active role in accessing health information. Many preferred to directly seek information from individuals with whom they had comfortable, trusting, and respectful relationships. Others wanted indirect access to information through reliable, impersonal sources. Students expressed the need to have more than one way to get health information, preferring different learning methods depending on the topic of interest.</p>
<p>In an age of high-technological advances, the school nurse is challenged to address the myriad health information needs of students. To successfully meet the health concerns of adolescents, it is essential to assess their learning needs, recognize the impact of caring relationships, develop meaningful connections, and create safe and interactive learning environments that are nonjudgmental. It is important to meet students where they are, considering both face-to-face encounters and virtual environments. Adolescents need to be equipped to critically evaluate health information and find reliable, relevant sources of health information they can understand. By encouraging adolescents to apply these skills, we are providing them with the information they need to make informed, healthy choices.</p>
