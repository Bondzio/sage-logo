<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate how contextual factors, as described by the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), impact on stroke survivors’ functioning and how needs are perceived in the long term after stroke.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 participants between 1 and 11 years after stroke. Data were analysed thematically using the ICF conceptual framework.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Long-term needs related to activities of daily living, social participation, mobility aids, home adaptations, housing, financial support, rehabilitation, information and transport. Participants identified a range of ICF environmental and personal factors including ‘support and relationships,’ ‘products and technology,’ ‘services, systems and policies,’ ‘attitudes,’ life experiences, social position and personal attitudes. Interactions between these contextual factors shaped functioning and how long-term needs were perceived. Social support from family and friends was a key facilitator of functioning for most participants, buffering the impact of disabilities and mediating perceived needs. Needs were not always stroke specific as many participants experienced other health problems.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The ICF framework was useful to investigate how contextual factors shaped functioning and mediated perceived long-term needs. Development of services to meet long-term needs among stroke survivors should consider the range of environmental and personal factors affecting how needs are perceived.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395311423848" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a significant proportion of stroke survivors experience physical, social and emotional consequences after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395311423848">1</xref></sup> Although increasingly recognised as a chronic condition, stroke services have largely focused on acute care and early community rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395311423848">2</xref></sup> Despite calls for comprehensive stroke services to address long-term needs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395311423848">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395311423848">4</xref></sup> there has been little investigation of the perceived needs of stroke survivors in the long term or what determines such needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311423848">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395311423848">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of need is complex. Bradshaw’s (1972) ‘taxonomy of social need’ distinguishes between ‘felt need,’ which refers to want, desire or the subjective view of a need, and ‘normative need,’ defined by professionals including doctors, therapists and policy makers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395311423848">7</xref></sup> There is no consensus on what ‘long term’ means in stroke policy and research. The National Stroke Strategy merely states that needs may continue in the long term without suggesting when this period may start or end.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395311423848">4</xref></sup> The National Clinical Guideline for Stroke refers to ‘long term’ as 6 months or longer after stroke, which marks the period immediately after active rehabilitation when maximum physical recovery is considered to have been achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395311423848">3</xref></sup> However, recent studies suggest that functional recovery may continue beyond this 6-month period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395311423848">8</xref></sup> and that the optimal period for psychosocial adjustment is in the first 1–2 years after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395311423848">9</xref></sup> In this study, we use ‘long term’ to refer to 1 year or more after stroke.</p>
<p>For stroke survivors, the social and personal context of long-term recovery and adjustment to disability beyond physical functioning is important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311423848">10</xref></sup> However, for healthcare professionals, rehabilitation is largely geared towards regaining functional recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395311423848">11</xref></sup> This mismatch between patients’ and professionals’ views of recovery after stroke may reflect differences in perceived needs among different stakeholders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311423848">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Developing patient-centred services for stroke survivors in the long term requires an understanding of the needs, experiences and priorities of those living with stroke. A recent survey investigated the prevalence of unmet needs in community-dwelling stroke survivors 1–5 years after stroke, reporting that nearly half of respondents had one or more unmet long-term needs in a range of areas including information, physical and emotional well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395311423848">13</xref></sup> In addition to such prevalence studies, other studies have used qualitative methods to explore the experiences of stroke survivors from their own perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311423848">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395311423848">6</xref></sup> A review of 23 qualitative studies of self-reported problems experienced by stroke survivors and their carers up to 5 years after stroke found that social, emotional and service deficiencies in health and social care accounted for over three quarters of these problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311423848">5</xref></sup> In a Canadian study, older stroke survivors between 2 and 8 years after stroke identified a range of unmet needs, including rehabilitation, personal and social care, home support, transport, psychological, emotional and medical follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311423848">12</xref></sup> Other studies have found that personal factors such as level of confidence in accessing services and social factors such as availability of ongoing social support also impact on perceptions of long-term needs among stroke survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311423848">10</xref></sup> However, most of these studies have investigated stroke survivor experiences in the first few years after stroke, rather than in the very long term.</p>
<p>No studies have examined how contextual factors, that is environmental and personal factors, shape perceived long-term needs after stroke. One framework providing a way of looking at this dynamic interaction is the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311423848">14</xref></sup> In the next section, we describe the ICF and the rationale for using this framework in our study.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1742395311423848"><title>The ICF framework</title>
<p>The ICF is divided into four domains: body structure and functioning; activity and participation; environmental factors and personal factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395311423848">Figure 1</xref>). It proposes that the interaction between an individual’s health condition (disease, disorder and injury) and contextual factors impact on level of functioning, (the ability to carry out daily activities and to participate in life situations).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311423848">14</xref></sup> Contextual factors are proposed to mediate how illness and disability are experienced and produced. The ICF suggests that contextual factors comprise ‘environmental’ and ‘personal factors.’ The ICF ‘environmental factors’ chapter describes these contexts as the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live, whereas the personal factors chapter focuses on features beyond the individual’s health condition, such as their personal attitudes or social background. The ICF personal factors chapter has not been fully developed but suggested components of the chapter include: age, other health conditions, psychological resources (e.g. styles of coping), socio-economic position, past and current life experiences. ‘Facilitators’ refer to aspects of the environment, which enable an individual’s ability to function after illness and disability. Conversely ‘barriers’ refer to those aspects of the environment or person that may constrain functioning.

<fig id="fig2-1742395311423848" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Environmental and personal factors, functioning and long term needs after the stroke.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395311423848-fig2.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The ICF has been used in research, rehabilitation and service planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311423848">14</xref></sup> A limited number of qualitative studies have used the ICF to investigate factors affecting individual functioning and participation in life after stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395311423848">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395311423848">16</xref></sup> but it has not been used to examine how contextual factors may interact to shape perceived needs in the long term after stroke. This study therefore aimed to investigate how contextual factors, as described by the ICF, impact on stroke survivors’ functioning and how needs are perceived in the long term after stroke. Since personal factors are currently only outlined in the ICF, our study also provided the opportunity for its methodological development, using the data to identify specific personal factors that are relevant in shaping long-term needs after stroke.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395311423848" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec4-1742395311423848"><title>Study design</title>
<p>We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 35 stroke survivors between 1 and 11 years after stroke. Participants were recruited from the South London Stroke Register (SLSR), a prospective population-based register that since 1995 has been recording first ever stroke in people of all ages living in a defined area of South London.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395311423848">17</xref></sup> All lived in the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth, in the top 20% of the most deprived areas in England.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395311423848">18</xref></sup> Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Charing Cross Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Interviews were carried out between May and November 2009. Written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to interview.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395311423848"><title>Sampling</title>
<p>Participants were sampled purposively to recruit men and women of different ages, with varied time of onset since stroke and level of disability, and from different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. We selected participants who had their stroke at least 12 months prior to the study. As longitudinal studies are known to have high attrition rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395311423848">17</xref></sup> we invited 111 people to participate in order to ensure that we could recruit adequate numbers at different time points after stroke. Invitation letters were sent by post with an information sheet, reply slip and prepaid reply envelope. We telephoned those who did not return the reply slip.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742395311423848"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>We devised a topic guide based on a review of the published literature. Topics included the impact of the stroke, problems and challenges experienced since the stroke, services and support received and perceived needs. The topic guide was initially presented for discussion to a research user group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395311423848">19</xref></sup> This comprised of an ethnically diverse group of 13 stroke survivors and 1 family carer. This pilot work showed that group members had difficulties articulating perceived needs but confirmed that taking a broader approach that focused on the above topic areas was necessary.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742395311423848"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and managed using QSR NVivo8 software. Transcripts were analysed thematically drawing on the ICF framework. Themes relating to environmental factors were coded using the environmental chapter descriptions. For example, perceived long-term needs after stroke relating to mobility aids and home adaptations were coded under the ICF’s environmental factors ‘products and technology’ chapter as either ‘facilitators’ or ‘barriers’ to functioning. We identified specific personal factors emerging from our data and also categorised these factors into ‘facilitators’ and ‘barriers.’ To increase the trustworthiness of our analysis, transcripts were coded independently by two researchers (KS and ER). In the following section, we first describe the characteristics of participants in our study and then present themes identified related to environmental and personal factors. We use pseudonyms to safeguard participants’ anonymity.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742395311423848" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>We sent out letters to 111 individuals but only 3 participants returned the reply slips. We were unable to contact 72 people by telephone for various reasons, which included no answer (56), incorrect phone number (6), death (8) and hospital readmission (2). Those who we were unable to contact by telephone had similar characteristics to those taking part in the study, in terms of gender, age and number of years since the stroke. Of 39 people, we were able to contact by telephone, 35 participants agreed to take part in an interview. The four individuals who refused gave reasons that included being too sick or too busy to take part.</p>
<p>Characteristics of participants are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395311423848">Table 1</xref>. Approximately equal numbers of men and women were interviewed, with ages ranging from 34 to 100 years, and of white, black African, black Caribbean and other (Filipino and Chinese) ethnic backgrounds. Disability levels varied, with Barthel Index scores ranging between 3 and 20,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395311423848">20</xref></sup> and two participants had mild expressive communication difficulties. The study sample was largely representative of the SLSR population in terms of age, ethnicity and living conditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742395311423848">Table 2</xref>). However, compared to the total SLSR population, more participants in this study had difficulties walking unaided or were wheelchair users; and more were 1 or 2 years and fewer 5 years post stroke.

<sec id="sec9-1742395311423848"><title>Environmental factors</title>
<p>Stroke survivors’ perceived long-term needs were mediated and shaped by a range of environmental factors. We discuss these under the ICF environmental factors chapter subheadings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311423848">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1742395311423848"><title>Support and relationships</title>
<p>The ICF ‘support and relationships’ chapter refers to the practical or emotional support provided by a person for another with a health condition or disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311423848">14</xref></sup> Participants reported a range of difficulties in carrying out every day activities due to stroke-related disabilities, including problems in dressing and personal care, cooking, housework, shopping, managing finances, collecting medicines, getting to medical appointments and participating in social activities. However, most (26/35) participants mobilised emotional and practical support from family and friends, which acted as a key facilitator of functioning, buffering the reported impact of disabilities and mediating perceived needs. For example, Mrs Alan, a 79-year-old white British woman explained how the support she received from her family was not only practical but also alleviated the stress of managing daily activities:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got no worries really at all, because (my daughter) takes it all off of me and my two grandsons, they’re very good to me. If I want to go out anywhere they’ll take me... (My son-in-law) comes around and keeps all the rooms clean... He’s another gem.</p>
<p>(P22, 11 years post stroke)</p></disp-quote>A number of participants reported deterioration in health and problems walking outside due to physical disabilities, meant that they had to mobilise more practical and emotional support from family members over time. Three individuals said that they had relocated closer to family members in order to access the support they needed and to enhance their social participation.</p>
<p>However, for some participants (5/35), family support was not guaranteed long term, due to changing circumstances such as other caring responsibilities or deteriorating health of carers. Lack of family support constituted a barrier to maintaining independence in activities of daily living (ADLs), social participation and perceptions of unmet need. For instance, Mr Jackson, a 67-year-old black African with stroke, reported that following his ex-wife’s stroke, his children spent less time caring for him:</p><disp-quote>
<p>My second daughter used to come and take me to go out sometimes, to go the park because I can’t go out on my own now. Even yesterday I’m going to the surgery, I can’t go by bus and I have to come and ring them. It’s hard for me.... Their mother is no more with me (divorced) but she had diabetes, she has just had a stroke, just come home.... So they spend more time with her now than me.</p>
<p>(P21, 5 years post stroke)</p></disp-quote></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1742395311423848"><title>Products and technology</title>
<p>The ICF describes ‘products and technology’ as relating to any technology, equipment or product that improves the functioning of a disabled person. Participants reported that mobility aids (19/35) and home adaptations (11/35) provided after discharge from hospital facilitated their ability to adapt to ongoing physical disabilities following their stroke. Mobility aids, included wheelchairs, scooters, walking sticks and frames, which enabled physical functioning and independence in ADLs. For example, Mrs Solomon, a 41-year-old black African, explained how her electric wheelchair enabled her to maintain independence outside of her home:</p><disp-quote>
<p>Without the (electric) chair you can’t imagine how bad it was... I couldn’t even go outside to get a loaf of bread or something like that. I had to sit around and wait for other people.</p>
<p>(P32, 10 years post stroke)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Four interviewees, all of whom had their stroke over 3 years previously, reported problems with inappropriate or unsafe walking aids, causing them pain and making them prone to falling over. This might in fact hinder rather than promote independence. However, these participants had developed compensatory strategies, such as walking shorter distances, taking frequent rests when walking or using a shopping trolley outside.</p>
<p>Eleven participants reported that home adaptations provided after discharge from hospital such as stair or grab rails, enabled them to adapt to their physical disabilities by facilitating independence in walking, climbing stairs and ADLs. Conversely, two women and one man had refused home adaptations because they did not want their home to be turned into a ‘hospital’ and preferred to manage without these.</p>
<p>Five severely disabled, mainly older, stroke survivors reported that it had become more difficult over time to manage stairs in their homes, creating a significant barrier to their physical functioning and independence. Three of these had consequently been able to move into more suitable accommodation, such as warden-controlled flats with lifts or bungalows. However, two other participants who lived in high rise public housing reported feeling trapped in their own homes because of frequently broken down lifts. Mr Odili (P33), a 47-year-old black African who had his stroke 4 years previously, described his struggle to be re-housed: ‘I told (the council) to move me (to a flat) downstairs. It’s causing a lot of problems. I’ve ripped my hand, on my back, everywhere, tumbling on the stairs.’</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1742395311423848"><title>Services, systems and policies</title>
<p>The ICF chapter ‘systems, services and policies’ describe services and systems designed to meet the needs of individuals and the policies that provide standards for these. Most participants (25/35) reported that they had received rehabilitation therapies which had facilitated their early functional recovery after stroke. Only one woman and two men between 2 and 5 years following their stroke, reported wanting more physiotherapy to continue to improve their physical strength, balance and walking. Conversely, around two thirds of stroke survivors (21/35) reported no long-term rehabilitation needs, despite some still experiencing stroke-related disabilities. They accepted that community rehabilitation after their stroke had been time limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311423848">21</xref></sup> A minority said that they continued to self-manage physical disabilities through exercises they had learnt from physiotherapists, to improve their physical function and walking.</p>
<p>Several stroke survivors (5/35) reported attending local day centres, stroke clubs or aphasia support groups, which facilitated their continued social participation long-term after stroke. However, the lack of access to suitable transport constituted a barrier to participation in such groups for some (2/35).</p>
<p>For seven participants, uncertainties about their entitlement to ongoing services and the lack of information about benefits or how to access these following their stroke continued to be a source of great concern and anxiety in the long term. Financial problems reported by six participants were identified as a barrier to adjustment to their physical disabilities because of the high costs involved in purchasing specially adapted equipment, such as cooking utensils or outdoor wheelchairs. For example, Mrs Kennedy, a 71-year-old white British woman, commented:</p><disp-quote>
<p>Everything I buy, I have to buy myself. I thought when you have a stroke you get help to get things for you but you don’t.</p></disp-quote>
<p>(P29, 10 years post stroke)</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1742395311423848"><title>Attitude</title>
<p>This ICF environmental factors chapter refers to attitudes of other people external to the person living with a health-related condition or disability. Two participants described overprotective attitudes among family and friends as a barrier to their continued functional recovery and independence in ADLs. Such a view was held by Mr Thomas, a 68-year-old white man, in relation to his son:</p><disp-quote>
<p>My son is over anxious about me personally…‘Sit there, I’ll get this, sit there, don’t do that, I’ll do that, you sit there, do that.’ And that is not quite the way to go.</p></disp-quote>
<p>(P11, 4 years post stroke)</p>
<p>Negative attitudes from others in the neighbourhood were also a barrier to functioning and participation for a minority of stroke survivors who were reluctant to walk outside with the necessary mobility aids, because of their fear of stigma and appearing vulnerable.</p>
<p>In summary, stroke survivors identified a number of environmental factors that facilitated or constituted barriers to functioning, and which shaped perceived needs. These related to availability of social support from family and friends, the provision of suitable mobility aids and home adaptations, features of the built environment such as housing and transport, financial resources and attitudes of others. In particular, the ability to mobilise informal social support networks was a key resource in terms of providing stroke survivors with ongoing practical and emotional support and continued opportunities for social participation, which mediated how needs were perceived.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1742395311423848"><title>Personal factors</title>
<p>The ICF personal factors domain is not yet developed but suggested items include age, other health conditions, psychological resources, socio-economic position and past and current life experiences. We used our data to identify specific personal factors relevant to functioning in the long term after stroke. We group these under the themes: ‘life experiences,’ ‘social position’ and ‘personal attitudes.’</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1742395311423848"><title>Life experiences</title>
<p>Emerging themes that related to life experiences included health before the stroke and other health conditions, comparison with other stroke survivors and bereavement. Most participants (29/35) had other existing health problems, including diabetes, heart problems and arthritis. Many spoke of stroke in relation to these other health conditions and often attributed their current health and disability to these. Experiences of disability and managing past health conditions minimised the impact of the stroke resulting in needs that were seen as not stroke specific.</p>
<p>Eleven participants viewed themselves as lucky compared to other stroke survivors, including patients they had seen in hospital. This meant that they often minimised the significance of their own physical disabilities and needs compared to others they viewed as less fortunate than themselves. This cognitive strategy relates to the ways in which individuals make downward social comparisons with others in light of adversity, such as coping with a health-related condition, as a mechanism for maintaining a sense of well-being despite suffering. For example, Mr. Smith, a 60- year-old white man explained:</p><disp-quote>
<p>I think I had a lucky escape. I could have ended up like that chap, the vegetable, with his pregnant wife sat beside him.</p></disp-quote>
<p>(P1, 2 years post stroke)</p>
<p>For a minority of older stroke survivors (3/35), recent bereavements had a greater impact on their lives than the stroke. For such individuals, the loss of a spouse was of more significance to them than the stroke.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1742395311423848"><title>Social position</title>
<p>This theme reflected personal factors relating to knowledge of healthcare services, previous or current occupation and level of education. For a few (3/35) stroke survivors, knowledge of stroke services and high level of education or socio-economic status meant they were more easily able to access services and information relevant to their long-term recovery. For example, Mr. Thomas (P11), a 68-year-old white man who had had worked as a London Ambulance Service paramedic and suffered a stroke 4 years prior expressed the view that his knowledge of stroke and understanding of the healthcare system made him more confident and able to negotiate the complex health and social care system: ‘I’m fortunate that I suppose I’m one of these buggers that won’t lie down and take no for an answer.’</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1742395311423848"><title>Personal attitudes</title>
<p>Personal attitudes that mediated perceptions of need included attitudes towards health and ageing, striving for independence and reluctance to use public resources. Fifteen stroke survivors between the ages of 58 and 100 years attributed their poor health to the ageing process rather than the stroke per se, which meant that they often had low expectations of recovery from stroke-related disabilities. For example, Mrs Hill, a 61-year-old white woman, explained:</p><disp-quote>
<p>When you get older, you’ve got to accept these things... I find it’s mostly to do with age....I don’t think it’s the stroke.</p>
<p>(P4, 1 year post stroke)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Seven participants voiced a strong sense of self-determination to recover, despite being told by health professionals that their potential for recovery was limited. Such participants were determined to achieve independence in activities such as walking and personal care. Three participants were reluctant to accept input from paid carers for support with personal care due to their concern about using valuable public resources, which, they thought, would deprive others who might be in greater need.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified specific themes relating to personal factors that acted as facilitators or barriers to functioning. These personal factors also shaped how long-term needs were perceived by participants, as well as their expectations of health, ongoing support and care. Building on the ICF framework, summarises the range of environmental and personal factors that acted as either facilitators or constituted barriers to functioning and how these interacted to shape long-term needs after stroke.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1742395311423848" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec19-1742395311423848"><title>Summary of main findings</title>
<p>This study was conducted to identify stroke survivors perceived needs in the long term. Needs identified related to ADLs, social participation, mobility aids, home adaptations, housing, accessing financial support and benefits, rehabilitation, information and transport. The ICF was used in analysis since it distinguishes between broad domains of factors that can influence functioning. Stroke survivors identified a range of factors relevant to the ICF environmental factor chapters, which in different cases either facilitated or constituted barriers to functioning and shaped perceptions of long-term need. We also used the data to develop themes related to personal factors that are not defined explicitly by the ICF. Under the theme ‘life experiences,’ we identified health before the stroke and other health conditions, comparison with other stroke survivors, and bereavement. Under the theme ‘social position,’ we identified knowledge of healthcare services, previous or current occupation and level of education. The theme ‘personal attitudes’ included attitudes towards health and ageing, striving for independence and reluctance to use public resources. Personal factors could either facilitate or constitute barriers to functioning and shaped how long-term needs were perceived after stroke.</p>
<p>We found that interactions between environmental and personal factors shaped both functioning and how needs were perceived by participants. Social support provided by family and friends was a key facilitator of functioning for the majority of stroke survivors, buffering the impact of disabilities and thereby mediating needs in the long term. However, perceived needs were not always stroke specific as many of the participants experienced other health problems including diabetes, heart problems and arthritis.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec20-1742395311423848"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title>
<p>Our study is one of only a few studies to investigate the self-reported impact of stroke in the very long term. It has also shown that the ICF is a useful framework for examining not only functioning but also how a wide range of contextual factors shape perceptions of long-term need after stroke. Our study further contributes to the development of the ICF, in identifying specific themes related to the ICF personal factors chapter that emerged from stroke survivors’ own accounts of their experiences. We acknowledge that one limitation of using interviews as a method for ascertaining perceptions of long-term needs among stroke survivors is that they provide one off in-depth accounts. However, we attempted to improve the validity of our findings by recruiting a representative sample from a population-based register.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec21-1742395311423848"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
<p>Our data support findings from other studies that have documented a similarly wide range of long-term needs among stroke survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311423848">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395311423848">13</xref></sup> Studies conducted to develop person-centred outcomes after stroke have also identified similar domains to those we have reported and have included these in stroke-specific quality of life measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395311423848">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395311423848">23</xref></sup> In terms of social support, existing studies reported the importance of social networks for practical and emotional support,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395311423848">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395311423848">25</xref></sup> but these focus mostly on the first few years after stroke. Our study shows that this social support is also an important facilitator and mediator of perceived needs in the very long term. Social support constitutes a form of social capital described by Bourdieu as an aggregate of the resources linked to the possession of a durable network and membership in a group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395311423848">26</xref></sup>However, our data suggest that family support is not necessarily guaranteed in the long term and can vary with changing life circumstances such as other caring responsibilities or deteriorating health of carers. Thus, needs met by family may not remain static.</p>
<p>Reliance on family and friends for support with daily activities might be thought to reflect gaps in formal service provision but our data suggest that most participants preferred the support of family members when it was available. While we did not include family carers’ perspectives in this study, many studies report burden and stress associated with caring for a family member with stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395311423848">27</xref></sup> and so it is important to remember that this preference may also have a cost.</p>
<p>This study suggests a number of personal factors can mediate participants’ ability to adapt to disabilities by developing management strategies and mobilising social networks. Other studies have also identified accepting and adapting to changing life situations, determination to strive for independence and confidence in seeking out services and support as effective ways of managing the consequences of stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395311423848">28</xref></sup> The cultural capital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395311423848">24</xref></sup> of those with professional backgrounds and knowledge of the health and social care system assisted them in negotiating complex health and social care systems.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no other study has identified personal factors relevant to functioning and long-term needs after stroke. One systematic review of 28 studies of communication, musculoskeletal and other neurological disorders identified 238 categories related to the ICF personal factors chapter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395311423848">29</xref></sup>These included aspirations; being in control; being positive; beliefs and attitudes towards the disease and disability; capabilities; confidence; personal characteristics; personal experiences; expectations; self-confidence, self-efficacy; social background; life goals; life experiences and attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395311423848">29</xref></sup> Such personal factors overlapped to some extent with the personal factors that we identified as shaping how long-term needs were perceived among stroke survivors.</p>
<p>We found that many stroke survivors expected few further gains in physical function in the long term and come to accept a level of functional recovery. This supports longitudinal data from the SLSR up to 10 years after stroke, which shows that physical functioning reaches a plateau after 1 year following stroke and remains stable thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395311423848">17</xref></sup> The vast majority of stroke survivors in this study, however, spoke about the continued importance of psychosocial resources in helping them to adjust to life after stroke, highlighting the importance of the social context in facilitating or hindering functioning and the perception of needs.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec22-1742395311423848"><title>Implications for stroke services</title>
<p>Stroke is increasingly recognised as a long-term condition, leading to calls for the development of services to meet the long-term needs of stroke survivors. Our data support the view that many stroke survivors are able to draw on their own resources and strategies to adjust to life after stroke in the long term. However, access to such resources may change, creating new needs. In England and Wales, the National Stroke Strategy recommends that reviews for stroke survivors should be conducted at 6 weeks, 6 months and annually thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395311423848">4</xref></sup> A system for annual reviews may therefore provide the opportunity for such changing needs to be identified and addressed. However, questions remain as to how these needs will be identified, and by whom. The ICF may provide a framework to guide and structure follow-up reviews in stroke care and to identify the contextual factors that may impact on functioning and long-term needs among stroke survivors and carers.</p></sec></sec>
