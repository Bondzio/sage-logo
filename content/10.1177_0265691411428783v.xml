<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783v"><title>Anna von der Goltz, <italic>Hindenburg: Power, Myth, and the Rise of the Nazis</italic>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2009; xv + 325 pp., 12 illus.; 9780199570324, £34.00 (hbk); 9780199695867, £19.99 (pbk)</title>
<p>This is the third scholarly book about the Field Marshal and Weimar President Paul von Hindenburg (1847–1934) to have appeared in the last three years. But it is not so much the life of the protagonist as such that interests the author of this excellent study, but the emergence, communication and transformation of the myths around Hindenburg in Germany from 1914 until well into the 1960s. Anna von der Goltz concurs with the recent study by Wolfram Pyta that Hindenburg was much better informed on political matters and more in command of his decisions than the older scholarly literature had suggested. According to Goltz, Hindenburg was not only less overburdened by his office as head of state and manipulated by his advisors than has hitherto been assumed; he was also very well aware of the importance of public relations and the symbolic dimension in politics. He therefore showed a genuine interest in the deliberate creation and survival of his own myth as a kind of father figure and national symbol for all Germans. His sensibility for symbols was already obvious in the event which made him a national hero in Germany overnight – the victory at the battle of Tannenberg in August 1914 where Hindenburg as the commander of the relatively weak German forces seemed to have saved Eastern Prussia from the numerically far superior invading Russian ‘hordes’. The name was geographically inaccurate but chosen by Hindenburg because it made the battle look like a historical revenge for the defeat suffered by the German knights at Tannenberg against another Slavonic nation, the Poles, in 1410.</p>
<p>Already by 1915 Hindenburg’s reputation as a man of strong nerves, with a total dedication to a final German victory and ready for any personal sacrifice, had eclipsed William II’s. In the second half of the war the use of Hindenburg’s name in government propaganda was the best guarantee to secure continuing support from the public for the war effort, whether in the form of adverts in his name for war bonds or so-called Hindenburg food donations from the countryside for the starving cities. Strangely enough the defeat in 1918 did hardly any harm to Hindenburg’s reputation, even though he had been commander-in-chief of the army in all but name since 1916. In a very lucid analysis the author shows that it was essential for the survival of the Hindenburg myth that general Erich Ludendorff, Hindenburg’s right hand man since 1916, was portrayed as the scapegoat for the military debacle in autumn 1918. Even the new revolutionary German political leadership thought it could not dispense with Hindenburg as an integrative figure for both the army and the home front in this period of transition from monarchy to republic and from war to peace, and chose to blame Ludendorff. Hindenburg, in contrast, was granted an honourable (second) retirement in July 1919 by the Weimar government. He remained for the wider public a name which stood for the positive reminiscences of the political regime that had collapsed in 1918. He thus gave the public a kind of moral orientation in the tumultuous immediate post-war years and few dared to criticize Hindenburg for his role in events of the past.</p>
<p>After the election of Hindenburg in 1925 as Reichs President, his name finally acquired a positive political connotation, even among the supporters of Weimar. They vainly hoped that the Field Marshal’s glory would now also shine on the republic. The republic did its best to honour Hindenburg in public at his 80th birthday in 1927 in a way no other personality in those days could dream of. The right-wing enemies of the republic, in contrast, found themselves in a difficult position, as their former hero now seemed to stand for the much-hated democratic system. They tried to solve this dilemma by differentiating between the Field Marshal and the allegedly positive legacy he stood for on the one hand, and the figure of the Reichs President, who would be opposed in the ‘most loyal manner’ as a political opponent, especially so during the second presidential election campaign in early 1932, when Hindenburg appeared to be the defender of the republic against the Nazi onslaught.</p>
<p>Apart from this political use of the Hindenburg myth by the various political camps in Weimar Germany, the war hero also became a kind of household name for companies to sell their products, from Opel cars to different brands of Hindenburg sparkling wines or Hindenburg spectacles. This commercialization suggests that Hindenburg was certainly the most well-known and respected person in Weimar Germany and a symbol with which almost all Germans (except the Communists) could identify in an otherwise politically deeply divided society. Surprisingly Hindenburg and his advisors, who were very cautious and manipulative about the presentation of his historical personality in books and films, hardly intervened against the commercialization of his name. Only the Nazis would ban in May 1933 the use of both Hitler’s and Hindenburg’s names and images from commercial adverts.</p>
<p>The book’s chapter on Hindenburg’s role in bringing the Nazis to power is slightly disappointing as it covers well-charted territory and is less innovative and convincing than the author’s treatment of the changing role of the Hindenburg myth in the years between 1918 and 1932. To a certain extent Hindenburg has fallen victim here to a twentieth-century commercialization of his name on the part of Oxford University Press. Today apparently a book on him can only be successfully sold to a historically interested readership if coupled with the inevitable Nazi theme.</p>
