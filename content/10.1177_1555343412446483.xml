<abstract>
<p>In the present article, we aim to provide guidelines on how to conduct research for the enhancement of training for cognitive readiness (CR). After distinguishing between trainable CR skills and stable person-related variables, CR components that are trainable need to be defined in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and person-related variables need to be selected as prerequisites for training success, as they define the composite construct of CR. Training success in turn needs to include indicators of successful performance in unpredictable environments after training of CR that operationalizes temporal and adaptive transfer. We suggest a basic module for training-of-CR research, which includes a pretest measuring the baseline of the participants’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes; person-related variables as control variables; predictors and moderators of CR training success; and two posttests for the assessment of training performance directly after training and following a retention interval for both temporal and adaptive transfer. For further research, we suggest extending the basic module with research on spacing of practice, performance under stress, and individual differences in cognition and personality. This research will enhance the understanding of the interplay between person- and training-related variables that best predicts the prerequisites for establishing and sustaining competent performance in complex and stressful environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cognitive readiness (CR) is defined as “possessing the psychological (mental) <sc>and</sc> sociological (social) knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSAs) that individuals and team members need to establish and sustain competent professional performance and mental well-being in the dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environments of military operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412446483">Bolstad, Cuevas, Costello, &amp; Babbitt, 2008</xref>, p. 970; adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). CR is also referred to as the optimization and enhancement of human cognitive performance, which is critical for effective mission performance, especially for performing multiple functions and for adaptation to dynamic threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412446483">Fatkin &amp; Patton, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo, Fatkin, and Patton (2007)</xref> state, CR is “not exclusive to military applications” but is relevant for any domain that “requires the active retrieval of skills and knowledge to perform a task” (p. B96).</p>
<p>CR research has so far mostly focused on predicting and assessing CR via readiness measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412446483">Bolstad, Cuevas, Babbitt, Semple, &amp; Vestewig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al., 2007</xref>). Although research on the prediction and assessment of CR is certainly important, there seems to be a lack of research regarding training design and effectiveness of training methods aiming at enhancing CR. We concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412446483">Fletcher (2004)</xref>, who states that research is still needed regarding training for readiness and “principles of training design and presentation that ensure reliable achievement of targeted cognitive state(s) by individuals, crews, teams, and units” (p. 8). Such research should incorporate findings from training research in fields such as human factors and ergonomics, cognitive psychology, or instructional psychology.</p>
<p>Research on training for CR is favorable for various reasons:</p>
<list id="list1-1555343412446483" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, most of the components of CR, such as metacognitive skills, problem solving, or decision making, are trainable skills that can be effectively developed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412446483">Cannon-Bowers &amp; Bell, 1997</xref>). Thus, training research can identify how CR can be achieved effectively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, research on training for CR can give indications as to how much training is needed for individuals or groups for them to be cognitively ready. For instance, in cases when individuals or teams have been assessed as “not yet cognitively ready,” indications of what and how to train further are essential.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, we propose that soundly conducted training research can support the question of how CR as a composite construct can be achieved. Can training be designed in such a way that multiple components of CR can be achieved in a training session? To what extent do person-related variables predict training success?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The scope of the present article is therefore to contribute to the CR research by suggesting a basic module for investigating CR training success and effectiveness in this field. The leading question is, How do experiments need to be designed so that one can draw valid conclusions regarding the predictive value of training for CR?</p>
<p>We aim to provide researchers with guidelines on how to conduct training-of-CR research with an emphasis on transfer of CR components to dynamic, stressful, unpredictable environments, because this transfer constitutes the means by which CR is attained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). We see it as a core element that links the application requirements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412446483">Figure 1</xref>) of competent CR performance in a complex and unpredictable environment with training and practice demands. This training provides individuals with knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that mentally prepare them for these dynamic, complex, and unpredictable applications. Our assumptions concerning transfer of training as the core and foundation of CR research are based on a process model that is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412446483">Figure 1</xref>. We grouped the components of CR defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref> into training objectives and application requirements. For instance, the component “selection of tactical and strategic plans, primed by the recognition of learned patterns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>, p. ES-2) and its underlying skills—in this case, decision-making skills—needs to be trained in such a way that it is transferred to practice and familiar situations (low-road transfer) as well as novel and unfamiliar situations (high-road transfer) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>, pp. II-4). Memory in terms of encoding specificity is the precondition for later retrieval, in which trained skills need to be applied automatically or controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>, pp. II-7). Situation awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412446483">Endsley, 1995</xref>) is, in our view, the prerequisite for applying the various trained skills according to the requirements of the situation, which is perceived, interpreted, and anticipated so that one may choose an appropriate course of action for which all trained skills are required.</p>

<title>Training Goals and Subgoal Templates (SGTs) for the Development and Selection of CR Measures</title>
<p>Research on the training of CR starts from “the end” (e.g., the deployment), meaning that it begins from the viewpoint of the transfer situation, which needs to be precisely defined according to specific training goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1555343412446483">Schmorrow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1555343412446483">Wilson, Salas, &amp; Andrews, 2010</xref>). Training goals define who (e.g., soldier) is expected to apply what (e.g., selection of tactical and strategic plans, primed by the recognition of learned patterns), when (in the dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environment of military operations several weeks after training), and in which conditions (stressful, practiced or familiar versus novel or unfamiliar). Training goals are the basis on which to derive KSAs needed to perform a task at the desired level of performance. The specified training goals are also used to define the dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412446483">Salas, Wilson, Priest, &amp; Guthrie, 2006</xref>). From our perspective, skills require special attention, because they are most relevant for the <italic>when</italic> and <italic>in which conditions</italic> requirements, which are extremely challenging for CR compared with training that prepares individuals for basically stable, less threatening, and more predictable environments.</p>
<p>As it is generally proposed (e.g., by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412446483">Kozlowski &amp; DeShon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412446483">Salas et al., 2006</xref>), the definition of training goals should be based on some form of job or task analysis, for example, a hierarchical task analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1555343412446483">Shepherd, 1998</xref>) or cognitive task analysis (CTA; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412446483">Chipman, Schraagen, &amp; Shalin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412446483">Crandall, Klein, &amp; Hoffman, 2006</xref>). CTA addresses cognition, expertise, and mental models, whereas traditional task analysis emphasizes behavior and observable processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412446483">Wei &amp; Salvendy, 2004</xref>). Although a detailed description and discussion of task analysis methods goes beyond the scope of this article (for an overview, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412446483">Kirwan &amp; Ainsworth, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412446483">Wei &amp; Salvendy, 2004</xref>), we would like to highlight one such method for training-of-CR research: the SGT method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1555343412446483">Ormerod, Richardson, and Shepherd (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412446483">Ormerod and Shepherd (2004)</xref>. Our research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, Schüler, Sauer, &amp; Ritzmann, 2007</xref>) suggests that important insights can be gained by using the SGT method; in particular, the “sequence elements” can be applied to military settings as described next. Sequence elements distinguish between the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1555343412446483" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fixed sequences: “If S1, then <italic>x</italic>.” For example, for a pilot in an air-to-air combat situation, after acquisition of a target, he or she selects a distinct weapon of choice required by the tactical air combat situation, subselects an adequate employment mode, rechecks the appropriate guidance submode for the selected weapon, double-checks using the guidance system whether he or she has targeted the correct target, arms the weapon, and employs the weapon.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contingent sequences: “S2, either <italic>z</italic>, then <italic>x</italic>; or not <italic>z</italic>, then <italic>y</italic>.” For example, the pilot perceives that during the verification of the guidance process, the weapon of choice is on a decoy (means “not <italic>z</italic>”). To counter a decoy, he or she selects a recage to slew the seeker head manually back to the target (“then <italic>y</italic>”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Parallel sequences: “S3, then do <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>.” For example, parallel to the manual switch selection for the targeting process, he or she has to maintain the ongoing air combat maneuvering communication process between the flight players according to phraseology, for example, “bandit high man, left hand turn—descending” while, in parallel, also aviating the aircraft.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Free sequences: “S4, in any order, <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>.” For example, during noncritical periods of flight with low workload, the pilot checks the aircraft system periodically during periods of idle time without a predefined sequence in any order.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The SGT method also helps to define the declarative and procedural knowledge as the prerequisites for performing a fixed, contingent, parallel, or free sequence. The knowledge of possible sequences as well as their proficient performance is an important precondition, for example, for mental flexibility and problem-solving skills as components of CR. For example, in cases of contingent sequences, one needs to know what the constituent characteristics of S2 are, what <italic>z</italic> represents, and what follows as <italic>x</italic> or, if not <italic>z</italic>, what <italic>y</italic> could be. The SGT method therefore also helps to elicit the necessary knowledge to perform and choose among the sequences. To go beyond the individual, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412446483">Bolstad et al. (2006)</xref> additionally propose team knowledge, such as shared mental models or interpositional knowledge, as training objectives relevant for CR, which requires a team task analysis.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the SGT method is less helpful in defining attitudes as effectively. Defining attitudes is also rendered somewhat difficult because the concern is with a method of CTA and not with an attitude analysis. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412446483">Salas et al. (2006)</xref> state, attitudes are more difficult to observe than skills and are therefore incorporated in the development of the training objectives less systematically. To date, mainly conceptual work has been undertaken to define CR-relevant attitudes as training objectives. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412446483">Bolstad et al. (2006)</xref> derived CR-relevant attitudes from their team CR model, which addressed the readiness of individuals and teams. Individual attitudes include behavioral style and global response to stress and self-efficacy, whereas team attitudes include team cohesion, collective efficacy, commonality of goals, and conflict management. Thus, a method that enables researchers to derive required attitudes from some sort of attitude analysis tool does not exist so far and needs to be developed.</p>
<p>As stated in the Introduction, we proposed that the components of CR are trainable skills that can be effectively developed. Nevertheless, training success is not independent of person-related variables. In this respect, the SGT method not only is helpful with regard to the definition of training objectives but also is important as a basis for test selection for person-related variables as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref>, for example, by using a method called the T-matrix (a test-skill matrix). This allows the crucial elements of a specific job or mission to be identified “in the same attribute terms used to define what the tests measure” to match, for instance, CR demands to the test measurement capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1555343412446483">O’Donnell, Moise, &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>, p. C29). We propose that job and CTA results can be used to select adequate cognitive tests to assess person-related variables that predict training success.</p>
<p>The objective of the T-matrix is “to provide a method of test selection in which a set of tests can be chosen based on the cognitive demands of a job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>, p. 1). In this regard, the analysis of cognitive demands based on the SGT method results in a list of mission-critical cognitive attributes, such as multitasking, which is required, for instance, for parallel sequences; restructuring problems, which is required in contingent sequences; or the capability to carry out changes in restructured plans and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>) to support transfer to dynamic and unpredictable situations. In summary, job and CTA results can be used to select adequate cognitive tests to assess person-related variables that are assumed to predict training success. Since complex tasks require multiple, dynamic cognitive processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref> suggest that these tasks should be measured with multiple-construct tests. The rule that prediction of training success will increase with point-to-point correspondence between predictors and criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446483">Patrick, 1992</xref>) also applies here, but further research is needed to prove the correspondence empirically.</p>
<p>In summary, training-for-CR research needs to</p>
<list id="list3-1555343412446483" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) define and operationalize the training goals in terms of knowledge and skills required for performing fixed-, parallel-, contingent-, or free-sequence elements;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) additionally use conceptual or theoretical frameworks, for example, the team CR model, to derive required attitudes for establishing and sustaining competent performance in dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environments;</p></list-item>

<sec id="section3-1555343412446483">
<title>Selecting Person-Related Variables as Control Variables and as Predictors for Training Success</title>
<p>In addition to the trainable CR components addressed by the training goals, person-related variables that are suspected to influence, moderate, or interact with the intervention under investigation should be considered and measured (for examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, &amp; Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412446483">Kluge, Sauer, Burkolter, &amp; Ritzmann, 2010</xref>). We argue that person-related variables and their interaction with training design should be considered to enhance CR research. This should provide a better understanding of the interplay of traits and states and their predictive and incremental validity to predict how well CR skills are established and sustained in complex and unpredictable environments. Although such consideration might seem obvious, so far, most work in training research has often not even taken into account the low-level and simple individual differences, for example, the fact that reading skills might interact with training design and contextual factors. Moreover, most of the studies also failed to include an adequate sample size to investigate such research issues.</p>
<p>Person-related variables can be grouped into five general categories: capabilities (e.g., general mental ability, skills), personality (e.g., Big Five, self-efficacy), demographics (e.g., age, gender), values and interests (e.g., education, career orientation), and learning and cognitive styles (e.g., preferred ways of learning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully and Chen (2010)</xref> mention demographics, values, and interests because their classification is supposed to cover a wider range of person-related variables for members in organizations generally, including members within an age range between 20 and 65 with broad backgrounds and career orientations. We propose that trainees assigned to a program to foster CR do not lie in this age range, being mostly between 20 and 35 years old and male (80% on average). For example, although women serve in almost of all U.S. Army occupations, they make up only about 14% of the active army (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1555343412446483">U.S. Army, 2012c</xref>). The average age at enlistment in 2011 was 21.3 for the active army and 20.7 for the army reserve. The maximum enlistment age is set at 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1555343412446483">U.S. Army, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>It is additionally expected that, for example, army personnel have less diverse values and interests compared with employees in civil organizations, as they all wish to join modern military operations and are preselected for this purpose, for example, to comply with the army values of “Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage (LDRSHIP),” which were introduced by a training and values campaign in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1555343412446483">U.S. Army, 2012a</xref>). Of course, one cannot rule out that cultural differences might affect training of CR, given the fact that persons with diverse ethnic backgrounds are being trained (Afro-American, Hispanic, Caucasian, Asian-Pacific Islanders), but this assumption remains speculative so far.</p>
<p>Therefore, with respect to the assumed homogeneity concerning age, gender, and values of the particular target group, in the context of CR, we focus on capabilities, personality, and cognitive and learning styles. The current research findings are presented first and are linked to the CR components on the basis of theoretical considerations for further research in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446483">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<list-item><p>(a) basic capabilities, such as general mental abilities and working memory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1555343412446483">Wittmann &amp; Hattrup, 2004</xref>) relevant for metacognitive, problem-solving, and decision-making skills, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) more CR-specific capabilities, such as time sensitivity, multitasking, divided attention, spatial manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>), rapid decision making, and manual control as measured, for example, by the Army Cognitive Readiness Assessment (ACRA; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1555343412446483">O’Donnell et al., 2005</xref>), as well as categorization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, &amp; Brand, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412446483">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, Sauer, &amp; Ritzmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555343412446483">Kluge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412446483">Kluge et al., 2010</xref>), also relevant for metacognitive, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Consenzo et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref> present results showing that ACRA measures were significantly related to performance in live-fire scenarios, including a target identification task, an auditory task, a haptic task, and combinations thereof. Concerning capabilities, it is assumed that general mental abilities are more important early in training, whereas task-specific factors are more important later on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446483">Patrick, 1992</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>Personality traits</italic> relevant for CR, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al. (2007)</xref>, are traits such as activity-energy or aggression-hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1555343412446483">Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Joireman, Teta, &amp; Kraft, 1993</xref>), affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1555343412446483">Lubin &amp; Zuckerman, 1999</xref>), neuroticism, and impulsivity and sensation-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al., 2007</xref>) with respect to the component of leadership as well as individual coping effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1555343412446483">Vitaliano, Maiuro, Russo, &amp; Becker, 1987</xref>), optimism, and positive emotions as relevant for emotional coping skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1555343412446483">Peterson, Park, &amp; Castro, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we consider it essential to incorporate <italic>learning</italic> or <italic>cognitive styles</italic> in CR training research. <italic>Cognitive styles</italic> relevant for problem-solving and decision-making skills, mental flexibility, and creativity as well as leadership include the need for cognitive structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412446483">Bar-Tal, 1994</xref>) and individual differences in coping with uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412446483">Greco &amp; Roger, 2001</xref>), as included in the Readiness Assessment and Monitoring System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Learning styles</italic> refers to differences and preferences in processing information when learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). Learning styles relevant for CR training design and different presentation formats include being a verbalizer or an imager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412446483">Riding &amp; Cheema, 1991</xref>), preferences for sensory modality, and preferences for discovery learning, hands-on experiential learning, observational learning, structured learning, and group learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1555343412446483">Towler &amp; Dipboye, 2003</xref>; based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1555343412446483">Kolb, 1984</xref>). Learning style affects the preferences for individualized learning versus learning in groups or preferences for exploring and discovering versus learning by observation and reflection. And because it is likely that cognitive and learning style affects training progress, the study thereof gains importance as instructional systems become more web-based and more dependent on trainees’ metacognitive and motivational processes during training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to measuring issues for assessing training success, person-related control variables should be assessed; for instance, in an intervention based on studying reading material (e.g., in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412446483">Bolstad, Cuevas, Costello, &amp; Babbitt, 2008</xref>), reading skills should be assessed as well as verbal comprehension. As another example, in a study that analyzes thinking protocols to measure whether participants apply the previously trained critical thinking skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412446483">Helsdingen, van den Bosch, van Gog, &amp; van Merrienboer, 2010</xref>), verbalizing skills should also be assessed, as otherwise, measures such as thinking-aloud protocols might be less reliable. These examples show how individual differences might affect training outcome in the first example and might contribute to a lower reliability in the second.</p>
<p>Additionally, current findings also call for aptitude–treatment interactions, that is, how individual differences might interact with treatment to influence training outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412446483">Cronbach &amp; Snow, 1977</xref>). The examples referring to reading skills or comprehension might not be relevant for all target groups that have to be cognitively ready for military operations, but they should be considered for some to gain additional insight into empirical results when an intervention was not successful.</p>
<p>As we proposed earlier, although we assume that CR components as introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref> are trainable skills, we also assume that skill acquisition depends on person-related variables too, in particular, on capabilities, personality, and cognitive and learning styles. For further training on CR research, on the basis of empirical findings presented and on the basis of construct validity, we propose selecting the capabilities, personality variables, and cognitive and learning style related to the CR components as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446483">Table 1</xref> to investigate the interplay of traits and their effect on training to predict how well CR skills are established and sustained in complex and unpredictable environments.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, to select adequate tests and performance measures for person-related variables, we refer back to the chapter on training goals in which the test-skill matrix (T-matrix) was mentioned. The T-matrix allows the essential elements of a specific job or mission to be identified in the same attribute terms used to define the test measures to match job demands to test measurement capabilities. To define job demands, results from job analysis, CTA, and the SGT technique, which was introduced earlier, should be used appropriately.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, research on training for CR should</p>
<list id="list5-1555343412446483" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>integrate person-related capabilities, such as CR component-related capabilities, personality traits, and cognitive and learning style (as assumed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446483">Table 1</xref>) that affect training success directly, as moderating or interacting variables with training content or training method.</p></list-item>

<title>Indicators of Successful Performance in Unpredictable Environments After Training of CR</title>
<p>CR is expected to be achieved if an individual establishes and sustains professional performance in a dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environment, which means that CR makes great demands on transfer of skills. <italic>Transfer</italic> refers to “the transportability of trained knowledge and skills from the training context to the performance environment, and focuses on issues of retention, maintenance, and generalization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412446483">Kozlowski &amp; DeShon, 2004</xref>, p. 75; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412446483">Baldwin &amp; Ford, 1988</xref>). Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref> refer to the concepts of low-road transfer (occurs automatically without conscious control) and high-road transfer (requires the learned skill to be decontextualized and represented in a more abstract format so that it can be adapted to unfamiliar situations) on the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412446483">Salomon and Perkins (1989)</xref>, current transfer-of-training research distinguishes between temporal and adaptive transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412446483">Baldwin, Ford, &amp; Blume, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412446483">Gorman, Cooke, &amp; Amazeen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412446483">Kluge, Sauer, Schüler, &amp; Burkolter, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Temporal</italic> transfer refers to the retention and maintenance of acquired skills and knowledge across a longer period of time. Longer retention intervals must be considered because of long periods of nonuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412446483">Kluge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412446483">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>). During these periods of nonuse, skill loss may even occur when individuals work on the job but do not perform certain tasks for longer periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412446483">Kluge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1555343412446483">Stammers, 1996</xref>). So far, little is known about the retention of acquired complex skills, such as CR, and more research is needed. An example of how temporal transfer of skills can be investigated and predicted is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412446483">Jastrzembski, Gluck, and Rodgers (2009)</xref>, who argue that considering the cost and effort of military training, it seems disappointing that soldier readiness is often defined by a simple summing up of training hours. Therefore, Jastrzembski et al. developed a tool (the Predictive Performance Optimizer) to dynamically assess performance effectiveness during training and to predict readiness and future performance. Demonstrated with a sample of pilot teams, the tool enables the scheduling of training to be prescribed to enhance learning and retention demonstrated with a sample of pilot teams.</p>
<p><italic>Adaptive</italic> transfer is required if skill components have to be applied to dynamic, complex, and unpredictable situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412446483">Bolstad et al., 2008</xref>) that have not been previously encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412446483">Ivancic &amp; Hesketh, 2000</xref>). This type of transfer involves the invention of new procedures based on acquired knowledge and the mindful processing of learning experiences to build up a mindful abstraction and a deeper conceptual understanding of the target domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1555343412446483">Smith, Ford, &amp; Kozlowski, 1997</xref>). Skills acquired during training must enable learners to later recognize when learned procedures must be changed to respond to novel situations. In cognitive control theory, such skills may also be referred to as <italic>problem solving</italic> and take place at the highest level of cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1555343412446483">Rasmussen, 1997</xref>). CR-relevant skills are also supposed to be used to prepare for the unexpected. Thus, in this sense, CR is said to require mindful abstraction to achieve high levels of flexibility so as to be prepared for situations other than those experienced in training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412446483">Fletcher (2004)</xref> emphasizes the importance of preparing military personnel for the unpredictable and states: “Unpredictability is the most predictable characteristic of military operations” (p. ES-1). Training programs that are designed to foster the transfer of knowledge and skills will be more likely to prepare personnel for the unexpected. In this respect, adaptive transfer also relates to the concept of measuring transfer by “first-shot” measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446483">Patrick, 1992</xref>), when the transfer of skill may have to be as near to perfect as possible when occurring for the first time in an unfamiliar context.</p>
<p>To give an example of situations that require adaptive transfer and to emphasize the fact that different adaptive transfer affordances affect performance, we present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446483">Bowman and Thomas’s (2008)</xref> study. These authors investigated how unmanned systems affect platoon effectiveness with regard to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Soldiers received 1-week training and a refresher course prior to the start of the test runs, in which different scenarios were designed to replicate threats, such as improvised explosive devices emplacement or prisoner exchange. This training occurred in three types of test ranges, such as open rolling sandy areas with light forest sections or an urban site configured in a triangular shape. Results showed that in the urban site, where the activity of the opposing force was more difficult to understand and predict, situation awareness was negatively affected, whereas this was not the case for the other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446483">Bowman &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>). This study exemplifies the requirement to address the variability of CR components and their adaptability with respect to different transfer situations.</p>
<p>Finally, CR is required in the presence of personal threat and in conditions of stress, sleep loss, or fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446483">Driskell, Salas, Johnston, &amp; Wollert, 2008</xref>), meaning that acquired skills must be resistant to altered conditions and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412446483">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>). This issue is addressed in more detail later.</p>
<p>In summary, indicators of successful performance in unpredictable environments after training of CR need to include performance measures as dependent variables that operationalize</p>

<title>Selecting a Dynamic, Complex, and Unpredictable Task Environment for CR Training Research and Assessment</title>
<p>The choice in favor of a specific task environment provides the opportunities and limits for training, assessing, and generalizing CR performance measures (as criterion measures or dependent variables), such as reaction time measures (speed measures), error-free application of skills (accuracy measures), decision quality, mental workload under stress, and so on. CR is defined as the mental preparation to establish and sustain competent performance in a complex and unpredictable environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412446483">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). For this reason, knowledge, skills, and person-related variables that contribute to CR should be investigated within an environment that represents such a complex and unpredictable context. The task environment must be able to elicit the desired behavior and must represent the domain being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1555343412446483">Wroblewski &amp; Warner, 2008</xref>), which in the case of CR is best realized with some form of setting that confronts participants with dynamic, complex, and unpredictable tasks as incorporated in scaled worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1555343412446483">Schiflett, Elliott, Salas, &amp; Coovert, 2004</xref>), microworlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555343412446483">Kluge, 2008</xref>), or simulated task environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412446483">Gray, 2002</xref>). For instance, in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412446483">Jastrzembski et al. (2009)</xref>, the Distributed Mission Operation test bed was used to track the performance of F-16 pilot teams engaging in air-to-air combat simulator training during the course of a training week to extrapolate the unique pilot teams’ learning and to predict the teams’ level of performance after 3 and 6 months. However, field training exercises, as in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412446483">Guerlain et al. (2004)</xref>, or live-fire scenarios, as used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al. (2007)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref>, can also be employed.</p>
<p>The advantage of simulated task environments is that they “provide a setting that adds controlled complexity to experimental tasks performed by human subjects in laboratory research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412446483">Gray, 2002</xref>, p. 205) and can therefore be used for training-of-CR experiments as well as for CR assessments. One major issue in selecting a simulated task environment is psychological fidelity and its relation to physical fidelity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412446483">Kozlowski and DeShon (2004)</xref> state, psychological fidelity “concerns the extent to which the . . . environment prompts the essential underlying psychological processes relevant to key performance characteristics in the real-world setting” (p. 76). It aims at invoking the central psychological constructs and mechanisms responsible for CR. The simulated task environment must allow tasks to be presented that exert dynamic threats and high stress that challenge, for example, problem-solving, decision-making, or metacognitive skills so that trainees need to demonstrate the regulation of their cognitive processes, to transform a goal into subgoals, or to select a tactical plan. Simulated task environments need to be designed to trigger the demonstration of leadership or emotional coping skills so that trainees are forced to show proactive coordination of single actions or control of their emotions to perform with a high mental workload attributed to dynamic threats and complexity. However, this does not mean that high psychological fidelity must necessarily correlate with high physical fidelity, which is “an effort to design a training context that physically reproduces the actual performance environment to the greatest possible extent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412446483">Kozlowski &amp; DeShon, 2004</xref>, p. 76).</p>
<p>As psychological fidelity is a “must” for psychological CR research, the question arises of the degree to which physical fidelity is required. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412446483">Gray (2002)</xref> introduces types of simulated task environments that differ with regard to their physical fidelity and therefore the generalizability of their training outcomes. To investigate CR, it is helpful to distinguish between (a) high-fidelity simulated task environments of complex systems, which represent <italic>many</italic> aspects of <italic>one</italic> system, and (b) low-fidelity simulated task environments, which represent <italic>one</italic> aspect of <italic>many</italic> systems.</p>
<p>High-fidelity simulated task environments are primarily used, for example, to investigate and assess the application of different, interacting skills (all simultaneously relevant for CR) in a dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environment, such as multitasking. Low-fidelity simulated task environments are primarily used in laboratory and basic research by researchers who are often less experienced with any of the original task environments. Low-fidelity simulated task environments abstract functional relationships from one or more complex task environments with the intention of generalizing these relationships to many different task environments that are dynamic, stressful, and complex, for example, with the use of serious games. Low-fidelity simulated task environments are particularly useful for investigating a phenomenon that can be grasped only by learning how it interacts with other phenomena, for example, dynamics and feedback delays and their effects on situation awareness. Low-fidelity simulated task environments are of particular interest for CR training research because CR is not supposed to prepare individuals for a precisely defined and predictable environment that is known and therefore cannot be translated 1:1 to the training setting. Rather, training for CR aims at preparing individuals for unpredictable environments.</p>
<p>In addition, from an experimental perspective, low-fidelity simulated task environments do have some important advantages compared with high-fidelity simulated task environments in training-for-CR research: First, experimental procedures are easier to set up with low-fidelity simulated task environments. Second, experimental conditions and tests can be more easily controlled for. Finally, since low-fidelity simulated task environments are easier for participants to learn and handle, researchers can collect data from a much larger sample compared with studies with high-fidelity simulated task environments, which often have only small sample sizes, for example, the aforementioned studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446483">Bowman and Thomas (2008)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref>. Sample size might be particularly important in terms of research questions in which aptitude–treatment interactions (see earlier discussion) are investigated. Examples on how to write, construct, and validate a scenario for simulated task environments for CR research can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412446483">Farmer, van Rooij, Riemersma, Jorna, and Moraal (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1555343412446483">Schiflett et al. (2004)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1555343412446483">Wroblewski and Warner (2008)</xref>. In conclusion,</p>
<list id="list8-1555343412446483" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Assure that the simulated task environment prompts the CR-relevant psychological processes by providing high psychological fidelity for triggering metacognitive, problem-solving, and decision-making skills alike.</p></list-item>

<p>To study the enhancement of training of CR through which CR is attained, some type of experimental design is needed. As introduced earlier, training research in the CR context includes temporal and adaptive transfer. A basic module experimental design should be conceived according to the recommendations of generally interpretable nonequivalent control group designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446483">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1976</xref>). Alternatively, it should be based on a pretest and at least two posttest measures (with one delayed posttest), as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager (1999</xref>, p. 317) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446483">Kraiger and Jung (1997)</xref>, because if an intervention (e.g., a training program) is designed for long-term effects, at least one long-term follow-up after some weeks or years should be applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412446483">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>). Applied to transfer-of-training research, a potential experimental design is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412446483">Figure 2</xref> (for examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, Sauer, &amp; Ritzmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412446483">Kluge et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>This basic module is designed to allow for the inference of “actual” causal relations between constructs (Stone-Romero, 2011). Causal relations are considered to be actual when they are based on randomized experimental research, whereas “assumed” causal relations derive from nonexperimental research (Stone-Romero, 2011, p. 41). In randomized experimental settings, individuals or teams need to be randomly assigned to study conditions. In randomized experimental research, given a sufficient number of individuals or teams and “effective randomization procedures, the researcher can be highly confident of the equivalence of the units in each of the conditions . . . prior to the time that subjects are exposed to the study’s manipulations” (Stone-Romero, 2011, p. 51).</p>
<sec id="section7-1555343412446483">
<title>The Pretest</title>
<p>To establish a baseline with which all changes in skill and knowledge acquisition and attitude change can be compared, participants take a series of prior knowledge tests, skills tests, or performance tests and are administered questionnaires measuring learning styles, which are addressed as training goals. For example, in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446483">Bowman and Thomas (2008)</xref>, soldiers conducted cognitive performance tests via a laptop computer prior to the start of every test session during a field test. This method allowed for just-in-time testing but required soldiers to be given four blocks of training to use the cognitive test battery.</p>
<p>Without a baseline, test results measuring differences in the KSAs of different groups (intervention Training A group, rival intervention Training B group, control group [CG]) after the intervention cannot be clearly interpreted as an effect of the intervention. However, person-related variables are important not only for measuring whether randomization was successful but also with respect to the question of which of the CR components are affected by training and which person-related variables affect training outcomes.</p>

<title>Designing the Intervention</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager (1999)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446483">Kraiger and Jung (1997)</xref> suggest evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention in a pretest-posttest-posttest design with at least three groups: two experimental groups for comparative evaluation and a “no-treatment” group, or CG, for noncomparative evaluation.</p>
<p>Relevant for investigating the acquisition of skills required for CR is, for instance, the question of how CR as a composite construct can best be trained. We suggest using part-task or whole-task training as a potentially effective training technique for CR. Part-task training is defined as “practice on some set of components of a whole task as a prelude to practice of or performance of the whole task” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412446483">Wightman &amp; Lintern 1985</xref>, p. 267). The overriding aim of any part-task training (e.g., of single CR components) is to maximize the amount of positive transfer to the complete job or task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446483">Patrick, 1992</xref>). Training based on task decomposition for part-task training demonstrated significant benefits compared with practice on the whole task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412446483">Frederiksen &amp; White, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412446483">Proctor &amp; Dutta, 1995</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412446483">Proctor and Dutta (1995)</xref>, the benefits of part-task training are the facilitation of learning of specific concepts, the development of more generic forms of knowledge representations, and enhanced generalizability of skill because of the inclusion of many transfer conditions, which is, by definition, extremely relevant for CR.</p>
<p>Emphasis-shift training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412446483">Gopher, Weil, &amp; Siegel, 1989</xref>) and fractionation are two part-task training approaches that have been distinguished and seem to be favorable for CR training. In emphasis-shift training, the whole task is left intact but the relative emphasis or priority placed on parts of the tasks is varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412446483">Gopher et al., 1989</xref>). Fractionation “breaks down the whole task into elements that have to be executed simultaneously” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412446483">Kluge et al., 2009</xref>, p. 502). Whereas in emphasis-shift training, the task is not broken down as such, when fractionation is used, part-task components need to be reintegrated, for example, by combining each part sequentially that was practiced in isolation (repetitive part-task training); by pure part training, in which each component is practiced in isolation and combined at the end of training; and by progressive part training, as a combination of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412446483">Proctor &amp; Dutta, 1995</xref>). On the basis of theoretical considerations, it is assumed that fractionation is best applied when there is relatively little need for time sharing between CR subcomponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412446483">Proctor &amp; Dutta, 1995</xref>), whereas emphasis-shift training seems especially useful when the whole task requires time sharing between CR subcomponents.</p>
<p>For the acquisition of CR skills, one can design Training A using emphasis-shift training, Training B using fractionation, and a CG that employs the previously used technique, for example, a verbal instruction. The aim of the noncomparative evaluation (comparing Training A emphasis shift or Training B fractionation with the CG) consists of assessing the intervention’s effectiveness per se (“Is the intervention effective [at all]?”). The aim of the comparative evaluation between two groups is to assess the relative effectiveness of two interventions with the same goals (“Is emphasis shift Training A more or less effective than B with the same goals?”).</p>
<p>The noncomparative evaluation of the effectiveness of Training A and B is usually assessed against a CG. The nontreatment of CG must take place in conditions that are identical or very similar to those of Training A or B (e.g., equal length, equal group size) as well as identical in terms of the cognitive demands regarding concentration, level of effort, the attractiveness of the training, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager, 1999</xref>). Moreover, the training needs to be conducted by the same trainer. It is important for the CG to be treated in the same conditions as at least one of the intervention groups to enable the comparison of the pre- and posttest measures between CG and the intervention group(s).</p>
<p>Although it is appealing from an experimental perspective that the CG treatment should have no theoretical relation to the objectives of the treatment groups, in practical terms, it is barely possible to convince, for example, a client to invest in the comparative investigation for a treatment that is assumed to be ineffective from the outset. Therefore, the CG will often represent an already established training format for which the decision has already been made to improve it.</p>
<p>In the comparative evaluation of emphasis-shift Training A versus fractionation Training B, the two training interventions are competing (also called rival interventions). Rival interventions will offer different tasks, instructions, and/or strategies for working on these tasks; they may rely on different instructional methods and may differ in terms of length, particular intervention context, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager, 1999</xref>). Successful comparisons between rival interventions pay special attention to the intervention’s efficiency, in most cases with respect to the duration and frequency of training, refresher training, or rehearsal.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, and independent of the specific example on emphasis-shift versus fractionation training, in the intervention, participants should train and practice either the combination of specific CR skills (e.g., decision making or problem solving) and should have to train with a specific type of intervention (e.g., with or without stress exposure, emphasis-shift training, drill and practice, cross-training). If the intervention Training A is completely new and cannot be compared with some training that already exists or is not part of a training syllabus, it should be compared to a no-treatment group or CG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager, 1999</xref>). The no-treatment group receives some form of intervention that lasts for the same amount of time as Training A so as to control for effects of fatigue, which might affect training results. The intervention should also be conducted by the same trainer to control for experimenter effects.</p>
<p>In many other cases, some form of intervention already exists but has some shortcomings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager, 1999</xref>), for example, it takes too long or is too costly. In such cases, one wishes to investigate whether a newly designed training intervention overcomes these shortcomings, and the suggestion is then to design two different interventions, for example, a newly designed Training A and a newly designed rival Training B. The two interventions are designed to meet the same training objectives (the KSAs) but use, for example, different instructional techniques, such as scenario-based training, guided error training, cross-training, or demonstration-based training (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1555343412446483">Wilson, Salas, &amp; Andrews, 2010</xref>), and they are then compared with the existing training (CG).</p>
<p>As stated in the Introduction, we propose that soundly conducted training research can support the endeavor to shed light on the question of how CR as a composite construct can be achieved. We suggest using already validated training, for example, on emotional coping skills, metacognitive skills, and problem-solving skills, as components of CR. To create an example, imagine that each validated training intervention takes half a day to be trained separately. One could design 1-day fractionation (see earlier discussion) training (Training A) with a first module in metacognitive skills, which is expected to positively affect the training of emotional coping skills, the prerequisite for applying problem-solving skills proficiently. The sequence of the fractionation training content is based on theoretical assumptions and models regarding what the “foundation for something else” consists of. The fractionation might shorten the time that needs to be invested in training a subsequent skill. In the example, we propose that metacognitive skills are important for recognizing that one’s cognitive processes might be negatively affected by stress. This stress leads to the use of emotional coping strategies, which in turn lead to the more mindful application of problem-solving skills. The underlying assumptions of the training are that the cognitive processes are dependent on each other and that the training has to address the interdependencies of skills so that (a) skills are applied proficiently under stress and (b) training time can be shortened.</p>
<p>We additionally design a 1.5-day training intervention (Training B, training time is the sum of each separate training part) in which the skills are separately addressed and the link between the underlying cognitive processes required for CR is not emphasized. In this case, the application of the basic module can help to answer the question of whether the theory-based training of combinations of skills, which reduces training time, can be as effective as, or even more effective than, the simple sequence of existing validated training, which would last longer.</p>
<p>Finally, with respect to cost-benefit ratio, one can investigate the question of what can be trained in a computer-based manner and what needs to trained in a classroom or in live training using the basic module by varying the training media or location and not the content. Imagine, for instance, that after discovering that the 1-day Training A (described earlier), which trained metacognitive skills, emotional coping skills, and problem-solving skills, worked effectively in a classroom setting, we would now like to compare the classroom training with a computer-based version (Training B). We could also compare high-fidelity simulations (e.g., live-fire scenarios) with low-fidelity simulations (e.g., serious games) and so forth so as to decide on the question of what might be the best cost-benefit ratio to achieve CR. A more expensive training method, for example, using a high-fidelity simulation, then has to prove that the increase in performance is worth the additional cost. Otherwise, the less expensive training intervention might still be preferred.</p>
<p>In summary, a great deal of research is still needed to answer questions regarding the achievement of CR by training, and only carefully designed training research programs in which design criteria are successively varied can provide answers based on a high internal validity of conducted experiments.</p>

<title>Designing the Posttests</title>
<p>Directly after the training, the training performance is measured by the same tests and instruments used in the pretest to check the effectiveness of the treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412446483">Guerlain et al. (2004)</xref>, for instance, used a paper-and-pencil premission readiness questionnaire and a postmission questionnaire with a similar set of questions addressing, for example, resources, time, and the team’s plan. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref>, a pretest, a pre-live-fire test, a post-live-fire test, and a recovery test were used (in sum, two pretests and two posttests). Additionally, to measure adaptive transfer, one needs to present tasks in a dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environment that are performed in terms of a “first-shot” performance measure (see earlier discussion) so as to assess adaptive transfer of acquired skills. Then, after a longer period of nonuse, for instance, several days or weeks, a second, delayed posttest should be applied (for examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, Sauer, &amp; Ritzmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412446483">Kluge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412446483">Pashler, Rohrer, Cepeda, &amp; Carpenter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1555343412446483">Shute &amp; Gawlick, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>It is useful to have some tasks as practiced tasks, which are applied in the two posttest measures repeatedly, to measure temporal transfer of practiced tasks. For example, if Tasks A, B, C, and D are trained in the intervention, A and B should be assessed in Posttest 1 and C and D in Posttest 2. Nevertheless, it needs to be assured that A through D can be performed accurately in a final trial at the end of the training or intervention. To measure adaptive transfer, on the basis of our experience, one should design four unfamiliar tasks, for example, M, N, O, and P. From these tasks, M and N should be assessed in Posttest 1, and O and P should be assessed in Posttest 2.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446483">Kraiger and Jung (1997</xref>, p. 171) suggest an alternative approach based on their “learning outcome design.” They suggest administering two different pretests to both Training Groups A and B (which, in the learning outcome design, do <italic>not</italic> address the same goals) as well as to the CG, with one test being tailored to the training goals of Group A and one being tailored to Group B. The same tests are then used for all groups on both posttests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446483">Kraiger and Jung (1997)</xref> state that “in an ideal situation, results would show that pre-test and post-test scores are more highly correlated within training groups than across training groups; scores on test A change more for participants of Training A than Training B” (p. 171) and vice versa, and posttest scores from Posttests 1 and 2 would be correlated within groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446483">Kraiger &amp; Jung, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The factors introduced in this section all contribute to the internal validity of a study. Internal validity involves ruling out alternative interpretations of a presumed causal relationship between a construct as manipulated (e.g., a training intervention to enhance transfer of training for decision-making skills) and the criterion as measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446483">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1976</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1555343412446483">
<title>Interpreting Results</title>
<p>Finally, the basic module for transfer-of-training research allows for a within- and between-group statistical analysis as well as for an interaction or moderator analysis of the impact of individual differences. In that respect, it should be considered that statistical tests for interactions (moderated regression analysis or MANOVA) as well as for within- and between-group comparisons require an adequate sample size. The within-group analysis compares, for instance, performance within the treatment groups at the different pretest-posttest-posttest measurements, such as knowledge acquisition or skills maintenance. The between-group design allows for comparisons between the treatment groups. Sample size should be determined with respect to the method of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412446483">Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1555343412446483">Maxwell, 2000</xref>). Given long time intervals between Posttest 1 and Posttest 2, one should bear in mind that participants may drop out and therefore consider a slightly larger sample to begin with. This procedure does not, of course, solve the accompanying problem of “mortality” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446483">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1976</xref>), a threat to internal validity resulting when different kinds of individuals drop out of particular interventions. On the other hand, the problem of studying mortality stresses the importance of measuring person-related variables at the pretest to enable the assessment of differences between participants who drop out and those who remain in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1555343412446483">
<title>Effect Sizes</title>
<p>What magnitude for effect sizes can be expected? In noncomparative evaluations (analysis of the difference in posttest measure between Training A and CG and between Training B and CG), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446483">Hager (1999</xref>, p. 328) suggests orienting one’s expectations toward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412446483">Bloom’s (1984)</xref> “2 sigma criterion” (a standardized means difference of <italic>d</italic> = 2.0) in ideal conditions (e.g., one-on-one training with mastery learning) to <italic>d</italic> = 0.5 through <italic>d</italic> = 1.0 for successful interventions administered to larger groups. According to Hager, many other authors refer to conventions proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412446483">Cohen (1988)</xref>, according to whom an effect is large if <italic>d</italic> = 0.8, medium if <italic>d</italic> = 0.5, and small if <italic>d</italic> = 0.2. In comparative studies, the correct interpretation of effect size <italic>d</italic> should refer to the difference in effectiveness of the two training interventions A and B, for example, high-fidelity simulation versus low-fidelity simulation, and not to their effectiveness compared with the CG, for example, a classroom session per se. However, this also implies that the magnitude of effect sizes of <italic>d</italic> = 0.5 to 0.8, given that the above is not directly applicable to comparative studies and is expected to be smaller because Training A and B are basically designed and developed to achieve the same training objectives but with different means. The CG is necessary in this case, for example, to assess performance improvement attributable to testing (an effect might be attributable to effects associated with taking a test a certain number of times; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446483">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1976</xref>, p. 227) or to maturation (an observed effect might result when participants grow older, wiser, stronger, or more experienced between pre- and posttest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446483">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1976</xref>, p. 227). Nevertheless, depending on the research question, the CG may also need to be considered for the analysis of planned comparisons or contrasts (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1555343412446483">Loftus, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Extensions of the Basic Module and Suggestions for Further Research</title>
<p>In the following section, we introduce three potential extensions of the basic module related to current discussions in the field of training that are especially relevant for CR: spacing of practice, performance under stress, and individual differences.</p>
<sec id="section13-1555343412446483">
<title>Investigating Spacing of Practice</title>
<p>As outlined in the section on indicators of successful performance in unpredictable environments after training of CR, longer retention intervals must be considered because of long periods of nonuse of CR skill. As little is known so far about the retention of acquired complex skills such as CR, more research is needed. With regard to skill retention, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412446483">Pashler et al. (2007)</xref>, one of the basic choices within training design is the question of when (in terms of temporal distribution) training should take place to maximize skill retention. In a spacing experiment, participants train the same skill or information on two occasions (S1 and S2), separated by an interstudy interval. Following an additional retention interval measured from S2, a final test is given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412446483">Pashler et al., 2007</xref>, p. 188). The authors conclude from their experiments that when the retention interval is substantial, the optimal ratio of interstudy interval and the retention interval is close to 10% to 20%, meaning, for example, that for a retention interval of 12 months, the interstudy interval should be between 5 and 10 weeks. They also conclude that spacing clearly has powerful effects on memory across substantial retention intervals. However, the experiments cited by Pashler et al. used relatively simple types of learning tasks “that people undertake in daily life,” such as facts, vocabulary, or math problem solving.</p>
<p>As it is questionable whether the conclusions drawn from these simpler learning tasks can be easily transferred to training goals relevant for CR, in the future, researchers should try to replicate the optimal ratio for the components of CR and their application in complex, dynamic, and stressful environments. With consideration of all of the aforementioned issues, the design by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412446483">Pashler et al. (2007)</xref> applied to training research for CR could resemble that displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412446483">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>This design is a comparative in that Training A and its rival group differ in terms of their interstudy interval, which is systematically altered and compared with regard to performance in Posttest 3. This research is relevant, for instance, if the date of a deployment is fixed and one wants to schedule training and refresher training and their interstudy interval in an optimal way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1555343412446483">
<title>Investigating Performance Decrements Under Stress</title>
<p>As introduced earlier, CR is required in the presence of personal threat or in conditions of stress, sleep loss, or fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446483">Driskell et al., 2008</xref>), meaning that acquired skills must be resistant to altered conditions and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412446483">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446483">Driskell et al. (2008)</xref> use the term <italic>stress</italic> to refer to “high-demand, high-risk task conditions” (p. 271) in which stressors, such as noise, threat, time pressure, task load, coordination requirements, or fatigue, are present. CR is supposed to prepare individuals for these types of high-stress environments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446483">Driskell et al. (2008)</xref> distinguish between <italic>training</italic> and <italic>stress training</italic>: The purpose of training is to assure the acquisition of KSAs, whereas the primary purpose of stress training is to prepare the individual to maintain effective performance in a high-stress operational environment. The basic module to investigate CR training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412446483">Figure 2</xref>) can now serve two purposes: (a) to investigate how skills that were maintained during a substantial retention interval might decrease in stressful conditions or (b) to investigate the long-term effects of special training programs, such as the stress exposure training (SET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446483">Driskell &amp; Johnston, 1998</xref>), which provides a structure for designing, developing, and implementing stress training. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446483">Driskell, Johnston, and Salas (2001)</xref> showed that stress training is generalizable to novel situations (which addresses the issue of adaptive transfer), the question remains of whether temporal transfer is also affected and whether performance improvements based on the SET from pre- to posttraining are also applicable to longer retention intervals. To answer these questions, one needs to adapt the basic module in two ways:</p>
<list id="list9-1555343412446483" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Posttest 2 needs to include a high-demand, high-risk, stressful test setting in addition to the tasks that operationalize practiced and unpredictable tasks for Training A and rival Training A with SET.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One training group should represent the SET group to enable long-term effects of SET to be investigated.</p></list-item>

<p>With this extension, it must be assured that all groups perform at the same level at the end of the training, especially experimental group Training A and CG Training A, such that differences in the posttests can be attributed to the condition of stress exposure only and are not caused by differences in the amount of acquired skill during training (or affected by individual differences, which are controlled for with the pretest measures). The effect of the SET can be inferred by comparing experimental group Training A with the rival training group, which also additionally receives the SET after the initial Training A.</p>
<p>Further research could address the predictive validity of CR components for coping with stress. For example, which of the components of CR are mostly affected under stress and generally deteriorate first? Which CR component is most vulnerable to stress: Is SA affected first or is metacognition? How does training need to be designed to countermeasure the deterioration of these vulnerable skills so that they can be retained?</p>

<title>Testing Specific Hypotheses on the Effects of Person-Related Variables</title>
<p>In addition to analyzing relationships between person-related variables and CR performance after training, that is, main effects, we suggest examining interaction effects of person-related variables, as introduced in the section “Selecting Person-Related variables as Control Variables and as Predictors for Training Success” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446483">Table 1</xref>. Compared to research on main effects, far fewer studies have investigated interaction effects of person-related variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). Two types of interaction effects are interesting and promising with respect to CR research:</p>
<list id="list10-1555343412446483" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) interaction effects between person-related variables and transfer performance (e.g., interaction effects of general mental ability and risk taking on performance; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412446483">Burkolter, Kluge, &amp; Brand, 2010</xref>) and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) interaction effects between person-related variables and training method or design (i.e., attribute–treatment interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446483">Kluge, Ritzmann, Burkolter, &amp; Sauer, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The assumption behind research on attribute–treatment interactions is that some training methods and designs show greater or lesser effectiveness for particular trainees with respect to their individual characteristics. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446483">Gully and Chen (2010)</xref> summarize, “optimal training outcomes result when trainees exhibit maximal fit with the training environment (which includes content, delivery, and context)” (p. 35). An example in terms of CR research can be found in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412446483">Bell and Kozlowski (2008)</xref>, who trained participants on a complex and dynamic task using active learning approaches. Their findings showed that error encouragement led to higher levels of state mastery orientation for participants with low levels of trait mastery orientation. However, for participants with high levels of trait mastery orientation, error encouragement did not bring about higher levels of state mastery orientation. Thus, error encouragement had a compensatory effect on participants with low levels of mastery orientation. Bell and Kozlowski conclude that active learning approaches are not a universal strategy but need to be tailored to different trainees.</p>
<p>Further challenging but nevertheless valuable and worthwhile questions for CR research are as follows: How can person-related variables, such as cognitive capabilities, personality traits, or coping styles (as addressed in the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al., 2007</xref>), predict</p>
<list id="list11-1555343412446483" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>training time (How much training is needed for somebody with an unfavorable coping style?),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>training outcome (Can training at all compensate for a unfavorable coping style?), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>retention? (Is somebody with a favorable coping style after receiving training better able to establish, sustain, and retain competent professional performance in dynamic, complex, and unpredictable military operations?)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We hope that questions like these can be approached with the ideas and guidelines for research design that we have provided in this article.</p>

<title>Guidelines for Research on Training of CR</title>
<p>The leading question of the present article was, How do experiments need to be designed so as to draw valid conclusions regarding the predictive value of training for CR? The statements made in this article are summarized as follows:</p>
<list id="list12-1555343412446483" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Distinguish between CR components that are trainable, for example, problem-solving skills, from person-related variables that are considered stable, such as working memory capacity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Translate trainable CR components into training objectives, for example, by using the SGT method to work out the fixed, parallel, contingent, or free sequences that need to be “ready” to be recalled, established, and sustained in dynamic, threatening, unpredictable environments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Select and link person-related variables to the trainable CR components that might affect CR directly or indirectly through interaction with training content or training method.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Define the transfer situation that operationalizes temporal (“readiness”) and adaptive (“unpredictable”) transfer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Select, adapt, or develop a simulated task environment with a high psychological fidelity that prompts cognitive processes underlying the CR components addressed by the training objectives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specify research hypotheses with respect to questions regarding, for example, the following:
<list id="list13-1555343412446483" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p>• How much training is needed for individuals or groups to be cognitively ready?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• What is the most effective interstudy interval for skill retention?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• Can training be designed in such a way that multiple components of CR can be achieved in a training session?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• Do person-related variables predict training success?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• Can CR be acquired in a computer-based manner, and what needs to be trained in a classroom or in live training?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• Which of the components of CR are mostly affected under stress and generally deteriorate first?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• Which CR component is most vulnerable to stress: Is SA affected first or is metacognition?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>• How does training need to be designed to countermeasure the deterioration of these vulnerable skills so that they can be retained?</p></list-item></list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use a pretest-posttest-posttest experimental design in which participants are randomly assigned to study conditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use the most promising part-task/whole-task training methods to capture the notion that CR is a composite construct.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specify study conditions in terms of a noncomparative (is Training A effective per se?) or comparative evaluation (is Training A more effective than Training B?)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make use of planning details for the CR training research question concerning study conditions, person-related variables, and randomization to define the adequate sample size.</p></list-item>

<title>Theoretical and Practical Implications</title>
<p>What are the theoretical and practical implications for enhancing the understanding of CR and for improving CR in complex environments? Our basic assumption is that CR cannot be achieved by measuring CR alone. We assume that most of the CR components are shapeable and trainable. However, we do not yet know to what extent this is the case. Therefore, a first research question to achieve a further understanding of CR regards the performance level up to which CR skills can be trained and which training formats and methods are needed. The basic module presented in this article can help one to investigate what the optimal and maximum performance level actually is on the basis of the combination of person-related variables and training.</p>
<p>Second, training-of-CR research and its demands resulting from pretest-posttest design can enhance the understanding of the interplay of person-related and training-related variables that best predicts the prerequisites for establishing and sustaining competent performance in complex and stressful environments. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref> presents an example of performance on some cognitive measures that was differentially influenced by workload. Nevertheless, the sample size in their study (<italic>N</italic> = 12) was too small to validly infer conclusions that allow generalization to other samples. As yet, little is known about this interplay, but it should be investigated to deepen our understanding of how person-related variables, such as personality traits or cognitive aspects, affect CR separately and in interaction with training design issues.</p>
<p>Third, using a pretest-posttest experimental design based on the proposed basic module including a CG allows insights to be gained into the stability of CR measures per se and thereby also supports the understanding of CR measurement issues. For example, in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref>, some of the measures (multitasking, spatial manipulation, and working memory) used to assess CR showed practice effects. Further research is needed to comprehensively understand the stability and plasticity of capabilities and the intraindividual variance of capabilities relevant for CR.</p>
<p>Fourth, CR measurements might differ in their relevance and incremental validity for predicting temporal and adaptive transfer. The studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446483">Cosenzo et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412446483">Swann and Schmidt (2005)</xref> report strong correlations between CR metrics and the live-fire performance, but it remains unclear what incremental contribution in explaining the variance in the live-fire performance each metric actually makes in comparison to the other metrics used. Thus, it might be important to administer test batteries and measures that are not too costly in terms of time.</p>
<p>Finally, advantages and disadvantages of using different test formats can be comparatively investigated, for example, self-ratings on stress coping style or performance tests, such as secondary tasks; test locations, such as in the classroom versus during a live mission (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446483">Bowman &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>) or with a simulation; and self-ratings versus performance ratings by experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412446483">Guerlain et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>With this article, we hope to support researchers in laboratory research as well as in field settings in planning and designing studies to investigate CR. We also hope that with our suggested extension of the basic module, researchers and practitioners from different fields relating to CR will feel encouraged to contribute to a challenging and exciting field of psychological research that aims to achieve a better understanding of the factors underlying CR. We have provided some hints on how best to apply this understanding to design tools and training programs to mitigate any identified deficiencies.</p>
