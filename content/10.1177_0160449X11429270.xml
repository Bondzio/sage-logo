<abstract>
<p>This article offers a pedagogical model for facilitating union worker–university student dialogues on labor issues. Most university students in this study initially held neutral opinions of organized labor. However, the beliefs of the few students with strong attitudes about unions were often shaped by close interactions with family members who belonged to unions. Taking these attitudes and factors into considerations when designing classroom activities and approaches, a dialoguing process was developed that encouraged participants to articulate their viewpoints, engage in reciprocal written and verbal exchanges, and reflect on others’ perceptions in order to enhance their own labor perspectives.</p>

<p>In his introduction to <italic>Organizing the Curriculum: Perspectives on Teaching the US Labor Movement</italic>, Rob <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160449X11429270">Linné (2009a</xref>, xi) states, “For far too long labor has been limited to a footnote in school texts instead of being treated seriously as the most effective force for championing the rights of working people—the vast majority of citizenry.” Most university students I teach confirm Linné’s assertion. Some students state that their education simply has not included labor topics. As a result, Stephanie, a freshman, explained, “I know next to nothing about unions. I’ve never been presented with the topic and it’s something that goes unnoticed in my life.” Other students state that general labor topics are sometimes discussed in history, political science, or geography courses, but these issues are often framed as secondary concerns. For instance, Jim, a sophomore, said that discussions of labor in previous classes “never went into too much depth; we mainly made note of the fact that labor issues were a cause or effect of some other major event.”</p>
<p>In contrast to my university students who often assert they have limited exposure to labor topics, while teaching with the United Steelworkers (USW) Local 787’s Institute for Career Development (ICD), I have met union members who have intimate firsthand knowledge of labor issues. These USW Local 787 members frequently voice their concern that young people have little knowledge about the labor issues that impact workers’ everyday lives because schools may not teach the history or continuing importance of local and global labor movements. One longtime union officer, Bill, explained that after looking at his children’s school curriculum, he concluded that we “don’t teach labor at all in our schools. Period. The kids are taught that Carnegie and Getty and all these guys were great champions of the industrial revolution, but they don’t teach at what cost.” Consequently, Bill and other USW Local 787 members worry that limited or one-sided exposure to labor issues in schools may result in students’ misunderstanding unions and forming negative opinions of organized labor. Specifically, another class participant and Local 787 officer, Adam, explained, “A lot of people think unions are bad, but unions don’t do things that are bad; they do things for the people and the community. You see, without a union, this could be a sweatshop.” While young people’s perceptions of labor issues may be shaped by multiple factors, including their own experiences, family attitudes, or media representations, USW Local 787 members recognize that labor education can serve as an important tool for helping students understand the role of unions in a global economy.</p>
<p>Simultaneously teaching labor topics to university students at a public midwestern university and union workers through USW/ICD allowed me to recognize a potential connection that could be made between several USW Local 787 members who wanted to share accounts of their labor and union experiences and university students who wanted to learn more about these topics. These groups inspired me to foster union worker–university student dialogues that provided students access to authentic voices of the labor movement while offering union workers the opportunity to share their labor perspectives and experiences with a student audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160449X11429270">1</xref></sup> In developing these dialogues, I drew on my dual roles as a university instructor and USW/ICD facilitator. However, my goal in this article is to present an example of pedagogical practices and classroom activities for creating union worker–university student dialogues that may be adapted to fit the learning goals of diverse educational programs that may include other student demographics or labor organizations.</p>
<p>Although numerous researchers have found that college experiences may shape students’ attitudes about unions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160449X11429270">Willoughby and Barclay 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0160449X11429270">Willoughby and Keon 1985</xref>), markedly little scholarship correlates this research on young peoples’ perceptions of unions with specific classroom approaches for educating students about organized labor issues. Therefore, this article strives to bridge research on young people’s perceptions of unions with scholarship on teaching about labor issues in order to suggest pedagogical approaches and classroom activities to facilitate union worker–university student dialogues that may inform participants’ perspectives on organized labor. To meet these aims, I will first briefly overview the university students’ initial perceptions of organized labor in order to subsequently suggest how considering the experiences, people, or topics the shape students’ labor perspectives can influence teaching approaches and course material. Next, the majority of this article will illustrate the process of union worker–university student dialogues that we developed in our course. Finally, the conclusion will reflect on this experience and suggest the impact that these dialogues had on participants.</p>

<title>Considering University Students’ Initial Knowledge of Labor Topics and Perceptions of Unions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X11429270">Barling, Kelloway, and Bremermann (1991</xref>, 725) emphasize the significance of studying young people’s perceptions of unions, asserting, “If union attitudes are indeed stable, and undergo most change during adolescence and early adulthood, an understanding of their development at that stage becomes even more important.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160449X11429270">2</xref></sup> While quantitative studies provide statistical data concerning young people’s attitudes towards unions, in my university classes, I offer students the opportunity to share narrative responses through writing activities and verbal discussions in which they can explore personal encounters, close acquaintances, educational experiences, and other factors that have helped shape their labor perspectives. Understanding what factors have significantly influenced students’ perceptions of unions allows me to tailor teaching methods and classroom activities to participants’ expectations, knowledge, questions, or concerns.</p>
<p>During two academic semesters in which I taught 100-level general education humanities courses at a public midwestern university, a total of fifty students who were enrolled in these classes volunteered to share their attitudes about labor issues and unions in order for our class to build on their knowledge during the course and consider how dialoguing with union members impacted their perspectives. Students in these classes were between eighteen and twenty-two years old and included twenty-three freshman, eighteen sophomores, eight juniors, and one senior. These classes reflected the demographics of the university, in which 82 percent of the student population is white and 99 percent are from within the state. Need-based financial aid is received by 27 percent of the students at the university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160449X11429270">Barron’s 2010</xref>). However, the majority of students in my classes stated that they did not have outside employment during the school year and expressed limited prior work experience. Throughout the semester, we met three hours a week for sixteen weeks, and participants shared their evolving labor perspectives in written assignments and class discussions throughout this time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the semester, only eighteen out of the fifty students expressed strong attitudes toward labor unions, with eleven students explaining that they had a positive view of labor unions and seven students stating that they had a negative perception of organized labor. The majority of students with favorable perceptions of unions, eight of the eleven respondents, acknowledged that their labor perspective was predominantly influenced by close family members’ active union participation or pro-union attitudes. These students explained that they typically did not pay close attention to labor issues in the news or popular culture and, instead, depended on direct conversations with family members to inform their perspective. Thus, these responses reflected the impact that close family members with strong attitudes toward unions can have on young people, as research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X11429270">Barling, Kelloway, and Bremermann (1991</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X11429270">Kelloway and Watts (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160449X11429270">Kelloway, Barling, and Agar (1996)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160449X11429270">Pesek, Raehsler, and Balough (2006)</xref>; and others conclude. Specifically, Janice, a freshman education major at the university, explained, “Labor unions are very near and dear to my heart. I grew up in a very pro-union household, and because of that we believe in American-made products. . . . Although labor unions might be controversial to some, I believe they are an important and necessary part of any labor worker’s job.” Janice correlated her current positive attitudes toward labor unions with her personal and professional goals, asserting, “As a future teacher, I want to be part of a union.” Similarly, Curt, a sophomore marketing major, expressed favorable views of organized labor, which he considered to be informed by a family member’s active union participation and pro-union attitudes. Curt explained, “My mom is vice president of the teachers’ union. The union allows the teachers to have a little bit of ground to stand on when it comes to certain discussions and disagreements with the school board. . . . There might be some association between my mother’s view and my own.”</p>
<p>Family members’ attitudes not only impacted students with positive perceptions of unions. Additionally, students with unfavorable perceptions of unions overwhelmingly cited that their perspectives at the beginning of the course were influenced by family members’ negative experiences with unions. While seven students conveyed unfavorable attitudes about unions, five participants explained that their perspectives were directly influenced by close family members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160449X11429270">3</xref></sup> For instance, Brianna explained that her negative perception of unions was influenced by her father, a nonunion general contractor, telling her about his experiences with a construction workers’ union. Brianna stated, “Most of my attitudes and opinions about unions come from my family, in particular my dad and grandfather. They have taught me to believe that union construction workers don’t work as hard as construction workers who aren’t in the union. Their beliefs about union workers’ work ethic has rubbed off onto me over the years of hearing them discuss it.” Brianna detailed how her family found themselves in an oppositional struggle against the union; however, most students in the class who expressed negative perceptions of unions said family members’ unfavorable experiences as union members had influenced their attitudes. For instance, Jesse explained that his father’s experiences as a union employee led him to conclude that “the union can do pretty much whatever they want, once they make a decision that upsets the workforce of the union and they go on strike. All those benefits are taken away and people can no longer afford to live their life how they have been since joining the union.”</p>
<p>Although some students expressed strong negative or positive perceptions of unions, the vast majority of participants in this study, thirty-two out of fifty students, expressed neutral attitudes toward labor unions at the beginning of the course. Therefore, most students did not express the negative perception of unions that USW Local 787 members expected or recent Pew and Gallop polls suggest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160449X11429270">4</xref></sup> Rather, students generally held neutral opinions about unions, as research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160449X11429270">Willoughby and Barclay (1986)</xref> finds. Unlike students with strong attitudes about unions who often stated a close family member who was a union worker influenced their perspectives, very few of the students with neutral opinions of labor unions, only six of the thirty-two, said a close relative was a union member. Subsequently, most students explained that they had a neutral attitude toward labor unions because they had no personal connection to organized labor and knew little about labor issues. One class participant, Ella, iterated the reason for many students’ neutral perspective, as she stated, “I don’t have an opinion about unions because I don’t know enough information about them to construct one.” Other students acknowledge that their neutral opinions resulted from their personal detachment from organized labor, such as Mitch, who explained, “I really have few opinions on unions simply because I have no experience personally as a member of a union.”</p>
<p>Considering students’ familiarity (or unfamiliarity) with labor topics and the influences that shaped their perceptions of unions allowed me to be better informed when developing teaching methods and classroom activities. Specifically, my research with university students indicated that the beliefs of the few students with strong attitudes about unions were often shaped by close interactions with union members. However, the majority of students held neutral opinions about unions and typically had little or no personal contact with union workers. These findings suggested how union member–university student dialogues might be adopted to inform each group’s perceptions of organized labor topics. First, because students with neutral attitudes often explained that they lacked information or experiences that would allow them to assert an informed position, they frequently expressed a willingness to actively engage in union worker–university student dialogues that might help them learn about labor topics. For instance, Molly wanted to become more educated about labor issues before she formed her opinion, explaining, “I honestly will say I don’t know much of anything about labor issues. I am very open to learning about them and becoming more informed.” Second, while influences, such as the media, popular culture, personal work experience, or other factors, might have affected the perspectives of students with strong opinions about unions, these students overwhelmingly expressed that one-on-one contact with close family members was the predominant factor in shaping their perceptions of unions. Because many students with strong perspectives about unions iterated the importance of personal interactions with union members, our class developed union worker–university student dialogues to offer the type of firsthand perspectives that students explained are important in shaping their perceptions of organized labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160449X11429270">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Classroom Approaches to Teaching about Labor through Union Worker–University Student Dialogues</title>
<p>Informed by the insight students shared about their perceptions of organized labor and inspired by the USW Local 787 members’ genuine concern for young people’s labor education, my general education humanities course was designed to foster dialogues between the students and the workers, providing each group an opportunity to discuss issues during face-to-face conversations and written correspondences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0160449X11429270">6</xref></sup> This process drew on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X11429270">Freire’s (1970</xref>, 88) assertion that “dialogue is the encounter in which the united reflection and action of the dialoguers are addressed to the world which is to be transformed and humanized.” In order to realize this lofty aim, I adopted an overall teaching method that synthesized multiple pedagogical approaches in order to engage participants through recognizing their own perceptions of unions and building on their expanding knowledge and experiences with labor. First, critical pedagogy’s student-centered approach and decentered authority influenced the structure of our discussions and dialogues as well as provided a theoretical rationale for connecting our classroom activities with pertinent contemporary labor issues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X11429270">Freire 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160449X11429270">McLaren and Farahmandpur 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X11429270">Darder, Baltodona, and Torres 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160449X11429270">Zullo and Gates 2008</xref>). Second, cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) offered techniques for engaging students in tool-mediated, historically and socially situated learning processes that could capitalize on our current moment of debate over organized labor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X11429270">Leont’ev 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0160449X11429270">van Oers et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160449X11429270">Sawchuk 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160449X11429270">Roth and Lee 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0160449X11429270">Worthen 2008</xref>). Finally, within a specific context of exploring labor issues, our class was guided by working-class approaches that recognize how labor and social class shape teaching and learning processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160449X11429270">Linkon 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160449X11429270">Russo and Linkon 2005</xref>) and youth labor education scholarship that addresses issues of teaching labor to a general audience of young people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160449X11429270">Linné, Benin, and Sosin 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0160449X11429270">Tubach 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0160449X11429270">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Working within this pedagogical framework, my course adopted multiple interconnected classroom activities to foster union worker–university student dialogues. First, to prepare for written and verbal dialogues, students were encouraged to share their own perspectives on labor and work experiences through writing assignments and in-class discussions. Second, our course gave students the opportunity to engage with labor issues as they read USW members’ stories and corresponded with the authors in written dialogues. Third, students participated in face-to-face verbal dialogues with a USW Local 787 member and connected this conversation with course topics and readings. Finally, to maintain this relationship between students and Local 787 members, students created social science–style research posters, which they presented to their class and shared with Local 787 members. As critical pedagogue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160449X11429270">Allman (2009</xref>, 427) points out, dialogue includes “at least some level of commitment, amongst participants, to develop a deeper and more critical understanding of their reality.” These four interconnected activities demonstrate the effort that both university students and union workers put into the dialoguing process in order to make this experience a worthwhile learning opportunity for all involved.</p>
<sec id="section3-0160449X11429270">
<title>Student Writing in Preparation for Dialogues</title>
<p>Throughout the semester, our class investigated labor topics, such as international commodity chains, offshore manufacturing practices, local/global work environments, and transnational unionization efforts, through reading literary, cultural, and social science texts and completing multigenre composition assignments in which we could develop and share our knowledge. Specifically, in our first writing assignment of the semester, I asked students to create a personal narrative in which they shared an experience, person, or issue that shaped their labor perspective. Informed by CHAT pedagogy, which strives to engage students in meaningful, socially situated learning processes, and critical pedagogy that builds on students’ experiences and knowledge, this broad list of suggested topics was created to allow students to engage with the factors that were most important in shaping what they knew about labor topics or how they perceived unions. Additionally, by encouraging students to articulate their developing labor perspective, this early assignment got them thinking, writing, and talking about labor topics in preparation for future union worker–university student dialogues.</p>
<p>This assignment appealed to the range of labor experiences and knowledge represented in the classroom. For instance, a couple of students who explained that they knew little of labor topics at the beginning of the course took this opportunity to research an issue and begin to develop an informed position. Several other students with little personal work experience reflected on a brief encounter that helped them realize the labor that goes into the products they consume. For example, Brianna wrote about how picking vegetables in her grandparents’ garden helped her recognize “the hard work that goes into growing the food I eat every day, and how much I take advantage of having the privilege to eat fresh food without having to work that hard for it.” For the few students who initially expressed that their perception of organized labor was significantly shaped by family members’ attitudes or personal encounters, these writings gave them the opportunity to reflect on their perspectives or work experiences. Jim wrote about his “very tedious” summer job “on the assembly line, pulling off small packages of cinnamon apples, making sure they weighed the proper amount.” Although he was “just there looking for a little extra cash,” writing his labor perspective allowed him to recognize the “injustices going on at the factory” for those who were “relying on that money from the day to feed their family.” He explained, “At the time, I didn’t even really think about it, but looking back on it I realize how unfairly all of the other workers were treated there.” As Brianna, Jim, and other students volunteered to share excerpts from their labor perspective essays in class, we were able to recognize and discuss the variety of experiences represented in the classroom as well as the numerous perspectives from which students approached labor topics.</p>
<p>While this assignment helped all students to begin to articulate their labor perspective, perhaps it was particularly important for engaging working-class students in the classroom by offering them an opportunity to share their personal connections to work and labor issues. Drawing on working-class pedagogy’s goal of creating a classroom that respects working-class and labor voices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160449X11429270">Seitz (2004</xref>, 214) promotes assignments that “elicit writers’ multiple orientations toward cultural values of work through reflection on situated moments of their continually evolving work identity and persuasive influences on work issues in their lives.” However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160449X11429270">Linkon (1999</xref>, 3) suggests that increasing numbers of students can be impacted by such assignments and pedagogies, as “even in elite schools, more students seem to be working more hours in order to be able to afford to go to college, and so-called nontraditional students are becoming more common. Such students may not be from working-class backgrounds, but they may well share some qualities associated with working-class students.” Therefore, while personal labor perspective essays may have been particularly well suited for engaging working-class students, through these narratives, all students were given the opportunity to articulate their present labor attitudes and experiences as a basis for cultivating a more knowledgeable perception of organized labor. Thus, as students began to think, write, and discuss labor topics, this early assignment laid the foundation for the union worker–university student dialogues our course would develop.</p>

<title>Reading Workers’ Stories and Participating in Written Dialogues</title>
<p>Reflective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160449X11429270">Linné’s (2009b</xref>, 37) “call for a pedagogy that encourages the study of local histories and cultures as told through working-class voices,” part of the reading that students did in the course included workers’ short stories, poetry, autobiographies, and ethnographic selections. For instance, our investigation into how specific populations are impacted by the benefits and drawbacks of international free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, was enriched by reading accounts by U.S. and Mexican workers, including literary selections, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X11429270">Baca and James’s (2003)</xref> <italic>The Heat: Steelworker Lives &amp; Legends</italic>, and social science ethnographies, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160449X11429270">Louie’s (2006)</xref> <italic>Sweatshop Warriors</italic>, which allowed us to see the personal impacts of political policies. Through studying these firsthand accounts, we attempted to revitalize what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160449X11429270">Sosin (2009</xref>, 269) recognizes as the “weakened version of what was once a robust passing on of stories about labor struggles and commonly shared experiences with industrial work.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0160449X11429270">8</xref></sup> Reading workers’ stories, writing to the authors, and receiving their responses enhanced our class’s understanding of labor struggles and experiences as well as improved our understanding of these workers’ perspectives.</p>
<p>After our class read <italic>The Heat: Steelworker Lives &amp; Legends</italic> and discussed its important themes, such as outsourcing, workplace safety, and global social class inequities, students were invited to write to an author in the collection and share their personal responses to a story. This writing built on the critical and reflective composition processes that students practiced in their labor perspective narratives. However, this assignment offered students the opportunity to create a piece of writing that would resonate outside of the classroom and reach a “real-world” audience by initiating recursive written dialogues between students and worker-writers. This conceptualization of writing reflects what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160449X11429270">Russell (1997</xref>, 505) explains as CHAT’s influence in moving “toward a theory of writing useful in analyzing how students and teachers within individual classrooms use the discursive tools of classroom genres to interact (and not interact) with social practices beyond individual classrooms, those of schools, families, peers, disciplines, professions, political movements, unions, corporations, and so on.” By engaging with particular activity systems—in this case, working with the genre of personal letters to correspond with union members about stories and labor issues pertinent to our current social moment—the assignment allowed students to reflect on what they had learned about labor topics in the course in order to compose letters that would be interpreted in rhetorical contexts beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Providing a composition assignment that allowed students to engage with CHAT’s concrete, real-world historical and social contexts as they wrote to authors encouraged students to reflect on how the literary selections connected to courses topics. Additionally, students had the opportunity to use their letter as a rhetorical performance in which they could voice their positive or negative impression of the author’s story as well as address how the text influenced their evolving labor perspective. For instance, Courtney, who at the beginning of the semester attributed her neutral perception of unions to the fact that she was “confused” by the “discrepancies between pro- and anti-union arguments,” wrote to one author, “When you talk about how the average individual could not survive in many ways without a steelworker employee’s help, it really showed me how much we depend on steelworkers. . . . I thought about how much steel I truly use every day. . . . I want to tell you that your work matters and you have truly changed my perspective on the steelwork profession for the better.” Other students similarly responded that the personal accounts helped them expand their labor perspective by learning about steelworkers, in particular, as well as recognizing the overarching contribution of industrial workers, more generally. Brianna, who at the beginning of the class explained that she thought some union workers do not work as hard as nonunion workers, told an author, “Your goal of opening up the minds of people to the life of a Steelworker has been accomplished. . . . My perspective on Steelworkers has completely changed. . . . Through your work I have gained an appreciation for not only Steelworkers, but for all laborers.” These statements suggest how reading USW-authored texts and writing to authors influenced students’ recognition of the labor embedded in commodities, informed their understanding of labor issues, and enriched their developing labor perspectives by offering them new viewpoints to consider.</p>
<p>In response to the letters, one author, Joe Gutierrez, a 70-year-old retired steelworker, replied to each student’s note. In these individualized responses, he provided students with an even more personal perspective on U.S. manufacturing work, again offering an authentic working-class voice for the students to consider. Joe explained, “In Inland Steel, the company where I worked, more than 340 workers that we know of had died on the job and thousands more have died as the result of work-related issues. . . . In 1983, when a steelworker retired his life expectancy was a mere six months to a year. Many retired workers in my department didn’t live that long.” Joe’s firsthand accounts of working conditions, specifically, asbestos exposure, provided students with new information and viewpoints to inform their evolving labor perspectives and attitudes about the role of unions. Moreover, students were able to see how their letters were received and interpreted by their target audience. As we shared excerpts from Joe’s replies aloud on the last day of class, tears literally came to several students’ eyes as we read, “Thank you so much for your words, for your enthusiasm, for your love of humanity. Keep up the good work. I know your parents must be very proud. You are truly the light of the world.” After this experience, one class participant, Molly, responded, “I literally had chills when you were reading his letters that he wrote back to us. . . . When you said that he was touched and inspired, I found it ironic because I was the one that was very touched!” As Molly’s reaction exemplifies, when students had the opportunity to discuss labor texts and topics in recursive written dialogues with worker-writers, it offered them the chance to more personally connect with the stories, people, and topics our class explored.</p>

<title>Engaging in Face-to-Face Dialogues</title>
<p>In addition to reading and responding to USW members’ creative writings, another way in which we worked to create dialogues between workers and students during our course and to uphold working-class and labor voices was by inviting Adam, a USW Local 787 officer, into our classroom to speak about his work experiences and union activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0160449X11429270">9</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160449X11429270">Sosin (2009</xref>, 269) notes, “stories about labor struggles seem more like ancient history than contemporary critical critique.” However, face-to-face conversations with Adam provided students with the opportunity to ask questions related to contemporary issues of unionization as well as the labor themes we explored in our multidisciplinary course texts, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160449X11429270">García Márquez’s (2006)</xref> <italic>One Hundred Years of Solitude</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X11429270">Bacon’s (2004)</xref> <italic>Children of NAFTA</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160449X11429270">Louie’s (2006)</xref> <italic>Sweatshop Warriors</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160449X11429270">Viramontes’ (1996)</xref> <italic>Under the Feet of Jesus</italic>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X11429270">Baca and James’s (2003)</xref> <italic>The Heat: Steelworker Lives &amp; Legends</italic>.</p>
<p>Adam offered to come to our class because he, along with several other USW Local 787 members, believed that “young people don’t understand the types of labor that go into all of these commodities” and, subsequently, that they misunderstand the role of unions in protecting workers’ rights. I first met Adam when he voiced this perspective in an ICD class called Globalization, Unionization, and Education that I taught for USW Local 787. During this course, I was impressed by his depth of knowledge on labor topics, diverse union experiences, and ability to articulate complex issues clearly and concisely. When I began thinking about facilitating union worker–university student classroom dialogues, I immediately turned to Adam to see if he would be willing to participate in this processes. As we talked before the classroom session, I encouraged Adam to share both the knowledge he had gained about issues during labor summer school courses as well as his personal experiences as a local union officer and worker in the manufacturing industry and, more globally, his travels to Mexico as part of a USW union solidarity delegation.</p>
<p>By inviting Adam into the classroom to chat with students, instead of only reading about labor unions in printed texts, our class had the opportunity to ask questions and offer face-to-face responses to Adam’s statements. Through this method, we engaged in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160449X11429270">McLaren (2000</xref>, 185) recognizes as critical pedagogy’s goal of a “reciprocal exchange between teachers and students–an exchange that engages in the task of reframing, refunctioning, and repositioning the question of understanding itself.” In our course, the exchange extended beyond the classroom walls to include students, myself, and our guests in reciprocal dialogues that could decenter classroom authority away from a teacher and focus on participant-centered inquiries and questions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X11429270">Freire (1970</xref>, 80) describes, “through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher cease to exist. . . . The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in which all grow.”</p>
<p>When Adam visited our class, he combined a short presentation about his own work and union involvement with time for open discussion and dialoguing. He began by providing students with a glimpse of the high technology and handcraftsmanship involved in his work by showing an episode of the History Channel’s <italic>Modern Marvels</italic> filmed at the Bridgestone tire factory where USW Local 787 members work. Many students were amazed that this type of manufacturing existed just a few minutes away from their school, not isolated thousands of miles away in developing nations. After the film, Adam explained multiple ways that the USW helps workers in his facility. For instance, he discussed how the union makes sure safety regulations in the factory are enforced; negotiates benefits like health care; and provides workers with educational opportunities like the USW/ICD. Additionally, Adam talked about USW’s national and international campaigns to support struggling unions in developing nations, lobby for legislation that will benefit workers, and alert local unions to important issues through a rapid-response system. Therefore, while Adam was personally involved in the manufacturing industry, his presentation addressed some of the overarching labor issues shared by unions in multiple fields.</p>
<p>After Adam’s presentation, students were able to chat with him about any questions, concerns, or confusion they had about unions, in general, or his work and experiences, specifically. While students learned from Adam’s initial presentation, having the opportunity to discuss the information with him during face-to-face dialogues made Adam’s time in our classroom even more effective. As we talked, students had a variety of insightful, respectful comments that ranged from technical inquiries, such as how the union’s grievance process works, to personal questions, like why Adam became so active in union operations. Students mentioned how the safety violations Adam described paralleled the toxic chemical dangers described in <italic>Under the Feet of Jesus</italic> and asbestos exposure recounted in <italic>The Heat</italic>. Additionally, during their conversations, students asked for more information about transnational union solidarity campaigns and, specifically, Adam’s involvement with USW-affiliated unions in other countries, such as Mexico’s Los Mineros. When Adam described the violence perpetuated against striking Los Mineros miners, students recognized how this mirrored the anti-union aggression we read about in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160449X11429270">García Márquez’s (2006)</xref> <italic>One Hundred Years of Solitude</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160449X11429270">Neruda’s (1991)</xref> “United Fruit Co.,” and other course texts.</p>
<p>In order to continue the dialogue with Adam after his chat with our class, students wrote to him sharing their reactions to his visit and asking any further questions. While reading <italic>The Heat</italic> and writing to authors enhanced students’ understanding of particular labor issues and industries, Adam’s dialogue with the class provided students with more specific insight into unions in general and the USW particularly. Students’ subsequent feedback suggested that regardless of their initial perceptions of unions, having a firsthand dialogue with a union member was an irreplaceably important experience in shaping their attitudes about organized labor. Brianna, who voiced a negative perception of unions at the beginning of the course, wrote to Adam explaining, “Your presentation gave me great insight into what it’s like to be a union member that I otherwise would not have gotten a chance to experience. I learned a lot about United Steelworkers and how the union runs. . . . It has opened up my eyes and made me realize that sometimes the way the media depicts unions isn’t necessarily true.” When the course began, Brianna initially stated that her father’s anti-union perspective influenced her own perception of unions. However, Adam’s pro-union sentiments provided Brianna with an alternate perspective to consider. Other students echoed Brianna’s experience, such as Chase, who stated, “I have to admit that I, like many others that you mentioned in your talk, had a negative view of unions. However, your personal and honest look made me reconsider my position. It never occurred to me how positive the impact of a union is on the workers.” Additionally, many students who held neutral opinions of organized labor at the beginning of the course expressed that talking with Adam helped them become more informed about unions and aware of the personal struggles of laborers. For instance, Molly, who initially voiced a desire to learn more about labor issues and reacted positively and emotionally to the written author dialogues, told Adam, “I know it may be challenging to speak about unions and the USW, since so many people assume unions are bad. I like the way you presented your part of the story. Most people don’t see the other side when they talk about all the negative things associated with unions.” As this feedback demonstrates, face-to-face union worker–university student dialogues can inform students’ labor perspectives by offering a working-class voice that underscores the continued imperative of labor organizations.</p>

<title>Maintaining the Union Worker–University Student Connection</title>
<p>Since union members shared their time, experiences, expertise, and stories with our class, some course assignments were designed to offer something back to the workers in return and maintain the connection that had been established between union workers and university students. Over the semester, students worked in groups to create educational social science–style research posters that informed the audience about an important moment in labor history, ranging from past events, like Ludlow and Homestead, to contemporary efforts to unionize <italic>maquilas</italic> and Liberian rubber plantations. Groups presented these posters to their classmates during a ten-minute informational talk followed by a question-and-answer segment. In the context of our course, this assignment allowed students to look in depth at a specific labor topic, while, overall, the posters presented a historical trajectory that highlighted the continued relevancy of organized labor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160449X11429270">Snegroff and Benin (2009</xref>, 48) assert that perfunctory labor history curriculum that frames the rise of unions as a reaction to unique and isolated historical occurrences can leave “students with the clear impression that organized labor, like Douglas MacArthur’s old generals, will just fade away.” However, as one student, Andrew, explained, the posters worked to “tie events in history to what we are currently learning about” and helped our class consider organized labor as a historically and contemporarily vital force for worker empowerment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0160449X11429270">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>This poster assignment allowed students to share their knowledge with peers while developing scholarly research and presentation skills. Additionally, as CHAT and critical pedagogy advocates, the poster assignment was designed to show students how course material relates to a wider social context and can have an impact beyond the classroom walls. Therefore, like our letters to the authors of <italic>The Heat</italic>, we shared our work with interested union members. At the end of the semester, we gave these posters to local labor unions, which displayed them in their union halls in order to provide information on labor topics to the workers. USW Local 787 members’ initial concern that students do not receive an adequate labor history education motivated me to have students engage in this transtemporal inquiry into select labor issues; therefore, it seemed fitting that in response we would offer these posters to the workers. When displayed during a USW Local 787 meeting, the posters initiated discussions about the specific topics as well as labor history education more broadly. In these conversations, members reflected on their knowledge of labor events and recognized that they could benefit from continuing this area of their education. As a result, USW Local 787’s ICD organized a series of labor history courses for the workers. Therefore, while university students may not have been experts on labor history, creating research posters and sharing their knowledge with the workers, in turn, catalyzed USW Local 787 members to develop their own labor history curriculum.</p>

<title>Reflections</title>
<p>Since my pedagogical methods are student-centered, it is not enough for me to personally believe or critically and theoretically justify that a classroom approach has the potential to help develop participants’ knowledge. The effectiveness ultimately depends upon participants’ own reflections on how and what they learned. Therefore, by considering university students’, union members’, and my own assessments of the classroom dialoguing process, I have been able to recognize strengths and weakness of the approach and suggest potential changes for future classroom dialogues.</p>
<p>The majority of my university students initially stated that they had neutral views of unions and commonly expressed a willingness to learn more about organized labor in order to cultivate an informed position. This mirrored other researchers’ findings on young people’s perceptions of unions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160449X11429270">Willoughby and Barclay 1986</xref>) and did not reflect Local 787 members’ expectation that students would hold predominately negative attitudes about organized labor. The few students who did have strong opinions about unions often stated that face-to-face interactions with a union family member was the predominate factor in shaping their perception of organized labor, as research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X11429270">Barling, Kelloway, and Bremermann (1991</xref>) and others similarly conclude. Therefore, taking these findings into consideration when designing my university course, I worked to provide students with information about labor topics through classroom readings and assignments, as well as offering dialoguing opportunities in which union members and university students could share their knowledge and learn from others’ perspectives.</p>
<p>Students’ reflections on the course suggested three ways in which they found this approach successful. First, students considered written and verbal dialogues the most engaging and beneficial activities of our course. Second, students explained that the union and labor perspectives presented in the course helped them understand pro-labor attitudes. Third, students said that through the dialoguing process they were able to develop and more confidently voice their own personal labor perspectives.</p>
<p>The reading and writing we did in preparation for the dialogues was designed to help students develop their knowledge on topics and articulate their initial perspectives. However, nearly every student stated that written and face-to-face dialogues with union members were their favorite course activities and were irreplaceably influential in shaping their understanding of labor issues beyond what traditional classroom reading and writing activities typically offer. Wayne explained, “There is no supplement for having an actual person come in and be willing to have a dialogue. Having someone come in and share their experience with a group of students who for the most part have no real idea of the working world, let alone unions, is immensely helpful.” Molly explained that she enjoyed “the format and the freedom” that written dialogues provided, and stated that she learned so much from Joe, who was “truly a wonderful man to share his stories with us and then to have the time to write us back is even more amazing!” Ella said that classroom verbal dialogues “gave us all a chance to understand what other people were thinking. This also made the class more interesting and gave it a little spin, so the teacher is not the only one talking while the rest of the class quietly takes notes the whole time.” These statements suggest the success of written and verbal dialogues for engaging students in meaningful learning activities that can offer CHAT’s cultural-historical context in the classroom as well as uphold critical pedagogy’s goals of decentered authority and student-centered learning.</p>
<p>After engaging in written and face-to-face dialogues, as well as interdisciplinary readings and multigenre composition assignments, university students expressed that regardless of whether their initial perception of unions was neutral, negative, or positive, at the end of our course, they were better able to understand a pro-union perspective. For instance, Terry, who initially expressed a neutral opinion of unions, explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning of this year, I didn’t know much about unions. . . . The guest speaker, Adam, really was the person that I got most of my information about unions from. . . . I believe that my previous lack of knowledge about unions really kept my mind open to what he had to say. I know that some people think that unions are corrupt and bad for the economy, but since I didn’t know much about unions prior to his speech, I think Adam really molded my views in a positive way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Terry’s comments suggest that he was already aware of anti-union arguments before he entered our classroom, and union worker–university student dialogues provided him with alternate perspectives to consider as he formed his own opinion. Similarly, Andrew stated that classroom dialogues informed his negative attitudes about unions by offering him opportunities to engage with organized labor perspectives:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Since the beginning of the semester, my perspective on labor and union has changed a lot. Coming into this class, I did not think that unions were a very important issue. I thought they were just radical people who would storm the streets with signs. . . . After taking this class, though, my views have changed to side more with the unions and workers. . . . My change of views came from readings, discussions, and our guest speaker, Adam. All three combined to change my view on unions and labor conditions and will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Andrew’s reflection on what he learned in the course and how dialogues with Adam contributed to his understanding of unions suggests the benefits of providing students with information, resources, and dialoguing opportunities that might aid them in forming their own opinions on issues. Brianna, who began the course as adamantly and vocally anti-union, also noted how important these resources were in helping her reflect on her initial labor perspective. She states,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Through readings I have learned so much. . . . My attitude has completely changed and I now support the various unions that are fighting for the rights of workers. Another aspect of the course that opened my eyes to a labor perspective of others is when Adam came to speak to the class about the USW. After hearing him speak about his personal experience, what the union is about, and who they protect, I have gained a lot of respect for union members and laborers. I am almost embarrassed about the essay I first submitted. . . . I remember writing about how I was told that union members were lazy and didn’t work as hard and how I looked at union members in a negative light. Through this course I have changed those previous opinions and attitudes and have realized what exactly a union is and what they stand for, and I have gained a better understanding and appreciation for all laborers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Brianna, who explained that class activities provided her with new information to consider in her evolving labor perspective, students who initially expressed a positive perception of unions similarly explained that the course provided them with new information and perspectives that influenced their understanding of labor topics. For instance, Kellie noted, “Not only have I enjoyed the class assignments and readings, but I also feel a lot more educated about things in the real world. . . . I now feel like I can talk confidently about unions.”</p>

<p>While dialoguing with union members allowed many students to understand pro-union perspectives, the overarching aim of this course was to offer readings, assignments, discussions, and dialoguing opportunities to aid students in articulating their own educated labor perspectives. The goal was not to change students’ attitudes in a particular way but rather to provide them with information about labor topics and unions to consider as they examined issues from multiple perspectives and formed their personal opinions. Student feedback suggests that many students found this approach particularly successful in helping them cultivate their own informed perspective on labor issues. For instance, at the end of the semester, Cale wrote, “Prior to enrolling in this course I could only view unions from the point of view the media has looked at them. Generally, I was only hearing and seeing negative connotations to these organizations. Between our reading and having Adam come in and speak with us about what they’re really working for, I was finally able to form my own opinion on the matter.” While not all students may have formed pro-union attitudes during the class, students overwhelmingly acknowledged that the course provided them with important labor perspectives to consider when developing their own positions. Specifically, Sam replied, “I came into it expecting a lack-luster 100 level general education class, but I was really able to walk away with new and powerful knowledge. This is something I will continue to carry with me and I have finally shaped my own opinion on such topics.” Likewise, Ella noted, “I also did not have my own opinion about unions at the beginning of the semester because I did not know enough information to form one. However, after taking this class, I have now been able to form my own intellectual opinion about them and I am able to join in conversations that are talking about these issues.” These student reflections suggest that the reciprocal process of writing and verbally articulating personal perspectives on labor issues and, in turn, listening and engaging with others’ viewpoints during dialogues can aid participants in forming and voicing their own informed position on labor topics.</p>
<p>Because these dialogues were occurring in the university classroom instead of, for instance, a union education program, particular attention was paid to university students’ learning. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X11429270">Freire (1970)</xref> notes, dialogues should be a cooperative endeavor that contributes to the intellectual growth of all participants. Two important union member participants, Joe and Adam, both explained that during union worker–university student dialogues, they not only were able to offer their own knowledge and experiences to students but, additionally, learned from the questions, responses, and perspectives university students shared with them. Joe reflected,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I wasn’t surprised at [students’] lack of knowledge about unions. This gap is universal in our schools. But the events transpiring today across the country concerning workers losing their right to bargain are making more people aware of unions and the loss thereof. I learned that students are beginning to question, and I was excited that they were excited. Their wonderful letters intensified my belief that hope, indeed, is alive. . . . They reinforced my belief that regardless of background people are basically good and truly concerned with justice and equality. Their words exemplified a sincere interest in something that has affected their lives and they were not even aware. That something is the Union and all the benefits enjoyed today by the blood and sweat of yesterday.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Joe felt disheartened by the loss of unions’ and workers’ rights, dialoguing with students helped restore his hope that education can provide opportunities for young people to becoming interested and excited about engaging with labor topics. Adam’s reflection iterates his similar experience. While he acknowledges that many students initially knew little about organized labor, he also recognizes the personal impact that his interactions had on their learning.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The most eye-opening thing was how little exposure to not only organized labor, but labor in general these students had. It seems that most had very little (if any) experience as a wage earner. . . . The greatest value for me was the fact that I could give them an exposure to unions that was not filtered through one of the many conservative pundits that seem to be so prolific these days. [I came] to them on their “turf” and that makes for a less threatening atmosphere. From the letters they wrote, it would appear that while I may not have created future labor activists, they may be more willing to consider both sides of the issue before making up their minds about some national or local news item.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Joe and Adam’s responses explain that the dialoguing processes helped them learn more about students’ perceptions of unions and knowledge of labor topics. Additionally, they suggest that the dialogues allowed them an important opportunity they had not previously had to share their labor knowledge and union experiences with a student audience.</p>
<p>As university students’ and union workers’ responses demonstrate, I was fortunate to have a group of participants who were all respectful to new ideas, eager to share their thoughts, and willing to engage in dialogues. I certainly attribute the meaningful implementation of critical pedagogy’s student-centered approach and decentered authority, along with CHAT’s engagement with sociohistorical contexts, to participants’ active involvement, which I believe is an important factor in determining the success of these methods. Moreover, the union members’ participation allowed us to benefit from vibrant working-class and labor voices in the classroom, as labor education and working-class pedagogy advocates. I am heartened by the fact that students and union members voiced so many successes of the dialoguing process, from helping students articulate their own personal labor perspectives to allowing union members to share their stories and knowledge with students. It has encouraged me to hone this approach by not only considering the successes of our classroom dialogues but also addressing limitations and potential areas for future improvement.</p>
<p>To improve university students’ learning experience, I would like to expand the variety of perspectives students are exposed to through the dialoging process by inviting union members from other industries, as well as nonunion workers, to participate in this process. By offering students access to a larger cross-section of unions, representing a broader variety of labor perspectives and working-class voices, students may also be able to interact with union members in occupations they plan on pursuing. This would help our course not only consider manufacturing processes but also more fully address other types of labor. To make these university classroom dialogues more worthwhile for union members, additional time during the dialogues could be set aside to discuss topics that union members consider important and want to hear students’ perspectives on. To foster union member learning, it might be beneficial to also arrange face-to-face dialogues in a union education setting, which would be more familiar to union members and underscore the importance of both university and union participants’ learning.</p>
<p>Recognizing that this model of dialoguing can be improved and revised for use in the future underscores what I see as the greatest value of this approach. Namely, the dialoguing process provides a flexible model for fostering participant-based learning, which encourages all members to engage with multiple viewpoints on labor topics to inform their own individual perspectives. This process provides a model for the practical application of research on students’ attitudes toward labor topics as well as emphasizes the importance of considering course participants’ unique perceptions and learning goals in developing classroom approaches and activities for teaching about labor. While the example of union worker–university student dialogues elaborated in this article drew on my experiences as a university instructor and USW/ICD course facilitator, the flexible dialoguing process it presents may be personalized to meet the learning goals and educational objective of multiple educational settings. Thus, for university instructors and union education facilitators, the dialoguing process offers an interactive approach for teaching about labor topics through encouraging participants to articulate their viewpoints, engage in reciprocal written and verbal exchanges, and reflect on others’ perspectives in order to enrich their own understanding of labor topics and perceptions of unions.</p>

<p>Only five out of fifty participants communicated factors other than family socialization that had shaped their strong negative or positive perceptions of unions. Both groups of individuals, those with pro- and anti-union positions, similarly attributed their strong attitudes to a mix of factors, including friends, news media, and school.</p>

<p>A 2009 Gallup poll found that public support of unions was at an all-time low, with only 48 percent of Americans approving of labor unions, representing a sharp decrease from a 59 percent approval rate the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160449X11429270">Gallup 2009</xref>). A 2011 Pew Research Center survey suggests that the public’s perception of unions has continued to sour, finding that only 45 percent of people expressed a favorable impression of unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160449X11429270">Pew Research Center 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Instructors who foster union worker–university student dialogues might encounter resistance from critics who assert that the classroom should be an ideologically neutral space and argue that introducing union voices might disrupt this neutrality. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160449X11429270">Bernard (2002</xref>, 6) points out, “there is no such thing as ‘neutral’ education. Even public educational institutions such as universities are advocates whether they admit to it or not.” Along with Barnard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160449X11429270">Linné, Sosin, and Benin (2009</xref>, 86) recognize, “There is nothing neutral about what gets taught in schools. . . . Through their influence over educational resources, corporations have been able to minimize recognition in the curriculum of labor’s ongoing centrality in the struggle for social and economic justice.” They posit that under these conditions, providing students with an organized labor perspective introduces some balance into the already pervasive corporate advocacy implicit in students’ education. Personally, my consideration of ideology in the classroom is significantly shaped by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X11429270">Berlin’s (1988</xref>, 492) assertion that “a way of teaching is never innocent. Every pedagogy is implicated in ideology, in a set of tactic assumptions about what is real, what is good, what is possible, and how power ought to be distributed.” What an instructor must do is realize, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X11429270">Berlin (1988</xref>, 489) states, that “ideology must continually be challenged so as to reveal its economic and political consequences for the individual.”</p>

<p>A significant amount of the scholarship on teaching labor studies in a university setting focuses on educating worker-students who may have full-time outside employment or students who are specifically focusing their course work in labor fields (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X11429270">Mantsios 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160449X11429270">Hertenstein 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160449X11429270">Bussel 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X11429270">Aronowitz 1990</xref>). Some labor history pedagogy addresses teaching labor topics to a more diverse student body (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160449X11429270">Barrett and Koenker 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X11429270">Green 2008</xref>). These fields of scholarship can be considered when developing teaching methods and curriculum for a general education course; however, perhaps scholarship on K-12 or youth labor education most directly addresses issues of teaching labor to a nonspecialized audience of young people. Although scholarship on K-12 labor studies curriculum may need modification for university classroom implementation, it suggests valuable resources to support general education instruction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X11429270">Green 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X11429270">Glass 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160449X11429270">AFL-CIO 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160449X11429270">California Federation of Teachers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160449X11429270">University of Iowa Labor Center 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160449X11429270">American Labor Studies Center 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Reading working-class labor literature as a method for exploring multiple perspectives on social class or different cultural orientations toward labor is also advocated by working-class scholars and labor historians. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160449X11429270">Christopher (1999</xref>, 221) offers insight into teaching working-class literature to students from multiple class backgrounds, notably stating that regardless of the student demographic or tier of the university, we can use literature to “bring discussions of social class issues, as they affect our own lives, the lives of our students and their families, and the fabric of our society, into every course in the humanities and social sciences.” Barrett and Koenker (1998, 183-84) reiterate the value of introducing literature as a tool for fostering discussions on social issues, specifically asserting that workers’ autobiographical writing and first-hand labor accounts can help instructors address the “subjective dimensions of working-class life” and shift the scope of inquiry from a general to personal context.</p>
