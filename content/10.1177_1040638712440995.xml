<abstract>
<p>Cutaneous toxoplasmosis has been previously reported in human beings, rarely reported in cats, and reported in 1 dog with systemic toxoplasmosis. The present report describes 2 cases of cutaneous toxoplasmosis in 2 dogs treated with immunosuppressive therapy. One of the dogs developed generalized cutaneous pustules and pruritus, and the other dog only had a single subcutaneous nodule. Microscopically, skin biopsies showed moderate to severe pyogranulomatous and necrotizing dermatitis and panniculitis, with multifocal vasculitis and vascular thrombosis. Single or aggregates of protozoal tachyzoites were mostly intracytoplasmic and occasionally extracellular. The etiology was confirmed in both cases by immunohistochemistry and by polymerase chain reaction assays, which were followed by nucleic acid sequencing. Both patients were treated with clindamycin. The dog with generalized lesions developed pulmonary and neurological signs and was euthanized. The dog with a single nodule recovered completely with no remission of cutaneous lesions.</p>

<body>
<p>Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the coccidian protozoa <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, which infects human beings and a wide range of domestic species. Transmission occurs by ingestion of oocysts from feline feces, ingestion of meat from an intermediate host containing cysts, or transplacentally. When ingested, the organisms penetrate the intestinal mucosa and can disseminate through other tissues. Tissue cysts are presumed to persist throughout the life of the host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref></sup> Reactivation of a latent infection caused by <italic>T. gondii</italic> is usually characterized by involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), occasionally the lungs, and infrequently other organs, and in most cases, patients that develop clinical disease frequently have concurrent immunosuppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712440995">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440995">22</xref></sup> Cutaneous manifestations of the disease have been reported in human beings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712440995">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638712440995">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712440995">17</xref></sup> and rarely reported in cats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440995">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712440995">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712440995">19</xref></sup> and only 1 report describes cutaneous infection in a dog with systemic toxoplasmosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440995">22</xref></sup> In the reported cases of cutaneous toxoplasmosis in human patients, the lesions present as erythema multiforme–like eruptions or as a nodular,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712440995">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440995">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712440995">17</xref></sup> maculopapular, papulopustular, lichenoid, or vegetative dermatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712440995">17</xref></sup> These patients can have systemic signs, including asthenia, fever, joint pain, and lymphadenopathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712440995">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638712440995">5</xref></sup> The presence of organisms in skin biopsies is observed in approximately half of the cases, and the diagnosis in the past was usually confirmed by animal inoculation or seroconversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712440995">17</xref></sup> Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and nucleic acid sequencing can be used to confirm these cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref></sup> The current report describes 2 adult dogs treated with immunosuppressive therapy that developed severe cutaneous lesions caused by <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and PCR.</p>
<p>In the first case, a 9-year-old Akita/German Shepherd Dog cross was presented with severe anemia and was clinically diagnosed with immune-mediated hemolytic disease (IMHA) and lower urinary tract infection. The dog was treated with prednisone, cyclosporine, sucralfate, and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid with successful increase and stabilization of the packed cell volume (PCV) and resolution of the urinary tract infection. After 20 days, the dog developed bloody diarrhea and was treated with metronidazole. After an additional 20 days, the dog was reevaluated clinically due to generalized and progressive cutaneous pustules and pruritus. Four skin punch biopsies were collected and submitted to the Dermatopathology Specialty Service at Texas A&amp;M University (College Station, Texas). A few days later, the patient developed respiratory distress, muscle rigidity, and neurological signs and was treated with clindamycin. Due to the poor prognosis and severity of clinical signs, the owners elected euthanasia, but necropsy was not performed.</p>
<p>Histological findings in the submitted biopsies included severe pyogranulomatous inflammation extending from the superficial dermis into the superficial subcutis composed primarily of neutrophils, macrophages, and fragments of necrotic debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712440995">Fig. 1</xref>). Multifocally, single or aggregates of 3 × 6-µm, elongated basophilic organisms with a central nuclei (tachyzoites) were mostly within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells, keratinocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts; however, scattered extracellular organisms were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712440995">Fig. 1</xref> inset). Multifocal necrosis was primarily observed around affected blood vessels with vasculitis and vascular thrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712440995">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In the second case, a 7-year-old, female, spayed Rhodesian Ridgeback was referred to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at Texas A&amp;M University (College Station, Texas) for a severe prolonged immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (IMTP), valvular endocarditis, and urinary tract infection. The patient was being treated with prednisone (10 mg/24 hr), aspirin (15 mg/24 hr), azathioprine (50 mg/48 hr), amoxicillin (800 mg/12 hr), and enrofloxacin (306 mg/24 hr) for approximately 3 weeks. The IMTP failed to respond to immunosuppressive therapy, and the prednisone dose was increased to 50 mg/day. After 4 weeks, a raised dermal nodule and plaque were observed on the left shoulder. Protozoal organisms were identified on cytologic examination of the mass. A skin punch biopsy taken from the mass and examined histologically was infiltrated with moderate to large numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, and plasma cells within the mid and deep dermis and subcutis. Occasional macrophages and scattered endothelial cells contained intracytoplasmic, 4–6 µm in diameter, round to oval basophilic tachyzoites, which were occasionally free within the interstitium. Additional findings included necrosis and edema, multifocal vasculitis, scattered venous thrombosis, and follicular and epidermal atrophy. The dog was treated with clindamycin (300 mg/12 hr), as well as the previously prescribed medications except for azathioprine, which was withdrawn due to development of hepatotoxicity. Immunoglobulin titers for trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, and neosporosis were all negative; however, convalescent serum was not tested. Short relapse of IMTP occurred after withdrawal of azathioprine; however, no recurrence of cutaneous lesions or IMTP was observed after 5 years.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> were performed in paraffin-embedded samples from case 1 and for <italic>T. gondii</italic> in case 2.

It is speculated that concomitant illness or immunosuppression may cause a host to become more susceptible to proliferation of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and development of clinical disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref></sup> Most of the cases of cutaneous toxoplasmosis described in human beings have occurred in immunosuppressed patients and occasionally as a severe complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712440995">21</xref></sup> In both dogs described in the present report, as well as in the previously described case of cutaneous toxoplasmosis in a dog,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440995">22</xref></sup> cutaneous lesions developed after the dogs received immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of IMHA or IMTP, which likely resulted in reactivation of a latent infection of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>In human patients, cutaneous lesions can present as erythema multiforme–like eruptions or as a nodular, maculopapular, papulopustular, lichenoid, or vegetative dermatitis. Those patients may have systemic signs that include asthenia, fever, joint pain, and lymphadenopathies. The clinical lesions of cutaneous toxoplasmosis in cats can present as a single cutaneous nodule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712440995">19</xref></sup> or as multiple ulcerated and nonulcerated cutaneous nodules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440995">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440995">7</xref></sup> The cutaneous lesions in the previously reported case in a dog were characterized by multiple raised, alopecic, and ulcerated nodules with some nodules exuding purulent material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440995">22</xref></sup> One of the dogs in the present report developed a generalized pustular dermatitis with significant pruritus, whereas the other affected dog only had a single cutaneous raised nodule on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Histologically, the previously described cases of cutaneous toxoplasmosis in cats and a dog were characterized by a necrotizing and granulomatous or pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis with vasculitis. Epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis can occur as well. The protozoal organisms can be single or arranged in clusters, some of which are extracellular or within the cytoplasm of follicular, epidermal, and glandular epithelial cells; macrophages; fibroblasts; and endothelial cells. The organisms are approximately 2 × 6 µm in size and have a crescent shape with a pale basophilic cytoplasm and a dark nucleus (tachyzoites).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440995">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440995">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712440995">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440995">22</xref></sup> Identification of organisms in histologic lesions can be a challenge in some cases. Even though organisms were abundant within the lesions of case 1, only scattered to rare organisms were observed within the lesions of case 2. In human patients serologically positive for antibody against <italic>T. gondii</italic> with cutaneous histologic lesions strongly suggestive of toxoplasmosis, organisms are only identified histologically in approximately 50% of the cutaneous lesions. Similar findings have also been observed in cats that have systemic toxoplasmosis with ulcerative skin lesions and vasculitis, presumed to be caused by <italic>T. gondii;</italic> however, organisms were not identified in histologic sections of affected skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440995">7</xref></sup> Also, similar histologic cutaneous lesions and morphologically similar protozoal organisms are observed in animals infected with <italic>N. caninum</italic>, making histologic differentiation between these 2 organisms virtually impossible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638712440995">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>For this reason, confirmation of clinical cases based only on histopathology of skin might be insufficient, as in numerous cases, identification of characteristic organisms can be challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440995">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440995">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712440995">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712440995">15</xref></sup> In the past, clinical diagnosis in these patients was usually confirmed by animal inoculation or seroconversion against <italic>T. gondii</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440995">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712440995">17</xref></sup> However, serologic techniques may be nonspecific and may lack sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440995">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440995">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440995">22</xref></sup> To overcome such problems, immunohistochemistry (IHC), PCR, and transmission electron microscopy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Even though IHC using polyclonal antibodies against <italic>T. gondii</italic> is considered sensitive, positive results might not be conclusive, due to moderately low specificity of polyclonal antibodies that can cross-react between <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>N. caninum</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440995">2</xref></sup> Cross-reaction was observed in case 1 of the present report; however, immunolabeling was very strong for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and very weak for <italic>N. caninum</italic>. Polymerase chain reaction is considered a more accurate technique for the diagnosis of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, being useful for early detection of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in people and animals, especially in asymptomatic cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712440995">14</xref></sup> Transmission electron microscopy can be used to detect structural differences between these 2 organisms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref></sup> but in occasional cases, these organisms can be indistinguishable due to many ultrastructural similarities shared by <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites.</p>
<p>Clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfa combination are the most commonly used drugs against toxoplasmosis in animals, and azithromycin and ponazuril are also effective to treat the infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref></sup> Clindamycin has been successfully used to treat fever, myositis, uveitis, and CNS disease in animals, even though gastrointestinal irritation can occur in some treated animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712440995">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712440995">13</xref></sup> Clinical signs not related to the CNS usually resolve within a few days after treatment, with ocular and CNS toxoplasmosis responding more slowly to therapy, although it is believed that no drug can completely clear <italic>T. gondii</italic> from the body. Unfortunately, the prognosis is usually poor in dogs and cats that develop disseminated toxoplasmosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440995">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, even though rarely described, cutaneous toxoplasmosis occurs in dogs and other species, especially if these patients are immunosuppressed. Diagnosis confirmation can be a challenge in similar cases; however, the use of proper diagnostic techniques can improve conclusive diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in animals.</p>
