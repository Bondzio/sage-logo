<abstract>
<p>We sought to compare the Eigenfactor Score™ journal rank with the journal Impact Factor over five years, and to identify variables that may influence the ranking differences between the two metrics. Datasets were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters<sup>®</sup> and Eigenfactor Score™ Web sites. Dentistry was identified as the most specific medical specialty. Variables were retrieved from the selected journals to be included in a regression linear model. Among the 46 dental journals included in the analysis, striking variations in ranks were observed according to the metric used. The Bland-Altman plot showed a poor agreement between the metrics. The multivariate analysis indicates that the number of original research articles, the number of reviews, the self-citations, and the citing time may explain the differences between ranks. The Eigenfactor Score™ seems to better capture the prestige of a journal than the Impact Factor. In medicine, the bibliometric indicators should focus not only on the overall medical field but also on specialized disciplinary fields. Distinct measures are needed to better describe the scientific impact of specialized medical publications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spread of bibliometrics in the scientific community began following the first publication of the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the proliferation of international academic rankings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512437374">Opthof, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512437374">Buela-Casal <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The Impact Factor (IF) has achieved a dominant position among scientific impact metrics. This hegemonic position is mainly due to the availability of the Thomson Reuters database, its simple definition (Appendix File 1), and the lack of accepted alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512437374">Bollen <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The popularity of the IF has led to side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512437374">Braun <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The evaluations of research teams—and even individuals—have been increasingly based on this indicator. Academic institutions often use the IF to evaluate the quality of an application for a position. The IF now tends to measure individuals (authors), universities, and even countries in terms of scientific production.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that the IF has many inherent limitations and does not capture the overall impact of scientific publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512437374">Harter and Nisonger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512437374">Seglen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512437374">The PLoS Medicine Editors, 2006</xref>). First, less than 20% of the denominator accounts for more than 50% of the numerator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512437374">Callaham <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512437374">Weale <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), <italic>i.e</italic>., in one journal, a few articles have a high citation rate, whereas the majority have a low citation rate, and some articles are never cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512437374">Rizkallah and Sin, 2010</xref>). Second, the IF counts the number of citations but does not take into account the prestige of the journal from which they are extracted. Third, it ignores the endogenous features of disciplinary fields that are less “exportable” than others. The IF is commonly used to judge the quality and the prestige of publications. In fact, it evaluates the popularity of the journal because it takes into account only the quantity of the citations. Finally, there is agreement on the imperfection of the IF as a single indicator to represent the overall scientific impact of publications and on the dangers of its overuse.</p>
<p>These shortcomings have led to the development of other instruments, still based on citation counts, aiming to best express the notion of scientific impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512437374">Bergstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Among the proposed indicators in recent years, particular attention has been paid to the Eigenfactor Score (ES), which is described in Appendix File 1. The ES is supposed to demonstrate the prestige of a journal because it takes into account the quality of the citations by assigning weights to the source of the citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512437374">Callaham <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Consequently, the ES tends to measure the scientific influence of a journal in its disciplinary field.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was: (1) to compare the IF and the ES in an endogenous, narrow, and highly specific disciplinary field, <italic>i.e</italic>., dentistry; and (2) to identify bibliometric variables that may influence the ranking differences between these two indicators.</p>

<title>Disciplinary Field Selection</title>
<p>Fifteen disciplinary fields were selected by consensus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512437374">Table</xref>). They correspond to the most common clinical specialties representative of the medical field. The field research in MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> was performed by use of the MeSH Queries given in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512437374">Table</xref>. Dentistry was found as the most endogenous disciplinary field compared with the others, with 70.5% of the dentistry articles published in dental journals. Thus, this model appeared to fit our purpose best.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Since the ES is a five-year calculation, our research time window was between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009. We retrieved the IF from the electronic <italic>Journal Citation Reports</italic><sup>®</sup> 2009. For the ES, data were retrieved by the same procedure. Two independent reviewers (AS, SK) abstracted IF and ES data on these journals; any disagreements were resolved by consensus. The following variables were retrieved from the selected journals: the total number of five-year articles published in a journal, the number of original research articles, the number of reviews, the number of other items (editorials, letters to the editor, notes), the cited time (half-life of the citations, <italic>i.e</italic>., the period at which the article has collected 50% of the citations that it may receive), the citing time (mean age of the references), the citable items (sum of original research articles and reviews), the percentage of self-citations, the country of publication, and the number of issues published <italic>per</italic> year. The target audience was identified by consensus according to the content of the journal (general dentistry or dental specialty). The data analysis is detailed in Appendix File 2.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Appendix Table 1 lists the characteristics of the 46 selected dental journals included in the analysis. The journals are sorted according to their ranking differences. Striking positive or negative variations are observed, showing a gain of up to 22 places and a loss of up to 29 places for some journals according to the metric used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512437374">Fig. 1</xref> details these variations. It shows the IF and ES values, and the journal ranking comparisons. Only four journals (9%) had the same ES and IF ranking. While the <italic>Journal of Dental Research</italic> (IF = 4.2; ES = 0.02408) retains the top spot whatever the metric, the Fig. illustrates some drastic changes in the ordering. For instance, <italic>Periodontology 2000</italic> is the # 3 journal in terms of IF (IF = 3.9) and drops to 32nd place when the ES is used (ES = 0.00393). In contrast, the <italic>Journal of Periodontology</italic>, the #14 IF journal (IF = 2.5) moves up to 2nd place for the ES journals (ES = 0.01829). In the same vein, the <italic>Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery</italic>, the #25 IF journal (IF = 1.9), gains 22 places in the ranking when the ES is used (#3; ES = 0.01634).</p>

<p>The multivariate analysis identifies 5 independent variables significantly associated with the difference between IF and ES rankings. Appendix Table 2 indicates that as the number of original research articles grows in a journal, the ES ranking of this journal increases compared with the IF ranking (p ≤ 0.003). Similarly, as the number of other items increases, the ES ranking increases (p = 0.03). In contrast, the ES ranking decreases (<italic>i.e</italic>., the IF ranking increases) as the number of review articles (p = 0.03) and the percentage of self-citations (p = 0.04) of the journal increase. The ES ranking also moves down when the mean age of the references of the journal (citing time) increases (p = 0.04). In the covariates, the median of the citing time was 8.4 yr.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study shows striking differences between IF and ES rankings. Comparing IF and ES values resulted in large changes in the ordinal rank of the selected journals, larger than in the databases previously used by others to compare various measures of scientific impact in the medical field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512437374">Bordons <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512437374">Falagas <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512437374">West <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The previous studies specifically comparing the IF and the ES showed that these indicators can produce dissimilar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512437374">Bollen <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512437374">Rizkallah and Sin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512437374">West <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The difference between the two metrics is greater in the present study than in these previous studies. We selected dentistry because the nodosity is stronger than in more heterogeneous fields (see Appendix File 1). In short, articles about dentistry are most often quoted in dental journals than in journals outside the disciplinary field. Thus, the endogeneity of the model reinforces the difference between IF and ES rankings. So far, the analyzed databases included a selection of highly ranked scientific and/or clinical medical journals according to the IF. The increase in the differences between the metrics may be explained not only by the fact that we used the most endogenous discipline in the medical field, <italic>i.e</italic>., the dental specialty, but also by the mean difference of the overall values of the metrics between the journals selected in the databases. Important differences in IF and ES between medical journals and dental journals are observed. For example, the IF of the medical journal leader <italic>The New England Journal of Medicine</italic> is 51.410 with an ES of 0.67236, whereas the corresponding values of the dental journal leader the <italic>Journal of Dental Research</italic> are 4.2 and 0.02408, respectively. The present outcomes indicate that the conclusions of the comparative studies may differ according to whether they deal with the overall medical field or a medical specialty, the ability of the specialty to spread information beyond its disciplinary field (endogenous or exogenous), the mean IF value of the specialty (high or low), and the target audience (general journals in the medical specialty or sub-specialty medical journals).</p>
<p>The multivariate analysis shows that the difference between ES and IF significantly increases with the number of original research articles (Appendix Table 2). The ES significantly decreases as the number of reviews and the percentage of self-citations increase. In addition, the ES decreases as the citing time increases. These data are consistent with the opinion that the ES captures the prestige of a journal better than does the IF. Original research papers are the very elements upon which medical practice is based; they fuel the pipeline of scientific knowledge and the content of review articles. They are the cornerstone of important breakthroughs in clinical practice. Review papers receive on average twice as many citations as original articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512437374">Weale <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512437374">Marashi, 2005</xref>). By reducing the number of original research articles and increasing the number of review articles to increase their IF, medical journals may reduce the overall scientific contribution and possibly lead to the impoverishment of medical knowledge. In addition, self-citations commonly used to increase the IF artificially inflate the popularity of a journal, keeping in mind that prestige cannot be transferred by the journal itself but by all other journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512437374">Fassoulaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512437374">Miguel and Marti-Bonmati, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512437374">Falagas and Kavvadia, 2006</xref>). Finally, one can assume that the mean age of the references of a journal reflects its potential to capture the current medical knowledge. Interestingly, the ES also increases with the number of ‘other’ items. This can be interpreted as the ability of high-ES journals to have higher readership and influence on their field than high-IF journals.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the ES with the IF in a specialized medical field. The current metrics measure the journal’s total influence and prestige at the overall medical community level and do not take into account the importance of the journal in the very specialized medical fields where it is published. Therefore, the impact of a journal may be completely different according to target audience and the size or influence of the disciplinary field. Some papers may lead to an important breakthrough in a specialized medical field, whereas, at the general medical level, their visibility remains poor. Second, to our knowledge, no study has explored the influence of independent variables explaining the differences between the IF and the ES. Analysis of our data tends to validate the ES as a surrogate for the prestige of a journal. Third, our analysis is robust because it is based on five-year data. Interestingly, in the dental field, the number of citations is highest in the first five years after publication, and then it decreases. Thus, it may be assumed that we captured the best ‘picture’ of the publications in this field. We concentrated our efforts on the ES because it is a weighting system. ES is an attempt to capture the ‘‘influence’’ of medical journals on the scientific content generated in their respective fields. In addition, it has been suggested that citations from fields that receive low IF are ranked higher with the ES relative to IF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512437374">West <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Indeed, an article published in a prestigious but specialized journal with a small community is supposed to be of better quality than an article published in a more generalist journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512437374">Falagas <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). By using dentistry as a model, we could highlight the role of the ES in well-defined fields of research, in contrast to other medical specialties such as “Medicine, internal and general” or “Oncology”. The dental model may avoid some bias such as citing practice by a specific community or time-shifting in citations that have been shown to influence the IF value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512437374">Weale <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Bibliometric indicators other than the ES are available and could have been compared. To assess a time-framed comparison, we eliminated the SCImago Journal Rank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scimagojr.com/index.php">http://www.scimagojr.com/index.php</ext-link>), which is calculated over three years. The Article Influence Score (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/methods.pdf">http://www.eigenfactor.org/methods.pdf</ext-link>) was also excluded, because it has been shown to produce a rank order of journals similar to the IF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512437374">Rizkallah and Sin, 2010</xref>). In addition, variables such as the free availability of the journal, open access on the Web, the duration of the review and publication process, how the journal is advertised, and the redesign of journals within the 5-year time span of the study were not included in the analysis. Some of these variables are not available in the dental field. Our selection, based on diseases, may not reflect the overall impact of the dental articles on the scientific literature. However, a selection based on “medical systems” is not appropriate for the present purpose, because it leads to a non-specific approach of the disciplinary fields. Finally, the reader should keep in mind that the 30% of dental studies not appearing in dental journals may, in fact, be more influential on research or the practice of dentistry than the content of the journals included in the analysis.</p>
<p>Our study suggests that to define a better approach to assessing the impact of a journal within and outside of a disciplinary field, two or more distinct measures are required. Further comparative studies dealing with various medical specialties should improve the interpretation of the bibliometric indicators and explore the combined effect of these indicators on specialized disciplinary fields.</p>
