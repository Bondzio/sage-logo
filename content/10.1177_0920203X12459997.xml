<p>Guided by painstaking attentiveness to details and robust scholarship, Yomi Braester’s book analyses how the Chinese city has come to play a key role in the building of the nation-state since 1949. It presents a unique, timely and superb history of urban change in China, documenting how a rhetoric of the new has been haunting the Chinese city and at what cost. Braester presents this history through the lens of theatre and cinema, taking these not as mere representations, but equally as active agents, of urban change. As such, the book is particularly valuable in underlining the intricate connections between visual culture and history.</p>
<p>The book takes as its central theoretical premises both the notion of urban contract from Manuel Castells and Jordi Norja as well as Mikhael Bakhtin’s idea of the chronotope, a term that refers to ‘the imaginary place and time frames that forge fictional realms’ (p. 18). Film and theatre, according to Braester, help to forge a social contract for the city, in the sense that they are part and parcel of the construction of the city – no less than other urban agents such as the government, real estate developers and residents. For Braester, ‘The filmic event is predicated on political, economic and ideological forces that channel cinematic production and predispose the audience. The influence of the cinema derives not so much from any intrinsic force of the moving image as from mediating among these external sources of power’ (p. 5). Throughout the book, the author weaves narratives of urban policies, real estate developers, global architects and residents with readings of 150 plays and films. In doing so, he consistently and convincingly steers away from a more conventional form of textual analysis towards a far more nuanced, contextualized and grounded understanding of what has been going on in the Chinese city and Chinese cinema and theatre.</p>
<p>For example, Braester demonstrates how different versions of Lao She’s <italic>Dragon Whisker Creek</italic> (<italic>龙须沟</italic>) mobilized a prescriptive chronotope in the early 1950s, presenting a utopian and ideal version of the future. Since the 1980s, the same text inspired more than a dozen plays, mostly performed in courtyard houses, often supporting the new policies of the Deng government and validating the construction of a new and prosperous Beijing through the chronotope not so much of utopia as of instantaneity. Similarly, the trope of Tiananmen Square serves multiple ends, from serving as a site of perpetual revolution to being reclaimed in documentaries such as Zhang Yuan’s <italic>The Square</italic> (广场) (1994) as a place of leisure and fun. A chapter on Taipei (while provoking the obvious question of why no other Chinese cities on the fringes such as Hong Kong, Chengdu, Ürümqi and so forth) serves as a welcome interlude, guiding the reader towards a different context, where more space for resistant voices operates in a paradoxically similar hegemonic vein: a greening of the city of Taipei is imposed at the expense of the veteran villages.</p>
<p>The final chapter of the book is devoted to the more critical and preservationist urban cinema of the 1990s and 2000s and concludes with an analysis of the Beijing Olympics as being dominated by the forces of transnational capital and its related booming real estate market. In promoting the Olympics, references were made by the political powers to a New Beijing, but then again, often at the expense of the very city and its inhabitants they were said to serve. While signature architectural projects were built by migrant workers, their only option to leave the real world might be a trip to a theme park, as shown in Jia Zhangke’s <italic>The World</italic> (世界) (2004). Gradually, in what Braester calls the post-spatial chronotope, a virtual reality takes over the imagination of the city and actual spaces seem to disappear. However, one wonders, especially after reading the gripping spatial inequality and inhumanity experienced by the migrant workers in <italic>The World</italic>, whether the Chinese city and its inhabitants are entering this post-spatial epoch en masse. It is, in my view, precisely this possibility of contestation that drives Braester to end his fascinating overview with the candid observation that the urban contract remains an unfinished project.</p>
<p>So is, of course, the project of writing up a history or histories of Chinese city and Chinese cinema. Braester’s book is, in any case, an admirable leap forward in documenting and analysing the on- and off-screen, cinematic and ethnographic, primarily and secondarily sourced, details surrounding the making of this contract over the past 60 years. Especially laudable is his great enthusiasm and respect for the works and the playwrights, filmmakers and artists. He analyses plays and films that were part of the state propaganda effort (itself a relatively neglected area of scholarship) in the same attentive manner as he does the critical independent cinema, moving beyond a simplistic framework in which state oppression meets with heroic dissent. At the same time, the book expresses the author’s sincere affinity with the city and its histories in its conscientious critique on processes of destruction and demolition.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a must read for anyone interested in China’s urban and cinematographic histories. It has achieved the formidable task of linking representations of urban change to actual changes of the city, and it convincingly shows the importance of visual culture as one facilitator of such changes.</p>
