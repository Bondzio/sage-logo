<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Western Europe, as in most other areas of the world, HIV/AIDS is a communicable disease of major public health importance. Over 850,000 persons live with HIV/AIDS, an incurable infection that requires costly lifelong treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483216">1</xref>]. Furthermore, 30 years into the HIV epidemic, strategies for control of its spread remain elusive. HIV testing, however, has become a cornerstone of prevention, recommended by the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813483216">2</xref>], and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483216">3</xref>]. This advice responds to evidence showing that early diagnosis and treatment can greatly decrease not only morbidity for the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483216">4</xref>] but also the probability of forward transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813483216">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813483216">6</xref>], reinforcing the promotion of early HIV detection as an important public health priority.</p>
<p>Aligned with HIV testing recommendations, a variety of prevention interventions that depend on a high level and frequency of HIV testing have emerged, including viral load suppression through antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813483216">5</xref>], pre-exposure prophylaxis, seroconcordant partner selection, and prevention with positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813483216">7</xref>]. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that men who have sex with men (MSM) – the population most severely affected by HIV in Western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813483216">8</xref>] – modify their sexual behaviour when they are diagnosed HIV positive to diminish risks to their sexual partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813483216">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813483216"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813483216">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, large numbers of people remain unaware of their infection, thus, they can neither benefit from ART nor take steps to reduce the risk of infecting others. In the last few decades, existing evidence points to high rates of undiagnosed individuals and late diagnosis across Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813483216">12</xref>], with an estimated 35% undiagnosed persons in Western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483216">1</xref>]. Further, a 2008 survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813483216">13</xref>] showed that many countries in Western Europe suffer from poor knowledge of testing behaviour among populations at highest risk of HIV infection, such as MSM.</p>
<p>In Norway, routine HIV testing in specific healthcare settings is used, especially for patients presenting to clinics for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnant women, and arriving migrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813483216">13</xref>]. Additionally, HIV testing guidelines from 2005 advise that general practitioners (GPs) annually test MSM for HIV and STIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813483216">14</xref>]. In fact, one of the four objectives of the national HIV strategy is early detection of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813483216">15</xref>]. However, there are no empirical data on the factors associated with HIV testing among MSM in Norway and their prevalence. In fact, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is only one previous large-scale study regarding Norwegian MSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813483216">16</xref>] and there are no studies in any Nordic country that examine the predictors of HIV testing among this population. This is an inopportune evidence gap given, first, reports of increasing HIV prevalence among MSM in Western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813483216">8</xref>] – Norway has experienced a tripling of the number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813483216">17</xref>] – and second, the associated sexual risk behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813483216">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813483216">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Understanding factors related to HIV testing is critical for establishing testing needs, informing prevention efforts on ways to increase testing, guiding testing policies, and as noted by Mounier-Jack and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813483216">13</xref>], for learning about potential shortcomings in testing strategies and enabling the directing of resources to undiagnosed populations. Thus, the present research aimed to identify the levels of and factors associated with never receiving an HIV test result, with the overarching aim to guide tailored interventions to promote early detection of HIV infection among MSM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494813483216" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The research is part of a larger study, EMIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813483216">20</xref>], in which the broad aim was to improve HIV prevention interventions for MSM. From June through August 2012, MSM were invited to participate in a study of HIV testing, sexual HIV/STI exposure, prevention needs, perceptions of intervention accessibility and performance, and HIV stigma. Banner and pop-up advertisements on the gay-oriented websites Gaydar, Qruiser, Gay Romeo, Gaysir (dating sites), and Gay and Lesbian Health Norway (information site) invited potential participants who lived in Norway to complete a survey. A study website detailed the research and eligible participants were routed to the survey questions when they declared they had read and understood the aim of the study, was a man who have sex with men and/or feel attracted to men, and were legally of age to have consensual sex with men. The survey was completely anonymous as no trace files were installed or IP addresses saved. Respondents received no recompense for their participation. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the human subjects ethical committee of the University of Portsmouth, UK.</p>
<p>The self-administered, computerised structured survey was tailored using intra-survey filters, which depended on the respondent’s answer to previous questions, and took about 20 minutes to complete. It consisted of approximately 280 questions, the large majority of which had Likert-scale, frequency scale, or dichotomous response categories. For the purposes of this research, the following factors were assessed:</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494813483216">
<title>HIV testing history</title>
<p>HIV testing, the criterion variable for the present investigation, was self-reported by the participants in response to the question “Have you ever received an HIV test result?” to which the respondents could answer “No, I have never received an HIV test result”, “Yes, I’ve tested positive (I have HIV infection)”, or “Yes, my last test was negative (I did not have HIV infection at the time of the test)”. Individuals who had received an HIV result were asked how long ago it was, where they had the test, and their level of satisfaction with the testing service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813483216">
<title>Socio-demographics</title>
<p>Participants reported their age, education, size of settlement, sexual self-identification, degree of being out as gay, and whether they were currently in a steady relationship and the length of the relationship. For the multivariate analyses, education was dichotomised as low (International Standardised Classification of Educational Degrees (ISCED) 1–4) and high (ISCED 5–6).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813483216">
<title>Cognitive factors</title>
<p>Internalised homonegativity was measured with the cross-culturally validated Reactions to Homosexuality scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813483216">21</xref>] where the score range is 0–6 and a higher score means greater homonegative internalisation. The research team computed HIV knowledge from 16 statements about HIV transmission, testing, and treatment. A higher score indicated higher knowledge (range 0–16). Participants also reported their confidence in getting an HIV test and an STI test if they wanted one, as well as whether they believed HIV testing and STI testing was free or affordable in Norway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494813483216">
<title>Behavioural variables</title>
<p>Respondents were asked whether they had ever taken an STI test. They were asked to report whether they in the past year had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with non-steady and steady male partners, had engaged in sex abroad (with someone who was not from Norway), visited a gay social venue, and visited a sex related venue. The question “When was the last time you saw or heard any information about HIV or STIs specifically for men who have sex with men” was dichotomised as those who had been exposed to HIV/STI information in the past year and those who had not (more than 1 year ago or never). With regards to drug use, participants reported whether they had used party drugs (e.g. ecstacy, amphetamines) in the past year, and Viagra and poppers in the past month. They were asked about daily alcohol use. History of STIs was also assessed. Participants were asked whether they had been diagnosed with any STIs by a healthcare provider in the past year.</p>
<p>Analyses were restricted to MSM who reported never testing HIV positive, in line with similar research (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813483216">22</xref>]). The framework of the analysis was to characterise MSM according to one main outcome: those who had never tested for HIV. To this end, individuals who had never been tested for HIV were compared with those who had ever been tested. Descriptive statistics with regards to aspects of HIV testing among those respondents who had ever tested were also obtained. The association between never testing for HIV and relevant predictor factors was first estimated with odds ratios (OR) in bivariate analyses. Next, multivariate logistic regression analyses included variables that were significant in bivariate analysis (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), that were considered <italic>a priori</italic> theoretically relevant characteristics of testing or potential confounders. The enter method with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used and the final multivariate model had no evidence of multicollinearity. The pseudo-<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> explained variance coefficient, along with the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit χ<sup>2</sup> statistic are reported. All analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 software. A <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was deemed as statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="section7-1403494813483216" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>At the end of the 12-week study recruitment period, 2164 respondents who lived in Norway had submitted answers. There were 68 ineligible respondents, 72 who reported testing positive, and 13 who skipped the HIV testing question, which left an analytic sample of 2011 MSM for the present analysis of factors linked with never testing for HIV. The great majority of the sample was recruited from Gaysir (81.5%) and Gay Romeo (11.6%).</p>
<p>Results showed that 64.7% (<italic>n</italic>=1301) stated their last HIV test was negative and 35.3% (<italic>n</italic>=710) had never received an HIV test result. Sample characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813483216">Table I</xref>. The median age of the total sample was 31, the majority self-identified as gay (82%) or bisexual (11%), and 62% reported that they were single. In this national sample, each of the 19 administrative regions (counties) of Norway was represented, but about 40% of the respondents lived in the county of Oslo (data not shown). This is reflected in respondents’ size of place of residence, with 40.5% residing in a large city (≥500,000 inhabitants) although 13.0% lived in a city of less than 10,000 people. The majority of the sample (63.1%) had an advanced education and was employed full- or part-time (67.4%).</p>

<p>With regards to aspects with HIV testing among those 1301 MSM who had ever tested, 60.1% had tested within the last year, but for 9.4% it was more than 5 years ago. A general practitioner or family doctor was the most frequently used place for testing – reported by 46.0% of the analytic sample – followed by HIV testing service (26.7%) and a hospital or clinic as an out-patient (13.3%). Close to three quarters (72.2%) of respondents who had ever tested negative for HIV and had an opportunity to talk about the sex they had, talked about the sex they had, and thereof, almost all (95.6%) talked about the sex they had with men. Regarding satisfaction with the last HIV test situation, the absolute majority was very satisfied or satisfied with the way the testing services kept their confidentiality (85.1%) and the respect with which they were treated (86.9%). While a third (32.6%) did not receive any counselling, 46.4% of the remainder who did receive counselling were very satisfied or satisfied with it, and 5.3% were very dissatisfied or dissatisfied.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To further our understanding of HIV testing among MSM, this paper identifies the predictive dimensions of HIV testing and experiences with the most recent HIV testing situation among a national online sample of MSM in Norway. According to the results of the present research, several of the aforementioned prevention approaches, which are reliant on knowledge of positive serostatus, would have limited impact in Norway given the low level of testing. Despite high rates of unprotected sexual behaviours – 69.3% had engaged in UAI in the past year – more than a third of the sample had never tested for HIV. For comparison, the never testing figures among MSM in Denmark and Sweden are estimated to 23 and 20%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813483216">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813483216">24</xref>]. These data raise concerns, first about a possible delay in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV in Norway, and second about secondary transmissions. It is estimated that the rate of HIV transmission is 3.5 times higher from persons who are unaware of their infection than those who are aware [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813483216">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The low rate of HIV testing, along with never testing for STI emerging as an independent predictor of never testing for HIV, suggests limitations with current HIV testing guidelines that advise GPs to annually test MSM for HIV and STIs. Among those who had ever tested, 40% had tested more than a year ago. The results point to a need for additional public health resources and prevention marketing efforts to be directed towards increasing GP’s and MSM’ awareness of the importance of testing and early detection of HIV (and STIs). As suggested by also others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813483216">25</xref>], HIV testing initiatives in general, perhaps mass media campaigns in particular, may contribute to increased awareness of HIV and pro-testing social norms. Modelling research has demonstrated that increases in HIV testing rates would, in contrast to increasing treatment in those in primary HIV infection, “have substantial epidemiological consequences” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813483216">26</xref> p.19]. These [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813483216">26</xref>] and other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813483216">22</xref>] findings suggested that increases in coverage and frequency of testing for HIV could be a highly effective public health intervention. It is worth noting that late diagnosis has grave economic implications, notably for health services and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813483216">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813483216">28</xref>].</p>
<p>The present findings identify additional priority groups for targeted promotional messages and outreach testing, including younger, closeted MSM and those with lower education. In concert with findings from USA and Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813483216">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813483216">24</xref>], younger age was associated with never testing. It is possible that younger MSM are less likely to have taken an HIV test relative to their older counterparts by virtue of lifetime opportunities to get a test. Moreover, not only younger but also more closeted MSM may also have had fewer chances to attain HIV prevention messages through traditional sources such as gay-oriented community information resources and contact with health personnel, which may have encouraged testing. Given the documented HIV risk in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813483216">19</xref>], a greater public health response is needed to address gaps in testing in this population. Related, despite the existing national HIV strategy and testing guidelines for MSM and free HIV testing in multiple locations across the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813483216">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813483216">15</xref>], not believing that HIV testing is free in Norway and having low HIV transmission and testing knowledge were independent predictors of never testing for HIV. These results demonstrate that there is preventive value in scaling-up targeted awareness-raising efforts to reduce testing delay, as well as routine pro-active HIV testing, which has been successful in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813483216">29</xref>].</p>
<p>On the positive side, not only did the results identify factors associated with never testing among MSM that are amenable to interventions, HIV testing was associated with having sex abroad. The latter result suggests that for men who travel abroad for sex, HIV testing may be part of a reasoned decision-making process. Whether testing is a deliberate harm reduction strategy to lessen the risk of HIV transmission when having sex outside of Norway is a question for future research, and regardless, recommendations for regular HIV testing to MSM at increased risk of infection should be continued. Recall, there was no significant difference in testing between men who engaged in UAI and men who did not. Not just routine testing, but efficient testing, that is, testing shortly after having engaged in unsafe sex with a high risk of HIV or STI transmission, is needed. Related, additional positive findings of the study were that most MSM tested at their GP’s office, in accordance with guidelines, and that the great majority is satisfied with the testing situation. Thus, whatever barriers to HIV testing exist, they are unlikely to be related to aspects of confidentiality, respect or counselling provided, but further research is warranted. It would be important to ascertain what are the specific determinants of test utilisation, including whether they are affected by the provider, HIV testing policies, or the general healthcare system.</p>
<p>Some limitations and potential biases of this study should be considered when evaluating the results. Although MSM from all areas of the country participated, geographic representation was not equally distributed. Recruitment was through gay-oriented websites and the study may not be representative of Norwegian MSM, in particular MSM who do not frequent gay internet networking sites or volunteer for HIV-related research, but the sample of gay-related website users represents a large and important population within Norway. Given HIV testing was part of the study design, participants may be biased by the same factors that prevent some MSM from seeking testing. However, evaluations show that MSM readily volunteer their HIV testing behaviours and do not consider such questions intrusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813483216">30</xref>]. The results may have been affected by social desirability and recall bias, and the causality of reported associations cannot be determined since the survey was cross-sectional. Lastly, we did not directly ask about men’s reasons for not testing. The motivation behind HIV testing is likely complex, but a 2011 systematic review of qualitative evidence on HIV testing among MSM in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813483216">30</xref>] showed that the leading reasons for not testing were denial of risk, anxiety linked to the consequences of a potential positive test, fear of having to potentially face difficult decisions and responsibilities, and HIV stigma. The review did not include any studies from Norway or a Nordic country, so whether the review’s identified reasons are true for MSM in this socio-political context is a question for further study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study is noteworthy because of its relatively large sample size, use of multivariate analyses, and for being one of the first studies in any Nordic country to explore factors associated with never testing for HIV among MSM. Research into this issue is important because knowledge of factors associated with never HIV testing is a prerequisite for evidence-based strategies towards strengthening HIV prevention and public health. The findings document low rates of HIV testing and demonstrate that more effective STI- and HIV testing approaches are needed, such as targeted awareness-raising regarding testing.</p>
