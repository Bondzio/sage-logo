<abstract>
<p>Social scientists have conducted numerous studies on college students’ binge drinking behavior. They have not, however, conducted any systematic studies of nondrinkers on college campuses. Our study focuses on the everyday experiences of nondrinking undergraduates who stay “dry” while living on “wet” campuses. We use the symbolic interactionist notions of identity work and deviance to show how nondrinkers employ a variety of stigma management strategies to avoid being labeled deviant. These strategies include the procurement of drinking props, fictive storytelling, alteration of personal appearance, concealment, disclosure, and capitulation. We extend the sociological study of identity work and deviance by documenting how nondrinkers experience and manage stigma and negotiate positive social and personal identities. Moreover, we apply the concepts of “negative deviants,” “rate busters,” and “positive deviants” to delineate how nondrinkers are viewed by different audiences on a “wet” campus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>University drinking culture has been a widely studied social phenomenon. The extant literature has focused on the sociodemographic characteristics of college student drinkers, the rates of binge drinking, the reasons for this behavior, and its negative consequences. A variety of studies have documented the ubiquitous nature and prevalence of college binge drinking behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241612458954">Dimeff et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241612458954">Goodhart et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891241612458954">Naimi et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0891241612458954">Young et al. 2005</xref>). Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al.’s (1994)</xref> original definition of “binge” drinking (five alcoholic drinks in a row for males, four drinks for females at least once in a two-week period) public health officials and social scientists have reported relatively stable rates of binge drinking among college students. These rates have ranged between 40 and 45 percent from 1993 to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891241612458954">Mitka 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0891241612458954">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0891241612458954">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This research has focused on the sociodemographic variables of gender, race, and membership in fraternities and sororities. Male college students are more likely to binge drink than their female counterparts (49 vs. 41 percent) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241612458954">Capraro 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241612458954">Peralta et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al. 2002</xref>). Minority students report using alcohol far less often than whites (50 percent white, 34 percent Latino/Latina, 22 percent African American) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241612458954">Chen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al. 2002</xref>) and possess different alcohol-related problems than do Caucasians (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241612458954">Peralta and Steele 2009</xref>). Members of Greek organizations are significantly more likely to engage in binge drinking than students not involved in these groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612458954">Cashin, Presley, and Meilman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241612458954">Durkin, Wolfe, and Clark 2005</xref>), although non-Greek students are closing the gap.</p>
<p>A large number of studies have examined the negative consequences associated with excessive drinking among college students. These consequences include drunk driving, car accidents (sometimes resulting in fatalities), problems with the legal system (e.g., disorderly conduct, vandalism, DUIs [Driving Under the Influence citations], MIPs [Minor in Possession citations]), injuries requiring emergency medical services and hospitalization, and even death from alcohol poisoning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241612458954">Bergen, Shults, and Rodd 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241612458954">Califano 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891241612458954">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891241612458954">Wechsler et al. 1994</xref>). In addition, researchers have documented increased rates of physical violence associated with binge drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241612458954">Dowdall 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891241612458954">Wechsler and Wuethrich 2002</xref>). Moreover, social scientists have reported the negative effects of heavy alcohol consumption on academic performance. College students who engage in excessive drinking/partying behavior are significantly more likely to skip classes, not complete assignments, and miss exams, leading to lower course grades and overall grade point averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241612458954">Mustaine and Tewksbury 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0891241612458954">Wood, Sher, and McGowan 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The existing literature has also documented that binge drinking increases the risk of sexual victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241612458954">Abbey 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241612458954">Howard, Griffin, and Boekeloo 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241612458954">LaBrie et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241612458954">Maggs, Williams, and Lee 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891241612458954">McCauley, Calhoun, and Gidycz 2010</xref>), unsafe sexual behaviors among females (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241612458954">Piombo and Piles 1996</xref>), the contraction of sexually transmitted diseases, and/or unwanted pregnancy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0891241612458954">Randolph et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891241612458954">Wechsler and Wuethrich 2002</xref>). Moreover, studies have also focused on patterns of drinking behavior and its consequences in terms of the “hook up culture” and casual sexual encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241612458954">Heldman and Wade 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0891241612458954">Wells et al. 2010</xref>). Along these lines, two notable studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241612458954">Bogle (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0891241612458954">Vander Ven (2011)</xref> found that drinking and hooking up are intertwined. On the one hand, drinking reduces sexual inhibitions, making it more likely for some students to engage in sexual activities that they would not have otherwise participated in when sober. These researchers report that while some students (especially females) regretted hooking up while intoxicated, others defined the experience of hooking up as a positive benefit of binge drinking.</p>
<p>While the above studies report negative and mixed consequences of drinking, other studies report certain benefits from fully participating in the college party scene. These benefits include stress management, recreational use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241612458954">Green et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241612458954">Martens, Cox, and Beck 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0891241612458954">Zucker and Landry 2007</xref>), and the intense camaraderie achieved through drinking activities, games, and rituals carried out in college fraternities and sororities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241612458954">Aldridge 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612458954">Cashin, Presley, and Meilman 1998</xref>). These same benefits are also reported by student athletes who drink heavily (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241612458954">Ford 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241612458954">Nelson and Wechsler 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891241612458954">Tewksbury, Higgins, and Mustaine 2008</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0891241612458954">Vander Ven (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241612458954">Gilles, Turk, and Fresco (2006)</xref> report that some of the major reasons that many college students “get wasted” is because it is relaxing, fun, an effective stress reliever, and makes them more social because it helps to overcome shyness.</p>
<p>Despite the extensive body of literature that has addressed the negative and positive consequences or reasons for heavy drinking, researchers have focused minimal attention on nondrinkers and how they <italic>coexist</italic> with drinkers on a “wet campus.” Given the potential positive benefits that drinkers cite for drinking discussed above, it is important to examine why and how some students on wet campuses accomplish sobriety. The few studies that have dealt with nondrinkers are quantitative in nature, and they have either focused on abstinence or nondrinking in terms of recovering alcoholics or on adult abstainers <italic>in the larger population</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241612458954">Lucas et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0891241612458954">Powers and Young 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241612458954">Schuckit and Smith 2010</xref>). These studies do not provide data on nondrinking students’ descriptions of their motives and behaviors. That is, the studies have overlooked nondrinking students’ <italic>definitions of the situation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0891241612458954">Thomas 1937</xref>) and <italic>constructions of reality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241612458954">Berger and Luckmann 1966</xref>). Quantitative studies are unable to capture the voices or subjective experiences of college nondrinkers and the unfolding of social processes that are so crucial to understanding their social worlds. Our research attempts to fill this gap in the literature. Guided by a symbolic interactionist approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241612458954">Blumer 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612458954">Cooley 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241612458954">Mead 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0891241612458954">Stryker 1980</xref>), we use qualitative methods to document the social experiences of nondrinkers from their subjective perspectives. This approach allows us to understand their motivations for not drinking while living in a social environment where drinking is the norm, their moral experience of stigma, and the strategies they employ to develop and maintain positive identities on a “wet” campus where they are defined as deviant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891241612458954">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson’s (1987)</xref> interactionist-inspired model of the formation, maintenance, and transformation of personal and social identities. These scholars define social identities as those that are “attributed or imputed to others in an attempt to place or situate them as social objects . . . based primarily on information gleaned [from] appearance, behavior, and the location and time of action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>, 1347). By contrast, they conceive of personal identities as “self-designations and self-attributions brought into play or asserted during the course of interaction” (1347). Social identities can be different than personal identities or they can be aligned. In contrast to these two variants of identity, the “self-concept” refers to a person’s overarching view of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241612458954">Gecas 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241612458954">Gecas and Schwalbe 1983</xref>). “Identity work” refers to the activities individuals engage in to create, present or sustain personal identities that are congruent with the self-concept. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson (1987</xref>, 1348), identity work involves four activities: (1) the arrangement of physical settings and props; (2) cosmetic face work or the arrangement of personal appearance; (3) selective association with other people or social groups; and (4) identity talk that includes “fictive story-telling,” “distancing,” and “embracement.” In this article, we illustrate how nondrinking college students use these four activities plus four additional strategies of stigma management, passing/concealment, preventive disclosure, therapeutic disclosure, and capitulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>) to maintain positive identities.</p>
<p>In addition, in our article, we apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612458954">Heckert and Heckert’s (2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612458954">2004</xref>, 210) typology of deviance to explain the nondrinking behavior of the college students interviewed in this study. This typology includes four key categories: (1) <italic>negative deviance</italic> that refers to nonconformity or underconformity that is negatively evaluated; (2) <italic>rate busting</italic> that refers to behavior that is overconformist in nature, yet still negatively evaluated; (3) <italic>deviance admirations</italic> that refers to underconformity or nonconformity that is positively evaluated; and (4) <italic>positive deviance</italic> that refers to overconformity that is positively evaluated. Not surprisingly, these types of conformity and subsequent reactions depend on the social context and relevant audience who differentially react to the same behavior. Our research shows that nondrinking college students, depending on the audience, can be defined as “negative deviants,” “rate busters,” and “positive deviants.” The major questions that we explore in this study are: What is it like to be a nondrinking college student on a “wet” campus? Why do these individuals choose not to drink at college (their reasons and motivations)? How are they evaluated by other students for not drinking in various on- and off-campus social situations? If negatively evaluated, how do nondrinkers respond? What identity work is used by these students?</p>

<title>Setting and Methods</title>
<p>In our study, we define nondrinkers as either students who have never drank alcohol (“<italic>abstainers</italic>”) or as those who once drank alcohol but chose not to so do anymore (“<italic>desistors</italic>”). These two social categories are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0891241612458954">Vander Ven’s (2011</xref>, 153–64) typology of nondrinkers. Approximately 75 percent of our respondents were abstainers, while the remaining 25 percent were desistors. It is beyond the scope of this paper to elaborate on all of the social and social psychological factors that may have shaped their decisions to be abstainers or to become desistors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891241612458954">2</xref></sup> In this paper, we focus on students’ subjective perceptions of their nondrinking as “deviant,” the reactions of others to their nondrinking status, the strategies of stigma management they have developed and employed, and the implications of these strategies for negotiating and maintaining positive self-images and identities.</p>
<p>This study was conducted at a medium-sized state university in the Midwest that enrolls about twenty-thousand students. “Keg State University”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891241612458954">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0891241612458954">4</xref></sup> has been named as a top twenty “party school” in the United States several times over the past twenty-five years on various college ranking websites, and by <italic>Playboy</italic> magazine. Moreover, one of the most popular local taverns was named one of the “top ten best sports bars” in America by ESPN. This school is also often referred to as “party school” in local and regional media accounts regarding what is viewed as the nonacademic social environment of Keg State. An example of the strong flavor of the local drinking culture is reflected in an advertisement for a local liquor store recently published in the Keg State University’s student newspaper. With the advent of spring, the ad features a young coed in a skimpy bikini and proclaims the following: “Day Drinking Season Has Begun! New Item: Mountain Dew Flavored Vodka! ‘Like’ Us on Facebook!” “We Accept Bridge Cards!” [State issued debit cards to purchase food products.] Another example of the widespread drinking culture surrounding this campus is the number of bars that have drink specials and special events. For example, just before and after spring break, several drinking establishments have “hot body” contests for swimsuit-clad men and women to compete for cash prizes. These events draw large crowds. Drink specials are so pervasive that students can find at least one bar (usually several) every night of the week that offers a selection of cheap beer and/or cocktails. A number of local taverns advertise “Kill the Keg” nights that promote rapid beer drinking. Happy hours occur not only during the late afternoon into the early evening, but also start in the late evening extending into the morning hours at a number of taverns. These drinking activities and drinking specials are not unique to Keg State. One would undoubtedly find similar activities and advertisements around campuses throughout this country. Keg State and the pro-drinking activities surrounding it, and within it, simply represent the college drinking norm of many “wet” campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891241612458954">Wechsler and Wuethrich 2002</xref>). In this article, we focus on how nondrinking students navigate their ways through this climate and the attendant student drinking peer culture that reproduces this “party” environment on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Our research is part of a larger, ongoing study of both drinking and nondrinking college students that we began in our respective research methods classes in 2003. This project received IRB approval from the university. Graduate students enrolled in the first author’s qualitative research methods seminar, and undergraduate students in the second author’s upper-level research methodology class, conducted intensive in-depth interviews and observations. We utilized snowball sampling as our primary method to recruit respondents, as we found nondrinkers a difficult population to reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241612458954">Lee 1993</xref>). First, snowball sampling allowed us to overcome the fact that there were relatively few nondrinking students attending this university. A recent survey conducted by the second author using a random sample of Keg State students indicated that about 17 percent self-identified as nondrinkers. Second, we learned early on that being an abstainer at college was a topic that many of these students chose not to make widely known. Therefore, snowball sampling was the best strategy for us to reach students who do not drink alcohol. Specifically, intensive interviews were arranged by having our students provide contact information to potential informants, who contacted our researchers if they were interested in participating in this study. Interviewees were also asked to refer other nondrinkers to the investigators. This snowball process yielded a pool of respondents that included friends of friends, classmates of informants, those from similar clubs or university organizations, those from the same apartment complex, and dorm-mates. In addition, other respondents were recruited from flyers placed around the university with contact information listed for those wishing to participate in the study.</p>
<p>To date, the authors, along with a carefully trained group of our students, have conducted a total of 131 in-depth interviews with college undergraduate nondrinkers. Seventy-three of these interviewees were women and fifty-eight were men. This gender distribution of 56 percent women and 44 percent men closely approaches the university population of 59 percent female and 41 percent male. Of the 131 respondents, 97 identified themselves as Caucasian, 23 identified themselves as African American, 8 self-identified as Hispanic, and 3 others identified themselves as bi-racial. The ages of the participants ranged from seventeen to twenty-five. Interviews took place in dorm rooms, residence hall lounges, and dorm cafeterias, conference rooms at the library, respondents’ apartments (only same-gender interviews), coffee shops, and restaurants. In certain cases, Herman-Kinney and her graduate students conducted 26 follow-up interviews in an effort to gather additional information on the respondents. In addition to interviewing, we conducted 65 observations on and off campus at nightclubs, sports bars, off-campus parties, and various tailgating events. Field notes were written after each observation and interviews were transcribed within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. In terms of data analysis, we adopted a “grounded theory” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241612458954">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0891241612458954">Strauss 1987</xref>) through the use of the constant comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241612458954">Glaser 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241612458954">Bogdan and Biklen 1998</xref>). Specifically, we employed open coding by systematically examining transcripts, re-reading the interviews several times, and sorting the data into units. These units were composed of quotes from respondents, and associated units became categories (themes). We continuously looked for linkages and relationships between the categories (themes). We then developed broader, more general explanations from the categories and their relationships. The resultant themes and constructions of reality derived from this work unveil the complex and dynamic social psychological processes of how nondrinking students manage identities and interactions on a “wet” campus. Using the principles of grounded theory, then, led to the emergence of categories or themes firmly rooted in the lived experiences of the nondrinkers’ social worlds.</p>
<p>To protect the participants in this paper, we used pseudonyms to refer to all names and places, and we stressed this fact to our participants before the interview started. We found that our guarantee of confidentiality provided a safe context in which the nondrinkers spoke frankly about their experiences. Moreover, we made the participants comfortable by allowing them to choose the location of the interview. In addition, we found that the similar ages of the interviewers and the participants contributed to the development of rapport between the two parties. We also argue that the training we provided to our student interviewers in our research methods courses (e.g., rapport building, strategic probing) was another factor that motivated nondrinkers to be open about their lives. Evidence of the high levels of rapport that our students developed with our respondents is indicated by the detailed, candid, and rich stories they provided about their lives and the fact that a number of respondents also shared discrediting information about themselves with our student interviewers. In short, we argue that these aforementioned factors contributed to the high levels of validity of our findings.</p>

<title>Perceptions of Stigma as Deviant—“Nondrinkers Are Losers, Freaks, Pussies, and Nerds”</title>
<p>In his classic work, <italic>Stigma</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman (1963)</xref> argues that placing deviant labels on individuals negatively “marks” them in the eyes of others. People on the receiving end of social stigmas are spoiled, devalued, and undesirable. Despite how they are acquired, the associated redefinitions of identity and social statuses rarely fare well for the bearers of this mark. Following Goffman, nondrinkers on a “wet” campus possess <italic>a blemish of individual character</italic>—qualities or nonactions that make them stand out from others in a devalued way. Goffman makes the distinction between <italic>discreditable</italic> deviant identities versus those that are <italic>discredited</italic>. The former refer to attributes or characteristics that are not readily known or apparent to others; the latter refer to stigmas that are obvious or otherwise known to others. For the most part, the majority of nondrinkers in our study represent the former category. Such persons took a great deal of time and energy managing and controlling their spoiled identities. How did nondrinkers learn the social meaning of their failing? How did they learn that abstinence or sobriety was a stigmatizing trait? Students reported that they acquired this message from numerous direct and indirect negative experiences with peers on campus. These negative experiences were sometimes coupled with a nondrinkers’ perspective on how one of American society’s defining cultural characteristics centers on alcohol use.</p>
<p>Erin, a nineteen-year-old abstainer states:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is a society where drinking and getting drunk is the <italic>norm or unwritten law</italic> and not being drunk is <italic>unnatural and abnormal</italic>. Outside of college when you are growing up, there is so much emphasis on staying off drugs and alcohol. You are labeled a deviant loser if you abuse these substances, but when you get to college, the opposite becomes the reality—you are labeled deviant if you don’t drink. I never thought . . . choos[ing] not to drink at college that I would be labeled as some kind of freak! I knew I was coming to a party school, but there is so much pressure to get wasted all of the time and it seems that almost every single activity revolves around booze . . . to fit in around here you have to hide your sobriety or otherwise students don’t accept you. You are treated differently—you stand out from the crowd like some goody-two-shoes or self-righteous saint!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Andrew, a twenty-year-old abstainer, sums up this view when he states:
<disp-quote>
<p>Let’s face it. In this world today, in American Society, so much centers around alcohol. Madison Avenue has brainwashed us into believing that we must/should do everything with a beer in our hands. . . . We can’t watch a sporting event . . . without being wasted or half wasted. . . . I went to a tailgating party recently and was one of the only ones sober. I was given a lot of shit about it by kids my age and even some of the older people around.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The emotional discussion by these nondrinkers, based on their real-life experiences of “normals” negatively defining them, was widely noted and is consistent with findings from other studies of “deviants” who are stigmatized (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0891241612458954">Winnick and Bodkin 2008</xref>). In addition, these findings, from the nondrinkers’ perspectives, provide a window on the historically strong culture of alcohol consumption in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241612458954">Burns 2004</xref>). This is reflected in the big business of booze at the macro level, coupled with the pervasive everyday drinking activities among many undergraduates at the micro level at this party school. Nondrinkers faced strong and multiple pro-drinking messages or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891241612458954">Wechsler and Wuethrich (2002</xref>, 4) call “the culture of alcohol” on college campuses. In short, a dominant theme in our findings clearly indicated that being a nondrinker on a wet campus can be extremely difficult, anguishing at times, and full of social situational landmines that can be difficult to traverse.</p>

<title>Motivations for Not Drinking (Negative Associations)</title>
<sec id="section5-0891241612458954">
<title>The Taste of Alcohol</title>
<p>One motive given for not consuming alcohol expressed by these college students was the statement that they did not like the taste of alcohol. More than 20 percent reported that they did not like the taste of beer, wine coolers, and/or many of the hard liquors. As Sandra, a nineteen-year-old abstainer says:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know how a lot of kids slam the drinks down. Me personally, I hate the taste of it. Scotch, tequila—the worst, vodka and gin all burn going down. All the different shots that people do are gross. They make me want to puke the stuff right back up.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another abstainer, Lydia, a nineteen-year-old speaks about the taste of beer:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know how girls especially chug one beer down after the next. Beer tastes like shit. . . . I tried it only once. It is bitter and sour, like vinegar—it makes you belch like a pig, fart like a cow, and bloats you up like a balloon. Have you seen all those college girls walking around with these big beer bellies—attractive isn’t it? NOT!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891241612458954">
<title>Family Alcoholism</title>
<p>Another major reason that students in this study did not engage in drinking was related to negative experiences with alcohol in their families. Fifteen percent of students we interviewed discussed how alcohol led to such things as their parents’ divorce, a family member going to jail or prison, lost jobs, and financial hardships. Others spoke of dysfunctional familial relationships that took the form of neglect or physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Cecilia, a twenty-year-old recounts her negative family experiences related to alcohol and her decision to abstain from drinking:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alcohol ruined my family. Both my parents were drunks but my father was the worst. He lost job after job. He was always more concerned about where he was getting his next bottle of vodka from than any of us kids. When he was unemployed, we had some difficult times. . . . When my dad was really drunk he used to yell and hit us. That kind of abuse you never forget. I swore when I grew up I would never touch alcohol.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sophie, a seventeen-year-old spoke about the alcohol and drug abuse in her family and its tragic results:
<disp-quote>
<p>My brothers, mother, uncles, and you name it were all drunks and addicts. Everyone was either drunk or high when I was growing up. It was the thing to do. . . . When I was thirteen, my brother who was drunk took me into his room and got on top of me and raped me . . . he told me not to tell my grandmother . . . I didn’t tell for over two years. In that time, he got drunk and raped me over 30 times. When I finally told, no one believed me . . . that’s why I don’t drink.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, alcoholism in the family, and its attendant consequences, has strongly shaped some college students’ decisions not to drink.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0891241612458954">
<title>Personal, Negative Experiences with Alcohol</title>
<p>A third reason reported by the interviewees for abstaining from alcohol was their own negative experiences with drinking. More than 25 percent of the students reported receiving MIP’s (Minor in Possession of Alcohol – a state misdemeanor) or DWI’s (Driving While Impaired), and/or having accidents while driving. A majority of students interviewed (55 percent) reported getting violently ill from binge drinking. Many of these students also noted that they had blacked out from extensive drinking and some had experienced alcohol poisoning, which required a visit to the emergency room and sometimes hospitalization. Still others (15 percent) reported contracting a sexually transmitted disease, while 3 percent reported having unwanted sex. Sarah, a nineteen-year-old desistor, recounts her negative experiences after one night of heavy drinking:
<disp-quote>
<p>I ended up after doing 13 Jell-O shots in some stranger’s apartment. I don’t remember anything that happened from the night before but I woke up in someone’s bed with no clothes on and a used condom next to me. . . . After that night, I said that I would never drink again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar vein, Larry, an eighteen-year-old, discusses how he arrived at his decision to desist after a series of negative events transpired related to drinking:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alcohol is like a curse, man! I’ll tell you. When I was partying last year, everything bad that could possibly happen to you did, and then some. I got an MIP; I totaled my roommate’s truck and broke my leg in the process. [Later that year], I got caught driving on a suspended license after I smashed my girlfriend’s car into a parked police car back in my home town. . . . Because of everything that happened to me, I ended up serving time in jail. But I think that jail was the wake-up call I needed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sabrina, a nineteen-year-old desistor, discloses that negative consequences of excessive drinking and the ensuing shame bestowed upon her by her parents, was the reason that she stopped drinking:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had always looked up to my parents . . . I wanted them to be proud of me. But you know, when you go off to college, meet new people and this is the first time that you are really away from your parents and are “free” to do what you want, it is a temptation not always to do the right thing. I got wild a few times when I was drinking up here at Keg State. Let’s just say that I behaved like a slut a few times and hooked up with guys, just ’cause I wanted to be popular. My parents heard about my wildness from another girl from our town. Her mother and mine are friends. I was so ashamed when they confronted me about it . . . I never want to disappoint them like that again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All of these students recounted these negative personal experiences with alcohol with great emotion and genuine remorse, which suggests that the ensuing serious problems left a deep imprint on their lives. These findings regarding the social problems related to alcohol use and abuse are also reported in the existing literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241612458954">Klingemann et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241612458954">Livingston, Wilkinson, and Laslett 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0891241612458954">
<title>Desire to Remain in Control</title>
<p>A final motive reported in our study was that college students did not drink because they wanted <italic>to stay in control</italic> of what they said and did. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241612458954">Klein’s (1990)</xref> research, over 20 percent of our sample of nondrinkers felt that it was extremely important for them to remain in control of their behaviors at all times, and that consumption of alcohol lowered their abilities to do so. As Abigail, a twenty-one-year-old former drinker who became a desistor recalls:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the major reasons I don’t drink [anymore] is because you lose control of yourself. I have seen so many people make asses out of themselves, or worse, get in trouble with the law, or get hurt by someone. My best friend’s roommate was sexually assaulted by some guy after drinking too much. For me, I like to be in control at all times, to be able to make the best and right decisions for me. Alcohol is too much of a risk, so why take it? . . . I learned this the hard way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Abigail and many others reveal, this desire to remain in control is frequently discussed by nondrinkers. Along these lines, another student stated that when he used to drink he felt that he was “no longer the manager” of himself, his “inhibitions flew right out the window” and he ended up “doing all types of crazy things that [he] seriously regretted later.”</p>

<sec id="section9-0891241612458954">
<title>Motivations for Not Drinking (Positive Associations/Influences)</title>
<sec id="section10-0891241612458954">
<title>Abstaining Role Models</title>
<p>A major reason that some students in our study chose not to drink alcohol in the first place centered on the positive influence of their role models. According to interactionist theory, the primary group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612458954">Cooley 1902</xref>), the first group with whom a person interacts, plays a major socialization role, not only in terms of transmitting the norms and values of a society but also in bestowing one’s self-concept. Studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241612458954">Coombs, Paulson, and Richardson 1991</xref>) have reported the strong role of parental influence on substance abuse. More than 15 percent of the students reported that they had internalized their parents’ beliefs and wishes regarding drinking, smoking, and drug use. Even though such wishes were not being reinforced on a daily basis, students felt that indirectly, their parents still influenced their actions at college. Joseph, a nineteen-year-old abstainer, speaking to this issue states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was brought up by my family, particularly my mom and dad not to drink or use drugs. I am no saint or anything, but they just wanted me to be able to do the best I could with as many brain cells as I had, and not to kill them off with liquor. Even though I am 300 miles away from them now at college, they still impact me. They are like that little voice inside my head, telling me not to do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612458954">Cooley (1902)</xref>, for some nondrinking students, parents remain a highly salient primary group. The norms and values that their parents have instilled in them have carried over into their college years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0891241612458954">
<title>Academic Identity</title>
<p>More than 30 percent of the students in our study stated that they did not drink because they were afraid that it would seriously interfere with their abilities to complete tests, assignments, and term papers and, thus, to secure a high grade point average. Andy, a twenty-year-old abstainer, states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have seen what alcohol has done to other kids’ grades around here. They end up in the toilet. They miss a lot of classes, flunk tests, or the whole course. My buddy from back home ended up with four F’s after a semester of heavy partying. I am not going to risk my hard work and flunk out of school because I partied too much. I now have a 3.6 GPA and want to keep it up so I can go to grad school.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These academically-oriented students are the antithesis of the heavy drinkers at Keg State and represent the “geek phenomenon” discussed in the conclusion of the paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0891241612458954">
<title>Athletic Identity</title>
<p>As discussed above, while the literature addresses the fact that many athletes engage in drinking and more excessive drinking than some other students, our study indicated that there were a number of student athletes (16 percent of our sample) who consciously made the choice to abstain from alcohol (and other substances such as tobacco and drugs). These students possessed a strong sense of self and positive personal identities shaped and reinforced by their <italic>primary groups</italic> (e.g., families), <italic>reference groups</italic> in high school and college, and <italic>significant others</italic>, such as coaches, pastors, etc. Because of these influences, many continued to choose abstinence as it is already an integral part of their identities. As Kelsey, a nineteen-year-old abstaining varsity athlete notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s really a no-brainer. I have no desire to drink and get drunk. What a waste! I have trained so hard on various sports teams, put thousands of hours in at practices and games. Ever since I started out as a little kid all the coaches told us that our body was our temple and my mom emphasized that too. Why would I mess it up now. That’s why I room with other nondrinkers and hang out with my teammates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar vein, Geoff, a nineteen-year-old varsity athlete, who chooses to abstain, says:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s so stupid to get wasted—it kills off so many brain cells. I would rather be spending my time working out or practicing with the team. The coaches would be real disappointed in me if I started to do that shit—and so would my dad—but most important, I would be disappointed in myself. You see guys walking around on weekends so out of it, either passed out or puking all over. I hear them talking about missing so much class ’cause they were hung over. They lie to their teachers. . . . Then the next thing I hear is that they’re planning their next big blow out and start the whole thing over again!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, virtually all of the student athletes in our study had internalized a high-status identity as a jock on campus, positive self-images that were constantly being reinforced by significant others both directly and indirectly. Thus, they either felt largely immune from being labeled deviant for not engaging in drinking/binge-drinking activities or the labeling from others would not stick. As noted by Joe, a twenty-year-old abstaining from alcohol:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like this, if you play a sport, no one’s going to have the guts to call you a pussy for not drinking or rag on you in any way—after all, I’m on a winning team, with girls hanging all over me; the coaches love me—I’m a big name here at Keg State. They understand I am in training. . . . And if some ass does try to give me heat for not boozing and call me a pussy, it’s like I got Teflon on me—those names don’t stick and just roll right off of me!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In accord with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson (1987)</xref>, we would argue that these nondrinking athletes are individuals who publically and privately embody such strong personal and social nondrinking identities that they are essentially impervious from outsiders’ attempts to stigmatize them for not drinking. Just as many student athletes abstained from alcohol and binge drinking activities, we found another typological group who possess similarly salient nondrinking identities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0891241612458954">
<title>Religious Identity</title>
<p>Consistent with other research findings on the relationship between religiosity and college student drinking behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241612458954">Ellison et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241612458954">Patock-Peckham et al. 1998</xref>), we also found that students who were actively involved in a religious group abstained from alcohol. These students expressed such a strong religious identity that it trumped any college identity related to drinking whatsoever (e.g., would not be affiliated with a Greek organization or other social groups where drinking is a frequent activity). Like the students with salient academic and athletic identities discussed above, these religious students had positive non-deviant identities as well as strong faith-based support groups. They continued to choose abstinence as it was already an integral part of their social and personal identities. For example, Audrey, an eighteen-year-old, explaining her decision to abstain from alcohol at college states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I grew up in a Christian family and nobody drank alcohol. I went to a Christian school and hung out with other girls who didn’t do drugs or drink. It is just part of who I am. <italic>This is what is normal to me</italic>. . . . No one is going to tempt me here at Keg State. There is nothing good that comes from getting drunk, if you think about it. You could kill someone if you try to drive home, you could get raped or killed, you could get an STD or pregnant, or you could just get so messed up that you start failing all of your classes. That’s not why I came to college.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Ravi, an eighteen-year-old, adds,
<disp-quote>
<p>My Muslim upbringing forbids alcohol. This belief was strictly ingrained in me. When I moved to America [to attend college], I saw how much drinking went on by the students every night and even in the day. . . . I was tempted to try it. . . . Everything is centered around getting drunk in this country. They drink to attend football games; they drink when the team wins; they drink when it loses; they drink when they are happy to celebrate the end of exams; they drink when they are sad or stressed out about something. There is always a reason. . . . I need to keep up my GPA and need to be sober to do it. <italic>Partying is a recipe for failure. It doesn’t mix with success</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, then, academically strong students, some athletes, and students adhering closely to religious customs use the strategy of avoidance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>) as a form of identity work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>). They actively avoid drinkers and drinking activities, and seek out others of their own kind with similar goals and values, thereby reinforcing what they perceive as normal social and personal identities.</p>
<p>In addition to using the strategy of avoidance, these religious, athletic, and academic students also use what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson (1987</xref>, 1354) refer to as forms of “associational embracement” and “ideological embracement” to buttress their nondrinking identities. In terms of associational embracement, these students have developed close-knit friendships with like-minded individuals. Moreover, within their groups, they consistently express ideologies that are antithetical to consuming alcohol.</p>
<p>In sum, regardless of their motives for not engaging in the consumption of alcohol, the students in our study disclosed that they felt the overwhelming need to somehow manage this information about their stigmatizing attribute with other college students. They believed that if they did not do so they would be labeled deviant. We now turn to a discussion and explanation of the stigmatizing responses students encountered and the strategies they used to address these responses and sustain valued identities.</p>

<sec id="section14-0891241612458954">
<title>Negative Responses to Nondrinking</title>
<p>Our findings revealed that many nondrinkers were stigmatized, harassed, bullied, and ostracized in a number of ways. About 20 percent were teased directly to their faces; 22 percent reported being bullied via the Internet, cellular phone texts, on Facebook, or the receipt of anonymous handwritten notes; 16 percent were called negative names such as “pussy,” “wuss,” “self-righteous bitch,” and “freak.” Bart, a twenty-one-year-old, talked about how he was ridiculed by dorm-mates and his car defiled when they found out that he no longer drank (desistor):
<disp-quote>
<p>When guys on my floor found out about me [my nondrinking status], they painted profanity all over my car. They put the word PUSSY all over my front windshield in red paint; they threw empty beer bottles and cans inside my back seat. They emptied beer and alcohol inside my car too—it stunk. And I found vomit and shit on the driver’s front seat. All because I told them that I don’t drink anymore and I don’t want to get drunk with them!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Candy, an abstainer, speaking to how she was stigmatized by others on campus states:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the second half of my freshman year, some other girls found out that I don’t drink, and this one girl in particular started a campaign to harass the hell out of me. Her and three others thought it would be cool to send me shit over Facebook, they would get other people on campus to chant “loser” and “miss prim and proper cunt” when I would walk by; for a whole semester they tortured me; they would pass notes to me during two of my classes telling me I was a “loser.” I just couldn’t escape them. Twice, when walking across campus, a bunch of them showered me with beer. I was humiliated, but I knew if I told anyone, they would make it a thousand times worse for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further, Debra, a twenty-year-old, on how she was harassed about her status as an abstainer remarks:
<disp-quote>
<p>Life was shit at this school. If you didn’t party, and they found out about it, or you made the mistake of telling certain people, like I did, it was disastrous. Others on my floor thought I was cool but when I told Amber about not drinking, everything changed. It was like I had AIDS or something. People avoided me, laughed at me behind my back and also to my face. I was the brunt of very cruel jokes. A couple of my friends started avoiding and not including me in anything. One night when I came back from the library, I was walking up the stairs to get to my apartment, and I found what I thought was water coming down from above. It turned out that some guys were peeing on me and laughing. They were saying that, “So, you don’t drink beer with us—here is some beer for you, freshly drunk, you <italic>holier than thou</italic> bitch!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In sum, then, given the fact that many nondrinkers in our study (both abstainers and desistors) encountered various direct verbal and physical assaults on their persons, they resorted to developing and employing various strategies to lessen the stigma they encountered in their daily lives at college.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0891241612458954">
<title>Strategies for Stigma Management</title>
<p>In his seminal work on stigma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman (1963)</xref> identifies several strategies for managing “spoiled identities.” Our nondrinking students developed and employed four specific strategies.</p>
<sec id="section16-0891241612458954">
<title>Concealment and Passing</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As one form of “identity work,” involving the use of props and the manipulation of their physical appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>, 1348), many students in our study engaged in the strategy of <italic>passing or concealment</italic> as a “normal” drinking college student. Members of other deviant groups have been found to employ this strategy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241612458954">Sandstrom 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891241612458954">Stiles and Clark 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0891241612458954">Winnick and Bodkin 2008</xref>). Passing, as a type of identity work, is a strategy whereby some college students pretended that they had already been drinking by acting inebriated (slurring their words, stumbling about, etc.). Others loudly discussed their plans for obtaining and consuming alcohol and where they were going to party. In addition, many carried props, such as two-liter plastic pop bottles, 7-Eleven® Big Gulp® containers, or red Solo® cups, when at a party or other drinking event to offer the illusion that they were consuming alcoholic beverages.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Ingrid, a twenty-year-old, who abstained throughout college, put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is one trick that I used throughout college—you bring in a big Mountain Dew bottle or one of those water bottle cylinder things and you pretend that you have vodka or some other booze in it. You take a swig now and then and start pretending that you are getting a little woozy or tipsy and no one is the wiser.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, another abstainer Jack, a twenty-one-year-old, tells how he utilizes this strategy to his advantage:
<disp-quote>
<p>I either fool the guys by walking around with the good old red [Solo] cup all night, picking up someone’s half-drunken drink and pretending it is my own. Or sometimes I grab almost drunken beer bottles and put them up to my lips. I moisten my lips with the beer smell but never actually drink it. That way, the other guys don’t give me no shit and they think I’m getting as wasted as them. After an hour or so of faking them out, they’re all so shit faced that they don’t even realize.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both examples clearly illustrate nondrinking students who successfully pass through the use of props (red cups, near empty beer bottles and soda bottles), and altering their physical appearances (smelling of alcohol and acting intoxicated). These activities are complementary and often occur simultaneously.</p>
<p>It is important to note, in a processual sense, that as students moved through their college careers, they used different strategies in different situations and at different times with different people. For example, first-year students in our study primarily utilized the strategy of total concealment/passing and the aforementioned use of props and rearrangement of physical appearance, as major forms of stigma management. These young students employed these strategies with almost everyone when they first arrived on campus and throughout most of the first semester; however, many found it difficult to keep up the façade with everyone. Thus, a large number of nondrinking students moved toward engaging in selective concealment. Just as the deviance literature indicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241612458954">Miall 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0891241612458954">Troiden 1988</xref>), some college students actively make decisions to <italic>selectively</italic> disclose or conceal such information about their abstinence and sobriety on the basis of their perceptions of others as being either “risky others”—untrustworthy and nonempathetic, or “safe others”—trustworthy and empathetic.</p>
<p>Decisions to conceal or disclose to certain others were based on prior, positive or negative experiences with “certain types” of people. Sometimes these decisions lead to less than desirable results. Nanette, a seventeen-year-old abstainer, who is in her first semester at college, recounts the process of how she moved from total concealment to selective concealment and how she made assessments of who to tell as well as who <italic>not</italic> to tell:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first semester at college is the hardest for a number of reasons. But with regards to being a nondrinker, you don’t want people to call you a prude, or . . . a freak, a square, or some loser-girl, so you do your best to hide it from everyone in the dorm. . . . You play the game and do whatever you have to in order to fit in. I used to carry that Big Gulp around and pretend it was filled with vodka. But all the games get old after a while, the lies, the tricks; it’s nerve-racking. After my first semester here, I decided to start to come out of the closet . . . about not drinking. I got to know a few people . . . I thought I could trust and would understand and not judge me—so I told them, one by one that I just don’t drink. Two of the girls were real cool about it, but one, who I used to go to “bar night” with thought I was real weird. She didn’t really want to hang out with me anymore. That really hurt my feelings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, one of the major strategies developed and used by these young college students was to engage in concealment, followed by selective concealment/disclosure to others. Nondrinkers’ future disclosures depended on how others reacted to their initial disclosure—some students moved forward more openly in disclosing this information to others, while others fell back into full concealment mode. Speaking to this issue, Samantha, a twenty-year-old desistor, states:
<disp-quote>
<p>After one particularly hurtful experience with someone who I thought was a friend and she laughed at me and then told everyone else in my group who put it up on Facebook what a wuss and baby I was, I just ran and hid from these mean girls as best I could. I would stay in my room all the time, go to the library when I knew they weren’t there. . . . I was a real mess and this bullying experience made me not want to tell anyone else. I just stayed pretty much to myself from that time on and shut up.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nondrinkers’ use of concealment was a strategy of information management that took three forms. First, they engaged in <italic>associational distancing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>, 1349) from other known nondrinkers and nondrinking groups (e.g., certain Christian Fellowship groups, nonalcoholic events), as well as avoiding drinking groups and activities (e.g., bars, tailgating, drinking parties). Second, nondrinkers employed <italic>fictive storytelling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>, 1358), which involves narrating stories about their past and present experiences that have a fallacious component to them. Third, nondrinkers utilized <italic>disidentifiers</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman 1963</xref>, 44), which included making misleading verbal comments or engaging in physical actions to deceive others about their true nondrinking identities. In terms of associational distancing, approximately 25 percent of the students in our study would avoid interacting with individuals who were vocal about their nondrinking status, and would also not attend “dry events” hosted by certain religious groups off campus. As Ramona, a nineteen-year-old abstainer remarks:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the things that I would not do is associate with Rod who was known for being an avid nondrinker, nonsmoker, non-everything. If you are seen hanging with these kinds of people, people begin wondering if you’re just like them. And you sure as hell don’t go to any of their Christian dances, dinners, or anything else that they are hosting. That would be a dead giveaway.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as a number of persons avoided those who were self-defined as nondrinkers for fear of being associated with them and given a <italic>courtesy stigma</italic>, or guilt by association (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241612458954">Birenbaum 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241612458954">Koro-Ljungberg and Bussing 2009</xref>), others attempted to pass by distancing themselves from people and places where drinking was occurring. More than two-thirds of the interviewees in this study reported that in order to mitigate the stigma potential of sobriety on a wet campus, they simply avoided locations where alcohol was being served (such as bars, parties, tailgating events), people who would be drinking and insist that they do the same, or activities where drinking was the primary activity. Nondrinkers use the identity work strategy of associational distancing (i.e., avoidance of the situation), so they would not have to explain or defend their “dryness.” Alysia, a nineteen-year-old desistor, began to avoid such activities as tailgating due to the intense pressure to drink at these and other events:
<disp-quote>
<p>I stopped drinking last year after a date gone <italic>very wrong</italic>. . . . [Going to places where] alcohol was being consumed, I now just avoid those places like the plague. Like tailgating, everyone is getting blotto by 9 in the morning of the big game. There’s a great deal of pressure to drink at tailgating, so I just plan to stay the hell away. . . . I don’t go to Greek parties either.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Along these same lines, Joe, a twenty-year-old abstainer, notes the pressures to drink excessively at off-campus parties:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alcohol is such a part of the whole campus scene. Nobody thinks that there can be any fun without it, especially here at Keg State University. So, for parties, I know that huge amounts of beer and other stuff are going to be drunk, so I just stay away. I make sure that I have to work a shift (part-time job) that night, or I go home to see my parents. . . . What is so ironic about this university is that they have ATF [Alcohol and Tobacco Free] dorm floors, but a lot of students still bring in alcohol and pressure others to drink.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although employed less frequently than the strategy of associational distancing discussed above, 15 percent of the students in this study used a form of “identity talk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>, 1348)—fictive storytelling. Fictive storytelling took the form of tales (which included exaggerations, embellishments, and sometimes total distortions) about why they do not drink alcohol. Arianna, an eighteen-year-old abstainer, explains her use of fictive storytelling when she says:
<disp-quote>
<p>Depending on who the crowd is, and how adamant they are about me drinking—some people just won’t take no for an answer—so, I’ve come up with a variety of stories to get them off my case. Like sometimes, I will tell them I do not drink because a family member had several DUI’s and ended up in jail (not true). Other times, with a difficult crowd, I tell them that I am not drinking ’cause a close high school friend was killed by a drunk driver (also not true)—but that usually stops them from bothering me about drinking and they just lay off me for good!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the two techniques noted above used by nondrinkers to conceal their discreditable aspects of self, we also found that about 19 percent of our respondents used disidentifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman 1963</xref>), which took the form of making cruel jokes about nondrinkers and verbally harassing nondrinkers when in the presence of drinkers. Dale, an eighteen-year-old freshman, who made the decision to abstain, speaks about his use of verbal disidentifiers:
<disp-quote>
<p>I used to do it a lot during the first month or two I was here [at university]. It is like you are trying to deflect who you really are, so you constantly make jokes about guys that aren’t “man enough” to drink. You build yourself up at their expense. I remember joining in with a bunch of guys on my floor going after one guy and just ragging the hell out of him about being a pussy for not drinking. . . . Now that I look back to it, I see that I was sort of verbally assaulting this guy, but it was ultimately a way to protect myself and my positive image.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar vein, Art, a twenty-year old, recounts the shame he now faces as a result of employing a behavioral disidentifier that he subsequently realized had negative consequences for his innocent victims:
<disp-quote>
<p>About two and one half years ago, I was desperate to fit in with the “in crowd” on campus [the drinking clique], so I did a lot of things that I am now ashamed of. We used to hide in the bushes where we knew there was a “dry party” going on, or outside of some religious gig, and we’d shake up beer cans and soak those guys. We’d sometimes chase them and yell things at them. Or we would trip them and make them fall flat on their face. We’d gather up all the red cups we could find with leftover booze in them, consolidate them into a few cups and throw them in the faces of our targets. . . . Now that I look back on it, I was joining in with bullies just to protect my “reputation.” I tried to pass myself off as one of them. Those guys had no idea I did not drink . . . I fooled them alright! But inside, after the fact, I’d sometimes feel sick to my stomach that I was really one of [those] very kids that we were harassing!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In sum, nondrinkers’ use of the three forms of concealment (associational distancing, fictive storytelling, and disidentifiers) and the various forms of identity work they use to carry it off, was done largely to protect themselves from the perceived negative consequences that might have resulted from others’ revelation of their “dryness.” They used these three strategic tactical maneuvers to mitigate the stigma potential of nondrinking on their daily lives at college. Ultimately, they also used these techniques to protect their positive, nondeviant, or normal identities.</p>
<p>It is important to note that employing concealment as a strategy of stigma management was a temporal process. We found that most of the students in our study used concealment primarily during their freshmen and sophomore years. Over time, we found that older nondrinking students found concealment to be too much effort, time-consuming, and stressful. This led them to adopt alternative strategies, which we discuss below, as their initially strong desires for total secrecy were gradually replaced by less of a concern for complete concealment of their nondrinking status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0891241612458954">
<title>Preventive Disclosure</title>
<p>Preventive disclosure, as a form of identity talk, is defined as the selective disclosure to others of a stigmatizing attribute in an effort to influence others’ behavior and perceptions about individuals and their behaviors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0891241612458954">Winnick and Bodkin 2008</xref>). Some nondrinking college students used preventive disclosure as a stratagem when they anticipated future rejection by their peers. We found that, in order to minimize the pain of subsequent rejection, 29 percent of the sample decided to disclose their “dryness” to certain others early in social relationships. As Jonathan, a twenty-year-old abstainer, notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>After you have been burned in a few relationships and even friendships, it is just much easier to just be up front with them early on. It is better than waiting until they find out later or you tell them later and then they shun you. I’ve been there. Now, I just tell some people right front and center, early on that I just don’t drink, and that’s that! That’s not my scene. Either they accept me and what I don’t do, or they don’t. I am not passing judgment on them, but drinking is not right for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not only did some college students use the technique of preventive disclosure to avoid future stigma and rejection, so too did they adopt this strategy in an effort to influence others’ attitudes about them, and about sobriety in general. Specifically, the data indicated that college students used the following two devices: (1) medical disclaimers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241612458954">Miall 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>) and (2) education (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-0891241612458954">
<title>Medical disclaimers</title>
<p>In contrast to some students in this study who use disclaimers, as discussed above, to completely conceal their nondrinking identities, we found that others used disclaimers (especially medical disclaimers) when voluntarily disclosing their true identities in order to positively influence others’ evaluations of them.</p>
<p>Overall, about 33 percent of the respondents in the study disclosed their nondrinking identities to certain others using one or more disclosure strategies. First, we discovered that a number of nondrinkers had valid medical reasons for not drinking and conveyed these conditions to others to maintain positive identities. Susan, a nineteen-year-old abstainer, using the valid excuse of being a diabetic explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am on so many meds for different medical problems, but mentioning my diabetes gets me out of drinking most of the time. They know about the insulin and I tell them that they don’t want to see me in a diabetic coma. By telling other students about a serious medical condition that I have and the importance of watching my sugar levels, that usually gets people to lay off.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, we found that others buttressed their nondrinking identity by combining disclosures of actual medical conditions with fabrications of other physical ailments. For example, Patricia, a nineteen-year-old abstainer, conveys one actual medical problem but also bolsters her case by fabricating a second serious illness:
<disp-quote>
<p>I decided to tell my friends and kids in the dorm that I do not drink alcohol and the reason for that has to do with a medical diagnosis that I recently got. I tell them that I have tested positive for lupus and maybe MS [multiple sclerosis] as well. The part about lupus is true, but the other is not. Often times, I will exaggerate the symptoms about both diseases and what the effects on my body will be if I drink, and why it is crucial that I stay away from all kinds of liquor. I tell them what will happen to my organs and my ability to function. In most cases, people accept my rationale and are understanding and don’t hold it against me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, we found that other nondrinkers did <italic>not</italic> have any actual medical problems but that they used elements of fictive storytelling (as discussed above) to fabricate health issues. By doing so, they were able to maintain positive, social identities. Shaun, a twenty-two-year-old desistor, states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t tell other kids the entire truth—I twist the facts a bit, lie a bit. Whatever the situation calls for, is the type of story I need to tell to protect myself. I may tell people that I am not drinking but don’t get into all the complex reasons about my past—the actual truth. I find that it is easier to distort the reality a little bit, like always saying that I am on some type of medication, usually antibiotics and that is why I am not drinking tonight. <italic>It is not the truth</italic>, but it at least gives me a free pass for one night and gets them off my case!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, when openly sharing their true nondrinking identities to select others, they used these three distinct medical disclaimers. In the hope of being accepted by others and prevent being stigmatized, some disclosed their abstinence by using elements of valid medical ailments, others shared actual medical problems in combination with fictive storytelling techniques, while still others employed complete fabrications of medical complications. By using medical disclaimers, they hoped to remain in a favorable light among their peers, thereby maintaining their positive social and personal identities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0891241612458954">
<title>Education</title>
<p>A second form of preventive disclosure employed by nondrinking students was education. Similar to others defined as deviant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891241612458954">Taub, McLorg, and Fanflik 2004</xref>), about 15 percent of our sample revealed their nondrinking to others for educational purposes and to contest or challenge stigma. In an effort to “teach” other students about why they do not drink and the negative consequences of such, Marissa, a twenty-two-year-old desistor says:
<disp-quote>
<p>I figure that someone ought to [educate others about excessive drinking]. . . . I have done it in some classes where the teacher is asking for some comment about alcohol and you should see some of the looks on their faces. Once, I told a group . . . at The Harmony coffee shop about all of the problems associated with drinking—the health-related, the emotional, the financial, the consequences like being raped, robbed, or worse. Hopefully, some people in these groups will understand why I do not drink and accept me for these principles . . . and won’t all laugh at me behind my back!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hector, a twenty-one-year-old junior who has always abstained, not only hopes to enhance others’ perceptions about him through education but also to provide them with knowledge about drinking in an altruistic fashion:
<disp-quote>
<p>I really come out and tell people for two reasons. . . . I want them to still like me and hang out with me. But also because if I can get through to at least a couple of my peers about how you could end up ruining your life from booze—job-wise, health-wise, relationships, jail, and that sort of thing, then I think that I’ve had an impact in this world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is important to note that older students were more likely to use education as a preventive strategy than younger undergraduates. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman (1963</xref>, 101), medical disclaimers and education are forms of “disclosure etiquette”—they serve as formulas for disclosing a stigmatizing attribute to others “in a matter of fact way, supporting the assumption that those present are above such concerns while preventing them from trapping themselves into showing that they are not.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0891241612458954">
<title>Therapeutic Disclosure</title>
<p>Therapeutic disclosure, another form of identity talk, may be defined as the selective disclosure of a stigmatizing attribute to certain “trustworthy” others in order to renegotiate perceptions of their “failing”—in this case, their abstinence or nondrinking behavior. Similar to others (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241612458954">Miall 1986</xref>), about 20 percent of the nondrinkers in our study felt that discussing their sobriety, and some of the “true” motivations (outlined above) for their abstinence, functioned in a cathartic way to significantly alleviate the burden of “living a lie.” Theresa, a twenty-year-old desistor, who had admittedly started down the path of alcoholism like her family but chose to stop, remarked:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is such a relief when you finally tell one of your friends the actual reasons that are behind you not drinking. . . . My whole family are drunks and me and my relatives have had so many tragic health conditions related to alcohol—it is so uplifting to get all the truth out. It is hard keeping all this hidden and having to lie all the time!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In sum then, nondrinkers adopted therapeutic disclosure to relieve the feelings of frustration and anxiety, to maintain a positive personal and social identity, and to renegotiate the stigma of not drinking with other students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0891241612458954">
<title>Capitulation</title>
<p>While the aforementioned kinds of stigma management techniques varied in their degree of securing positive outcomes, (sometimes they failed in reducing stigma, and in maintaining positive identities), one final stratagem used by the students—capitulation—had the least favorable outcome of all of the techniques adopted. Capitulation refers to giving in, giving up, or otherwise succumbing to the social stigma applied by others. Individuals succumb to the extent that they cannot actively confront and successfully deal with the stigma. Just as some obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0891241612458954">Wott and Carels 2010</xref>) and homosexuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0891241612458954">Troiden 1988</xref>) give in to stigma when all other strategies of deviance disavowal fail, a small number of college nondrinkers in our study (2 percent) employed the stratagem of capitulation; that is, they gave up or otherwise gave in to the stigma attached to their nondrinking. These students fell into two categories. The first category included those whose abstinence from alcohol was already known to others and, thus, did not have the option of engaging in concealment or passing. The second category included students whose attempts at voluntary and preventive disclosure had serious negative consequences. These student nondrinkers reported being verbally abused, victimized by practical jokes, were sometimes physically attacked, and ridiculed repeatedly for choosing to abstain from alcohol; as such, they concluded that capitulation was their <italic>only</italic> option or “only way out.” Capitulation took the forms of deliberately missing classes so as to avoid nonsupportive others, dropping out of school temporarily, or planning to leave permanently. We were not able to ascertain whether students actually dropped out but their intentions should raise concerns for faculty and administrators interested in retention issues. As Sandy, an eighteen-year-old freshman, observed when describing the stigmatizing consequences of her abstinence:
<disp-quote>
<p>I can only take so much picking on, and being the brunt of their jokes. Other students can be so cruel. I just get to the point where I can’t take it anymore. I was bullied by a group of kids relentlessly when they found out (that I did not drink). They acted like I had two heads. . . . I just can’t take it anymore, so I am seriously thinking of dropping out of college, either for the rest of the semester or never come back.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, Anita, a nineteen-year-old who always abstained from alcohol, spoke of cutting herself (self-mutilation) in response to the stigmatization she felt on campus by so-called friends and acquaintances:
<disp-quote>
<p>After you’ve been laughed at over and over and over, played jokes on—so that even strangers know your business, you can’t take it anymore. Everyone in my dorm and a bunch of kids in my classes think I am some kind of weanie for not drinking. They call me freak-girl. . . . So I go home and cut the bottoms of my feet with a knife. . . . The deeper I cut, the less pain I feel from my enemies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In sum, for nondrinking students, capitulation represented a retreat from further negative social confrontation as well as an explicit acceptance of a deviant label and the low status bestowed upon them by peers. The deviant social identity imputed to them by their drinking negatively shaped their personal identity. From the point of view of college officials (interested in the safety of students and college retention rates), this is a noteworthy and alarming finding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study developed from a larger, ongoing project in which we conducted numerous observations and interviews with college students, the majority of whom reported drinking frequently, sometimes heavily, and a number of others who did not drink alcohol at all. The latter group became the focus of this paper. Our review of the extant literature on college student nondrinkers found that only a few studies dealt with those who abstain from alcohol, and not a single study included the perspectives and experiences of nondrinkers living for the next four (or more) years of their lives in a micro-social context dominated by drinkers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0891241612458954">5</xref></sup> This study arose then, in response to the paucity of research on college nondrinkers. In terms of substantive contributions, this study is unique in that it allowed college nondrinkers to tell their story. The qualitative data has provided us with a better understanding of what it is like to be a nondrinker on a “wet campus,” by examining their social interactions with other drinking college students, and how they dealt with the stigma imputed to them by the aforementioned. The in-depth interviews revealed the motives for college students underlying their decisions not to drink or to cease drinking, their subjective perceptions of sobriety as a “deviant” attribute of self, and the various ways they attempted to cope. In short, our findings have illuminated nondrinkers’ unique world by drawing on their subjective understandings of their everyday social lives at college.</p>
<p>In addition, from an interactionist perspective, our study has shown how nondrinkers moved from one strategy to another over their college careers, starting out in concealment mode as freshmen but often turning to therapeutic and preventive disclosures as seniors. The social context and their past experiences with drinkers, either negative or positive, affected which strategies nondrinkers employed. All of these techniques served the twofold function of mitigating the stigma potential of their “failing” during their everyday lives, but also strategically allowed for negotiations with others that promoted their personal and social identities. During their early college careers, the negative, stigmatizing experiences of our interviewees made them feel as if they lacked control (low self-efficacy) over the content of their personal and social identities. The deviant attributions imputed to them by drinkers negatively shaped both their social and personal identities. These labels triggered anger, anxiety, and depression, which subsequently motivated nondrinkers to use identity work strategies to protect their identities from assaults by some drinkers. We observed that older students not only became increasingly more successful at doing identity work but also sought out like-minded students and social groups who supported sobriety. In the process, they learned more effective stigma management strategies. In doing so they not only deflected negative evaluations from others but also developed valued personal and social identities that were congruent with their positive self-concepts. With the exception of the nondrinkers who used the tactic of capitulation, most of the nondrinkers in our study developed a strong sense of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891241612458954">Gecas 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241612458954">Gecas and Schwalbe 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Our qualitative study also adds to the body of research on stigma management strategies (e.g., the mentally ill, persons with AIDS, disabled children, those with ADHD, homeless people, S &amp; M subcultural members; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241612458954">Hefley 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612458954">Herman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241612458954">Sandstrom 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612458954">Schneider and Conrad 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891241612458954">Stiles and Clark 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0891241612458954">Troiden 1988</xref>) by documenting how a more “mainstream” social group (college student nondrinkers) are stigmatized and forced to adopt many of the management strategies of the aforementioned “deviant” groups. This is a major substantive contribution of the article as we show how “overdogs” also face the burden of stigma and utilize the same strategies as “underdogs” to mitigate the stigma potential on their “failings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612458954">Goffman 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>We expand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612458954">Snow and Anderson’s (1987)</xref> research on identity work by showing how education, as a form of embracement, involves more than simply avowing nondrinkers’ implied social identities, but by doing so in altruistic manners not only changes others’ perceptions of them, it also serves to educate others. Nondrinkers feel so empowered, and are so confident in their avowed identities, that education has become their primary mission as they teach others in the college community about the perils and pitfalls of excessive drinking. Thus, we see the beginnings of an activist identity forming. This finding has policy implications and warrants future research.</p>
<p>From an interpretive socialization point of view (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241612458954">Corsaro 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241612458954">Eder 1995</xref>), we would argue that the nondrinkers were producing a new sober peer culture rather than merely being a part of the continual reproduction of the party culture on campus and in the larger society. At this time, while nondrinkers were not making considerable changes in the hegemonic drinking culture, one can imagine, with the aid of university administrative policies and parents’ increasing concern with college binge drinking, that the nondrinking peer culture may eventually “penetrate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0891241612458954">Willis 1977</xref>) the local college drinking culture. Our study suggests that nondrinkers created pockets of resistance that protected their identities and insulated them from stigma directed toward them by members of the college drinking culture. We argue that the identity work processes which nondrinkers were going through is akin to that in which some adolescents begin high school as “nerds” and become “normal” as they move toward graduation, by creating a new peer culture and changing the proximate social structure of peer groups in the school. Thus, our findings regarding identity are consistent with work in the sociology of education and sociology of adolescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241612458954">Kinney 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241612458954">2007</xref>). In the long term, the presence of a growing number of nondrinking young adults may forge safe havens in the larger social structure of America’s “wet” society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891241612458954">Wechsler and Wuethrich 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>At a theoretical level, our findings have provided additional support for those social scientists calling for a unifying definition of deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241612458954">Best 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612458954">Heckert and Heckert 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612458954">2004</xref>). Our present study is an empirical example of the application of a typology of deviance that combines both normative and reactivist definitions. Heckert and Heckert’s typology of deviance cross-classifies normative and reactivist definitions of deviance, distinguishing between negative deviance, positive deviance, deviance admiration, and rate busting. Our findings suggest that depending on the audience, our nondrinkers fit three of four typological classifications: underconformists who are negatively evaluated (negative deviants), as well as overconformists who are negatively evaluated (rate busters) and overconformists who are positively evaluated (positive deviants). First, from the point of view of moderate college student drinkers, by abstaining, the nondrinkers underconform to the norm of moderation and therefore are negatively evaluated. Second, from the perspectives of the excessive drinkers, the nondrinkers are conceived as rate busters since they are essentially overconforming to the American value of moderation by abstaining and thus are negatively evaluated. Rate busting, as the negative reaction to overconformity, is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612458954">Heckert and Heckert (2004</xref>, 216) as “adhering to the idealized level of the norm [which] induces unfavorable [negative] evaluations . . . and constitutes the ‘geek phenomenon,’” or what we would label as the “super-geek phenomenon” in the case of nondrinking students. This makes nonconforming nondrinkers easy targets for their drinking peers to skewer them with labels such as “pussies” and “losers.” Third, if we consider these nondrinkers from the perspectives of parents, professors, police, and administrators, we can conceptualize them as “positive deviants” in the sense that their nondrinking behavior is overconformity to the norm of moderation and is positively evaluated. In sum, depending on the audience, we argue that nondrinkers at Keg State University can be classified as “triple deviants.”</p>
<p>In addition, our findings illustrate how the process of drinkers’ stigmatization of nondrinkers at Keg State can be interpreted using Durkheim’s classic sociological theory of deviance, in which he pointed out that there are no individuals but only representatives of groups. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241612458954">Durkheim (1895)</xref>, deviance is a form of group or class conflict. Norms are derived from the dominant group; those who violate the norms are labeled deviants and stigmatized by the powerful. Applying Durkheimian theory to our research, our nondrinkers, who incur the wrath of the drinkers, are merely representatives of a larger social group of nondrinkers. The drinkers as a group on the Keg State campus, and the social organizations (e.g., Greek, varsity athletics) of which they are a part, are essentially the ones with the power; the words that they use to stigmatize nondrinkers are fighting words—pussy, weanie, loser. In addition to the verbal warfare, we found instances of behavioral violence (e.g., showering with beer, damaging personal property). These verbal and physical clashes are examples of group conflict. We would argue that perhaps the drinkers lash out at nondrinkers because of the threat they pose. That is, they represent a way of life that dovetails with the primary reason one goes to college: to learn marketable skills and obtain employment in one’s field of interest. Alternatively stated, the drinkers may come to the realization that the nondrinkers are more likely to be successful adults because they are not spending time getting wasted and nursing hangovers, but focusing on what college is all about, preparing oneself for a successful future. In sum, our study illustrates how this particular group fits into three cells of the typology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612458954">Heckert and Heckert 2004</xref>) simultaneously at Keg State, depending on the context, audience, and power relationships. Clearly, this theoretical interpretation requires future research to address its complexities.</p>
<p>Future research should include studies using longitudinal and multiple methods to follow a group of high school students who abstain and a group who drinks into and through college in order to delineate trajectories of abstainers, desistors, and drinkers of varying frequency and intensity. Given that association with other nondrinkers on campus, and membership in nondrinking organizations (e.g., religious groups, substance-free dorms) were viewed as important factors in countering the stigma felt by these college students, another fruitful area of research should examine nondrinking peer groups and compare students who have such social organizational support with those who do not have allies. Moreover, from our nondrinkers’ perspectives, “serious” binge drinkers were more likely than moderate drinkers to apply harsher and more frequent stigma to nondrinkers. A new venue of research might specify which students (on the continuum of college drinkers) are the most aggressive in terms of stigmatizing their nondrinking peers. Another area of potential research, building on our study, should specifically focus on the nature and extent of how other audiences such as parents, faculty, and administrators define and treat nondrinkers.</p>
<p>Finally, future studies should also examine the experiences of nondrinking students at other known “party” schools as a point of comparison to investigate how those students fare on their daily rounds. Is stigma a problem for them? If so, how do they deal with it? Are there college-instituted programs in place to support their nondrinking stance? Are there many nondrinking events held on campus? In addition, comparisons should also include students on campuses that are not known for being “party schools.”</p>
<p>Since research on college student nondrinkers is relatively rare, our findings should be taken into account by campus administrators where alcohol-related activities are the norm, not the exception. We would argue that administrators, who are concerned about retention and the emotional well-being of their students, should pay particular attention to the strategy of capitulation utilized by some frustrated nondrinking students. Do they want students to drop out of classes, leave their college, transfer to another college, or engage in self-mutilation (or worse) because they “do not fit in” on a “wet” campus. Future programs and activities could and should be implemented to address some of the issues and concerns brought to light by our nondrinking students. For example, we argue that the stigma management strategies they use effectively should be shared with students entering college during freshmen orientation to provide them the tools to stay dry and feel positive about this decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0891241612458954">6</xref></sup></p>
