<p>Purposes</p>
<p>The purposes of this study were to assess differences in lifestyle behaviors and other health-related factors between black and white adults with pre-diabetes and to identify predictors for lifestyle behaviors.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Using the 2007 and 2009 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual cross-sectional survey of randomly selected samples from each state, black (n = 1156) and white (n = 9539) adults with pre-diabetes were compared on lifestyle behaviors, general health practices, perceptions of health, chronic diseases, and access to care. Predictors for participating in regular physical activity and adequate intake of fruits and vegetables were identified for each racial and gender group using multiple regression procedures.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Less than 40% of the adults with pre-diabetes participated in regular physical activity, and less than a quarter had adequate intake of fruits and vegetables; only 20% met the body weight recommendations. Compared to whites, blacks were more likely to be overweight/obese (86% vs 79%) and less likely to engage in regular physical activity (29% vs 40%). Except for adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, each racial and gender group had different predictors for regular physical activity. For black males, the predictors included impaired physical health and coronary heart disease/stroke. For black females, the predictors were younger age and routine checkup.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Significant disparities exist between blacks and whites in lifestyle behaviors and other health-related factors. Targeted intervention strategies are needed to motivate blacks to modify behaviors to prevent or delay the development of diabetes.</p>

<p>Pre-diabetes, the condition of having blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes, is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712440334">1</xref></sup> Compared to people with normal glucose levels, people with pre-diabetes are 5 to 15 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712440334">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712440334">3</xref></sup> Based on fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1C levels, recent data indicate that 35% of adults in the United States aged 20 years or older have pre- diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712440334">4</xref></sup> Yet only a small proportion of those with pre-diabetes are aware of their condition. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712440334">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712440334">6</xref></sup> Results from the 2006 National Health Interview Survey indicate that only 4.2% white, 3.9% African American, 3.3% Hispanics, and 2.8% Asians report they have pre-diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712440334">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetes is more common among nonwhites, especially among non-Hispanic blacks (blacks). The age-adjusted rate of diagnosed diabetes among adults 20 years or older was 12.6% for blacks, which is 77% higher than the 7.1% among non-Hispanic whites (whites).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712440334">4</xref></sup> However, the rates of pre-diabetes were the same (35%) for both blacks and whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712440334">4</xref></sup> These data indicate that a higher proportion of blacks with pre-diabetes progressed to diabetes than whites. Although most available studies have focused on the racial differences in the general population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712440334">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712440334"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712440334">8</xref></sup> there have been no data comparing black and white adults with pre-diabetes regarding preventive behaviors and other health practices.</p>
<p>Lifestyle modification, such as weight loss and increased physical activity, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes among persons with pre-diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712440334">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712440334"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712440334">11</xref></sup> The recommended standard of medical care for pre-diabetes includes weight loss, at least 150 minutes/week of moderate physical activity, counseling, and annual monitoring for the development of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712440334">12</xref></sup> Most recent data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712440334">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712440334">13</xref></sup> however, indicate that only 68% of adults with self-reported pre-diabetes had been trying to lose weight or control their weight and 55% had increased physical activity/exercise. Even more alarmingly, at least one-quarter did not engage in any risk-reduction behaviors.</p>
<p>Behavioral changes such as exercising regularly and following prescribed eating plans are more difficult to do for patients with diabetes than engaging in other medical management activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712440334">14</xref></sup> Currently, limited information is available about factors associated with practicing preventive behaviors, and that hinders the development of effective interventions to foster important lifestyle changes. Identifying and understanding contributing factors are the crucial first steps for the development of interventions to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations such as people with pre-diabetes, especially in blacks, as they have a higher risk of developing the disease. The purposes of this study were to assess differences in lifestyle behaviors and other health-related factors between black and white adults with pre-diabetes and to identify predictors for lifestyle behaviors. Factors considered included general health practices, perceptions of health and impairment, chronic diseases, and access to care.</p>

<title>Design and Data Collection</title>
<p>This is a secondary data analysis using national data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Both 2007 and 2009 data were analyzed because of the availability of measures of physical activity and the intake of fruits and vegetables were measured in both years. The BRFSS is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized United States population aged 18 years or older. Sponsored and coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712440334">15</xref></sup> the BRFSS collects data in all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The survey includes a core set of modules that are asked of all respondents about health status, health risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and health care access. In addition, standardized optional modules relating to specific diseases or behaviors are added at the discretion of each state. Data were collected in either English or Spanish.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample for this analysis included adults 20 years old or older who reported having pre-diabetes and self-identified as non-Hispanic blacks or non-Hispanic whites. Whites were included to serve as references to identify disparities. The survey question, âHave you ever been told by the doctor that you have diabetes?â was used as a screening tool to identify the sample. There were 5 mutually exclusive response categories, including âYes, diabetesâ; âYes, but female told only during pregnancyâ; âNoâ; âNo, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetesâ; and âDonât know/not sure/refused.â For this analysis, only adults who answered, âNo, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetesâ were included. Several studies have reported high overall reliability of the BRFSS question about diabetes diagnosis and the items used in this analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712440334">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712440334">18</xref></sup> Pregnant women were excluded (n = 32). The final sample included 10 695 adults, 46.2% from 2007 and 53.8% from 2009. The majority of the sample was female (6670 [62.4%]). There were 9539 (89.2%) whites and 1156 (10.8%) blacks.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The major categories of variables included lifestyle behaviors, general health practices, perception of health, chronic diseases, and access to care. Social demographic and risk behaviors were also analyzed.</p>
<p>Lifestyle behaviors included regular physical activity, adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, and overweight/obesity. Regular physical activity was defined by meeting the ADA physical activity recommendations, which included participating in moderate-intensity physical activity for â¥ 150 minutes per week or engaging in vigorous activity for â¥ 60 minutes per week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712440334">12</xref></sup> For the 2007 and 2009 BRFSS surveys, respondents were asked about the frequency (number of times) of participation in moderate activities such as âbrisk walking, bicycling, vacuuming, gardening, or anything else that causes some increase in breathing or heart rateâ in a usual week, and the duration (number of minutes) of the moderate activity each time. The frequency and duration were then combined to obtain the total minutes of moderate physical activity in a usual week. The frequency and duration of participation in vigorous activities such as ârunning, aerobics, heavy yard work, or anything else that causes large increases in breathing or heart rateâ in a usual week were also combined to obtain the total minutes of vigorous activity per week. Based on the number of minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity, respondents were classified as participating in regular physical activity if they met the ADA recommendations. If respondents engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity but did not meet the recommendations, they were classified as having insufficient physical activity. Respondents were classified as inactive if they reported no moderate or vigorous physical activity in a usual week.</p>
<p>Adequate intake of fruits and vegetables was defined as consuming 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day, as indicated by the Food Pyramid food guidance system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712440334">19</xref></sup> The BRFSS assessed the daily consumptions of fruits and vegetables using 6 questions measuring the frequency of drinking fruit juice and eating fruit, green salad, non-fried potatoes, carrots, and other vegetables. The frequencies of these 6 food categories were then combined to form the total number of servings of fruits and vegetables per day. In this study, if the total number of servings was 5 or more, the respondents were classified as having adequate intake of fruits and vegetables (1 = yes); otherwise, they were classified as not having adequate intake (0 = no).</p>
<p>Overweight/obesity was defined based on the body mass index (BMI), which was calculated using self-reported weight and height (weight [kg] / height [m<sup>2</sup>]). Being obese was defined as having a BMI of â¥ 30.0 (2 = obese). Being overweight was defined as having a BMI of â¥ 25.0 but &lt; 30 (1 = overweight). A BMI of less than 25 was considered as normal weight (0 = normal). In the regression analysis, the authors combined overweight and obesity to reduce the number of variables (1 = overweight/obesity, 0 = normal). Reliability coefficients for these variables were higher than 0.75 with moderate to high validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712440334">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>General health practices were measured by the attendance at a routine checkup within the past year and the receipt of the flu vaccine (shot or spray) within the past 12 months. A routine checkup was assessed by the question, âAbout how long has it been since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup?â The responses included within the past year, within the past 2 years, within the past 5 years, 5 or more years ago, or never. Respondents were classified as having received a routine checkup within the past year (1 = yes) if the answer was âwithin the past year.â Respondents who chose other answers were considered as not having a routine checkup within the past year (0 = no). Flu vaccine was measured by a question asking whether or not the respondents had received a flu vaccine in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Perceptions of health assessed 3 variables: poor health, impaired physical health, and impaired mental health. Poor health was measured by the question asking about health status, which has 5 response categories including poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. In this study, respondents were categorized as having poor health (1 = poor health) if they rated their overall heath as poor or fair; and good health (0 = good health) if their rating was good, very good, or excellent. Impaired physical health was measured by the number of days âphysical health was not goodâ because of physical illness and/or injury that prevented work or recreation in the past 30 days. If the number of days was 15 or more, the respondents were classified as having impaired physical health (1 = yes, impaired physical health). If the number of days was less than 15, then the respondents were considered as not having impaired physical health (0 = no). Impaired mental health was defined as experiencing poor mental health because of stress, depression, and/or problems with emotions that prevented work or recreation on 15 or more days during the past 30 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712440334">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712440334"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712440334">22</xref></sup> The classification was the same as for impaired physical health (1 = yes, impaired mental health; 0 = no). The measures of impaired physical and mental health have moderate to high retest reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712440334">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chronic diseases were measured by questions regarding the incidence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease or stroke (history of heart attack/angina/stroke). For each condition, if the answer was âYes,â the respondent was considered as having a history of that chronic disease (ie, 1 = yes, high blood pressure; 0 = no). Sensitivity and specificity for self-reported chronic conditions were acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712440334">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Access to care was measured by questions about health insurance (any kind of coverage), having a regular primary care provider, and cost barriers (avoided seeing a doctor because of cost in the past 12 months). Each condition had 2 response categories (yes or no). Respondents who answered âNoâ to the insurance and regular primary care provider questions were classified as no health insurance and no regular primary care provider (no PCP). Respondents who answered âYesâ to the cost barriers question were considered as having cost barriers.</p>
<p>Demographic factors included sex (female), age (years), married or living with a partner, annual income â¥ $35 000, education of high school or higher (high school graduate), whether there was a child younger than 18 years old living in the household, and current employment for people under 65 years of age. Except for age, all variables were measured as dichotomous (yes or no). Risk factors included current smoking and binge drinking. Current smoking was measured by 2 questions of the history of smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and current smoking. Respondents were classified as current smokers if they had histories of at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and were currently smoking either every day or on some days (1 = yes, current smokers; 0 = no). The measure of current smoking has high reliability and validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334">17</xref></sup> Binge drinking was measured by the question regarding the number of times a male respondent had 5 or more drinks per occasion or a female respondent had 4 or more drinks per occasion in the past 30 days. For this study, if the answer was 1 or more times, the respondent was considered as a binge drinker (1 = yes, binge drinking). A respondent was classified as no binge drinking if the answer was 0 times (0 = no). This measure has acceptable reliability and validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0145721712440334">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>PASW Statistics (version 18, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://IBM.com">IBM.com</ext-link>, 2009) was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine the frequencies of variables. Chi-square or <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare blacks and whites on demographic variables and risk factors. The lifestyle behaviors, general health practices, perception of health, chronic diseases, and access to care were compared between blacks and whites using logistic regression analyses, adjusting for the demographic variables (age, sex, marital status, income â¥ $35 000, high school graduate, and having a child living in the household). In all of the analyses, whites were used as the reference group. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported to indicate both the nature and strength of the relationship. The relationship was considered significant if the 95% CI did not include 1.00.</p>
<p>To identify significant predictors for regular physical activity and adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, separate logistic regressions with stepwise method were performed for each race, stratified by sex. Variables were retained in the model if <italic>P</italic> &lt; .10. This <italic>P</italic> level is the default in PASW (SPSS) stepwise procedure to ensure that important variables are not omitted from the model. Understanding the significant predictors could guide the development of interventions specific for each subgroup. Moreover, intercorrelations among physical activity, adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, and body weight were also examined to further understand the lifestyle behaviors in the subgroups.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To the authorsâ knowledge, this is the first study comparing lifestyle and behavioral factors between blacks and whites with pre-diabetes. Considerable variations were found between the 2 races. There were also different predictors for lifestyle behaviors for each racial group, suggesting the need for different intervention strategies.</p>
<p>Despite the respondentsâ awareness of their pre-diabetes status, less than 40% of them participated in regular physical activity, less than a quarter had adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, and only 20% met body weight recommendations. The prevalence of regular physical activity in pre-diabetes adults (38.5%) was higher than the national average of 20.8 in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712440334">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712440334">8</xref></sup> The racial and gender differences among pre-diabetes adults mirrored the disparity observed for the general population, in that blacks have a lower prevalence of regular physical activity than whites and women have lower prevalence than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712440334">7</xref></sup> The positive relationship between adequate intake of fruits and vegetables and physical activity suggests the possibility that intervention in 1 behavior could result in changes in both behaviors. Professionals could start with identifying and changing 1 behavior that is more acceptable to a patient, and follow up with the change of another behavior.</p>
<p>The different predictors identified for each racial and gender group indicate that tailored interventions should be developed. For black males with impaired physical health and coronary heart disease or stroke, professionals could assist them to identify appropriate and suitable activities to facilitate the behavioral change. For black females, because of the positive influence of routine checkups, strategies to increase physical activity could target primary care providers to provide culturally appropriate counseling and interventions. For all adults with pre-diabetes, increasing physical activity, education, or counseling targeting healthful eating choices could be effective.</p>
<p>One element in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans is to consume adequate servings of fruits and vegetables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712440334">19</xref></sup> In this study, the predictors for adequate intake of fruits and vegetables were unique for black males and females. For black males, none of the variables significantly predicted eating behavior in the multivariate model, although respondents with high blood pressure were almost twice as likely to report adequate intake of fruits and vegetables. For black females, the only significant predictor was the perception of poor health, which negatively related to adequate intake of fruits and vegetables. It is unexpected that body weight was not associated with adequate intake of fruits and vegetables (healthful eating) for both black males and females. In the literature, most evidence about fruit and vegetable intake has focused on environmental factors and availability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712440334">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712440334"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712440334">25</xref></sup> In a systematic review examining the relationship between diet and obesity among adult African Americans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712440334">23</xref></sup> the presence of supermarkets and specialty stores was positively associated with meeting fruit and vegetable guidelines. Another systematic review found that availability of fruits and vegetables was related to consumption and there was no racial difference on the availability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712440334">24</xref></sup> Kamphuis and colleagues found that living in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood and having a low household income were negatively associated with fruit and vegetable intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712440334">25</xref></sup> In the current study, the relationship between income and other social economic factors with fruit and vegetable intake was not significant in black populations, but it was significant among whites.</p>
<p>As expected, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher among adults with pre-diabetes than in the general population. Consistent with previous literature for the general population, blacks had a higher obesity rate than whites; nearly 60% had a BMI â¥ 30, whereas the rate for whites was 42%. Interestingly, overweight/obesity was independent from physical activity and intake of fruits and vegetables for both black males and females in the multivariate models, whereas for the white population, the relationships between overweight/obesity and physical activity as well as intake of fruits and vegetables were strong. Further studies are needed to investigate this lack of association in black population.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are subject to several limitations. First, BMI was based on self-reported height and weight, which was likely to be underestimated in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334">17</xref></sup> Second, the estimates of fruit and vegetable intake in the BEFSS were lower than with other methods of dietary assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440334">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712440334">26</xref></sup> Third, the self-report of pre-diabetes was an underestimate, as many were unaware of their status. Nevertheless, this study is the first to report lifestyle behaviors, general health practices, perceptions of health, and chronic diseases among black and white adults who were aware of their pre-diabetes status. These data can assist health care providers to develop focused interventions to address each culture/race.</p>

<title>Implications for Diabetes Educators</title>
<p>The standards of medical care in diabetes recommends that people with pre-diabetes be referred to receive lifestyle counseling and an ongoing support program to reach the goals of weight loss of 5%-10% of body weight and an increase in physical activity of at least 150 minutes/week of moderate activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712440334">12</xref></sup> Diabetes educators are often in the role of providing counseling and follow-up support. Although lifestyle modification is extremely effective in slowing or reversing the natural course of the development of diabetes, the task of motivating patients to lose weight and exercise is often challenging, especially if the strategies used are not culturally sensitive. Among all the behavioral modifications, dietary changes are the most difficult because food is an important part of oneâs life; making changes can make people feel âangry, depressed, and deprived.â<sup>28</sup> To have a successful education and counseling program for adults with pre-diabetes, it is crucial to understand the unique factors relevant to each subgroup so the strategies can be tailored and well received. The unique predictors identified from this study can help diabetes educators to design intervention programs to improve the success rate in the black population. A program targeting 1 behavior change may lead to further changes in other behaviors.</p>
