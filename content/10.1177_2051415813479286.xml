<p><italic>In the first of a three part series on expert witnesses, MPS Medicolegal Adviser Dr Sonya McCullough introduces the role of the expert witness</italic></p>
<sec id="section1-2051415813479286" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a Consultant Urologist your role as an expert witness is to assist the Court on specialist and technical matters within your field of practice. As such, your duty to the Court will override any obligation to the legal team instructing you. You will have a duty to act independently and not be influenced by the party retaining your services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2051415813479286">1</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2051415813479286">
<title>Factual or Expert Witness</title>
<p>There is, at times, confusion over these different roles. A factual witness is called to supply factual information obtained in their role as the treating doctor in a particular case. It is important in this situation to stick to the facts and not stray into providing opinions beyond the scope of your expertise.</p>
<p>However, in your role as an expert witness, you are being called to give an independent opinion on the facts of the case, based on your own specialist knowledge and experience, but without any personal involvement in treatment of the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2051415813479286">
<title>Benefits of the Role</title>
<p>You will be required to assimilate the facts of the case, consider the questions asked of you and formulate an opinion based on your experience and qualifications. It is an opportunity to interact with the legal profession and the interface between medicine and the law can be stimulating and challenging. In formulating your reports, you will have a unique opportunity to reflect on your clinical practice. There is an altruistic satisfaction in assisting resolution of a dispute and there is also financial reward in carrying out such work. For anyone considering becoming an expert, it would be advisable to have at least ten years of specialist experience in urology and to have undergone training on giving evidence and the relevant law in the area where you will be providing advice and medicolegal reports, e.g. civil procedure rules.</p>
<p>You may be asked to provide an expert report in a number of settings. In a personal injury claim, you may be called upon by the claimant’s solicitors to provide a report on the extent of the injuries and the patient’s prognosis. So, for example, if the patient sustains trauma to the kidney during a road traffic accident you may be asked to comment on the injuries sustained and the patient’s likely future requirements, given his current clinical status.</p>
<p>In personal injury claims for compensation in respect of alleged clinical negligence, you will be asked to comment on whether there was a breach in the doctor’s duty of care and, if that is the case, whether that breach caused the insult complained of. You will be provided with instruction by the defendant’s or claimant’s solicitor and relevant documentation. You may need to see and examine the patient yourself. Having furnished a report to the instructing solicitor, you may be required to attend a meeting with the client (defendant or claimant), the solicitor and Counsel. In the case of a defendant doctor, the representative from his defence organisation may also be present. In such cases you may be required to attend Court to provide evidence, but in medical negligence claims, the vast majority are settled before they ever get to Court.</p>
<p>In surgical cases, for example if the bowel is inadvertently damaged during a procedure, resulting in perforation, peritonitis and death, this could result in a civil claim, attendance at an Inquest and referral to the General Medical Council (GMC) for the treating doctor. As the expert, you could be asked to provide a report in any one of these settings. With respect to the regulator, you may be asked to comment on the doctor’s fitness to practise, based on the facts of the case.</p>
<p>The GMC provides a useful checklist of issues to consider when providing expert advice in any of the above settings.</p>

<title>Writing the Report</title>
<p>Having considered the above issues before preparing to write a report, you are now in a position to put pen to paper. Your report should be free standing. The reader should be able to glean key issues in the case, understanding the evidence available to reach a clear understanding of the range of expert opinion, without needing to look at any other document.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text2-2051415813479286">
<p>A good report will include:</p>

</boxed-text>
<p>In conclusion, there are a number of good reasons to consider acting as an expert. You may be called upon to provide advice and/or evidence in relation to a civil case such as a clinical negligence claim, an Inquest, at the GMC or, indeed, in the Criminal Court. Before embarking on this you should have the necessary experience and qualifications in urology, in addition to training in writing expert reports and giving evidence. There are risks associated with this work, however you are unlikely to run into any difficulty if you comply with the principles set down by the GMC and in the Civil Procedure Rules for such work.</p>
