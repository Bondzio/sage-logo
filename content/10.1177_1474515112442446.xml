<abstract>
<p>In 2005, the English Department of Health developed a National Service Framework for the identification and treatment of Arrhythmia. A new specialist role was recommended, the Arrhythmia Care Co-ordinator (ACC), to guide patients through their illness and coordinate their care. In 2006, to implement this policy, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) sponsored 32 new nursing ACC staff posts across England and Wales. The BHF also sponsored an evaluation to investigate the impact of ACC support on patients and caregivers, with 30 patients (18 men, 22 women) and 10 caregivers being drawn from a purposive sample across seven arrhythmia treatment centres. Two main key themes emerged to describe the patients’ experience of the new service: personalized coordinated care and learning to live with their condition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiac arrhythmias affect over 700,000 people in England, with the most prevalent type, atrial fibrillation (AF), affecting up to 1% of the population and accounting for 1% of the entire NHS budget.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112442446">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112442446">2</xref></sup> The care of people with arrhythmias varies according to the nature and severity of the condition, and is dependent upon locally available resources.</p>
<p>For many, initial expert assessment and reassurance by specially trained nurses or general practitioners is all that is necessary. Others may need to be seen by a cardiologist to ensure appropriate diagnosis and decide on the best treatment. Some require an ablation procedure or the insertion of an implanted device such as a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator. For some patients, catheter ablation, which aims to destroy or isolate the abnormal sources of electrical impulses that may be responsible for underlying AF, can be a successful treatment. However, not all patients respond well to ablation even after undergoing multiple procedures and still experience AF symptoms. Regular follow up may also be necessary, for example to ensure a device is functioning normally and the condition is stable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112442446">3</xref></sup> Pharmacological treatments for AF include anticoagulation with warfarin and other anti- arrhythmic drug treatments.</p>
<p>The symptoms of arrhythmia can be very frightening and in some patients this can lead to a fearful and restricted lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112442446">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112442446"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112442446">6</xref></sup> Anxiety and depression have been demonstrated as predictors of mortality in this clinical group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112442446">7</xref></sup> High levels of anxiety and depression are strongly associated with patients following the occurrence of any acute coronary event,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112442446">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112442446">9</xref></sup> with studies emphasizing the need to accurately identify significant anxiety and depression as soon as possible following a cardiac event. This is to ensure the delivery of a comprehensive treatment package that incorporates the psychological as well as physiological aspects of health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112442446">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112442446">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>‘Arrhythmia and Sudden Cardiac Death’, the UK governmental National Service Framework for arrhythmia was published in 2005<sup>12</sup> and introduced the idea of an Arrhythmia Care Co-ordinator (ACC) to operate as a guide and advocate for patients, claiming that this role would improve the quality of care, make it more efficient and therefore cost effective. The role of the ACC was to improve the educational, emotional, and practical support offered to patients and their families and to educate other health professionals in the most effective and evidence-based approaches to the management of arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112442446">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>There have been several previous studies of the effectiveness of specialist nurse-led care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112442446">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112442446"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112442446"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112442446">16</xref></sup> with the majority reporting a decrease in hospital readmissions, adverse clinical outcomes, and healthcare costs. Some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112442446">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112442446">16</xref></sup> have linked these positive outcomes to specialist nurse provision of patient education and support. The reported effect on health-related quality of life has been mixed. Results have ranged from improved quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112442446">17</xref></sup> to little or no effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112442446">18</xref></sup> All these studies were randomized control trials based on quantitative questionnaire measurements, not seeking to explore the effects of specialist nurses in depth using a qualitative approach.</p>
<p>This study, whilst embedded in a larger evaluation, aims to address this gap by using qualitative in depth interviews to report on the views of patients and caregivers about what they valued the most and the type of information and support they received through the introduction of a newly appointed arrhythmia specialist nurse</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112442446" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The BHF Care and Education Research Group at the University of York was commissioned to carry out a 3-year evaluation of BHF-ACC services.</p>
<p>While the evaluation used multiple data sources and mixed methods, this paper reports on one element of the qualitative part of the evaluation (interviews) and assesses the effect of a new ACC role from patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives. We used telephone interviews to explore the role of ACCs in providing care to arrhythmia patients, with a sample of patients and caregivers in seven centres. The centres were chosen to reflect four aspects that differentiated the 19 sites: (1) number of nurses appointed; (2) intensity of workload; (3) rural vs. urban site location; and (4) whether the site was a major or minor implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implanting centre.</p>
<p>We developed a topic guide for the interviews, but ensured we adopted a flexible position in order to explore any emerging subjects that were raised. The patients’ topic guide covered three main areas: (1) their understanding of their condition; (2) their experiences of health services; and (3) their views of the arrhythmia nurse service. The topic guide for caregivers covered three areas: (1) their caring responsibilities and impact of caring; (2) patients’ health and wellbeing; and (3) their views of ACC services.</p>
<p>The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. National and local ethical approvals were gained from sites prior to commencement of interviews. Quotes used have been anonymized and coded.</p>
<sec id="section3-1474515112442446">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited patients according to a sampling strategy designed to capture a representative sample of the patients seen by the ACCs using: age, sex, type of condition, and centre type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112442446">Table 1</xref>). Study details were given to the patients by the nurses with a consent form to be returned directly to the research team. We excluded patients with a written case record of cognitive deficit and caregivers who had been recently bereaved. Altogether, 50 patients were approached and 40 agreed to be interviewed. From the 40, we interviewed 30 patients and 10 caregivers by telephone between February and October 2008, continuing until a point of information saturation was reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112442446">17</xref></sup> According to Sandelowski,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112442446">19</xref></sup> determining adequate sample size in qualitative research involves judgement and experience on part of the researchers along with an evaluation of the information collected and the purpose for which it will be used.</p>

<p>The patients were predominantly white British (28/30) and divided equally by sex. Mean age was 64 for women and 65 for men. Around half had significant comorbidities including diabetes, back pain, and asthma. Three of them, all male, lived on their own; the remaining 27 lived either with spouses or adult children.</p>
<p>Participants came from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and a large number were retired. Five patients gave up work following diagnosis, primarily due to their deteriorating condition, while three reverted to part-time hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112442446">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>All interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ permission and ranged in length from 30 to 60 minutes. Data collection included the interviewer’s notes made during and after the interview to record any relevant contextual details. All interviews were carried out in English and subsequently transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1474515112442446">
<title>Analysis of data</title>
<p>A constant comparative method was used to look at differences and similarities in experiences by sex, age, and condition. Subsequently, an index was constructed, drawing upon a priori issues informed by the original research aims, as well as issues which emerged as the interviews progressed. A coding frame was applied to each transcript and relevant text was indexed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112442446">20</xref></sup> Indexed data was transferred to a grid to compare cases and identify similarities and differences.</p>
<p>To check reliability of coding and to minimize the effects of bias, we ensured that two team members that were not involved in the data collection process examined a random data sample and compared their coding strategies and interpretations. After the thematic framework supporting the index was confirmed, all the coded data was linked with similar sections of text from all interviews. This process allowed for the comparison of participants’ accounts and incorporation of deviant cases into emerging themes. Research team meetings were regularly held to discuss the data.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1474515112442446" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients and caregivers were keen to list the many ways in which the new service improved on the care they had previously received or, in the case of new patients, helped them understand their condition and treatment options. Two main themes emerged: the interpersonal skills of the ACCs and the personalized care that patients now received.</p>
<sec id="section7-1474515112442446">
<title>Personalized coordinated care</title>
<p>Patients pointed out that the new service was more efficient because they now had a designated contact person. The ACC acted as an access point and guide, with patients commenting that as a result they felt less anxious: ‘Patients have a nurse’s name, so it’s personal: a name and a number. I hope it will be perpetuated and extended to other parts of the country. I think it’s marvellous’ (70-year-old white female).</p>
<p>Many patients were not confident in asking for help, so they appreciated dealing with someone they had met and interacted with before: ‘The whole set-up has been extremely positive. I compare and contrast with my brother-in-law who had this serious heart condition and who was pushed from pillar to post and who hardly ever saw the same person twice, and he is quite envious of the fact that in his area they don’t have the benefit of a BHF nurse’ (77-year-old white female).</p>
<p>Nurses also often acted as intermediaries when things went wrong: for example, after repeated mistakes by a hospital (inappropriate advice, misdiagnosis, wrong medication). One patient felt able to continue using the hospital’s services because of the ACC’s support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1474515112442446">
<title>Accessibility</title>
<p>Patients had contact with specialist nurses at the hospital, at home, and over the telephone. Many patients who had previous experience of the arrhythmia service expressed great satisfaction with the increased access to advice and the new ease of contact: ‘I mean who else am I gonna talk to? A doctor hasn’t got the time to talk to me, a specialist is not there to talk to, I’ve got to have an intermediary, and she is it’ (48-year-old white male).</p>
<p>Patients reported feeling reassured by having their ACC’s phone number and being able to call them between 8 am and 7 pm on weekdays or leave a message outside those times. Informal phone consultations made an enormous difference, especially to people with limited mobility or who lived far from the hospital. The nurses’ reliability in returning calls was also appreciated. Although the issues or concerns were relatively minor they often affected the patient’s quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112442446">
<title>Learning to live with the condition</title>
<p>Patients entered the service with different levels of knowledge. Some patients, for example, those with congenital heart disease, stated they were knowledgeable about their condition, but for others, the onset of symptoms had been sudden, making them keenly aware of their information deficit and of the powerless feeling this engendered.</p>
<p>Before specialist nurses came into place, ICD patients mainly sought information from ICD technicians but were sometimes frustrated as these were often under-staffed and too busy to give explanations. Appointments with consultants could be intimidating and patients often forgot some of their questions. Patients appreciated the chance to ask questions covering the entire spectrum of knowledge, from simple to specialized: ‘I was given reassurance, and it was pointed out what could happen . . . I was given all the information; I was told the truth. The choice, at the end of the day, was left to me’ (76-year-old white male).</p>
<p>The patient interviews illustrated that the effects of a heart condition were not simply limited to the patient, but were also felt by the patient’s family and caregivers. The specialist nurses took the needs of patients and caregivers into consideration and acted as a major form of support, providing much needed information, taking time to hear their concerns, and providing explanations and reassurance,</p>
<p>Patients remarked that doctors often lacked time for explanations. Some remarked that doctors ‘speak down’ to people, much preferring the nurses’ approach: ‘They explained things to the point even I could understand and they were reassuring in a practical, positive way, not in a “there, there, dear; don’t worry” kind of manner that some consultants have’ (67-year-old South Asian female).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112442446">
<title>Support groups</title>
<p>A number of nurses had organized or rejuvenated defunct local patient support groups, thus providing a forum where patients and their families could share experiences: ‘I absolutely loved going to the support group, it gave me the opportunity to ask questions and meet others, my partner also found it useful, she could finally understand that I wasn’t the only one with this implant inside me’ (72-year-old white male).</p>
<p>Patients felt grateful that they had the opportunity to meet people who had been living with a life threatening condition for many years and felt hopeful that they too could have a future: ‘When I was diagnosed and they told me that I was going to have this implant my world just fell apart but seeing the nurses before and after my operation was wonderful’ (72 year-old white female).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112442446">
<title>Practical help</title>
<p>Patients cited many ways in which their lives had been improved by practical help from the nurse. For example, one patient had derived comfort from the ‘relaxing tape’ given to her by the ACC. Another recounted how, before her holiday, her ACC would help her find the nearest hospital at her destination in case of a problem. Several patients said that in many cases, phone calls or appointments with ACCs had replaced hospital visits and that they were happier that way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112442446">
<title>Psychological support</title>
<p>Many patients felt anxious or depressed about their illness and its effect on their lives. Some had been prescribed antidepressants and many had to restrain from health-enhancing activities such as walking or swimming.</p>
<p>However, patients reported that encouragement from the nurses had helped them restart some leisure activities they had previously enjoyed: ‘The service is extremely important. They reassure you. It’s a confidence booster. If you’ve got an illness, that’s the one thing you need. To have someone to say “Don’t worry about it, ring us and we’ll talk it through with you”’ (73-year-old white male).</p>
<p>The majority felt that the nurses had made things better for them and had helped them come to terms with their condition: ‘I’ve always said I don’t mind what you tell me, but I want the truth. I don’t want to be placated with anything short of, I don’t want them to tell, well, it’s possibly going to be alright. I don’t want the details, but I just want to know the truth and I’ve always found that they do that’ (64-year-old white male).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1474515112442446">
<title>Involving caregivers</title>
<p>The caregiver interviews illustrated that the effects of a heart condition were not simply limited to the patient, but also felt by the patient’s family and other caregivers. The arrhythmia nurses emerged as educators and confidantes not only for their designated patients, but also for caregivers. These were reassured by the ACCs’ presence and clearly very much in favour of this new approach. Many praised the quality of the care that patients were receiving: ‘It’d be a shame if it (the service) goes down. Because they are so good, they are, I mean, you could be talking to a consultant when you are talking to them, they’re dedicated to what they’re doing’ (caregiver of 63-year-old white female).</p>
<p>For caregivers of newly diagnosed patients there were many new and frightening aspects to this new life, and they were immensely grateful for the specialist nurses’ assistance and guidance through the initial shock.</p>
<p>Patient support groups were also highlighted as a valuable resource for caregivers, who were invited to attend, ask questions, and meet other caregivers. This was seen as a priceless platform for exchanging stories and helpful information, with patients and their caregivers benefiting equally.</p>

<sec id="section14-1474515112442446" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nurse specialist services are becoming more widely established in the UK health service. However, there has been little prior work addressing the effects of site-specific specialist arrhythmia nurses; previous research investigated the impact of specific nursing interventions in different patient groups. Indeed, evaluating the impact of disease-specific specialist nursing roles has been acknowledged as fraught with difficulty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112442446">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112442446"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112442446">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>We believe that we interviewed a sufficient number of patients and that our sample was representative of the wide range of patients seen by nurses. A limitation was that the majority of patients we interviewed were white British. One problem was that the list of patients from which we purposively sampled was chosen by the nurses, and potentially excluded those that may have been critical of the service. Also, the mean age of interviewees was high (men 65; women 64); we were unable to interview younger patients possibly diagnosed with genetic conditions like Brugada or long-QT syndrome, who may have given us a more critical perspective. Furthermore, the use of the telephone instead of face-to-face interviews may deprive the researcher of witnessing the respondents’ nonverbal communication, although there is evidence that telephone interviewing is an acceptable and valuable method of data collection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112442446">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112442446">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hobbs and Murray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112442446">26</xref></sup> observed that specialist nurses are unlikely to make a positive impact on care outcomes if their role is essentially limited to coordination, especially if such services themselves are of variable quality. When nurses have a well-defined role – offering additional and specialized care such as monitoring treatment or managing follow up or specific patient education and support – they seem to have a more effective impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112442446">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>A strength of the paper is that it is not solely focused on AF patients, but covers the views of a wide range of patients (ICD, AF, palpitations, syncope) presenting to a specialist arrhythmia nurse. It reports on the social and lived experiences of patients and provides valuable evidence on the different ways a specialist nursing role can significantly improve the lives of patients and caregivers.</p>
<p>Incorporation of a specialist nurse role, as described, may prove challenging in the international context due to the sheer diversity of healthcare delivery systems. This model of care is underpinned by the role of the specialist nurses and fits well into existing European healthcare systems, particularly in the Scandinavian and Dutch contexts. However, we see no reason why the core elements of the specialist nurse role could not be adapted to respond to the particular needs of other European countries where these nursing roles are still in their infancy.</p>
<p>This study concurs with other studies that specialist nurses can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112442446">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112442446"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112442446">30</xref></sup> The nurses were seen by patients and their family caregivers as educators, counsellors, clinicians, facilitators, and advocates, forming an improved link between other health professionals (GPs, consultants) and patients/caregivers, as well as providing practical help that improved the patients’ quality of life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study indicates that specialist nurses can play an important role in arrhythmia care and can exert a positive and beneficial impact on the patient experience. Also it is vitally important to appreciate the uniqueness of the role and to protect them from the financial pressures faced by the NHS.</p>
<p>Data collected as part of another element of the evaluation (Ismail et al., in preparation) confirmed the main emphasis for BHF-ACCs as the delivery of care coordination and information and support. Future research eliciting the views and measures of health-related quality of life for patients and caregivers prior to the introduction of specialist nursing care would enhance understanding of the effectiveness of the intervention. Thought needs to be given to how specialist nurses might be best used in the future to improve care quality and effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112442446">31</xref></sup></p>
