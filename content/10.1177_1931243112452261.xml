<abstract>
<p>This study examines National Broadcasting Company (NBC)’s U.S. broadcast coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games for gender equality and compares that coverage to previous years. Olympics coverage is particularly important to female athletes because many receive little media attention beyond Olympic competition. The study found that, while female participation in the Olympics has increased, NBC’s coverage of women’s events has not, and 97% of airtime devoted to women’s events was confined to six “socially acceptable” sports.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this study, we examine the amount and scope of National Broadcasting Company (NBC)’s coverage (as broadcast to the United States) of men and women competing in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and how that coverage compares to previous years. Who and what are covered at the Olympic Games is particularly important to women in sports, because many of those athletes and the sports they participate in receive little coverage beyond Olympic competition. How they are framed on the world’s largest and most important sports stage warrants close scrutiny.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1931243112452261">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The Olympic Charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243112452261">International Olympics Committee, 2007</xref>) declares sport to be a human right, open to all people “in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.” Its guiding principles include a rejection of any form of that based on discrimination, including race, religion, and gender. Because of the spirit of international cooperation of the events, and because of their extraordinary worldwide popularity, the Olympic Games represent multicultural acceptance and egalitarianism unmatched by all but the most far-reaching international organizations.</p>
<p>News coverage of sports, however, has never been as egalitarian as the Olympic ideal, particularly in regard to gender. In a series of content analyses of news and highlight shows between 1989 and 2004, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112452261">Duncan, Messner, and Williams (2005)</xref> found that the small percentage of sports coverage devoted to women—less than 10%—has not significantly changed. Female Olympians fare much better, but still receive less attention than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243112452261">Billings, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243112452261">Bissell &amp; Holt 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1931243112452261">Tuggle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1931243112452261">Tuggle, Huffman, &amp; Rosengard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1931243112452261">Tuggle and Owen, 1999</xref>). This paucity of reporting has reinforced the stereotypical dominance of male athletes, making female athletes at best marginal and at worst, nearly invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1931243112452261">Hargreaves, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1931243112452261">1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Lack of parity of attention takes a toll on the audience as well as the participants. Several studies in the United Kingdom have found that girls find it challenging to manage preconceptions of femininity and sexuality while participating in sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243112452261">Cockburn &amp; Clarke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1931243112452261">Harris, 2007</xref>). This is despite the fact that, during the past 35 years, the number of American girls playing varsity sports has risen from one of the every 27 to one of the three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243112452261">Benjamin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall cultural significance of sport cannot be underestimated in this regard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1931243112452261">Rowe (1999</xref>, p. 23) explains it this way: “If culture is the ‘stuff’ of everyday life—the frame through which we experience, interpret, mould and represent everything that surrounds us—then sport occupies. . .an uncommonly prominent position within it.”</p>
<p>Television coverage is a frame, a window on the world, through which we learn of ourselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1931243112452261">Tuchman, 1978a</xref>). Frames are important because they help build “the pictures. . . in our heads”—the stereotypes on which we base our thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1931243112452261">Lippmann, 1922</xref>, p. 59). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112452261">Edelman (1993</xref>, p. 232) describes the social world as “a kaleidoscope of potential realities, any of which can be readily evoked by altering the ways in which observations are framed and categorized.”</p>
<p>The sports industry and sports media have traditionally been male defined and controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1931243112452261">McDaniel &amp; Sullivan, 1998</xref>). Framing theory suggests that gender stereotypes persist in media coverage because ways of representing gender have become standardized in news practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1931243112452261">Gamson &amp; Modigliani, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1931243112452261">Pan &amp; Kosicki, 1993</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243112452261">Entman (1993</xref>, p. 52), news workers incorporate framing when they “select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more [or less] salient in communicating a text.” Framing is thus achieved through the processes of selecting events for coverage and then producing the coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243112452261">Entman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1931243112452261">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1931243112452261">Tuchman, 1978b</xref>).</p>
<p>Women were not allowed to compete in the first modern Olympics in 1896 because it was thought to be “inappropriate” for them to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1931243112452261">May-Mons, 2000</xref>). At the 1900 Olympics in Paris, France, women competed in only tennis and golf. The percentage of female competitors has risen steadily since their initial inclusion in the 1900 games, when they comprised only 1.6% of competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1931243112452261">International Olympics Committee, 2009</xref>). Now women compete in all Olympic sports except baseball and boxing. Four thousand six hundred and nine women competed in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, comprising 42.3% of the 10,904 competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1931243112452261">International Olympics Committee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The 1960 Games marked the first-time women’s events were televised into U.S. homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243112452261">Creedon, 1994</xref>), and both the number of females competing and the proportion of broadcast coverage devoted to them have increased with each successive Olympics until the 2000 Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243112452261">Leder, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243112452261">Boutilier &amp; SanGiovanni, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112452261">Bryant, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243112452261">Duncan and Messner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243112452261">Hallmark &amp; Armstrong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1931243112452261">Hilliard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243112452261">Himmelberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243112452261">Huffman, Tuggle, &amp; Rosengard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1931243112452261">Lattimore, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1931243112452261">Messner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1931243112452261">Tuggle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1931243112452261">Tuggle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1931243112452261">Tuggle and Owen, 1999</xref>) have found that coverage of female athletes pales in comparison to coverage of males in sports at all competition levels. This difference manifests itself in several ways: (1) total column inches and running times, (2) persons quoted, (3) placement of articles and stories, (4) presence and size/length, (5) placement of an accompanying photograph or videotaped highlight, (6) the range of sports depicted in photos and tapes, and (7) the size and content of newspaper headlines and magazine article titles. In a study examining gender representation of female athletes on three leading sports websites (CBS SportsLine, CNNSI, and ESPN), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243112452261">Kachgal (2001)</xref> found that female athletes received less coverage than male athletes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243112452261">Huffman, Tuggle, and Rosengard (2004)</xref> found that campus media, covering both professional and amateur sports, also devoted significantly more space and time to male athletes than female athletes.</p>
<p>Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243112452261">Kane (1989)</xref> found that women in more “feminine” or “socially acceptable” sports such as tennis and golf received significantly more coverage than women who participated in “socially unacceptable” sports. Eleanor Metheny observed that social mores influenced the acceptability of a sport type for women because femininity requires graceful and aesthetically pleasing body motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1931243112452261">Metheny, 1965</xref>). Her taxonomy included swimming, gymnastics, and tennis as socially acceptable sports, while softball, basketball, and track were unacceptable. This was confirmed by survey research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1931243112452261">Spreitzer, Snyder &amp; Kivlin, 1978</xref>) and has remained stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1931243112452261">Kane, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1931243112452261">Kane and Parks (1990)</xref> found that women participating in “acceptable” sport types received more coverage in Sports Illustrated than did women engaged in “unacceptable” sports. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112452261">Lumpkin and Williams (1991)</xref> found that this was true regardless of race, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1931243112452261">Leath and Lumpkin (1992)</xref> found it to be true even of a magazine devoted to women in sport. In the 1992 summer Olympics, women in feminine, individual sports such as tennis and gymnastics were given more airtime than those playing team sports like basketball.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1931243112452261">Messner (1992)</xref> concluded that sports news means men’s sports news and that sport is a key component to our current gender order. “A key to whether or not increasing female athleticism will amount to a real challenge to sport’s role in a system of masculine domination is whether and how the media cover girls’ and women’s sport” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1931243112452261">Messner, 1992</xref>, p. 164).</p>
<p>Historically, women’s team sports have been slower to gain acceptance at the Olympics than have individual women’s sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243112452261">Leder, 1996</xref>). In their content analysis of NBC’s coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1931243112452261">Tuggle and Owen (1999)</xref> found that men’s team competitions received substantially more coverage than did women’s team events, and women in sports that involved power or hard physical contact between athletes received almost no attention. In their study of NBC’s coverage of the Summer Olympics in Sydney, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1931243112452261">Tuggle, Huffman, and Rosengard (2002)</xref> found that women received proportionately less coverage in 2000 than they did in 1996 on the U.S. network. In Athens, NBC’s coverage of women’s events returned to the 1996 levels, even though women comprised a smaller portion of the total number of athletes competing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1931243112452261">Tuggle, Huffman, &amp; Rosengard, 2007</xref>). In both the Games, however, coverage focused on individual events, with women competing in team sports receiving relatively little coverage. As was the case in 1996, women who competed in 2000 in sports involving power or hard physical contact received almost no attention. The same was true in 2004.</p>
<p>The degree to which the media cover female athletes helps mold society’s view of female athletes and its perceptions of women in general. Sports media reflect, shape, and might even help create attitudes and values about what type of sports participation is appropriate and acceptable for females. Decisions about which sports to cover and how extensively to cover them can reinforce preconceived concepts among audience members about which sports and which athletes really matter and create a self-perpetuation stereotype of women and sports.</p>
<p>Sportswriters and sportscasters must be selective in what they cover because of limitations of resources, space and/or time, and often base their coverage on the perceived level of reader or viewer interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243112452261">Belliotti, 1983</xref>). NBC appears to have been successful in this, as it consistently led in national broadcast ratings, and in sum achieved the status of the highest viewership of any televised event of all time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243112452261">TVWeek, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the ratings success, NBC’s coverage did not come without some criticism. Some accuse NBC Sports of devoting a disproportionate amount of coverage of women’s events to those that involved leotards and swimsuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243112452261">Billings, 2008</xref>; Mediapost, 2004). In the 2008 Summer Games, men’s volleyball and beach volleyball were equally covered (approximately 2 hr of total time each), while women’s volleyball received no coverage, and women’s beach volleyball was 1.75 times that of men’s. All four teams earned medals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1931243112452261">Sports Reference, 2008</xref>), and yet the women’s coverage was limited to the bikini-clad athletes. Some would argue that this was not an accident.</p>
<sec id="section3-1931243112452261">
<title>Research Hypotheses</title>
<p>Based on previous research, we make the following predictions concerning NBC’s coverage of male and female athletes competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Men’s team sports typically gather more attention than women’s team sports. Additionally, men’s team sports outnumbered women’s team sports in Beijing 34 to 32, and so it is expected that coverage of men’s team sports will outweigh coverage of women’s team sports.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1. </italic>Men’s team sports will receive slightly more coverage than women’s team sports.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Previous studies have found that television coverage of women’s sports in general tends toward events such as tennis, golf, gymnastics, and swimming, what some have called “socially acceptable” sports for women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1931243112452261">Tuggle et al. (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1931243112452261">2007</xref>) found that the most-covered events for women in both the Sydney (2000) and Athens (2004) Summer Games were gymnastics, diving, swimming, and track, gymnastics being the clear leader. Beach volleyball, a new event in 2004, joined the list. All of these sports are defined by the authors to be “socially acceptable” forms of female athleticism. NBC’s coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics is expected to follow this pattern.</p>
<list list-type="simple">

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>

Although the amount of coverage of women competing in the 2008 Olympics is expected to be more balanced than that found in highlights programs in the past, the proportion of females as on-camera sources is expected to mirror what was found in earlier studies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>NBC in recent years has expanded coverage of Olympic events into other day parts and onto its website—in the 2008 Olympics, 61% of its video coverage was online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1931243112452261">Stelter, 2010</xref>). Last year, NBC announced its intention to stream and broadcast the 2012 Olympics live, a departure from its previous policy of holding broadcasts of sports the network expected to draw broad interest until prime time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112452261">Cromwell, 2011</xref>). However, this has not diminished the importance of the prime-time broadcast, when networks can reach the largest audiences and make the most revenue from advertisers. From 1988 to 2004, average prime-time Olympic broadcast ratings were at least twice as high as those in other day parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1931243112452261">Nielsen, 2008a</xref>). Indeed, NBC intends to rebroadcast events of high interest in prime time to a larger audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112452261">Cromwell, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>NBC’s Internet coverage attracted approximately 33.8 million unique visitors during the 2-week event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1931243112452261">The Nielsen Company, 2008b</xref>), not quite equaling the 34.8 million viewers of the opening ceremony on Friday, August 8. NBC’s average prime-time viewership during the 2-week period was approximately 27.7 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1931243112452261">The Nielsen Company, 2008</xref>, August 27). In 2009, advertisers spent 57% of their money on television, 50% of which was spent on prime-time broadcast advertising. By contrast, only 7% of ad revenue went to the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1931243112452261">The Nielsen Company, 2010</xref>). In fact, NBC dialed back its online streaming coverage of the 2010 Vancouver Games to 48%, in part to encourage prime-time viewership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1931243112452261">Stelter, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Aside from its coverage on its main channel, NBC Universal also broadcast events and highlights of the Beijing Olympics on its cable networks, USA, Telemundo, MSNBC, CNBC, and Oxygen. While the latter three received a substantial ratings bump from their Olympics coverage, the combined daily ratings of these five cable channels during their Olympics coverage was approximately 12% the size of NBC’s daily ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112452261">Magna International, Inc., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, the authors chose to concentrate on the prime-time broadcasts of the NBC main channel. The sample consisted of digital video recordings of NBC’s prime-time Olympics coverage for the dates August 8–24, 2008; a total of 16 days, 15 of which involved competition. Opening and closing ceremonies were not included in the analysis. Also removed from analysis were segments that did not include direct participation by athletes, such as stories detailing the history of China, or other human-interest features.</p>
<p>Once all data were collected, the content was coded. The unit of analysis was the broadcast segment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1931243112452261">1</xref>
</sup> This study replicated the coding schemes of previous studies of the Olympic Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1931243112452261">Tuggle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1931243112452261">Tuggle &amp; Owen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1931243112452261">Tuggle et al., 2002</xref>). Coding indicated the sport, the length of the segment, the type of presentation (event, interview, awards ceremony, etc.), the sex of the participants, the role of quoted sources (athlete, coach, sports official, etc.) whether the segment was presented live (or as live) or edited into condensed form, whether the competition involved physical power or hard body contact as a primary component, and whether individual or team medals were at stake. In addition, coding indicated the job description of all speakers (anchor, reporter, etc.) and the speaker’s sex. Coding was completed by the authors. Because all data were categorical in nature (i.e., either a segment fell into a category or did not), calculating intercoder reliability was not necessary. The data were then compiled using SPSS 16.0 for Windows. Because the study captures the entire population under study (all of NBC’s prime-time Olympics coverage), there is no need for inferential statistics, as measured differences in percentages were actual differences, not projected differences based on a sample of the coverage. Nonparametric tests are used.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>In 2008, women competed in 42% (127) of the 302 Olympic events. American women made up 48% (286) of the U.S. team, and claimed 48% (53) of the nation’s 110 medals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1931243112452261">Sports Reference, 2008</xref>). Teams consisting of men and women competing together netted 4 medals, and men claimed 53 (48%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1931243112452261">Sports Reference, 2008</xref>). Hence, women’s medal success was proportional to the number of events in which they participated. If medal success was the only criterion for coverage, U.S. women should have received 48% of NBC’s prime-time coverage. Women received approximately 46.3% of total airtime, falling nearly two points from 2004 (47.9%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243112452261">Table 1</xref> shows the percentage of airtime by sex since 1996.</p>

<p>While coverage of male events was more substantial in 2008 than coverage of female events, males did not receive more coverage than females in every category. Most notably, women received far more coverage than men in individual diving, beach volleyball, and gymnastics—particularly team gymnastics. Nevertheless, males received more airtime, especially in individual events. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1931243112452261">Table 2</xref>, men garnered more airtime than women in six of the eleven events, four of which had no female coverage. Even though in four of the six individual categories women received more coverage, men still received more airtime for individual events overall. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2 predicted that “socially acceptable” sports would comprise the bulk of women’s individual and team coverage. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1931243112452261">Table 3</xref> shows, nearly 60% of women’s coverage was devoted to gymnastics and swimming or diving. The authors argue that beach volleyball should be included in this list of socially acceptable sports, as since its arrival as an official Olympic sport in 1996, it has been widely cited by media and academia as an example of popularity driven by sex appeal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243112452261">Armstrong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243112452261">Bissell &amp; Duke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1931243112452261">Lines, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1931243112452261">2007</xref>). With the inclusion of this sport in the socially acceptable category, nearly 75% of the coverage of women’s sports was given to acceptable sports. It should be noted that it is now customary for the participants in all of these events and in track and field events to wear the equivalent of a bathing suit—making up almost 98% of the coverage. The remaining sports represented—rowing, cycling, and fencing—are not, by traditional standards, “socially acceptable” sports for women, and make up approximately 2% of coverage. Fencing coverage, receiving the smallest portion (.25%) of airtime devoted to women, consisted of an interview of the three American women who won the gold, silver, and bronze medals in the saber competition. As neither male nor female fencers received any further coverage, the three-medal sweep was probably the only reason the sport received any airtime. Hypothesis 2 was supported.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 3 predicted that coverage of sports involving physical bulk, power exerted against an opponent or object, or unpenalized hard contact would concentrate on men. Both male and female teams competed in all of these events except for boxing, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1931243112452261">Table 4</xref>. The difference based on sex was remarkable, in that it reversed the trend found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1931243112452261">Tuggle 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1931243112452261">Tuggle et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1931243112452261">2007</xref>). Overall, most power sports were not covered outside of brief news mentions and medal counts. Of the two events that did receive live or as-live coverage—track and field and cycling—women’s events received the lion’s share. The leaders in women’s coverage were the pole vault event and an awards ceremony for the discus gold medal winner, the bulk of the time (approximately 11 min) devoted to the pole vault. Consequently, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 4 predicted that on-camera comments would be more likely to come from male participants or observers. It was supported, as male sources received significantly more airtime than female sources. The only category in which the opposite was true was the smallest (family and friends) because of a long interview with the mother of swimming star Michael Phelps. While it is not known what percentage of current and former coaches present at the Olympics were male, the vast majority of comments came from current athletes, and 60% of those were men, overrepresenting the 53% majority of male athletes.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Discussion</title>
<p>In 2008, female representation grew to 48% of the U.S. team, and yet coverage of women’s events fell to 46.3%. This is in contrast to previous years, when coverage exceeded participation for women. In Athens in 2004, for example, women made up 40.7% of the U.S. team, yet received 47.9% of airtime. For those events that did receive airtime, the Beijing Olympics upheld the long-observed maxim that for female athletes to garner media coverage, they must be involved in socially acceptable individual sports and/or sports that highlight body type. Women who take part in sports that involve either power or hard body contact are particularly unlikely to receive media coverage. When women engage in stereotypically feminine events, or look pretty or graceful, they will receive coverage, but risk being shunned if they venture from that space.</p>
<p>As in 1996, 2000, and 2004, gymnastics accounted for the largest percentage of airtime devoted to women. More recently, beach volleyball has come to prominence, beginning in 2004. While there is no doubt of the athletic prowess of the gold medal-winning American women’s team, it is curious that while men’s volleyball coverage was split nearly equally between beach and court volleyball, women’s court volleyball received no coverage, despite the fact that those athletes won a silver medal. In contrast, women’s beach volleyball was the second-most covered event for women at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Since 1996, women’s representation in the “big three” team sports (basketball, soccer, and softball) has precipitously declined. In 2008, they disappeared from the schedule entirely. This is despite the fact that American women remain a dominating force in the field, taking home gold medals in basketball and soccer, and a silver medal in softball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1931243112452261">Sports Reference, 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, men’s basketball and baseball each received more than 20 min of airtime.</p>
<p>Softball and baseball were the focus of a feature on August 18, 2008, lasting 4 min and 40 s. The topic of the feature was the elimination of both sports from Olympic competition, apparently for opposite reasons. (Men’s) baseball teams fail to attract the star-caliber players that are common in soccer and basketball, which make the competitions less than thrilling. On the other hand, the U.S. softball team is such a dominating force that there is virtually no competition for the gold medal. This might also explain why NBC chose to provide only limited coverage of these two sports, and yet the men’s team received 24 min of event coverage, while the women’s team received none.</p>
<p>Men not only get more coverage, they are given more opportunity to speak about their accomplishments. The number of female athletes quoted falls at about 40% of the total number of interviews, lower than the overall coverage percentage. Although NBC used only a small number of quotes from male coaches, the network used no live or taped comments from female coaches. This was also true of the 2004 Olympics in Athens. NBC’s coverage of the 2008 Olympics and the three before it was, of course, an improvement compared to the time when women’s participation in almost <italic>any</italic> sport was socially unacceptable. But perhaps more noteworthy than the amount of coverage is <italic>what </italic>is covered. Even today, it seems that women are accepted as athletes only if they continue to look and act as women are expected to look and act.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that a network’s primary concern is to deliver audiences to advertisers, and consequently it is likely to maximize audience sizes by putting the most popular sports events during prime time. It is not the contention of the authors that NBC is intentionally marginalizing any athletes. Instead, the network appears to be responding to the general public’s interest level in various sports, which was, in turn, influenced by social attitudes about femininity. Indeed, five of the top eight events in terms of ratings were women’s swimming and gymnastics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112452261">Magna International, Inc., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, by following public opinion, there is a missed opportunity to change public opinion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243112452261">Boutlier and San Giovanni (1983)</xref> noted that the media’s treatment of the relationship between women and sport shapes the direction and content of that relationship. A decision to spend more airtime on socially “unacceptable” sports may go a long way to making it “acceptable.” Based on the network’s ratings and profit success from the Beijing Games, however, there seems to be little incentive for NBC to change its approach when covering the 2012 Olympics in London.</p>
