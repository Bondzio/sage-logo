<p>Until recently the historiography of El Salvador was often a reflection of its geographical size. The few works that appeared in print often focused on La Matanza (the first communist-led revolt in the Western Hemisphere) or on the civil war of 1972–1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12453897">Anderson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12453897">Browning, 1971</xref>). While the three volumes under consideration here do not overlook these historical events, two of them—<italic>Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador</italic>, by Elizabeth Jean Wood, and <italic>Waves of Protest</italic>, by Paul D. Almeida—suggest that El Salvador offers a unique opportunity for understanding the growth and success of collective social movements in a violent and repressive state while the third, <italic>Landscapes of Struggle</italic>, edited by Aldo Lauria-Santiago and Leigh Binford, assembles the ideas of some of the most preeminent scholars on the area to provide a contemporary understanding of El Salvador’s people and culture. Taken together, they serve as a reminder that scholars should not “ignore the ways in which large, long-term explanations are built from small, local experiences, including those of seemingly marginal people” (Lauria-Santiago and Binford, in <italic>Landscapes</italic>, 14).</p>
<p>Divided into three sections, <italic>Landscapes of Struggle</italic> is paving the way for new scholarship on El Salvador by aspiring to foment the same type of intellectual dialogue that <italic>Everyday Forms of State Formation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12453897">Gilbert and Nugent, 1994</xref>) did for Mexico. It begins with articles by Aldo Lauria-Santiago, Victor Hugo Acuña Ortega, Erik Ching, Kati Griffith, Leslie Gates, and Carlos Benjamín Lara Martínez reinterpreting prewar Salvadoran history and making connections between local dynamics and national politics, including discussions of the rise of an urban middle class (Ortega), the local connections General Maximiliano Martínez used to maintain power (Ching), and the interplay between women and mid-twentieth-century labor reforms (Griffith and Gates).</p>
<p>The subsequent section analyzes the effects of the civil war on local politics. Leigh Binford examines the emergence of organic intellectuals and their influence on revolutionary politics. Elizabeth Wood describes the role cooperatives played in reconstructing the country. Vincent McElhinny reminds scholars that revolutionary alliances during the war often materialize in different ways in a postwar society. Irina Silber discusses the contribution of women’s revolutionary identities to the success of reconstruction projects, and Lisa Kowalchuk describes the often messy relationship between ideology, affluence, and land reform.</p>
<p><italic>Landscapes of Struggle</italic> ends with an examination of contemporary Salvadoran culture and the struggles the country faces in a globalized world. As the contributors to this section point out, the past often holds the keys to progress. In Henrik Ronsbo’s analysis of the way foreign organizations define ethnicity, emphasizing language and clothing, we see that El Salvador’s indigenous genocide in 1932 continues to haunt the country’s advancement even today. Ellen Moodie reports that the media’s portrayal of violent actions often frames stories in a way that reminds Salvadorans of their corrupted policing institutions, and David Pederson tells a fascinating story of an individual’s acquisition of remittances and the influence this gave him once he returned to El Salvador.</p>
<p>Complementing this anthology, <italic>Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador</italic> centers on the creation of social movements in El Salvador, unpacking the reasons insurgents chose to support the Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación Nacional (Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front—FMLN) despite the possibility of harsh retribution. Wood goes beyond the traditional revolutionary intellectuals’ accounts that tend to dominate the discussion of revolutionary action to describe the formation of revolutionary identity among campesinos in El Salvador’s rural areas.</p>
<p>Taking a more structural approach to the rise of collective social movements, <italic>Waves of Protest</italic> views El Salvador as a background for understanding the conditions that must occur for different social classes in the developing world to engage in mass defiance. While Almeida’s analysis makes a contribution to the literature surrounding the rise of collective movements, it lacks the local perspective of the other two books under review.</p>
<p>Any analysis of the rise of a social movement or a revolutionary action begins either with an examination of the individuals who instigate the process or the structural factors that might lead to an individual’s taking action. All three of these works clearly augment the work of scholars who emphasize individuals as the agents of revolution, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12453897">Michael Radu (1988)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12453897">Yvon Grenier (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12453897">Eric Selbin (1999)</xref>. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12453897">Grenier (1999</xref>: 2) explains, “Skocpol once asserted revolutions are made by countries, not by revolutionaries . . . [but] in contemporary developing countries, insurgencies are initiated by insurgents, not by countries. Countries make them more or less successful, but insurgents provide the impetus.” Similar to Grenier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12453897">Eric Selbin (1999</xref>: 66) argues that the “social revolution in particular—defined as it is by the effort to transform society—is largely the result of, composed of, and driven by human action, not simply structural phenomena.” This strand of the third generation of revolutionary scholarship focuses on the revolutionaries themselves rather than on the structural inequalities that marginalized populations were resisting.</p>
<p>At the heart of Wood’s argument in <italic>Insurgent Collective Action</italic> is her claim that Salvadorans felt a deep “moral indignation subsumed into a general belief in the justice of the struggle” (204). Along with many before her, she points to the dissemination of liberation theology through Christian base communities as one of the primary vehicles for reframing the fatalistic understanding of society that campesinos had developed after the Martínez massacres in 1932 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12453897">Cabarrús, 1983</xref>). The historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12453897">Anna Peterson (1997</xref>: 157) provides an eloquent summation of this fatalism when she writes: “Poor people have lived, at least since 1932 . . . and arguably since the conquest, in a culture of fear. This culture includes [among other things] lack of access to information . . . impediments to social organizations . . . vagueness of legal definitions for criminal activity . . . and open physical coercion, including torture, death, and the impunity with which these crimes are committed.”</p>
<p>In these ecclesiastical enclaves of learning, campesinos acquired a Christian-centered interpretation of state-supported violence that exposed the immorality of government actions and led to an aggressive form of defiance. Never before had the Church suggested that individuals should resist the dominant social order. Yet, with liberation theology spreading through these communities, progressive catechists became change agents who helped peasants find a space to claim their revolutionary identity. In “Peasants, Catechists, Revolutionaries: Organic Intellectuals in the Salvadoran Revolution” (in <italic>Landscapes</italic>) Binford describes these catechists as organic intellectuals who adapted urban-centric ideas to rural areas in places like Morazón.</p>
<p>Moral indignation was not, however, the only factor encouraging the formation of social movements in Wood’s case-study areas. Many of the participants in the insurgency also claimed that they committed defiant acts so that fellow activists or family members who had died would not have died in vain. In time, participants found what Wood calls “the pleasure of agency,” which produced a collective experience that rested on the process of making history and helping create a more just society. What makes her contribution unique is that many of her conclusions are drawn from map-making workshops with members of cooperatives and collectives. During these workshops, participants were asked to document how the borders of their cooperatives had changed during the course of the civil war. Through this process, Wood believes, they were effectively redrawing “the boundaries of class relationships” (43). In this instance, it was the individuals involved in these communities that engaged in defiance rather than the catechists or the Church. Effectively, Wood argues, that these cooperatives served as a vehicle for the transformation of the Salvadoran political culture during and after the war.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this transformation is documented in Wood’s chapter for <italic>Landscapes of Struggle</italic>, “Civil War and Reconstruction: The Repopulation of Tenancingo.” In it she shows how this small community became more collectively oriented when campesinos returned to their places of origin after the creation of an unarmed zone in the area. Under the guidance of the Salvadoran Foundation for Development and Housing, the relocation to Tenancingo succeeded in large part because of the aid of international actors and nongovernmental organizations that protected the project’s independence. Yet, Wood’s case study appears to be unique for that time period, since cooperatives were not widespread in El Salvador before or during the war.</p>
<p>Carlos Lara exposes the transformation of the township of Joya de Cerén in “The Formation of a Rural Community.” He suggests that collective memory in this community was plagued by a violent past that punished any communitarian endeavor. Community members therefore resisted any form of incorporation and instead deferred to businesses favoring subsistence-based agriculture. In “Between Clientelism and Radical Democracy,” Vincent McElhinny reveals a very different outcome. Researching a Salvadoran refugee camp in Honduras, he shows how a political culture built on “collective self-defense, participatory decision-making, a certain leveling of privilege, and unity against a common enemy” (in <italic>Landscapes</italic>, 165) was transplanted back to El Salvador during reconstruction. Named Ciudad Segundo Montes, this community, which embraced an alternative path to neoliberal development, is now grappling with a fractured identity as it struggles to prevail in a framework that values small enterprise over collective identity.</p>
<p>As does Wood’s study, Almeida’s <italic>Waves of Protest</italic> traces the evolution of the political culture in El Salvador. Decidedly more structural in approach, his argument is that cracks in a repressive political culture can encourage “protest waves”—“periods of widespread protest activity across <italic>multiple</italic> collectivities that often encompass a sizable portion of the national territory” (12). He suggests that these protest waves are a result of people’s mobilizing to take advantage of political liberalization, to resist government intimidation, or to preserve social good in the wake of globalization. By examining these different political constellations he hopes to assist scholars, activists, and movements in understanding the particular conditions that are conducive to an outbreak of popular contention in Third World states. In many ways, Almeida is expanding upon the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12453897">Theda Skocpol (1979)</xref>, who suggested that agrarian bureaucracies must undergo fundamental structural changes in order to join the modern world.</p>
<p>Although Almeida’s work provides an interesting framework for understanding the emergence of protest waves, the deterministic nature of his analysis places little emphasis on the individual and their local actions. For instance, he suggests that with growth in the coffee economy at the turn of the twentieth century the government tolerated some degree of mass organization, and this moment saw the development of collective action and the formation of entities such as the Salvadoran Communist Party. Concluding that political liberalization encourages organizational mobilization, he argues that when the government attempted to reverse the situation collective action was inevitable. Yet, in contrast to the contributors to <italic>Landscapes</italic> and Wood in her analysis of Tenancingo, he overlooks the role of indigenous communities and their conflict with an emerging Ladino community (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12453897">Gould, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Giving credit to the leaders of the uprising that spawned La Matanza, Almeida suggests that the few leaders who survived the massacre “played a role in passing on organizational skills and knowledge to future generations of activists” (69). He goes on to describe the period between 1962 and 1972 as the “longest period of sustained contentions since the late 1920s” (87). Focusing on labor, education, and the Church, he points to an electoral modification toward proportional representation as having given these groups institutional access via competitive elections. Yet, just as in 1932, the government moved to limit citizen’s representation at all levels of government, and this shift radicalized many of the organizations that had formed during the protest wave. This time a new radical civil society adjusted its strategies toward a more inclusive and widespread coalition of actors. Leaders with extensive organizational skills and experience served as catalysts for a new social movement based on social justice and an end to violent repression.</p>
<p>Eric Ching, in “Patronage and Politics under General Maximiliano Martínez” (in <italic>Landscapes</italic>), argues that this pattern of opening and then violently closing institutional access for social movements was characteristic of the Martínez regime and may have served as a blueprint for future rulers in El Salvador. At the same time, he shows that Martínez was capable of making institutions inaccessible only because he had at his disposal a vast patronage network that supported his actions. Examining both the structural factors that contribute to revolutionary action and the role of local politics in this way would have enhanced Almeida’s analysis.</p>
<p>One glaring omission from Almeida’s structural account is women’s role in the viability of social movements in El Salvador. Almeida acknowledges that the strikes conducted by the Asociación Nacional de Educadores Salvadoreños (ANDES) contributed to a new protest wave in El Salvador. Yet, few scholars on El Salvador would dispute that these strikes were significant not only because they galvanized the opposition in a common mission but also because they were largely led and organized by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12453897">Shayne, 2004</xref>). As the political scientist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12453897">Julia Shayne (1999</xref>: 89) has put it, “Women workers [were] not expected to resist so forcefully, and in doing so en masse the women of ANDES not only shattered stereotypes, but acted as gendered revolutionary bridges by providing a model for other disenchanted sectors of society.” Even many leaders of the FMLN acknowledged that these strikes were a model of activism and “the turning point in the unfolding of the political crisis of the 1970s and 1980s” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12453897">Grenier, 1999</xref>: 45).</p>
<p>The importance of including gender in any analysis is clearly seen in Griffith and Gates’s “Colonels and Industrial Workers in El Salvador, 1944–1972: Seeking Societal Support through Gendered Labor Reforms” (in <italic>Landscapes</italic>). Griffith and Gates describe a culture of patriarchy that was quite similar to those that women were facing around the globe. Whether it was relegating women to the home and motherhood, designating certain training and vocations as gender-specific, or denying women key leadership roles in labor unions, women’s work was always subservient to men’s. Despite this historical pattern, women make up half of the workforce in El Salvador today. Perhaps, as Griffith and Gates suggest, by understanding women’s historical role scholars can begin to shed some light on state-labor relations and their application to a female workforce.</p>
<p>All of these works go beyond the civil war to suggest how their work applies to society today. For Almeida, civil society continued to mobilize after the peace accords in 1994. With the FMLN now part of the polity, nonviolent mobilization attacked the negative outcomes of neoliberal globalization. His study of “mobilization by globalization” focuses largely on strikes against a proposal to privatize health care. Through the new political entity of the FMLN, federations of associations successfully defied the implementation of destructive neoliberal policies. The ability of oppositional political parties to work in conjunction with other civil-society groups, Almeida suggests, will largely determine the extent to which El Salvador becomes a completely neoliberal globalized bastion of support for foreign investors and affluent capitalists in Central America. Similar to Almeida, Wood suggests that the push toward neoliberal policies has the propensity to prevent campesino collectives from achieving autonomy. Unfortunately, this is a reality that I personally witnessed in 2006 when a foreign investor secured the rights to the land of a fishing cooperative in Costa del Sol; in just a few days these individuals were forcibly removed from their land because they could not produce titles to it.</p>
<p>In <italic>Landscapes of Struggle</italic>, the scholarly discussion of a postwar El Salvador is even more extensive. Tackling the themes of migration, violence, and ethnicity, these investigations illustrate that globalization’s reach can extend to everything from the way multilateral donors narrowly define indigenous identity (Ronsbo) to the unequal and sometimes bizarre relationship between migration and remittances (Pederson). Added to these social challenges, as Ellen Moodie points out, is the fact that El Salvador has the lamentable distinction of leading Latin America in homicides and the dominant narrative of the media often offers little solace to the victims of these crimes. As a result, many Salvadorans are finding comfort in religion. These challenges will shape El Salvador’s decision whether to embrace the neoliberal policies of outside organizations and countries or create an alternative that challenges the inequality and marginalization that has defined the country for so long.</p>
<p>This trio of books reveals many important themes that scholars should consider when reexamining El Salvador. First, El Salvador must be viewed as a country in which dynamics may vary radically from one region to another. Second, efforts to understand revolutionary social movements should always begin with the actors that create them. Third, cracks in the political culture will continue to inform civil society. Finally, local successes and failures must be examined in the context of globalization and the development initiatives created by nongovernmental organizations and government agencies.</p>
