<p>Scholars across numerous disciplines are currently grappling with the question of how to make scientific research and technological development more democratically responsive. A number of difficulties and constraints limit the potential for science and technology to meet social needs and concerns. These barriers include limited research funding available to institutions other than industry and the military, campaigns by industry groups to manipulate the design and interpretation of research, expert disciplinary traditions that constrain how scientists go about their work, and ignorance on the part of experts about the needs and experiences of marginalized groups. As this excellent book documents, one of the promising avenues for breaking through these barriers is for activists and grassroots organizations to partner with experts in addressing on-the-ground social challenges. The editors, Gwen Ottinger and Benjamin R. Cohen, chose to focus specifically on the environmental justice movement and the ways in which it is transforming the practice of scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>The volume begins with an introduction written by Ottinger and Cohen. They emphasize that science and technology can be either harmful or beneficial in the context of the environmental justice movement. On one hand, many technological advances have contributed to environmental burdens on disadvantaged communities, and expert risk assessments frequently underestimate the significance of the hazards that disadvantaged groups face. On the other hand, scientific research can, under the right circumstances, draw attention to crucial hazards that need to be addressed and provide support for the claims of those who have been victimized by environmental injustice. Ottinger and Cohen are interested in how interactions with the environmental justice movement can transform experts and their research practices so that they can more effectively partner with citizen groups rather than harming them. The editors introduce geological metaphors, suggesting that interactions between experts and activist groups create “ruptures” or “spaces” that give practitioners room to maneuver and to explore new approaches to scientific practice.</p>
<p>The first half of the book explores deliberate efforts by experts to serve the environmental justice movement. The first chapter, by Scott Frickel, examines the factors that push experts into activism and concludes that institutional networks are particularly important in this regard. The next chapter, by Karen Hoffman, explores how an environmental organization, the Clean Air and Water Network, was influenced by environmental justice considerations to shift from a primary focus on technical legal advocacy to a greater involvement in organizing and equipping local communities. Chapter 3, by Jason Delborne and Wyatt Galusky, analyzes how websites influence and even “construct” their audiences based on how they provide information about toxic exposures. The fourth chapter summarizes the findings of a research group that explored different approaches to informing citizens about the results of biomonitoring (i.e., testing people for their body burden of toxic substances). Finally, Dean Nieusma discusses how experts can serve in a “middle” level between policy elites and grassroots communities, opening up more effective lines of communication between those with varying forms of expertise, including groups that are typically marginalized.</p>
<p>The second half of the volume considers how the environmental justice movement has disrupted typical science and engineering practices in political institutions. Chapter 6 examines how an environmental justice organization in Madison, Wisconsin, highlighted crucial data gaps about the risks associated with subsistence fishing and challenged the faulty assumptions of local policy makers. In the seventh chapter, Jaclyn Johnson and Darren Ranco describe how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Tribal Science Council has challenged traditional approaches to risk assessment and even explored a different model for characterizing “health” based on the distinctive perspectives of Native American groups. The eighth chapter examines how the environmental justice movement influenced both “regulatory science” and “street science” in cases involving pesticide regulation in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Finally, in the ninth chapter Gwen Ottinger considers how service learning opportunities in engineering courses can ideally help new engineers to see themselves not as problem solvers but rather as participants with community members in addressing social problems. Kim Fortun concludes the book with an afterword that summarizes many of the ways that traditional scientific practices inhibit effective environmental justice advocacy. She also highlights some of the book’s major recommendations, including the call to circulate study findings in more effective ways and to train scientists and engineers to appreciate forms of expertise different from their own.</p>
<p>The book as a whole is very well edited and unified. It provides many examples of how scientific and engineering practices can be altered to better serve the goals of the environmental justice movement. These practices include ways of interacting with community groups and policy makers, methods of training students, choices of research questions and methodologies, and approaches to communicating results. Chapters 4 and 6, which discuss the issues involved in disseminating research results and the activities of environmental justice advocates in Madison, Wisconsin, are among the highlights of the volume. One of the strengths of the sixth chapter is that it goes into more detail than many of the others concerning the specific scientific assumptions that were fruitfully challenged by grassroots activities. This detail is particularly valuable, because one of the volume’s few limitations is that it sometimes seems a bit quick in assuming that hierarchies of expertise need to be broken down to the greatest extent feasible, and it does not grapple with the nuances of how one might temper this assumption (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1086026612450871">Collins &amp; Evans, 2009</xref>). It is perhaps unfair to place much weight on this point, however, because this book is clearly designed to move on from questions about <italic>whether</italic> and <italic>to what extent</italic> hierarchies of expertise need to be altered; its focus is on exploring <italic>how</italic> to go about changing expert practices.</p>
<p>Other bodies of literature that might fruitfully strengthen the book’s message concern the topic of “agnotology” or “epistemologies of ignorance” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612450871">Proctor &amp; Schiebinger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1086026612450871">Sullivan &amp; Tuana, 2007</xref>). Historians and philosophers such as Robert Proctor and Nancy Tuana have recently emphasized that we could learn much about scientific knowledge by studying the range of institutional factors and practices that contribute to our ignorance about some phenomena at the same time that we collect a great deal of information about other phenomena. These forces can include government censorship, campaigns by industry groups to suppress information that reflect poorly on their products, and a myriad of subtle factors that prevent those in positions of social power from gaining deeper understanding of those who are disadvantaged. Ottinger and Cohen’s volume illustrates these points very well, insofar as it constantly emphasizes how both individual scientific experts and institutional practices, such as risk assessment, often ignore information that is of crucial importance to those who are at greatest risk from environmental hazards. Fortunately, the book does not merely point out these problems; <italic>Technoscience and Environmental Justice</italic> provides a valuable resource for thinking about how to alter scientific and engineering practice to address these deficiencies and to better serve our democratic aspirations.</p>
