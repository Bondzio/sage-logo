<abstract>
<p>The reading process and reading development have been addressed by researchers for decades. As a result we know much about what reading is and how it happens. However, less is known about how reading influences other aspects of children’s development, specifically the development of social imagination. To address this, we examined the narrative produced by one child during wordless picture book reading using a conceptually derived coding scheme to identify instances of social imagination. We asked: Is children’s use of social imagination visible in wordless book reading, and if so, what does it look like and how might it give us a more detailed in-process view of the reader–text transaction? Results suggest that the use of social imagination is observable in wordless book reading and that it is an integral part of the comprehension of stories. From this we posit that through vicarious engagement with others, the process of reading may influence the relational capacity for social imagination.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468798411430425" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The reading process, what it is, how it operates and how it is nurtured, has been an important focus of literacy research for decades. During this time, we have learned a significant amount about the development of reading. For example, we know that children develop concepts about print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411430425">Clay, 2000</xref>) and attain phonemic awareness, as well as word knowledge, as they participate in shared-book interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411430425">Lomax and McGee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468798411430425">Martin and Reutzel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468798411430425">Zevenbergen and Whitehurst, 2003</xref>), particularly those with positive socio-emotional qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411430425">Bus, 2003</xref>). We also know that children’s knowledge about stories and the written register develop over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411430425">Dickenson and Tabors, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468798411430425">Purcell-Gates, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468798411430425">Snow, 1983</xref>) and that they engage in approximations of mature reading, such as pretend reading and the memorization of favourite picture books as one part of this development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468798411430425">Sulzby, 1985</xref>). Although there are ongoing debates about how to define and view the relative development of specific reading skills and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411430425">Paris, 2005</xref>), we have a well-researched terrain of what constitutes reading development generally, and have developed complex models of how reading operates and what it takes for children to read successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411430425">Alexander and Fox, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468798411430425">Ruddell and Unrau, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>While we know much about how reading typically develops and <italic>what it takes to read</italic>, we know less about how reading influences other aspects of children’s development, or put another way, <italic>what reading does</italic> for the child reading. While sociocultural and constructivist perspectives assume that language and literacy shape human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430425">Halliday, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468798411430425">Stone, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468798411430425">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430425">Wertsch, 1985</xref>), we are still exploring <italic>what</italic> is being shaped and <italic>how</italic> in terms of specific aspects of children’s development. One possibility is that reading helps children develop their capacity for relationships in varied and flexible ways by exercising, and thus building up, social imagination – the ability to think about the thoughts, feelings and intentions of others – as they encounter characters in books.</p>
<p>Specifically, some hypothesize that the ability to imagine the thoughts and feelings of other people may be influenced by a child’s ability to understand and process stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411430425">Liddle and Nettle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468798411430425">Szarkowicz, 2000</xref>). In fact, it is believed that stories are good for children and that they make use of them as resources for understanding the complexities of the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411430425">Bruner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411430425">Dyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411430425">Gregory, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411430425">Quindlen, 1998</xref>). Although much of this thinking is based on children hearing stories read to them by adults, it makes sense that children reading stories on their own will also have these benefits. This seems consistent with a transactional view of reading that posits reading as an activity of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411430425">Lysaker, 2006</xref>) in which an encounter with text is a personal event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411430425">Rosenblatt, 1938/95</xref>). Taken together, it seems reasonable to think that reading may promote children’s relational development in valuable ways, particularly in terms of understanding the thoughts, feelings and intentions of others.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why it might be important to understand better whether, and if so how, reading fosters the development of relational capacities in children, particularly in terms of understanding others. There is growing concern for nurturing global perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411430425">McCollough, 1992</xref>), helping children develop the ability to understand and care for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411430425">Noddings, 2005</xref>) and encouraging concern with social justice issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411430425">Leland and Harste, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468798411430425">Silvers et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, due to the increasing diversity of classroom populations, there are new social demands that require children to relate frequently and effectively with an ever-growing range of peers. Successful negotiation of complex social circumstances such as these requires relational skills, one of which is social imagination, the ability to imagine the thoughts, feelings and intentions of others. In fact, social imagination has been linked to children’s ability to get along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411430425">Liddle and Nettle, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, children continue to have difficulties with social settings. As a result, schools have become more concerned with children’s ability to understand the perspectives of others, and interventions to deal with social problems, such as bullying, have become widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468798411430425">Rigby and Griffiths, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468798411430425">Seals and Young, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468798411430425">Slee and Mohya, 2007</xref>). In such an environment the need to consider the ways in which reading may be helpful in developing children’s relational capacities becomes critically important.</p>
<p>While others have studied the use of literature to encourage understanding and responding to the perspective of others in instructional settings such as book clubs and literature discussions (Ivy and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411430425">Johnston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411430425">Johnston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411430425">Lewison and Heffernan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430425">Lysaker et al., 2011</xref>), in this study we were interested in how the reading process itself, particularly the comprehending of text, might help children do similar things. Put another way, we wondered how the understanding of texts might be related to children’s understanding of other people. To answer this question we used the notion of social imagination as an analytical tool for exploring wordless book reading. Specifically, we examined the narrative produced by one child during wordless picture book reading for instances of social imagination. We asked a two-part question: (1) Is the use of social imagination visible in wordless book reading; and (2) If so, what does it look like and how might it give us a more detailed in-process view of the use of social imagination as part of the reader–text transaction?</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468798411430425"><title>Theoretical perspective</title>
<sec id="sec3-1468798411430425"><title>Social imagination</title>
<p>The capacity to imagine the thoughts, feelings and intentions of others is referred to across several disciplines in different terms, including theory of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411430425">Baron-Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468798411430425">Tomasello et al., 2005</xref>), social understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430425">Fernyhough, 2008</xref>) and social imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411430425">Johnston, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411430425">Rosenblatt, 1938/95</xref>). This human capacity is considered a critical aspect of the developing child because of its importance in establishing and maintaining relationships with others. There are a variety of explanations for how social imagination develops in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430425">Fernyhough, 2008</xref>). However, most theories suggest that being with others, both observing and interacting with them, is crucial to the development of social imagination, particularly when participants have opportunities to both notice and respond to the perspectives of others through language. Put another way, relationships with others, and the talk that constructs and surrounds those relationships, provide experiences that afford the development of social imagination.</p>
<p>We assert that, although a vicarious one, reading is one of these relational experiences. People think, feel, imagine and dream with the characters in books and explore possible selves by taking on the positions of others as their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468798411430425">Richardson and Eccles, 2007</xref>). In addition, since stories are thought to unfold in two landscapes, one of ‘consciousness’ and one of ‘action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411430425">Bruner, 1986</xref>), they provide a context within which to make sense of one particular aspect of the human condition, the relationship between how people feel and think (consciousness) and how they behave (action) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411430425">Pelletier and Astington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468798411430425">Szarkowicz, 2000</xref>). In fact, some argue that the vicarious practice of understanding human nature and the activity that occurs in fiction reading have consequences for the reader in terms of the person he or she will become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411430425">Gregory, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468798411430425">Zunshine, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468798411430425"><title>The dialogic self</title>
<p>We have suggested in other work that a dialogic view of self helps us account for how reading shapes aspects of the person reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411430425">Lysaker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430425">Lysaker et al., 2011</xref>). From a dialogic perspective, self consists of a set of voices, or characters, that are in constant conversation with one another and with the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411430425">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411430425">Lysaker and Lysaker, 2005</xref>) and is therefore dynamic, inherently relational and open to transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411430425">Hermans and Hermans-Jansen, 2003</xref>), particularly when one is engaged in other relational and semiotic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430425">Fernyhough, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468798411430425">Ricoeur, 1991</xref>). Successful reading, then, might be thought of as a dialogic exchange in which the person who reads appropriates the characters in the text as voices of the self, at times displacing some aspects of his or her own consciousness. This aligns with views of human experience in which displacing the self allows the reality of others to be understood as both present experience and future possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411430425">Noddings, 1984</xref>). As readers, we experience this as ‘identifying’ with the character or ‘getting lost in the book’, i.e. when we adopt new realities and possibilities through imagination.</p>
<p>From a Vygotskian perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468798411430425">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>), this dialogic exchange between the voices of the self and the text may be internalized, resulting in a simultaneity of difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411430425">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>) within the intra-mental plane. As Fernyhough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430425">2008</xref>, pp. 233–234) states:
<list id="list1-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If Bakhtin is correct to claim that an individual’s utterances in dialogue are reflective of his or her orientation to reality, then the internalization of dialogic exchanges (or, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468798411430425">Vygotsky’s [1997]</xref> terms, their reconstruction on the intrapsychological plane) will necessarily involve some adoption of the other’s perspectives. By taking on the utterances of the other through the internalization of dialogue, one is also actively reconstructing some aspect of their perspective on physical and social reality.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Put another way, the taking up of voices from text introduces new perspectives within the self, resulting in a revised multifaceted consciousness which then becomes a rich relational resource for the future. In sum, it would seem that reading, and fiction reading in particular, sets up numerous varied occasions for imagining the reality of others, their thoughts, feelings and intentions. These uses of social imagination that occur during reading may then be internalized and experienced as parts of ourselves, creating a consciousness that is inherently perspectival and a valuable resource for understanding others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430425">Lysaker et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, both empirical research and theory suggest that the process of reading may have a critical influence on the developing child. It seems that the activity of comprehending stories may provide children with unique opportunities to practise, and hence develop, social imagination, potentially linking the process of understanding text to the process of understanding people. While intuitively reasonable, little documentation of children’s use of social imagination within a reading event currently exists.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1468798411430425" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The work presented here is part of a larger study in which wordless book reading was used to assess children’s social imagination before and after a relationally oriented reading intervention for second- and third-grade children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430425">Lysaker et al., 2011</xref>). In this paper, we highlight this particular aspect of that study: the use of wordless picture book reading as a way to examine the use of social imagination within the reading process. To do this we used purposeful sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411430425">Patton, 2002</xref>) to present a single case analysis of one participant’s wordless book reading with an instrumental purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468798411430425">Stake, 2000</xref>): to document and describe the phenomenon of social imagination as it occurs in wordless book reading. Such case work is particularly useful for examining and illustrating phenomena about which little is known and whose study may inform theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468798411430425">Yin, 1994</xref>). This case was selected because it provides a demonstration of the many and varied uses of social imagination within a reading event and was thus an ‘information rich sample’ useful for in-depth study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411430425">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 242).</p>
<p>Wordless book reading has a rich history in literacy research as a way to view aspects of reading not bound to decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411430425">Lysaker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411430425">Paris and Paris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468798411430425">Sulzby, 1985</xref>). We reasoned, as others have done, that the ability to construct stories from books might be considered a performative view of the reader–text transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411430425">Paris and Paris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468798411430425">Sulzby, 1985</xref>) and afford an in-process view of this transaction, including children’s use of social imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430425">Lysaker et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430425">Crawford and Hade, 2000</xref>) have found children’s reading of wordless books to involve similar processes to those found in the reading of print-based texts.</p>
<p>We purposefully chose an unseen wordless book in order to prompt an original reading and avoid the possibility of the child using past reading as a resource for narration. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411430425">Alexander and Jetton (2000)</xref>, we viewed the text as a kind of environment for the reader and wanted that environment to be more open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411430425">Rosenblatt, 1938/95</xref>) rather than closed. We made the assumption that an open text make would make it more feasible for the reader to engage with the voices of the text and promote a rich reader–text transaction. In fact, the image-based quality of wordless books is by nature open, requiring that the reader construct the linguistic narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430425">Crawford and Hade, 2000</xref>), and offers invitations for ‘interpersonal meaning’ as readers view the representations of people in images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411430425">Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996</xref>). In addition, a wordless book is a spatially organized text (Bearne, 2005) with temporal and causal qualities only implied. Thus it is left to the reader to render time and causality during meaning making. In these ways, the narrative produced by children during wordless book reading would in effect paint a picture of that meaning making.</p>
<p>Also informing our methodological choices was the history of other observational assessments of reading, such as miscue analysis, which have been particularly valuable in gaining information about the reading process itself as it occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411430425">Goodman and Burke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411430425">Martens, 1997</xref>). We were interested in the same kind of ‘within activity’ method. We speculated that wordless book reading could provide a context within which to view children’s use of social imagination during the process of comprehending text, in much the same way that miscue analysis offers a window on the psycholinguistic processes of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430425">Lysaker et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec6-1468798411430425"><title>Participant</title>
<p>Makaila (a pseudonym) is a black African American girl, who was a second- grader at the time of the study. She attended an elementary school in a mid-western US city with a student population of approximately 680. Approximately 58% of the students were black, 25% white, 14% Hispanic, 1% Asian and 8% multiracial. About 57% received free or reduced lunch benefits.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1468798411430425"><title>The book</title>
<p>Like all children in the larger study, Makaila read the wordless picture book, <italic>I Had Measles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468798411430425">No author, 1987</xref>). <italic>I Had Measles</italic> is part of a collection of wordless books created to help children develop their understanding of how books work. The book is 16 pages long and has soft pastel illustrations depicting a family in which one of the children has measles. There are five characters who are intended to be a mother, a father, an older sister who has measles, a younger brother and a doctor. The characters are not named. In addition the family has a puppy that appears often. This book was chosen purposefully for its specific qualities, including the presence of a family setting, male and female characters, as well as the use of childhood illness as the central problem. These attributes of the story provide many opportunities for making personal connections and for relating to one or more characters.</p>

<p>The wordless book-reading task was part of a set of assessments used to document children’s reading comprehension and social imagination in the larger study. Assessments were done during the school day in a classroom that was familiar to Makaila. The researcher and Makaila sat together at a small table of a type common to early childhood classrooms. The task was introduced by telling Makaila that she and the researcher would be doing some reading together. To verify that this would be an unseen text for Makaila, she was asked if she had ever seen the book <italic>I Had Measles</italic> before, which she had not.</p>
<p>Prior to Makaila beginning the book, the title was read to her and the term measles was explained as a common childhood illness of the past, similar to chickenpox. No other introductory information about the story was provided, so that construction of the narrative would come exclusively from the child’s reading of the illustrations.</p>
<p>In order to point out the quality of wordlessness, the researcher asked Makaila if she noticed anything unusual about the book and reaffirmed that the author did not write words for the story. Makaila was then told that she could make up the story using her own words and the pictures that the illustrator provided. The researcher asked Makaila to read the wordless book aloud to her as they sat side by side. The sessions were audio-recorded and later transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1468798411430425"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>In order to answer our research question, we coded the transcript of Makaila’s reading for uses of social imagination. That is, we marked instances when her reading indicated that she was imagining the thoughts, feelings or intentions of characters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430425">Table 1</xref>). The inter-rater reliability for the coding of social imagination was assessed by two raters who blindly rated one third of the entire corpus of wordless book-reading data generated in the larger study. Intra-class correlations revealed a significant amount of inter-rater agreement (<italic>r</italic> = 0.95, <italic>F</italic> (1, 19) = 21.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001).

<sec id="sec10-1468798411430425"><title>Findings</title>
<p>In this section, we present and discuss Makaila’s wordless book reading in order to give a detailed view of her use of social imagination during the reading. We also provide a description of the illustrations of <italic>I Had Measles</italic> to provide a context for understanding her narration. Overall, Makaila’s reading had a word count of 262 with 23 sentences. We identified and numbered her sentences (i.e. s1) in terms of how they were uttered, rather than how they are grammatically defined, in order to capture better the reader’s prosody. Coding for social imagination shows 20 instances in which Makaila imagined the thoughts, feelings and intentions of others during her reading. The transcript is presented in full in Appendix A.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1468798411430425"><title>Makaila and her reading of I Had Measles</title>
<p>At the outset of the reading, Makaila looked at the cover of the book, which shows two children. The older girl is sitting on a bed and lifting her pyjama top to reveal spots on her abdomen. The younger brother is looking at her abdomen and pointing to the spots. Makaila then turned to the title page where the younger child appears to be moving forward while pushing a door open and entering a room. A small dog appears to be running alongside him. Makaila reads:
<list id="list2-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s1 My name is Makaila and I’d like to read a story about a little girl being sick and having chickenpox.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Makaila begins by introducing herself and the characters, and states what she thinks the book is going to be about. While there is no evidence of social imagination in her opening lines, this part of the reading is important because she positions herself confidently as the reader. This suggests an understanding of the task and being comfortable with the idea of wordless book reading as ‘real’ reading.</p>
<p>The first illustration after the title page in <italic>I Had Measles</italic> is spread across two pages. It depicts the two children in their pyjamas. The girl is lying down and rubbing one eye. A tear is falling from the other. The younger brother is kneeling beside her on what looks like a bed, looking at her with one arm reaching towards her. The puppy is climbing up onto the sick girl’s back. Makaila reads:
<list id="list3-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s2 There’s there’s one …</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s3 I think she’s crying because … um … she’s sick and she doesn’t feel well and her brother’s kinda messing with her.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Here Makaila begins by commenting on the presence of the character – ‘there’s there’s one’ – as if noticing aloud will help her find a place to begin. She then shifts to commenting on the action by saying ‘I think she is crying’. Makaila explains her thinking about the action in terms of the character’s state of being and uses the word ‘because’ to link the two, saying ‘because she’s sick and she doesn’t feel well’. Here Makaila is imagining the state of being sick and the feelings of the sick child. This is the first instance of her use of social imagination in this reading. This is an important dialogic move because, from the position of the child, she can then imagine a reason for the action of the character: ‘I think she is crying.’ The girl is sick, therefore she does not feel well and so she is crying.</p>
<p>In sentence three, the section ‘her brother’s kinda messing with her’, we have another instance of social imagination. Here, Makaila has imagined and voiced a relationship between the characters by identifying the younger child as ‘her brother’. It seems possible, if Makaila has experienced a mischievous brother, that this identification of the boy as ‘her brother’ may be what leads her to imagine the intention of the action of the brother ‘messing with her’. On the other hand she might have first regarded the younger boy, taken up his perspective, and imagined his action as mischievous and narrated ‘messing with her’. In either case, the word ‘because’ signals the intention of the brother – to ‘mess with her’ – a reason for Makaila’s unhappiness. Makaila’s use of social imagination seems to have led her to create a relationship and the establishment of intention with regards to the depicted action.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Makaila hesitates and appears to reread, as if working out the meaning as she goes. She reads: ‘There’s there’s one ….’ And then, as if starting again she says: ‘I think she’s crying because … um … she’s sick and she doesn’t feel well and her brother’s kinda messing with her.’ It seems that her use of social imagination deepens as she hesitates and self-corrects. From a dialogic perspective, one might deduce that it has taken Makaila a moment to encounter the character and take her perspective. Given that this is the first time she has encountered this story, hesitation and self-correction are an understandable part of active meaning construction.</p>
<p>The next two-page spread has two illustrations that depict two different moments in time and two different sets of actions. In the first illustration (left-hand side), the sick child is holding her shirt up, revealing several spots, while a woman, apparently the child’s mother, is putting her hand on the child’s abdomen. The woman’s gaze is on the sick child’s abdomen, she is not smiling and her eyes appear to be nearly closed. In the next illustration (right-hand side), the sick child is lying in bed with her eyes closed. The woman and the younger child are near the door with the puppy. The woman’s hand is outstretched and near the door knob. Makaila reads:
<list id="list4-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s4 And her mom is looking at her chickenpox</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s5 and now she’s telling her … um … little brother to go out so her, his little, his little, his big sister can … um can get, has to sleep.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>On this page of the reading, Makaila continues imagining relationships and assigning roles by referring to the female character as ‘her mom’. She then reads: ‘now she’s telling her … um … little brother to go out so ….’ This utterance is coded as an instance of social imagination for two reasons. First, Makaila is imagining that the mother is speaking to the younger brother, which serves to maintain a relationship she has created. She then further imagines that the mother is telling the little brother something specific, which requires imagining the thoughts of the mother, i.e. that she wants the younger brother to go out.</p>
<p>In addition, Makaila uses the connector ‘so’ to indicate the intention behind the mother’s thought, this is reflected in the statement asking the brother to leave the room. The intention of course is to allow the sick child to get some sleep. In essence, Makaila has imagined that the mother is thinking the boy should leave the room, because she has imagined that the mother is thinking that the child needs to sleep. This leads to a caring action, leaving the sick child alone to sleep in a quiet room. As a reader, Makaila has <italic>decided</italic> that the mother cares about the sick girl and created an action for the mother that promotes the good of the sick child. Dialogically, Makaila has taken up the position and voice of the mother, imagined her thoughts and feelings, i.e. what she would say and do, as well as why.</p>
<p>In this part of Makaila’s reading, she again demonstrates repetition and self-correction as she figures out the relationship between the sick child and the smaller sibling. She shifts between pronouns as well as between the words ‘big’ and ‘little’: ‘and now she’s telling her … um … little brother to go out so her, his little, his little, his big sister ….’ Makaila has created characters with thoughts and feelings and, through the exercise of social imagination, works to represent linguistically those characters and their actions in a way that is consistent with her narrative. In this way, we might think of social imagination as making narrative coherence both desirable and possible.</p>
<p>The phrase ‘has to sleep’ also reflects the use of social imagination, because it portrays a particular state of being, i.e. that of needing sleep. The verb ‘has’ signals the emotion of need. This is different, for example, from reading ‘is going to sleep’, which depicts a concrete action. As a reader, Makaila has imagined the reality of being sick, which involves the need for sleep, and invented an action on the part of the mother that responds to that need.</p>
<p>The next two-page spread of <italic>I Had Measles</italic> consists of two separate illustrations with two distinct sets of actions. In the first illustration (left-hand side), there is a woman with a stethoscope leaning over the sick child, who is in bed with a thermometer in her mouth. Another woman, apparently the mother, is at the window with her hands on the curtains. In the second illustration (right-hand side), a male character is facing the reader. He has a doll and stuffed toy in one arm, and a glass with an orange drink and a straw in the other. He is smiling slightly. Makaila reads:
<list id="list5-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s6 And she’s taking the temperature, the doctor,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s7 she called the doctor and told her to take her temperature</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s8 and she said something like, “she has bad chickenpox”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s9 And her dad brung her some dolls and some juice and she …</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Makaila begins with an action, taking the girl's temperature, and then imagines the identity of the character doing the acting, which is represented by her interjection of ‘the doctor’. By way of contrast, for example, she does not read: ‘And the doctor is taking the temperature.’ Rather, the action seems to prompt a closer look at the character, whom she then notices has a stethoscope around her neck.</p>
<p>Having created the character of the doctor, Makaila then accounts for her presence by saying: ‘She [meaning the mother] called the doctor and told her to take her temperature.’ Here Makaila is imagining the thoughts of the mother that led to the action of calling the doctor. She goes on to be even more specific. She reads: ‘And she said something like, “she has bad chickenpox”.’ Now she has not only imagined the mother telling the doctor to take the child’s temperature, but also what the mother has said about the illness of the sick child. From a dialogic perspective, she has assumed the perspective of the mother and voiced that character. Interestingly, this leads to a vicarious moral decision on her part. She has imagined the mother calling a doctor and telling her to take her temperature, which is a caring action on the part of the mother. It is important to note that none of these actions are depicted in the illustrations. Rather, Makaila has identified characters, created relationships between them, as well as explained those relationships and the characters’ actions by imagining their thoughts, feelings and intentions. All this has led her to create a complex narrative in which the dual landscapes of action and consciousness are linked.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the illustrator depicts the man carrying toys and a drink and looking straight ahead making the intended receiver of the objects ambiguous. Makaila, however, imagines that this is the dad, and that he is bringing these things to his sick daughter. The use of the verb ‘bringing’ implies intention in a way that ‘carrying’, for example, does not. Here it is not clear whether in Makaila’s mind the identification of the male character as dad leads her to further imagine that the toys and the juice are for the sick child, or if the idea that a person who would bring these things and is male is likely to be a dad. However, in either case, this is another instance of social imagination in which Makaila imagines the intention of the male character and, as narrator, makes a moral decision, on the part of the character, to care for the sick child. It is interesting to notice that Makaila’s ongoing narrative shifts easily between the characters as she imagines their thoughts and feelings and creates actions and relationships that reflect them, once again linking the landscapes of consciousness and action.</p>
<p>On the next two-page spread, the illustrator again depicts two separate sets of actions at different points in time. In the first illustration (left-hand side), the sick child is sitting up in bed with the stuffed toy under one arm. In the other hand she is holding a glass with orange liquid and the straw is in her mouth. She is looking off into space with a faraway expression in her eyes. In the second illustration (right-hand side), she is seen in the background lying in bed with her eyes closed and blankets up around her chin. In the foreground of the same illustration is the younger brother, squatting by the bedroom door with his arms around the puppy. Makaila reads:
<list id="list6-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s10 drunk it ….</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s11 And played with her doll and she was thinking about something.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s12 And then her brother was standing right there while she was asleep, playing with their, playing with the dog.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s13 And she was looking and thinking how long is my, his sister going to be out sick?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Makaila links this page to the one before it by ending the previous page with ‘and she …’ and then, in sentence 10, reading ‘drunk it’ as she turns the page. While this may on the surface seem obvious, what Makaila has done here is to imagine an action on the part of the father, that he has indeed handed her the juice and doll, based on her earlier attribution of his intention. This is an example of how the connections between the two landscapes of narrative, consciousness and action, lead to narrative coherence.</p>
<p>In sentence 11, we find two new instances of social imagination. First, Makaila’s rendering of the action she sees as ‘playing with her doll’ portrays a <italic>particular intention</italic> of the physical contact between the girl and the doll. This is different, for example, from using the verb ‘holding’ in reference to the doll. In addition, her comment ‘thinking about something’ is an instance of social imagination – she is imagining that the girl is <italic>having thoughts</italic>, and in fact this seems so important that she mentions it without any specific idea about what those thoughts are.</p>
<p>Makaila then shifts to the right-hand frame where the younger sibling is kneeling at the door and the sick girl is asleep in her bed in the background. Makaila links this page to the previous one by using ‘and then’ to imply a connection between the activity of the girl and the presence of the younger brother ‘standing right there’. She extends this connection by reading ‘while she was asleep’ to create a relationship between the boy and the sick girl. Although Makaila does not specifically link the thoughts of the girl and boy to their actions, the use of the word ‘while’ places them in the same place and time, thus implying connection.</p>
<p> Makaila continues to imagine particular actions as playful, this time in reference to the young boy and the dog. However, what is most interesting here is her pronoun use. In sentence 13, ‘she was looking and thinking’, she refers to the boy as ‘she’. Makaila continues from this perspective part-way through the sentence by using the pronoun ‘my’, then shifts to the pronoun ‘his’: ‘how long is my, his sister going to be out sick?’ Using the pronouns ‘she’ and ‘my’ suggests that Makaila had momentarily inhabited the character of the younger sibling, making him female, and was probably beginning to say ‘how long is my sister going to be out sick?’. This also explains her use of the female pronoun earlier: since Makaila is a girl, ‘my’ refers to a female. However, her change to the pronoun ‘his’ in mid-sentence demonstrates her return to a view of the younger brother from the narrator position.</p>
<p>The next illustration in <italic>I Had Measles</italic> covers the two-page spread with a single illustration depicting a single set of actions at one point in time. In this scene, the sick child is on her knees, on the bed, with her hands supporting her as if she is getting up. She is looking towards the mother, who has one foot in front of the other, as if in the midst of a walking motion. The gaze of the child is on the mother and the gaze of the mother on the child.
<list id="list7-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s14 And then, and then, and then she woke up</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s15 And her mother told her that she’s kinda, she’s kinda feeling better.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s16 And then she woke up and felt excited.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Makaila continues the reading with ‘and then, and then and then’, which helps her connect meaning across the page turn, but also seems to buy her some time to think about what is depicted in the illustration. She begins this page as she has done before by describing action. Here she is describing the sick girl who appears to be getting out of bed as her mother comes towards her with an outstretched hand. The illustration of the mother striding with outstretched hand in combination with the girl looking alert and getting out of bed provides a set of actions that invite explanation in terms of the internal world of the characters. Makaila does this by saying ‘her mother told her that she’s kinda, she’s kinda feeling better.’ Here Makaila uses social imagination to explain the state of being alert and the action of getting out of bed. Dialogically, she is taking up the character of the mother, who is then imagining the feelings of the sick child and voicing them. Makaila then shifts slightly to take up the position of the sick child and imagines both her actions and her feelings by saying ‘she woke up and felt excited’.</p>
<p>On the next two-page spread of <italic>I Had Measles</italic> there is a single illustration in which the sick child is now out of bed and looking out of the window to the yard below where she sees the father, pushing the younger brother on a swing. The dog accompanies them. Both characters are looking up at her in the window. Makaila reads:
<list id="list8-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s17 And she looked outside and felt sad because her brother and her dad were outside</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s18 And she couldn’t go outside because she was sick.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Again Makaila begins with an action, ‘looked outside’, and then imagines the feelings of the sick child and says ‘she felt sad’. She follows that with explanation, using the word ‘because’, which links the child’s feelings to the action taking place outside. This also serves to maintain the relationships she has created between the characters: the girl feels sad since she cannot be with her family having fun.</p>
<p>Makaila goes on to explain why the sick child could not go outside and uses ‘because’ once more to link the state of being sick with the consequence of being unable to go outside. This requires the exercise of social imagination in two ways. First, she continues with imagining the feelings of the child as ‘being sick’, but also that she ‘couldn’t go’ outside. The use of ‘couldn’t’ implies that something is holding her back, which is different from simply ‘not going’ outside. The choice of verb tense suggests that Makaila is imagining the reality of the sick child and the moral implications of that reality: going outside could be bad for the girl’s health, and possibly for others she might interact with.</p>
<p>On the following page, we see the young boy kneeling on the floor drawing something on white paper with crayons. The puppy is lying on the floor beside him with the sick child’s doll sitting next to him.
<list id="list9-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s19 And her brother drew pictures of (inaudible),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s20 and then he and his dog was sitting on the floor.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Makaila stays with describing the action here and does not venture into the mind of the characters. It may be that for her, as a reader, the connections between the actions depicted on this page do not connect well with what came before.</p>
<p>Finally, on the last page, we see a single illustration in which the father is holding an open book with the smaller child in his lap. He is sitting beside the sick child’s bed, where she is lying with the puppy curled up next to her asleep. She is turned towards the father and the boy. Makaila reads:
<list id="list10-1468798411430425" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>s21 And then their dad and brother was …</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s22 read him a story so his little, his big sister can take some sleep again.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>s23 “The End.”</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Once more, Makaila appears to reread and self-correct as she narrates. She begins with the father by saying ‘And then their dad …’, making him the subject of the sentence. Then she moves briefly to the brother by narrating ‘and brother was’, before returning to the position of the father and reading ‘read him a story’. Makaila again appears to reread and self-correct by saying ‘so his little’ and then ‘his big sister can take some sleep again’.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know what is causing Makaila’s momentary ambivalence about the relationship between the characters. However, the apparent rereading and self-correction suggest a flexibility of consciousness on Makaila’s part that was seen earlier in this reading. Because Makaila seems able to move from the inner world of one character to the inner world of the other with fluidity, for example between the big sister and little brother, she is at first prone to making inaccurate approximations. In this moment, it may be more difficult for her to take up the little brother’s position because her gender and age make inhabiting the character of the sick child more consistent with her physical identity. If she is taking the sick girl’s perspective then the word ‘little’ makes sense.</p>
<p>Makaila then makes a move to the state of the girl, who she thinks needs to ‘take some sleep again’. Her use of the word ‘take’ suggests that she is reading from the position of the sick child rather than, for example, the father, who might ‘allow’ her to sleep. Makaila also uses the word ‘so’ in this last sentence, which results in an attribution of intention for the father’s action: he is reading to the younger brother so she can sleep. Again, Makaila has supplied an explanation for action by flexibly moving between the positions of characters and imagining the thoughts and feelings of those characters. She closes her reading with the conventional ‘The End’.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1468798411430425" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the use of wordless book reading as a window to the use of social imagination within the reading process. We wondered how the understanding of text might be related to children’s understanding of other people. While it has been proposed by many that stories told and read to children are resources for them as they develop increasingly complex ideas about other people, we wondered if we could observe, and therefore come to understand better, children’s active use of social imagination within an independent reading event.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1468798411430425"><title>The visibility of social imagination in wordless book reading</title>
<p>Makaila’s wordless book reading gave us a revealing and useful view of the use of social imagination during the comprehending process. By looking carefully at the language Makaila used in her reading of <italic>I Had Measles</italic>, we were able to identify the ways in which Makaila made attributions and articulated the thoughts, feelings and intentions of characters.</p>
<p>We found 20 instances where Makaila articulated her awareness of the thoughts, feelings or intentions of characters as a part of the wordless book reading. We were able to identify the dialogic moves she made as she took up the positions of different characters. Pronoun use was particularly indicative of Makaila’s movement between characters, while verbs and adjectives allowed us to see her attribution of thoughts, feelings and intentions to the characters she was constructing. In fact, careful analysis of Makaila’s language demonstrates that articulations of social imagination during her reading were not a homogeneous phenomenon, but seemed to be the result of slightly different positioning by Makaila as a reader.</p>
<p>The first position might be best described as the inhabiting of a character. This involved a deep resonation with the character, i.e. ‘becoming’ the character. Makaila’s reading shows evidence of this in sentence 5 where she corrects her pronoun use from ‘my’ to ‘his’, suggesting that she was at least momentarily inhabiting the character of the younger brother. Without her self-correction the line would have been ‘how long is <italic>my</italic> sister going to be out sick?’. From a dialogic perspective, Makaila has not only allowed the voices of the text to merge with the voices of her self, she has also appropriated one of them (the younger brother) as her own and spoken using this voice.</p>
<p>The second position from which Makaila imagined the thoughts and feelings of others came from taking the character’s perspective. An example of this is in sentence 4 when Makaila reads ‘And her mom is looking at her chickenpox and now she’s telling her … um … little brother to go out ….’ While she has not ‘become’ the mom (she still uses the pronoun her), she has imagined her perspective and given the mother something to say to the little brother from that perspective.</p>
<p>The third position that Makaila assumed, and that afforded instances of social imagination, is an outside, narrator position. From this position Makaila comments and reflects on the thoughts and feelings of the characters ‘from a distance’. An example of this is in sentence 3 where Makaila reads ‘she doesn’t feel well’ and ‘her brother is messing with her’. In these instances she is attributing thoughts and feelings to the character from a narrator position, using the third person.</p>
<p>In sum, in answer to the first part of our research question, we discovered that the use of social imagination is clearly evident in Makaila’s wordless book reading, and dialogically shows her assuming different positions during the reading in relation to her understanding of the characters. If our theoretical premises are right, and social imagination is socially constructed through language events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430425">Fernyhough, 2008</xref>), then during this reading Makaila has potentially reconstructed aspects of herself through the internalization of these literary dialogic exchanges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468798411430425"><title>What social imagination did for the reader</title>
<p>In addition to being able to see and describe the various uses of social imagination in wordless book reading, we were also able to see that the use of social imagination was valuable to Makaila, as a reader, in several ways.</p>
<p>The first, and perhaps most elemental, is that the use of social imagination allowed Makaila to create, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411430425">Bruner’s (1986)</xref> terms, the ‘landscape of consciousness’ fundamental to narrative. What might have been simply a description of actions depicted in the illustrations became a story, as Makaila imagined what people were thinking and feeling. For example, in sentence 16, she reads ‘She woke up and felt excited’, referring to the inner emotional state of the sick child.</p>
<p>Secondly, and related to this idea of developing a landscape of consciousness, Makaila’s use of social imagination led her to create roles and personalities for the characters. In a Bakhtinian sense this led to voicing the characters within the narrative. Although Makaila did not use direct dialogue often, the narrative she constructed reflected her construction of the personalities in the story. Lines like ‘her brother’s kinda messing with her’ and ‘thinking how long is [his] sister going to be out sick’ gives us a picture of the personality of the boy that Makaila is inventing. This is significant in two ways. First, it demonstrates the importance of social imagination for successful reading. Secondly, it supports other work and provides specific evidence that stories are particularly rich environments for the use and hence development of social imagination.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the use of social imagination also helped Makaila establish and maintain relationships between the characters. For example, as Makaila imagined the sick child ‘not feeling well’, the account of the mother closing the door became a caring one, because the child ‘has to sleep’. Another example is Makaila’s attribution of ‘father’ to the male character and the verb ‘brung’ to describe the action of the father coming with juice and toys. Both the naming of the character and the use of language indicate a caring action and imply the loving character of the father.</p>
<p>This leads to a fourth benefit of social imagination for Makaila’s reading. The creation and maintenance of relationships, as suggested in the previous example, sometimes prompted Makaila to invent actions that reflected those relationships, even actions that were not specifically depicted in the illustrations. One example of this is when Makaila’s mother calls the doctor and tells her that she has a sick child. Makaila’s use of social imagination led her to make vicarious moral decisions about how the mother would behave in this situation. From a dialogic perspective, her participation in the dialogic exchange between characters offers her an invitation to voice moral perspectives and to rehearse and internalize her own sense of moral agency as part of her developing self. This provides further evidence that the reading process as a relational experience provokes the exercise of social imagination and consequent moral decision-making.</p>
<p>Linguistically, she achieves these important connections between thoughts and actions, the two landscapes of story, by using connecting words like ‘so’, ‘then’ and ‘because’. These causal and temporal markers help to create connections between the inner worlds of the characters and the actions depicted on the page. Indeed, the uses of causal and temporal markers are thought to be aspects of narrative competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411430425">Paris and Paris, 2003</xref>) and, as suggested, provide opportunities for vicarious moral decision-making.</p>
<p>Taken together, the invention of the landscape of consciousness, the construction and voicing of different characters, the establishment and maintenance of relationships and the role of invented action resulted in a complex narrative in which the landscapes of consciousness and action are meaningfully intertwined. While other studies have shown that stories read aloud help children begin to understand how people’s thoughts and feelings are related to how they behave, wordless book reading affords a view of these connections as the child actively imagines and voices those thoughts, feelings and intentions as she weaves them into her narrative construction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1468798411430425"><title>The reading process and the use of social imagination</title>
<p>In addition to what we learned from Makaila about the use of social imagination during reading, we observed several ways in which the use of social imagination intertwined with the reading process.</p>
<p>First, similar to what occurs in the oral reading of conventional texts, rereading and self-correction seemed to be indicative of active engagement in meaning construction. Several times, Makaila reread or changed her word choice in order to have the story make sense. This rereading and self-correcting activity seems to suggest flexibility within the meaning-making process that is useful to constructing a coherent narrative. Such flexibility involved Makaila making sometimes swift multiple dialogic moves from character to character (linguistically represented by pronoun changes) in order to explain better what was happening in the illustrations, as well as to provide a rationale for her own decisions as narrator. This is consistent with the importance of cognitive flexibility in the reading process, in which being able to move between strategies, and cueing systems, with fluidity and speed supports comprehension. In this case, the reader’s flexibility might be seen as more meta-cognitive, as she imagines the thoughts, feelings and intentions of more than one ‘other’, resulting in a set of dynamic dialogic exchanges. These rich dialogic exchanges support the reader’s creation of a coherent narrative. However, for our purposes, the importance of these exchanges is that they afford the development of social imagination as a relational capacity, as they are internalized as an active part of the developing selfhood of the child.</p>
<p>In addition, from a reading perspective, these dynamic dialogic exchanges between the reader and the characters might be thought of as particularized examples of the merger of text and self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411430425">Rosenblatt, 1938/95</xref>). It appears that this kind of flexibility, and the relational capacity of social imagination that affords it, might similarly be necessary for deep engagement with fictional non-wordless texts. In fact, voicing the thoughts and feelings of characters is a particular kind of inference. To construct inferences, to imagine something beyond that which is explicitly stated, is a critical component of reading comprehension and necessary for deep engagement in text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411430425">Duke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468798411430425">Sweet and Snow, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1468798411430425"><title>Wordless book as a mediational tool</title>
<p>Finally, given the nature of wordless books, it is no surprise that particular text characteristics seem to mediate Makaila’s use of social imagination. First, the episodic nature of the narrative as depicted in the illustrations left gaps in the plot. These spaces between events served as invitations to Makaila to create aspects of the characters that would provide the link between pairs of episodes. This sometimes prompted and supported the use of social imagination specifically. In fact the wordless book might be thought of as providing certain affordances due to the fact that it is a spatially organized text (Bearne, 2005).</p>
<p>Secondly, the ambiguous expressions of the characters invited imaginative work on Makaila’s part. The illustrations are imprecise, and in particular the eyes of the characters are often not seen clearly, making thoughts and feelings less apparent and more open to the reader’s construction.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of expression and the episodic nature of the illustrations also led to possibilities for complex and nuanced emotional states in the characters. For example, when the mother is closing the door to the bedroom and encouraging the younger brother to leave the room, she appears to be both gentle with the boy and concerned about the girl. This implied complexity in the illustrations seemed to support Makaila in creating characters that were, at times, thinking about each other and their relationships. For example, the illustration of the sick girl looking out of the window at her father and brother suggests that she is thinking about them. These characteristics of the wordless book seemed particularly important in mediating Makaila’s use of social imagination.</p>
<p>Although Makaila’s use of social imagination during wordless book reading may in some ways seem typical, the documentation of it is not. Makaila’s demonstration of how a young reader uses social imagination to construct narrative gives us evidence of the links between understanding story and understanding people. Moreover, to use social imagination, to consider the thoughts, feelings and intentions of others, is to think about thinking, and in particular to be able to think about someone else’s thinking and to put language to it. These meta-cognitive and metalinguistic skills are crucial to both academic and social development and are not something that all children do well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411430425">Paris et al., 2001</xref>). This study highlights the resources of wordless book reading specifically, and reading fictional texts more generally, for their potential to help children to develop these vital meta-cognitive skills. Furthermore, social imagination is important to children’s social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411430425">Liddle and Nettle, 2006</xref>), and therefore important not only to school success but to success in life. It becomes important then to understand the specific ways in which children may develop this human capacity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1468798411430425"><title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>There are some limitations to this study. First, we relied only on the observed linguistically-rendered text and did not ask Makaila about her reading after she had finished or capture her gestures and facial expressions, both of which might have been informative. In future studies, these data sources might prove useful.</p>
<p>In addition, we made no attempt to assess the accuracy of the instances of social imagination that we observed. Whether or not Makaila’s reading was correct, logical or verifiable in terms of the illustrations did not enter into our analysis. We also made no effort to distinguish systematically between layers of complexity within the moves of social imagination we observed. Understanding the differences in children’s use of social imagination during reading is another avenue for future research and may lead to more extensive understanding of the ways in which social imagination and reading comprehension are intertwined.</p>
<p> Finally, this is a single case study whose function is exploratory and illustrative. Insights gleaned from this work are useful within those parameters. Future studies in which individual children’s wordless book reading is recorded at regular intervals over time will give us more information about the course and variation within the development of social imagination. In addition, cross-sectional studies that look at the wordless book reading of children at a range of different developmental levels might lead to an understanding of social imagination and literacy, which has developmental markers much like reading development more generally.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1468798411430425"><title>Conclusion and implications</title>
<p>In this single case study we have documented and described the use of social imagination in wordless book reading in the hope of examining and illustrating this phenomenon. This work adds to previous studies that have shown that children’s understanding of stories provides them with important information about other people. Moving beyond previous work, this study demonstrates that the use of social imagination occurs within the reading process itself, suggesting that the process of comprehending fictional texts may be a powerful aid in the development of this relational capacity. This is theoretically consistent with the idea that stories are resources for the development of social imagination and in fact concretizes this set of ideas by providing empirical evidence of a child using social imagination during reading. It also supports the theoretical view of reading as a social and relational process.</p>
<p>We also suggest that this study may inform reading theory in terms of its relational and developmental consequences. The dialogic exchanges that occur during wordless picture book reading may offer significant opportunities for self-development in terms of the relational capacity of social imagination. More generally, this work supports the idea that to comprehend the nuances of story <italic>requires</italic> the use of social imagination, pointing to a potentially critical relationship between reading and the developing child. Moreover, we have argued that social imagination, when applied to the actions of characters, leads the reader to vicarious moral decision-making within the wordless book-reading process. Given the assumption that the dialogic exchanges between the reader and the text may be internalized, we suggest that fiction reading is a resource for moral development and self-authorship.</p>
<p>While the idea that reading is good for us is not new, we propose that the documentation of social imagination and vicarious moral decision-making within reading challenges us to rethink the importance of reading in the development of children as social and moral beings, as well as expanding the critical role of fictional texts in schools. In fact, the connections between social imagination and reading comprehension suggest that it may be useful for teachers of young children, i.e. to modify interactive reading approaches to include, more regularly, instruction in which children are encouraged to imagine the thoughts, feelings and intentions of characters.</p>
<p>Finally, this study has shown that wordless book reading can give us a window onto the use of social imagination during meaning-making as children construct narratives from illustrations. Being able to view the process of how children make connections and understand those connections between what people think and feel, and how they behave, provides new and important information on the human activity of reading and may help us to understand reading, and other literary activity, as relational processes integrally implicated in the development of the child.</p>
