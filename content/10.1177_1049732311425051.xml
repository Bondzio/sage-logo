<abstract>
<p>We assessed intergenerational differences in food, physical activity, and body size perceptions among refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa living in Victoria, Australia. We used a qualitative design and obtained data from 48 participants (18 individual interviews; 3 semistructured focus groups). Three major themes emerged: (a) food and physical activity, (b) preference of body size and social expectations, and (c) perceived consequences of various body sizes. For parents, large body size was perceived to equate with being beautiful and wealthy; slimness was associated with chronic illness and poverty. Parents adopted strategies that promoted weight gain in children. These included tailored food practices and restricting children’s involvement in physical activity. For young people, slimness was the ideal body size endorsed by their peers, and they adopted strategies to resist parental pressure to gain weight. Obesity-prevention programs in this subpopulation need to adopt a multigenerational approach.</p>

<p>Refugees and migrants moving from low-income countries to high-income countries are at increased risk of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425051">Roshania, Narayan, &amp; Oza-Frank, 2008</xref>). Refugees and migrants from an African background are at particularly high risk of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425051">Renzaho, Swinburn, &amp; Burns, 2008</xref>). For example, data from Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425051">Renzaho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311425051">Saleh, Amanatidis, &amp; Samman, 2002</xref>), the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311425051">Hervey et al., 2009</xref>), Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311425051">Gil, Vioque, &amp; Torija, 2005</xref>), and the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311425051">Agyemang et al., 2008</xref>) indicate that, following migration to high-income countries, African refugees and migrants are at increased risk of obesity and obesity-related diseases. African migrant children experience rapid catch-up growth and weight gain within the first 6 to 10 years of resettlement; however, factors that predispose them to obesity are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425051">Renzaho et al., 2008</xref>). Although it is recognized that eating and physical activity behaviors are heavily influenced by environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311425051">Swinburn, Egger, &amp; Raza, 1999</xref>), there has been little environmental research into the sociocultural aspects of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425051">de Garine &amp; Pollock, 1995</xref>). Of particular importance is the question of how sociocultural factors underpin body size preferences and patterns of eating and physical activity in any ethnic group.</p>
<p>Refugees and migrants are more affected by obesity than their host population following migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311425051">Renzaho, Gibbons, Swinburn, Jolley, &amp; Burns, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425051">Renzaho et al., 2008</xref>), and they culturally construct obesity and body sizes differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425051">de Garine &amp; Pollock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425051">Renzaho, 2004</xref>). Most studies examining sociocultural influences have been focused on established ethnic groups and migrant groups which have had high exposure to Western values and are narrow in perspective, focusing primarily on body size satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311425051">Bearman, Martinez, &amp; Stice, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311425051">Craig &amp; Caterson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311425051">Paxton, Eisenberg, &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425051">Rucker &amp; Cash, 1992</xref>) or body image and self-esteem among obese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311425051">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311425051">Thomas, Hyde, Karunaratne, Herbert, &amp; Komesaroff, 2008</xref>). It is possible that ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence could be largely explained by substantial differences in sociocultural influences on food, physical activity, and body size perceptions. One hypothesis stated that premigration cultural norms and beliefs related to body size, nutrition, and physical activity have a role to play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425051">Renzaho, 2004</xref>). However, it is unclear whether premigration beliefs persist postmigration, and whether there are any intergenerational differences. The lack of published research in the area led us to question the extent to which body-image attitudes among African youth are influenced by sociocultural factors, peers as role models, parents, and the media. Sociocultural influences are of particular interest because they are compounded by the consequences of migration, with its added complexities in terms of changing environments and cultural adaptation (acculturation).</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311425051">
<title>Application of an Acculturation Theory</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425051">Allan, Mayo, and Michel (1993)</xref> undertook research to compare values held by White and African American women related to body size, and to identify factors that influence those values and the links between body size values and weight-management activities. They found that body size perceptions and ideals of African American women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) were significantly different from African American women of higher SES, and from White women regardless of SES. African American women from a low SES background tended to be heavier, to view themselves as heavier, and to perceive attractive body size as heavier. They accepted a much heavier body weight before they defined themselves as overweight, suggesting that these women were more accepting of their appearance and larger body sizes. These findings were similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311425051">Altabe (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311425051">Botta (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311425051">DiGioacchino, Sargent, and Topping (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>The above findings, together with literature on other ethnic groups such as Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311425051">Ayala, Mickens, Galindo, &amp; Elder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425051">Franko &amp; Herrera, 1997</xref>), suggest that an individual’s body image and size perception might be determined by cultural norms rather than one’s actual physical dimensions. Therefore, one approach to examining whether culture influences body size and image perceptions among immigrants is to apply an acculturation theory to this issue. Acculturation refers to the process of cultural exchange that occurs when two distinct cultures come into contact, resulting in changes to features of both the migrating and host cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311425051">Berry, 2001</xref>). Different types of acculturation result in different beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors across many domains, including food and body size perceptions.</p>
<p>The comparison of findings across studies is problematic, however, because of differences in the measurement of acculturation. Some researchers used loose or surrogate measures of acculturation such as length of stay, generation, race, place of birth, or language spoken at home in their studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425051">Ahluwalia, Ford, Link &amp; Bolen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311425051">Himmelgreen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311425051">Lopez, Blix, &amp; Blix, 1995</xref>). For example, Lopez et al. reported that non-Latina White women, Latina born in the United States, and Latina who immigrated to the United States at age 16 or younger showed a preference for a smaller ideal body size. However, Latina who immigrated at age 17 or older showed a preference for a larger ideal body size. These findings suggest that age at migration is an important factor in shaping ideal body image, but the authors found that length of residence was not associated with ideal body image. Findings from studies using nonspecific measures of acculturation were varied and inconsistent (see Ahluwalia et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311425051">Brown, Cash, &amp; Mikulka, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Others authors used the linear model of acculturation in their research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311425051">Nicolaou et al., 2008</xref>). In this context, acculturation was considered to be the “shedding off of an old culture and the taking on of a new culture,” and assimilation was considered to be the only outcome of acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311425051">Flannery, Reise &amp; Yu, 2001</xref>, p. 1035). Articles written to report the relationship between body size perceptions and linear acculturation measures have shown mixed results: some researchers found that higher acculturation levels were associated with increased body dissatisfaction and fear of being obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425051">Franko &amp; Herrera, 1997</xref>), and others found no association (Nicolaou et al.).</p>
<p>The strongest evidence of the relationship between acculturation and body size perception was provided by the bidimensional acculturation model. The bidimensional model of acculturation proposed four types of acculturation: integration, in which identity and characteristics of both the home and host cultures were valued; assimilation, in which identity and characteristics more toward the host culture and less toward the home culture were valued; separation or traditional, in which identity and characteristics more toward the home culture and less toward the host culture were valued; and marginalization, in which identity and characteristics of neither the host nor the home culture were valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311425051">Berry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311425051">Flannery et al., 2001</xref>). Researchers who used this theory of acculturation found that assimilated women showed greater preference for thinner body sizes than traditional women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425051">Cachelin, Monreal, &amp; Juarez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311425051">Olvera, Suminski, &amp; Power 2005</xref>); however, most of their research focused on established migrant communities with a relatively longer stay, and did not examine intergenerational differences.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, according to the literature, the sociocultural determinants described above— mainly premigratory cultural norms related to food, body size perceptions, and acculturation—had a major influence on the increase in unhealthy weight gain postmigration. Premigratory experiences seemed to be particularly important because of the differences in the cultural construction of the self, identity, and body across societies. For example, when contrasting Fijian and Western attitudes toward the body, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425051">Becker (1995)</xref> argued that people in individualistic societies (such as the United States, for example) were preoccupied with their body shapes as a personal endeavor, an objective that was influenced by an individual’s notion of self as being individuated and autonomous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311425051">Triandis (1995)</xref> found that individualistic cultures consisted of loosely linked individuals who were primarily motivated by their own preferences, needs, rights, and the contracts that they had established with others. They gave higher priority to their personal goals than the goals of others. Hence, in those cultures, individuals saw their bodies as manifestations of individual selves, and cultivated their bodies with great preoccupation (Becker). Thus, constructing one’s desired look or shape became a personal endeavor for individuals in those cultures.</p>
<p>In contrast, in collectivist societies such as Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425051">Becker, 1995</xref>) and sub-Saharan African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425051">de Garine &amp; Pollock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425051">Renzaho, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311425051">Tauzin 2007</xref>), individuals showed preference for a robust body size, and a rounded body was the norm for both men and women. Individuals in collectivist cultures were found to be closely linked and primarily motivated by the norms of and duties imposed by collectives (family, coworkers, tribe, nation). They prioritized the goals of connectedness to members and emphasized collectives above their own personal agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311425051">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Therefore, in those collectivist cultures, self, identity, and body were embedded in a sociocosmic framework, with a strong vested interest in cultivating others’ bodies rather than one’s own (Becker). In those collectivist cultures, cultivating social relationships—expressed through nurturing and food exchange—were emphasized (Becker), and bodies were seen as manifestations of success or neglect in kinship care.</p>
<p>We can infer from the above observations that cultures differ markedly in their attitudes toward food and body size. When interpreted within specific cultural contexts, fatness was not reviled in all cultures. Collectivist cultures tended to view fatness positively (i.e., it was admired, considered beautiful, or associated with high social status), whereas prejudice against fat people was more closely associated with cultural values in the individualist cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311425051">Crandall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425051">Renzaho, 2004</xref>). However, individuals from collectivist cultures who migrated to industrialized countries lost their kinship support, were required to establish new social relations, and were confronted with issues related to acculturative stress. Acculturative stress was found to encompass psychological and social difficulties that accompany acculturation processes, including perceived discrimination, lack of employment, language difficulties, and intergenerational acculturation gap. An intergenerational acculturation gap between children and parents might have occurred because the children acquired the values of the host culture (language, customs, rights, and so forth) faster than their parents. Parents tended to retain their traditional culture, leading to family conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311425051">Hwang, 2006</xref>). However, it is unclear whether family conflicts and poor family functioning resulting from the intergenerational acculturation gap reduced or increased the risk of body size dissatisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311425051">Soh, Touyz, and Surgenor (2006)</xref> suggested that the level of satisfaction with the perceived family environment and family patterns preferred by different members of the family needed to be examined more closely in relation to body image and eating disturbances.</p>
<p>Therefore, our objective was to explore differences in adolescent and parent perspectives toward behaviors related to body-size perceptions, eating, and physical activity behaviors among refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa living in Victoria, Australia. This study contributes to the literature on body size perceptions and culture by (a) taking a broader perspective of body image by examining body size perceptions and associated behaviors intergenerationally, and (b) addressing these issues within the Horn of Africa community, which is a rapidly growing migrant community in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311425051">International Organization for Migration, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Design and Recruitment</title>
<p>Our research focused on the three largest African migrant groups in Melbourne: Sudanese (South Sudan), Somali, and Ethiopian, and we applied a qualitative design. Participants were recruited from a range of locations where African refugee and migrant parents and adolescents congregate, and recruitment was supported by the African Review Panel (ARP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425051">Renzaho et al., 2008</xref>). The ARP was a layperson steering committee established to review and advise on the cultural sensitivity of the interview guide, ensure community mobilization and participation, and act as an advisory body on the best way to feed the study findings back into the community. The ARP members were nominated by their respective communities and received basic training in appraisal techniques and communication strategies. The plain language statement emphasized that participation was voluntary and optional, and that confidentiality and anonymity would be maintained at all stages of the research. Confidentiality was achieved by ensuring that any information would only be disclosed with participants’ permission subject to Australian legal requirements; consent forms were stored separately from the data; the computer records were password protected; and any report or publication was written in such a way that participants could not be identified. Only members of the research team had access to the data and records, and all obtained data have been kept in confidence in locked facilities and will be disposed of after a minimum period of 6 years, in accordance with the Australian Government guidelines. To generate concepts that explain how Horn of Africa migrants culturally construct body size, eating, and physical activity, and to formulate a hypothesis based on our observations, we selected grounded theory to guide this research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311425051">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311425051">
<title>Interview Process</title>
<p>Data collection occurred between September, 2007 and July, 2008. A combination of individual interviews and focus group discussions with adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age and parents was used to enhance data richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425051">Lambert &amp; Loiselle, 2008</xref>). The allocation of individuals to one-on-one interviews or a focus group was based on availability and whether they belonged to an already-formed social group. Individual interviews were conducted using a standardized protocol to obtain individual attitudes and perceptions related to body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311425051">Taylor &amp; Bogdan, 1984</xref>). For one-on-one individual interviews, we interviewed participants until we reached data saturation in topic areas. Interviews took place at a mutually agreed time and location and lasted approximately 14 minutes on average. Each focus group discussion took approximately 65 minutes. For adolescents, consent to participate was also provided by their parent or guardian. By the end of the 18th individual interview (12 with parents and six with adolescents), the data had reached saturation.</p>
<p>Building on themes that emerged from one-on-one interviews, we conducted three focus group discussions to elicit a multiplicity of views and to add robustness to the data quality and meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425051">Lambert &amp; Loiselle, 2008</xref>). Each focus group involved eight to 10 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311425051">Hawe, Degeling, &amp; Hall, 1990</xref>). Prior to this research we conducted a pilot study, and found that focus group discussions among refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa that include a gender mix provide robust data when the issue being researched relates to traditional values. Thus, the focus group discussions included one with Ethiopian mothers, one with mixed-gender Sudanese parents, and one with mixed-gender and mixed-nationality adolescents. In this sense, focus group interviews allowed synergism (i.e., helped generate a bank of data through group interactions), snowballing of ideas (i.e., statements of respondents initiated a chain of reaction for additional comments), stimulation (i.e., the group discussion generated excitement about the topic), security (i.e., the group discussion provided comfort and encouraged responses), and spontaneity (i.e., because participants were not required to answer every question, their responses were more spontaneous and genuine), concepts which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311425051">Birmingham &amp; Wilkinson (2003)</xref> described as important. Similarly, sociability was an important construct in the selection of focus groups, because collectivism and oral literacy are embedded in African social and cultural life in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311425051">Renzaho, Green, Mellor, &amp; Swinburn, 2010</xref>), and shape knowledge exchange and transmission and promote decision making as a process that is heavily influenced by wider family and social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311425051">Komarraju &amp; Cokley, 2008</xref>). Thus, the focus groups were drawn from existing networks.</p>
<p>Data were collected by three trained and experienced bilingual workers who had experience working with these communities. Those who participated in individual interviews were not eligible to take part in focus group discussions. Participants’ self-reported country of origin, age, number of children/siblings, and length of stay in Australia were recorded. Interviewed adolescents and parents did not come from the same family. One focus group and all of the one-on-one interviews were audio recorded. At the request of the participants, for cultural reasons, case notes were taken in two of the focus groups instead of creating audio recordings. When possible, at the end of each interview or focus group session, the recording was played from the beginning to give participants a chance to make corrections and/or add comments. When notes were taken, participants were given the opportunity to check transcripts and to make corrections and additions as appropriate. All tapes were transcribed verbatim for data analysis. Participants were compensated for their time with a $15 gift voucher, and were provided with refreshments during focus group discussions. The research protocol and interview guide (see Appendix 1) were approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To condense our transcripts into a structure and to develop a model that established clear links between emerging themes and research objectives, we used an inductive approach to analyze the data. Transcripts and written contemporaneous notes from focus groups were subjected to manual thematic analysis. Transcriptions of individual interviews and focus groups were summarized and then manually coded for emerging themes. Notes were used to confirm the coded themes, persistent words, phrases, or concepts that extended throughout the notes and transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311425051">Constas, 1992</xref>). The transcripts and field notes were read and summarized by the first author, and independently summarized by the second author and two African Review Panel members. In summarizing the findings, codes that shared a relationship constituted the creation of categories, and subsequently, the identification of emergent themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425051">Green et al., 2007</xref>). When a theme was identified by one person but could not be confirmed by the other three people, the theme was dropped from the analysis. Quotations were chosen to exemplify differences and commonalities in community representatives’ diverse views and experiences.</p>

<title>Food and Physical Activity Behaviors</title>
<sec id="section8-1049732311425051">
<title>Body size perceptions and feeding practices</title>
<p>Parents tended to be traditional, maintaining and reinforcing premigratory beliefs related to food practices. They maintained food practices that promoted weight gain, which was interpreted as a sign of success and preservation of cultural values. According to parents, such feeding strategies helped them maintain cultural pride and meet expectations of relatives both in Australia and in their country of origin. They provided young people with enough weight for self-defense against rough school mates and security for the family (someone with a physical presence). Popular parental strategies to promote weight gain among children included making young people drink a lot of milk and eat cheese and yogurt for strong bones, and taking children to take-away food shops once or twice a week. Children were also encouraged by the parents to eat more meat, pasta, sugary foods, or whey protein. Examples of comments about these strategies included: “My two children are too skinny for their age. I give them a lot of milk, biscuits, and yogurt. I give them some juice or soft drinks for snacks.” “I have been giving the boy some whey protein. . . . The mother looks after the girl in the kitchen, she feeds her.” “My parents want me to put on some weight. This is ridiculous. We are in Australia, and not Africa.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311425051">
<title>Coping mechanisms to prevent weight gain</title>
<p>In contrast, young people tended to assimilate to the host culture, which discouraged excessive weight gain. Consequently, they adopted strategies to resist parental pressure to put on weight and to meet the expectations of their peers:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She wants me to put on weight and wants me to eat more food. So I put more clothes on to make her happy, to meet her expectations. . . . And at school kids tease me, saying stuff like, “You are skinny,” and they push me around and stuff. But if you put more clothes on they do not say anything. So it is a coping mechanism against the guys at school who try to bully me, as well as making Mummy [Mother] happy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The strategies adopted by the children to overcome familial and peer pressures included skipping meals, refusing to eat traditional food, requesting money so they could choose what food they ate or bought from the school canteen, and increasing and diversifying their physical activity; for example: “To lose weight, I can skip breakfast. I pretty much only have breakfast on the weekends and for lunch sometimes the whole week.” This finding was also confirmed by parents: “My son does skip meals, he does not like food. He likes to skip lunch.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311425051">
<title>Conflict and confusion between parents and children regarding meals and traditional foods</title>
<p>The data showed an intergenerational acculturation gap in relation to food. Parents considered sandwiches to be an insufficient lunch meal for school. In contrast, for most young people, these sandwiches were sufficient and were more appropriate for school lunch than traditional food. Young people noted that traditional food required refrigeration, reheating, and cutlery, and was too spicy. They all remarked that taking traditional food to school was not “cool.” All interviewed young people indicated that their refusal to take traditional food to school meant that parents gave them money (about AU$5) every day so they could buy food from the canteen at school. Buying lunch at the school canteen was interpreted as “cool,” and allowed them to blend in because they used the money to buy foods similar to that eaten by their peers. Although getting money for lunch increased their purchasing power and freedom of choice, young people also noted that this amount was not enough to buy a healthy meal, and the temptation was to buy junk foods instead, most of which fell within their budgetary limitations. Participants (from both interviews and focus groups) elaborated on these issues:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The food they eat at home, when they come home from school, that is what we call lunch. So what he takes to school, that is not lunch, they are sandwiches. When they come from school they have to eat again, because I am busy preparing food all day for them.</p>
<p>I would like my kid to eat the traditional food but he does not like [it]. I get upset with him and tell him, “Eat.” They [children] cannot take traditional food to school. They won’t eat traditional food, so we take them to convenience fast food store like McDonalds, KFC [Kentucky Fried Chicken], Hungry Jack, Pizza Hut. We give them $5 every day to buy lunch at school. I just give them $5 each, every day.</p>
<p>Because in high school it is embarrassing to take traditional food from home. Too messy! We do not want to stand alone and stand out when everybody is having sandwiches and answering questions like, “What is this, are you having spaghetti?” . . . Yeah, I get $5 every day, but this is not enough to buy a healthy meal. I like having a chicken burger, you know, it is irresistible. And a hot dog for sure.</p>
<p>It is not cool! Being cool is being popular. Then being popular breaks down to all these branches. One is having friends. One is not taking food cooked from home, but another is the way you dress. . . . Well, you have to be thin. You have to be funny, and you have to be a bit smart. Not too smart. You do not fit in these criteria if you bring traditional food to school. Being cool is not sitting in the corner with their home-cooked traditional food and reading books, but it is about buying stuff from the canteen. All the cool people in our school, they play soccer and they play cool sports and are fit. And they are funny.</p>

<sec id="section11-1049732311425051">
<title>Take-away food and social status</title>
<p>Parents noted that pocket money increased children’s food purchasing power and reduced parental control of their children’s food consumption. As a result, children prioritized take-away foods. Parents remarked that when their children refused the traditional foods, they would feed them take-away foods, and that they associated take-away food with higher social status. One parent summed it up during a focus group discussion:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Back home we did not have the freedom of buying these foods from the restaurants. The issue was the money. They were very expensive, seen as food for rich people. Because we are all equal here [in Australia] financially, you say, “Why would we bother ourselves with cooking or buying the veggie we know were for the poor?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section12-1049732311425051">
<title>Nutrition knowledge gap</title>
<p>Parental lack of knowledge about healthy eating impeded their ability to make a healthy lunch, and was identified as one of the biggest problems contributing to conflicts between parents and children. According to parents, young people demonstrated adequate knowledge of their nutritional and health risks by attending school, being able to read and understand English, or follow health programs on television. Thus, parents viewed children as a reliable source of health information at the family level. They stressed that because children had more nutrition knowledge than their parents, it was hard for parents to convince the children to accept food they did not want, which ultimately led to intergenerational conflicts. Children’s refusal to eat traditional food or to comply with parental demands made parents believe that they had lost both power and control of their children. Another conflict between parents and children related to the knowledge gap occurred when children used their knowledge advantage and tried to tell the father or the mother how to eat healthily. Family education in terms of nutrition has traditionally been a sole responsibility of the parents, and especially the mother, regardless of what children learn in schools. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When we were in Somalia we never had consciousness of the link between heavy weight and diseases. And now we have this awareness all the time. Teenagers know they are at risk of obesity. They know their risk because of being in school. This brings arguments, and trying to tell the father or the mother the right way, but he or she does not want to know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311425051">
<title>Work demand and stress</title>
<p>Parents noted that, prior to migration, fathers were the breadwinners and mothers had access to domestic workers to help with household chores. However, following migration, mothers were required to work to provide for their family, a situation which they described as stressful. They no longer had sufficient time to interact with children around the dinner table:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Back home we had a lot of time together with our kids, but now you leave home at 9:00 in the morning and you come back at 5:00 or 5:30. When you work, and by the time you come home you are too tired. . . . You cannot sit down at a table and have a healthy meal together because you are exhausted, and you have no help here. It is contributing to the weight problem. Back home, if you are working you can afford helpers who will prepare the meal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732311425051">
<title>Body size perception and physical activity</title>
<p>Parents reported restricting young people’s involvement in sport to promote weight gain in children. Restricting young people’s involvement in sport was more pronounced among fathers, because they feared that sport contributed to weight loss and prevented young children from becoming “fleshy”; for example: “I will encourage her not to lose weight more than this, and I will not bring instruments or equipment for exercise into the house. So I will ban exercise instruments in the house.” Most fathers considered taking children to their organized sport or the park to do physical activity as a waste of time and pointless, because there was no tangible outcome like there was with farming, as demonstrated by the following statements:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is good having the soccer teams now, but fathers worry and do not want to be involved. So we need to look for ways for involving the fathers. They are still living a traditional life and they do not want to be involved in exercise. Because this was part of the concept of health back home. Exercise is pointless, time consuming; there is no end product like, say, farming.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I want my child to put on a little bit of weight, but on the other hand he is very active. With the young ones it is good having the soccer teams, but fathers worry and do not want to be involved because of the time and resources required to take the children to training, matches. This is not their priority. Exercise is not on our agenda. But I think being very active prevents him from putting on weight. I have asked him to reduce his level of activity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the fathers’ restrictions, youth identified mothers as role models for physical activity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She [mother] used to be big when we arrived in Australia. Sometimes she wakes me up in the morning so I can wake up and brush my teeth and stuff, so I can go for a run. Daddy does not know that I am going for a run. Mummy encourages me to exercise so I do not turn out like herself, I think, because she turned out like, fat.</p>
<p>My Daddy would not be comfortable with me exercising because he thinks it is not comfortable for me. He does not like when people are really skinny. He thinks by exercising I am going to be skinnier. He is now worried, and he wants me to put on weight, encouraging me to eat sugary food such as doughnuts so I do not become skinnier. But my mummy is not worried; she is cool for me to exercise. She herself has lost a bit of weight, I think. And my father always says to her, “You are just wasting your time. You are all right like that. Do not do that again.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, mothers identified the complexity of legislation related to the use of public space and safety in the neighborhood as two other reasons that compel parents to restrict children’s engagement in physical activity. One noted,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Around the suburb and the house, it is not safe. The park is far, because here there are people who inject drugs and they throw syringe, and if you step on it then you are finished. I am worried about that.</p>

<title>Preference of Body Size and Social Expectations</title>
<p>For parents, a large body size was perceived to equate to being beautiful and wealthy. Parents used various terms to describe a large body size, and these included: <italic>fleshy, happiness, well fed, wellness, strong, powerful, status, wealthy, trustworthiness, attractive</italic>, and <italic>respect</italic>, especially at work and on the street. The expressed preferences for a large body size were consistent with the beliefs and values that prevailed in the countries of origin. Parents stressed that back home, if a person was big it reflected his or her status. To their disappointment, they stated that if a person was big in Australia, people would say that he or she “should lose weight,” whereas in Africa, people would say he or she was “beautiful and rich,” and consider it a job well done. Parents commented that, if an African migrant is big, the family takes pride in it because it means they are wealthy parents and can afford any foods they want to enjoy. One parent summed it up this way:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Big body size means you have plenty to eat. We have a proverb that says, “Whatever goes through your throat is seen through your body.” If you are thin, it means not much food goes through your throat, you are poor.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only four mothers, all of whom were single (divorced or widows), mostly educated, and/or had overweight children, showed different attitudes toward large body size. Freedom from pressure from men, increased knowledge about obesity, and acculturation all contributed to the desire to lose weight, as they remarked:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have lost weight now. I was even bigger than this. I was 120 kilos before. . . . I used to get too sluggish. I am divorced and I do not want men now. That’s why I can afford to lose weight. I made a decision because my kids are young and I do not want to die. . . . If you live in Australia, you try to adapt to their way of living, otherwise it is depressing. . . . [Unfortunately], my husband didn’t like skinny women.</p>
<p>I have reduced the consumption of sugar. . . . As a family of five we used to consume 18 kilograms of sugar per week. Now we consume only six kilograms of sugar a week. I have learned how to prepare tasty vegetables for the kids. . . . This has helped reduce the consumption of meats.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notions of beauty varied between genders. For a man, it was a combination of having a lot of money and being large in body size, particularly a big bottom and belly, which made him “beautiful.” For women, beauty was associated with being big and tall, and shape was an important consideration, especially the shape of the bottom. For most parents, especially women, “short and slim” was seen to be a bad combination. Notwithstanding this, women reported that having a balloon-like shape and big stomach were undesirable, and that was what they referred to as being overweight/obese, as exemplified by one mother:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I put on weight here [in Australia]. I had a big stomach, which I didn’t have in Africa. . . . People were asking me if I was pregnant, which I did not like . . . but if you are a [tall] woman and you have bigger body size, you are more attractive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, adolescents deviated from the parents’ body shape values toward values accepted and endorsed by peers. Adolescents who were slim, tall, and elegant reported satisfaction with their looks and often got compliments from peers. For example, they made comments like the following: “I am really thin. I like it. I do not want to change. . . . However, if I put on weight, she [mother] does get a bit happy, only when she notices.” “In Australia if you are big, people say it is not good being fat. You do not get friends, you get discriminated against. That is why I am afraid to put on weight.”</p>
<p>For parents, slimness equated to sickness or ugliness. For example: “Thinness means [being] unwell, TB [tuberculosis] or AIDS. Thin means ugly. The beauty is not how you look, it is your size.” Parents stressed that people who were slender were poor, had many problems, and did not have money to buy food or to welcome relatives and friends into their home. However, there was no standard definition of slimness, and children who had adequate body size and were tall and elegant but had a flat bottom were referred to by their parents as “slim” or “thin.” For example,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She is not that skinny, but she is slim. If the collar bones is so deep that you could put water and maintain it, then that is too skinny. When big bones are protruding, nobody wants that. If her bones are all covered with adequate flesh—that is what is normal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these cases, most parents expressed disapproval and dissatisfaction, and made derogatory comments about their slender child to friends and relatives:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have three children. The seven-year-old one is the thinnest. When she gets home I give her McDonalds for two weeks, and I sometimes stop working and stop her going to school for two weeks so she wouldn’t lose more weight. The doctor said she is okay because she is growing tall. But despite getting the medical attention, that the child is okay, I am still worried. When I put her in dresses, she does not look good in the clothes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were some occasions on which parents were happy and satisfied with their children’s slimness. In a few cases, parental satisfaction with slimness in children was expressed when the child was slender but showed signs of progress at school or sport as a career.</p>
<p>For young people, slimness was the ideal in Australia. Young people who were slim indicated that they wanted to remain so because most of their friends and school mates were small and slim. They wanted to fit in. For the majority of the young people, remaining slim was associated with getting complimentary comments from their peers, and not getting discriminated against or bullied at school for being overweight. For example: “I am naturally thin, and get compliments at school such as, ‘You are very tall for your age and elegant. I would love to be as tall as you.’ But Mummy wants me to gain weight.” Young people stressed that in Australia, decisions about everyday life were very dependent on and heavily influenced by television (TV) programs. They maintained that television programs in Australia portrayed slimness as the ideal “gold standard” for beauty, that clothes advertised on television were for slim people, and that large people in small clothes were portrayed as “ugly.” As a result, young people who were overweight indicated they were trying to lose weight against their parents’ wishes, leading to intergenerational conflict:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Children of my age I see on TV are slimmer than I am. My friends at school think I am a bit chubby, and children who are chubby like me won’t feature on those TV advertisements. I have been trying to lose weight, and every day I go through the park from school to exercise before coming home. . . . But it is difficult for me. My mother thinks that after school I am tired and I should come straight home to have food and rest so I do not become weak.</p>

<title>Perceived Consequences of Various Body Sizes</title>
<sec id="section17-1049732311425051">
<title>Body size and shape linked to marriage for women</title>
<p>For women, body size and shape were closely linked to the likelihood of getting married. Men would be able to marry the woman of their choice regardless of whether they were slender or large, as long as they could afford the dowry; however, if a woman was slender she would not be able to marry a husband of her first choice: “If you are that skinny you won’t get a good husband. You might just get somebody who everybody does not like. Like a second-class citizen.” Even though slender women got “leftover men,” they were still expected to gain weight after getting married to fulfill the husband’s expectations. Failing to gain weight would lead to three possible outcomes: The husband would divorce the wife and marry another woman, or keep the wife and take a second wife (polygamy), or run away from familial pressure (abandon his wife, but not necessarily remarry). When a slim woman married, the pressure to gain weight came in different forms, but mainly from the husband’s family. Various definitions were given to describe a woman who failed to gain weight after getting married. For example: “If a woman does not gain weight after she is married it means [she] does not like people to visit her. . . . She is depressed because people come to visit her and eat her food.” “Not gaining weight means that she [married woman] is talking too much and that she is having problems with people around her. . . . She likes to make trouble with her husband or other people.” “In Somalia, if a woman is married and skinny, it means her husband does not know how to look after her.”</p>

<title>Other perceived social and health consequences associated with obesity</title>
<p>Both men and women observed that overweight people in Australia become sick mainly because of the “poison” in the Australian food—notably chemicals, colors, and additives—and their risk was exacerbated by sedentary behaviors. The link between chemicals and the likelihood of overweight people developing chronic diseases such as diabetes was so strongly felt by participants that they attributed the current rise of diabetes in Sudan to increased wars, with gun residues perceived to affect fruit and vegetables. This view was held by a significant number of people, exemplified by the following quote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These diseases [diabetes] are mostly common now in Sudan. . . . Because people have been in war for a long time, so maybe if it is the reaction to guns’ residues, getting affected by guns’ residues through the air or affecting plants they consume, I mean pollution. In the past we didn’t hear any case of cancer, but now it is common in Sudan. I have seen those who have put on bodies [weight] back home have problems now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents lamented the fact that despite many people in Australia being overweight, clothes were made for slim people and not for large body sizes. Parents noted that it was difficult to find adequate clothing for larger body sizes, and that this difficulty led to feeling depressed. Parents noted that when their children tried to wear clothes that did not fit for their age and size, they looked ugly because their large bodies were more suited for traditional clothes. These traditional clothes were seen to be more attractive on overweight girls, but they refused to wear them, preferring to wear what they saw on television, even though those outfits might not suit their body shape. A parent summed this up during a focus group discussion:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Australia, clothes are made for thin people only. Large people in small clothes, clothes made for skinny people, look ugly. The TV says, “Do like this, do like that. Shrink to fit in these clothes, like jeans.” However, our bodies look nice in our traditional clothes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, for young people, the consequences associated with being overweight included being teased and bullied at school, discrimination, and exclusion. For those who were slim, the main problem was the rejection and denigration they received at the family level, which led to low self-esteem. For example: “Big people get bullied at school, teased in the locker area. It is as, if you are big you shouldn’t have friends.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article we present the first research (to our knowledge) exploring intergenerational differences in body size perceptions among African migrants in Australia. We found intergenerational incongruence related to body size perception, food, and physical activity. Our findings have major implications for obesity prevention in this population, and potentially other migrant populations with similar intergenerational conflicts about food, physical activity, and body size. The observed intergenerational differences in terms of body size perceptions and health consequences might be explained by differences in acculturation between migrant parents and their children. Based on the bidimensional model of acculturation theory, children might be more likely to assimilate or integrate following migration, rapidly acquiring the cultural values of their new environment, including wanting to be slim to be accepted by their peers in Australian schools.</p>
<p>In contrast, parents might seek to reinforce traditionally oriented values to maintain traditionally held beliefs and values related to body size perception. Most parents preferred large body sizes and did not see any health consequences provided that children were not obviously sick and were not teased at school. The positive attitude toward a larger body size has also been reported among Canadian urban Aboriginal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311425051">Fleming et al., 2006</xref>), Mexican American parents in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425051">Jean, Bondy, Wilkinson, &amp; Forman, 2009</xref>), and a sample of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds living in the northeastern United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425051">Cheney, 2010</xref>). Cheney undertook an ethnographic study of 18 women to examine how these women dealt with the messages of the dominant White society’s obsession with thinness, and whether it affected their perceptions of an ideal body image. The sample was comprised of White, Hispanic, Persian, Filipino, Jamaican, Vietnamese, Peruvian, Black Puerto Rican, Indian Italian, and Asian Indian women. She found that the majority of these women viewed a slender body ideal as a vehicle for increased social acceptance. However, not all women idealized the Western slender body. Several participants mocked the image of the slender girl, and for those of a Jamaican background, a beautiful woman must have a more curvaceous body type: “Ideally the female is curvy, has a big butt, big boobs [breasts], everything is big” (Cheney, p. 6). Similarly, participants of a Peruvian background rejected the slender body ideal, contested the hegemonic Western beauty codes, and idealized a voluptuous body image which resonated with their notions of beauty.</p>
<p>Thus, in this study, parents lacked both the awareness and knowledge about diseases associated with diet and overweight, and the health benefits of physical activity. The intergenerational acculturation gap seemed to contribute to poor relationships between parents and their children, ineffective feeding practices, and was the main source of personal, intergenerational, and intrafamilial conflicts. Skipping meals and refusing traditional foods as strategies to resist parental pressure to gain weight might have been part of the young people’s attempts to obtain peer acceptance and to assert their independence from their parents. This independence from parents is different from how children in African countries are brought up.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425051">Crockett &amp; Sims (1995)</xref> found that children in Western countries were encouraged to be part of decision making, be autonomous, and to care for themselves and show independence in food selection and preparation; for example, by packing their own lunch box. The youth in the current study displayed a preference for a similar level of independence, and their tendencies to refuse or reject traditional foods resulted in them receiving money every day to purchase lunch, resulting in increased independence with regard to food choice. The youth were likely to snack on high-energy, low-nutrient foods through the school canteens and/or to skip meals. Such eating behaviors predispose African migrant children to risk factors linked to the development of obesity and chronic diseases related to obesity in adulthood.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425051">Grivetti (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311425051">Darby, Ghalioungui, and Grivetti (1997)</xref> insisted that the predilection for larger body size among populations of an African origin appears to date back to antiquity; however, it is possible that the overwhelming preference for a larger body size reported in this article might be influenced by the high prevalence of chronic diseases, poverty, and undernutrition that characterize the premigration environment. Renzaho observed,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is known for its chronic poverty, population displacement due to war, ethnic conflicts and natural disasters and subsequently high levels of malnutrition (undernutrition). Consequently, the cultural exposure of sub-Saharan Africans to this suffering is likely to have a major influence on the way body weight is socially constructed and positioned. (2004, p. 106)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This observation was also validated among Jamaicans. In an ethnographic study of traditional Jamaican beliefs about the body, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311425051">Sobo (1993)</xref> noted that the moral character of individuals was interpreted in terms of their body size and shape. The authors noted that fatness and thinness were outcomes of the distribution of resources, in a country where people are generally poor and rely on interdependence for survival. In this sense, fatness was interpreted as good health, abundance, and a generous nature. In contrast, thinness was considered as a state of inferiority characterized by the withering of the body. Nevertheless, the fact that sub-Saharan Africans have continued to hold positive attitudes toward a larger body size postmigration suggests that body image and body size perceptions in this subpopulation have strong cultural roots.</p>
<p>As a way of comparison, preference for a larger body size was observed in industrialized countries during the post second world war famine period. Grivetti noted,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century in North America obesity was admired; wealthy consumers exhibited their wealth around their waist. Fat cheeks and ample stomachs were visual cues that individuals were healthy, not infected with the dreaded slim tuberculosis. Photographs of American executives taken during the late 19th and early 20th centuries reveal that dietary intakes of wealthy gentlemen regularly exceeded calories expended. (2001, p. S5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The preference for a larger body size observed in industrialized countries during this period, however, disappeared at the turn of the 20th Century and was replaced with the preference for lean body size (Grivetti). This transition in body image and body size perceptions coincided with the boom in technology, media, and the entertainment industry, suggesting environmental influences.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>The strengths of the current research include data from parents and adolescents, data on participants from three different countries, and a clear consensus (early saturation). However, participants were recruited through established networks, and only participants who were familiar with the various centers that we used as points of entry to reach the community were likely to be included in the research. Hence, more studies are required to replicate these findings in the wider African communities.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>We conclude that there are intergenerational challenges that need to be addressed by researchers, health professionals, African communities, and organizations working with African migrants to ensure better targeting and delivery of successful settlement programs. In light of the results presented in this article, obesity prevention programs need to be closely linked with settlement programs to address issues related to acculturation and intergenerational conflicts. Programs should also focus on health education to improve parents’ knowledge about healthy eating and the benefits of physical activity, and to dispel myths held by parents regarding the causes of chronic diseases related to obesity. Greater emphasis should be placed on improving relationships between parents and their children, with a particular focus on conflict resolution; for example, through parenting programs and role plays (mainly targeting fathers). Such programs would need to recognize the networks and the environments that influence African migrants’ behaviors, and work holistically to support African migrant parents with adolescent children within the community structures.</p>
