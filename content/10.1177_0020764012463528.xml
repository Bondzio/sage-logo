<p>As the editors note in their preface to this interesting collection, Rank and Freud lived near each other in Vienna during the first three decades of the last century, in the formative years of psychoanalysis. Rank was 28 years Freud’s junior, a technical person with an interest in music – characteristics that Freud lacked. Rank was secretary of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and kept the minutes of their meetings. The editors have classified these letters into categories, with those of major and medium importance in the main text. The emergence of Rank into an intellectual and administrative force in the field of psychoanalysis, albeit gradual, as the editors note, can be attributed to the significant influence Freud had on Rank. This interesting volume starts with a short introduction dealing with Otto Rank. The first chapter deals with the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, describing the establishment of the Society and the international psychoanalytic congresses and the yearbook. The departure of Alfred Adler from the Society following the development of his own theories, of which Freud did not approve, is described in chapter two. As any theory gets accepted, it is inevitable that other ideas will emerge and, sooner or later, a degree of splintering will occur. The following chapter provides an overview of Jung’s relationship with Freud and his contributions to the field of psychoanalysis. When the committee to guide and guard the psychoanalytic movement was established in May 1913, Freud wanted it kept secret. In the ritualistic mode Freud presented five of his colleagues each with an antique engraved stone to be mounted in a ring. Subsequently, each chapter details a theme, but in a historical and chronological manner. There is enough material and evidence here to provide an interesting overview to the general reader but also to those who are interested in psychoanalysis. This is a useful volume that places psychoanalysis in a historical context, both at a broader national and global level and at a personal level, for all the key participants in the theory of psychoanalysis.</p>
