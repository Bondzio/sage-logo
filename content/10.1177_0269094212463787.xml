<abstract>
<p>The World Development Report ‘Reshaping Economic Geography’ is a bold attempt to set the agenda for spatial economic policy throughout the world. It promises governments a way to tackle uneven development by combining the pursuit of socio-spatial equality with stronger economic growth. This involves increasing density, reducing distance and lowering divisions. The framework is neat and internally consistent, but reducing the complexity of spatial development to a few simple distinctions results in serious omissions and shortcomings. First, the social, environmental and political effects of rapid urbanisation are neglected. Second, the role of local and regional institutions is ignored because of the focus on national institutions. Third, there is undue faith in the ability of trade and market forces to reduce spatial inequalities and a lack of faith in the capabilities of the state to stimulate development.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212463787" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Within a few years of reaching the tipping point when the majority of the world’s population lives in urban areas, the World Bank launched a major salvo into debates about unequal growth with its 2009 <italic>World Development Report</italic> (<italic>WDR</italic>). Titled <italic>Reshaping Economic Geography</italic>, the report represents an ambitious intervention by the Bank aimed at setting the intellectual agenda for spatial economic policy in the years ahead. It seeks to provide robust principles and guidelines applicable throughout the world about how to tackle geographical inequality and unbalanced growth, with the intention to give a deliberate steer to government policies and investment priorities. It also provides a lucid framework for policy analysis and evaluation that is already proving influential. Above all, the <italic>WDR</italic> offers governments the bold promise of a way to reconcile one of the fundamental challenges involved in tackling uneven development, namely to reduce social inequality without undermining economic growth. For all these reasons, it deserves close scrutiny by policy researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212463787"><title>The <italic>World Development Report</italic> analysis</title>
<p>The central argument of the <italic>WDR</italic> is that economic growth will inevitably be unbalanced, but development can still be inclusive. It argues that the appropriate way for governments to ensure inclusive growth is by promoting economic efficiency and integration, while providing universal welfare services to the population wherever they live. Economic efficiency and integration are best achieved through international trade, specialisation, economies of scale, and connecting leading and lagging regions. Governments should focus their efforts on enabling economic concentration and growth to occur in favourable locations and pursuing ‘people-based’ policies, rather than more activist ‘place-based’ policies in less advantageous locations.</p>
<p>Looking back over the long sweep of economic history, progress is said to be necessarily accompanied by significant shifts in the distribution of population and economic activity. Spatial changes are also accompanied by sectoral changes as economies progress from agriculture towards manufacturing and higher value services. In other words, economic development is intimately bound up with sectoral and spatial transformation. The main drivers of spatial development are identified as <italic>density</italic>, <italic>distance</italic> and <italic>division</italic> – the catchy 3Ds. These relate closely to the three geographic scales analysed in the report – urban, national and international.</p>
<p><italic>Density</italic> refers to the growing concentration of people and firms in selected places. It is most relevant to urban development and the interactions between cities and their hinterlands. <italic>Distance</italic> is mainly physical distance but it also covers other frictions that impede beneficial economic interactions. It determines the size of the gap between lagging and leading regions within countries. <italic>Divisions</italic> are international borders and other barriers that affect the level of economic interaction between countries. The <italic>WDR</italic> distils a wealth of historical evidence to argue that economic development has generally gone hand in hand with higher densities, shorter distances and fewer divisions.</p>
<p>The <italic>WDR</italic> argues further that economic development depends on efficient, well-regulated markets for land, labour and goods. Each factor market is most important at a specific geographic scale. Land markets are crucial in the urban context. Efficient land markets respond to changing demand (e.g. from industry to offices) and adapt to facilitate agglomeration and economies of scale through increasing densification over time. Flexible labour markets are vital at the regional scale to ensure that people in lagging areas migrate towards opportunities in more dynamic areas. Efficient product markets are necessary at the international scale. Functional transport networks and rising trade in specialised goods and services between countries enable higher national incomes and living standards.</p>
<p>The final section of the <italic>WDR</italic> draws out policy implications to promote economic development through urbanisation, regional growth and international integration. It gives advice for <italic>how</italic> to increase density, reduce distance and lower divisions. A controversial message is that the key instrument at each level is to put in place <italic>spatially-blind institutions</italic>, i.e. policies that apply to all locations. This includes laws and regulations to ensure efficient markets, coupled with government provision of basic welfare services such as education, health, clean water and safety from crime (people-based policies). This is supposed to ensure that people’s life chances do not depend on their place of birth and that they are equipped to take advantage of economic opportunities wherever they arise.</p>
<p>Once such national institutions and programmes are established and low income economies are progressing towards an intermediate stage of development, the second priority is <italic>transport and communications infrastructure</italic> that connects places and facilitates agglomeration, mobility and economic specialisation (i.e. integration). At a higher stage of development, a third policy may be appropriate – <italic>spatial targeting</italic>, i.e. programmes that benefit a specific area (place-based policies). This may be necessary as a last resort to tackle the most difficult development problems, but should be ‘used sparingly since this is where misallocation is most likely’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212463787">Deichmann et al., 2011</xref>: 167). Spatial targeting is only recommended in restricted conditions, namely countries with all of the following characteristics: high levels of urbanisation, divided cities, large regional disparities and small economies that are isolated from world markets.</p>
<p>An important message is that low- and middle-income countries should not divert resources into trying to prevent or improve overcrowded ‘slum’ settlements, beyond providing basic household services. The <italic>WDR</italic> says that spatial problems of this intensity can only be properly addressed once countries attain higher incomes. In the meantime, they need to accept concentrated poverty as a fact of life. A related message is that large regional inequalities are also inevitable in low- and middle-income countries since growth tends to focus in the early days on a few places with some natural advantage or head-start. But with access to decent schools, health facilities and sanitation, lagging regions will gradually catch up and poverty will fall.</p>
<p>The <italic>WDR</italic> says that these market‐driven transition processes may take time and require patient and predictable universal people-based policies. However, it states that there is no alternative since subsidised industrial zones, major infrastructure schemes and other ‘quick fixes’ are most likely to become white elephants. Furthermore, spatially-targeted initiatives that divert jobs from the most dynamic urban economies and siphon off their surplus resources may damage overall growth and national income by restricting agglomeration forces, reducing productivity and efficiency, and depriving growth areas of the investment they need to fuel further expansion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212463787"><title>Critical assessment</title>
<p>The <italic>WDR</italic> framework is certainly neat and internally consistent. Careful crafting has enabled complex spatial problems to be analysed along a restricted set of dimensions. The conceptual distinctions have an intuitive appeal and will be relatively accessible to most policy makers, evaluators and researchers. Yet there is a price to be paid for the heroic effort to embrace such a wide range of geographical scales and influences on economic development, and for the global reach of the policy proposals. The result is a series of omissions and simplifications that render the framework vulnerable to the charge of being far too broad-brush and insufficiently discriminating between different national contexts. Some of these gaps are perhaps issues of detail that could be inserted into particular case studies to give a more rounded account of specific situations. This is how the main authors have responded to criticisms of the report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212463787">Deichmann et al., 2011</xref>). However, some of the omissions are more serious and threaten to discredit the core policy prescriptions.</p>
<p>Environmental and social issues receive scant attention; hence the impact of rapid urbanisation on pollution, congestion, water scarcity, ecological resilience, communicable diseases, social inequality, ethnic conflict and violence is neglected. Since most of the world’s large-scale urban growth in the next few decades is going to occur in the poorest cities and nations that are most vulnerable to climatic disasters, this limitation is problematic. If the negative social and environmental externalities of large cities were properly incorporated into the analysis, the conclusions about supporting ever-increasing agglomeration and postponing slum upgrading until a high level of economic development was attained would almost certainly have to be qualified.</p>
<p>Territorial politics also appear to be neglected. There is an obvious difficulty in most developing countries of proposing that investment in economic infrastructure should be focused on the cities, while rural areas only qualify for better welfare services. Policies which advocate that desperate rural dwellers must migrate to insecure shack settlements in urban areas in the hope of gaining a toehold in a precarious labour market are unlikely to gain much traction. If policies that are perceived to reinforce territorial divisions do get approved and start taking effect, this could have destabilising consequences in already fragile states.</p>
<p>A second weakness is the <italic>WDR</italic>’s disregard for local and regional institutions because of its focus on market forces and national institutions. For example, the report ignores the power of vested interests to resist change and suppress growth. Local elites have many opportunities to obstruct investment and hinder economic progress in order to protect their own positions. Thus, economic development cannot be taken for granted once universal services are put in place. The very provision of these services may be jeopardised by local resistance or failure to agree on where and how they should be established. Not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) pressure groups seeking to conserve their environment can be intense opponents of any physical development. Other elites engage in opportunistic, ‘rent-seeking’ (and sometimes corrupt) behaviour that extracts value from others and enriches a narrow group without adding to productive activity or enterprise. Successful growth processes tend to engage local interests, rather than assume their irrelevance.</p>
<p>Inclusive local institutions can play a positive role in fostering development because of their superior local knowledge and their greater responsiveness to realities on the ground compared with national bodies. By acting in concert and taking a long-term view of potential, they may be able to exercise sufficient collective weight to reduce investment risks, instil confidence and stimulate productive activity in forms and places that may not occur spontaneously through the market. Different actors come together, engage in joint problem solving, negotiate deals that create positive outcomes, and thereby draw in higher levels of public and private resources, skills, effort and energy.</p>
<p>Local governments can provide leadership to align public investment streams to gain synergies, and technical capacity to plan and manage the development process more sensitively than remote institutions. In the cities this helps to mitigate the costs of agglomeration and to realise the potential. National governments are too distant and distracted by other matters to promote and sustain functional local economic systems. Local civil society organisations also perform vital roles in holding municipalities to account and facilitating public participation in the design and delivery of services. This builds trust and ownership of public facilities, and improves the quality of governance and policy. These are some of the elements of effective place-based policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212463787">Barca, 2009</xref>), of which the <italic>WDR</italic> has a very restricted view.</p>
<p>Third, the <italic>WDR</italic> advocates economic integration between regions and nations without any qualifications. It assumes that external trade and factor mobility are necessarily beneficial to both the areas of origin and destination. Physical distance and national borders are considered the critical variables affecting the strength of economic interactions. The report ignores historical evidence that if places have unequal assets and capabilities at the outset, the outcome of linking their economies may be wider rather than narrower spatial inequalities. Places that are relatively well endowed may well pull further ahead by sucking in talent, capital and other resources from poorer areas. Compensating income flows are likely to be outweighed by a widening division of labour and disparities in economic power between leading and lagging areas.</p>
<p>A case can be made that spatial disparities are cumulative and that divergence is at least as likely as catch-up and convergence. This is a basic insight from research on global value chains and production networks, reinforcing earlier work on regional divisions of labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212463787">Coe et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212463787">Gereffi et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212463787">Yeung, 2009</xref>). It confirms that trade and markets are not neutral and can obscure relationships of dominance, control and dependency. Wider national and international business networks and value chains condition the development paths of local economies, so their prospects depend on the role they perform. Those dominated by low value activities face structural constraints preventing upgrading to more valuable functions. Hence integration may prove to be harmful rather than beneficial.</p>
<p>Fourth, the <italic>WDR</italic> is underpinned by a causal model which holds that urbanisation in low income countries stimulates or accelerates industrialisation, which raises productivity, boosts growth, creates wealth and reduces poverty. Over time the benefits extend outwards from the growth centres to the steadily integrating periphery, thereby narrowing spatial inequalities. This analysis of economic dynamics is too simple and the process is far from automatic. It assumes wrongly that all countries necessarily follow the same economic development trajectory based on an outdated linear stage model. It does not allow for the character of development to vary in different contexts, or for cities to be stronger sources of growth in some situations than in others, despite other World Bank evidence that urbanisation without economic growth is a fairly common phenomenon around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212463787">Fay and Opal, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study examined the relationship between average income and level of urbanisation of some 80 countries at two points in time – 1960 and 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212463787">Bloom and Khanna, 2007</xref>). It found that there was an association between urbanisation and income, particularly at higher levels of urbanisation, but the relationship was not simple or linear. A key conclusion was that ‘the links between urbanisation and income are relatively weak at low levels of development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212463787">Bloom and Khanna, 2007</xref>: 11). Yet the main focus of the <italic>WDR</italic>’s recommendations is low-income economies, which are supposed to benefit disproportionately from urbanisation. There is sufficient ambiguous and contradictory evidence available to raise doubts about the <italic>WDR</italic>’s confident proposition that agglomeration and integration are equalising forces and bring benefits to all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094212463787" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is something significant about mainstream economists discovering the role of geography in economic development, through agglomeration and physical proximity (‘density’ and ‘distance’) as basic drivers of productivity and growth. This is a big change from just a decade or two ago when they tended to ignore the importance of territory and location. However, accepting a restrictive set of spatial factors means that the insights they yield are partial and there are major omissions, such as the influence of institutions and the constraints posed by unequal economic relationships. These undermine the <italic>WDR</italic>’s bold presumptions that economic concentration, specialisation and trade are the key determinants of growth and that they generate prosperity all round.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the influence of geography is also quite different from recognising an important role for spatial policy. It is somewhat ironic that the <italic>WDR</italic> emphasises the impact of space and location on economic performance, but concludes with a circumscribed role for government action. The report shows undue faith in the ability of market forces to reduce spatial inequalities and a notable lack of faith in the capabilities of the State to stimulate and sustain economic development in lagging areas. This should be seen as a major challenge for spatial economic researchers to articulate a more convincing case for ‘place-based’ policies, and for policy evaluators to generate the evidence to demonstrate their impact and effectiveness.</p>
