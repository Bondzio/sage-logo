<p>With a collection of 20 short papers, <italic>Discourse, of Course</italic> not only serves as a textbook, but also a reference book for researchers who want an update for the main topics in the field. This book starts with discourse as a mode in communication, and then moves via discourse types, structure and style into three main research areas: cognition, institutions and culture. It has 20 chapters categorized into eight parts: discourse in communication, discourse and other communication modes, discourse types, discourse structures, stylistics and rhetoric, discourse and cognition, discourse and institution, discourse and culture. All chapters are presented in a fixed format: introduction, the research challenge, examples, research methods, recent research, research proposal, and practical relevance.</p>
<p>The first two chapters deal with the relationship between discourse and communication. Part II, ‘Discourse and other communication modes’, explores communication in the verbal and visual modes.</p>
<p>Part III, ‘Discourse types’, is linked either to cognitive processes or to communicative functions. Wang presents a new approach to the study of text type variation in focusing on how language users detect different text types with great ease. The notion of <italic>interpretation constraint</italic> is proposed as an analytic tool for text type variation. Part IV, ‘Discourse structures’, shifts from more external aspects – communication, multimodality and typology – to focus on more internal aspects: the various ways in which utterances can be combined within a discourse. The two chapters in this part deal with the puzzling phenomenon of coherence.</p>
<p>Part V, ‘Stylistics and rhetorics’, elaborates many new developments anchored in the traditional framework of stylistics and rhetoric. Kaltenbacher opens a new direction by stating that style as a choice is more than just patterns of language use dependent on the situation. With the analysis of an Austrian and an American corpus of tourist websites, he explains that stylistic patterns and cultural identity to a certain extent belong together.</p>
<p>Part VI, ‘Discourse and cognition’, deals with what is going on in our brains during the perception of discourse. Sadoski starts with <italic>embodied cognition</italic>, which is based on the premise that all mental representations and processes are based in the body’s physical interactions with the world. Louwerse and Jeuniaux use a computational psycholinguistic algorithm to determine the degree of cohesion in discourse. With this technique, called Latent Semantic Analysis, the semantic relations between words, sentences and paragraphs can be determined. With this approach, it is possible to construct the macrostructure of a text, or to determine whether textbooks are appropriate for their readers. Part VII, ‘Discourse and institution’, analyzes the function of discourse in institutions from a sociological perspective. Wang applies the turn-taking model to institutional dialogue. Jacobs and Van Hout explore new ways in the study of media to analyze how press releases find their way into the newspaper.</p>
<p>Part VIII, ‘Discourse and culture’, focuses on what discourse can reveal about societal features such as power relations, the male–female relationship, and so on. Van Leeuwen explores the presentation of social actors, in studying how the English language allows ‘actors’ to be presented. Wodak introduces the discourse-historical approach, in which the focus is on how discourse mediates and has mediated this imbalance. This chapter presents the phenomenon of racism, with a focus on verbal–visual racism propaganda in election posters from an Austrian populist party.</p>
<p>This book certainly fulfills both the teacher’s need for an overview of the main topics in discourse studies, and the student’s need to acquire standards for developing research plans in theses and dissertations. It gives a combination of approaches from different schools in discourse studies, ranging from argumentation theory to genre theory, from the study of multimodal metaphors to cognitive approaches to coherence analysis. What is more, this book combines theory and practice to highlight pedagogy, which is rather rare in volumes of this kind. All the contributors conclude their chapters with some information about possible practical relevance. Furthermore, the format of the contributions makes the book very useful as a textbook for students. One or more assignments in each chapter are added and can be worked out with Internet information. The answers or elaborations are presented in the ‘Key to the Assignments’ at the end of this book for readers’ reference.</p>
