<p>Compiled according to what the editors call ‘a broadly epistopic approach’ (p. xxii), <italic>Ethnomethodology at Work</italic> contains contributions on the division of labor, competence to work within a specific organization, calculation, plans and planning, time, business talk, documents and reading, and technology. Chapters 1 and 12 discuss the ethnomethodological approach to work and organization more generally, along with other ways work and organization have been studied. Each chapter is well-written and rigorous, and the book certainly meets the editors’ stated goal of providing ‘an outline, some data and examples of an ethnomethodological approach to a number of commonplace organizational topics and issues’ (pp. xvii–xviii) for ‘a student coming to the study of work in organizations for the first time’ (p. xvii). Unfortunately, the book contains so much that writing a review that does justice to each contribution is not possible. Below, I will attempt to draw out a few themes that run through the different chapters, but I will inevitably ignore other important themes.</p>
<p>One theme, related to understanding the participants’, members’, or actors’ points of view, has to do with the use of theoretical concepts and their relationship with commonsense concepts. Terms such as ‘memory’, ‘skill’, and ‘power’, to list a few that are discussed in different chapters, are on the one hand commonsense concepts which participants use and understand. However, they are also used as theoretical concepts, in sociology, psychology, and other human sciences. This can result in confusion as the theoretical concept comes to be understood as an equivalent (though more precise, accurate, scientific) of the commonsense concept (Chapter 4, Hughes; Chapter 5, Randall and Rouncefield; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612467254">Bittner, 1974</xref>). In addition, when theoretical concepts are used to describe and explain the things that people do, they can obscure rather than illuminate. As Rouncefield, Slack, and Hartswood (Chapter 11) state regarding the concept of skill, ‘(t)o abstract the notion of “skill” in some way is to render the activities constitutive of that skill invisible – the term is a gloss that hides more than it reveals’ (p. 210). Theoretical concepts may also turn out to be relatively vacuous. Regarding work on distributed cognition, for example, Sharrock and Button (Chapter 12) state that ‘(l)ittle is added to the fact that the filing cabinet often serves to store what might be called “information” to describe it as serving a memory function’ (p. 227). Ethnomethodological research attempts to avoid such difficulty by not being committed a priori to theoretical concepts in the explication of the participants’ point of view. Power, for example, ‘can be viewed through and only through the orientation of members to political matters in a visible and accountable way in the specific contexts they inhabit’ (Hughes, Randall, Rouncefield, and Tolmie, Chapter 8, p. 131).</p>
<p>A second theme is context. As stated in the final chapter, ‘(e)thnomethodology does not possess nor require any proprietary concept of context, since it does not conceive its sociological task as that of making any <italic>a priori</italic> theoretical stipulation of what “context” is to be’ (Sharrock and Button, Chapter 12, p. 225). Nevertheless, context, as oriented to by participants, is important for the participants as they situate their actions within the relevant context, and is thus important for gaining an understanding of participants’ points of view. As put by Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (Chapter 6), for example, with regard to participants’ ‘reasoning about time’ (p. 107):
<disp-quote>
<p>calculating reasonable expectations of how long some task may take, putting down a sequence of tasks on a schedule, providing displays of current average call length in a call centre, and so on, are not things undertaken in and as of themselves. Rather they trade upon practical <italic>local understandings and material articulations of time</italic> to accomplish specific kinds of work in specific kinds of situations. (p. 107)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A third theme, the final that I will consider, is consideration of what ethnomethodology is. Of paramount importance, of course, is the participants’ point of view. So, for example, ‘(e)thnomethodologists treat “skill” endogenously. That is, seen from the point of view of the person doing the work’ (Chapter 1, Randall and Sharrock, p. 3). There is also consideration of what ethnomethodology is not or does not do, such as its ‘stubborn refusal to fetishize data collection techniques’ (Preface, Rouncefield, and Tolmie, p. xx). In particular, Sharrock and Button (Chapter 12) consider how to distinguish ethnomethodology from similar lines of enquiry, while other authors distinguish it from conversation analysis (CA). For example, Tolmie and Rouncefield (Chapter 3), in the conclusion to their discussion of ‘organizational acumen’, refer critically and somewhat indirectly to CA: ‘Often analytic accounts treat things like adjacency pairs, insertion sequences, sequential objects, or whatever as though they are of intrinsic interest in their own right’ (p. 55). More directly, Martin and O’Neill (Chapter 7) claim that ‘CA is more interested in how the <italic>talk gets done</italic> while ethnomethodological studies of talk are interested in how the <italic>work gets done</italic>; how the talk features in doing the work of the organisation, and how the organisation is realized in these quotidian activities’ (p. 110). As someone whose interest in ethnomethodology developed out of CA, I find this characterization of CA not quite accurate and the distinction between it and ethnomethodology not so sharp, particularly with regard to ethnomethodological research on talk, such as Martin and O’Neill’s chapter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612467254">Boden’s (1994)</xref> work on talk at meetings, for example, is accurately described, to me at least, as CA and as ethnomethodology. Finally, with regard to this third theme, perhaps the greatest strength of the book, and of each of the chapters within it, is in providing numerous demonstrations of what ethnomethodological research on work can look like, how such research can be conducted, and the value of actually conducting it.</p>
