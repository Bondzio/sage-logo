<p>This volume is comprised of a collection of studies that employ priming and other experimental paradigms to address issues in second language (L2) learning and teaching. With the goal of bridging the gap between pure theoretical psycholinguistic research and the practice of L2 research, the volume includes nine core chapters, each of which is an empirical study, in addition to an introductory (Chapter 1) and concluding (Chapter 11) chapter. Part I consists of studies using priming methods (Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and Part II includes studies using other innovative psycholinguistic methods (Chapters 7, 8, 9 and 10).</p>
<p>In the introduction, priming is defined as ‘the phenomenon in which prior exposure to specific language forms or meanings either facilitates or interferes with a speaker’s subsequent language comprehension or production’ (p. 3). To capture the implicit processing of language learning, three types of priming and their corresponding methodologies are discussed: semantic, syntactic, and auditory priming. To date, L2 studies using priming, although few in number, have investigated lexis, syntax, and phonology, as well as linguistic skills like syntactic processing in reading and listening comprehension. Following a brief introduction of Parts I and II, the goal of this volume is emphasized and the organization of the book is presented. Finally, suggestions on the use of this book and concluding remarks are provided.</p>
<p>In Part I, five studies address issues on L2 vocabulary teaching (Chapter 2, 3 and 4), L2 phonology (Chapter 5), and L2 syntax acquisition (Chapter 6). Chapter 2 by Jeanette Altarriba and Hugh Knickerbocker examined the efficacy of using first language (L1) translations and pictures (both black-and-white and color) to teach new L2 words. Inthe study, English monolingual speakers were taught new Spanish words in the aforementioned three ways, and their performance on a lexical decision task (LDT) was assessed. Priming effects were significant in all three conditions with L1 translations being the most effective (i.e. best performance on the LDT) and no significant difference between black-and-white versus color pictures. In Chapter 3, Joe Barcroft, Mitchell Sommers, and Gretchen Sunderman compared the effects of the Keyword Method – using a L1 word with similar lexical forms, mostly similar sounding, to access a target L2 word – and rote rehearsal on L2 lexical development. English learners of Spanish were assigned to the keyword or rote rehearsal group, and their performance in vocabulary retrieval, at both accuracy and latency levels, was measured using a semantic priming task. Although there was no overall difference in accuracy and latency retrieval between the two groups, keywords serving as prompts led to significantly slower responses in the keyword group relative to the rote rehearsal group. Next, in Chapter 4, John Williams and Amanda Cheung used semantic priming to investigate what aspects of meaning are activated by newly learned words. Across four experiments, Cantonese L2 Learners of English were taught new words in French via English translations (Studies 1 and 2) or French words paired with pictures (Studies 3 and 4). Their findings suggest that the meaning associated with a newly learned word is determined by the learning experiences. For instance, if a word is learned through translation, both L1 and L2 word forms are stored in memory. In the following chapter, Pavel Trofimovich and Paul John used auditory priming and word production tasks to examine the accuracy of L2 phonological information stored in mental lexicons with a sample of French learners of English in Quebec. They found that L2 learners could produce difficult L2 words accurately without having precise phonological information in their mental lexicons, thus indicating that learners employ strategies for accurate production of difficult L2 words. The efficacy of these strategies remains a future research direction. Finally, in the last chapter of Part I, Kim McDonough designed collaborative syntactic priming activities (CSPA) for peer interaction to see if CSPA can elicit greater use of English <italic>wh</italic>-questions among Thai learners. Indeed, she found that CSPA with lexical prompts does elicit more <italic>wh</italic>-questions with supplied auxiliary verbs compared to CSPA without lexical prompts. However, this conclusion should be considered with caution because learners’ actual performance in peer interaction is affected by many variables.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, Norman Segalowitz, Guy Lacroix, and Jenelle Job investigated the effect of attention on L2 word processing. They administered two semantic attentional blink (AB) tasks (using a rapid serial visual presentation to measure ‘blindness’ to the target word that is preceded by a distracter) to English speakers of French. Although AB significantly affected both L1 English and L2 French tasks, it had a significantly greater impact on the L1 task. In the next chapter, Michael Leeser, Anel Brandl, and Christine Weissglass studied the effect of two different reading tasks (comprehension questions versus grammaticality judgment tasks) on L2 sentence processing. After reading sentences containing two types of grammaticality violations (noun – adjective gender agreement and subject – verb inversion in <italic>wh</italic>-questions), L2 intermediate learners of Spanish completed the two reading tasks at their own pace. The findings revealed that the two reading tasks only affected learners’ sensitivity to violations of noun-adjective gender agreement and the grammaticality judgment task significantly heightened this sensitivity. In Chapter 9, Guiling (Gloria) Hu and Nan Jiang examined the role of context in semantic integration in listening comprehension. These researchers simultaneously presented a visual LDT and one of three auditory sentential contexts (congruent, neutral, or incongruent) to both native English speakers and Chinese learners of English. They found that the congruent condition significantly sped up L2 learners’ responses while there was no significant difference between the neutral and incongruent conditions. In the last chapter, Gretchen Sunderman investigated the differences in conceptual mediation between high and low L2 proficiency groups. This study adapted the false memory paradigm – falsely recalling unprimed words after exposure to a set of semantically highly related words – to English learners of Spanish and found that they recalled significantly more false memories in the L1 relative to the L2. Moreover, relative to low proficiency L2 learners, high proficiency L2 learners had significantly more L2 false memories.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter, the two editors summarize the implications of these studies and discuss the future directions of applying priming methods to L2 research. As stated in the introduction chapter, this volume compiled recent examples of L2 research wherein traditional priming and other psycholinguistic methods were applied to tackle practical issues. Consequently, there are many pedagogical implications that help narrow the gap between L2 research and teaching. The application of priming in L2 research can serve as a tool to evaluate experience-based teaching methods, such as the three vocabulary teaching methods examined in Chapter 2; to help in the design of classroom activities (e.g. Chapter 6); and to assess L2 learners’ word comprehension (i.e. the primed LDT used in Chapters 2 and 9). However, as discussed in Chapter 11, priming research in L2 research is lab-based and relies heavily on specific equipment and skills, thus limiting its application to the teaching sector. Moreover, most priming research is word-learning based and, as such, there are few studies that address issues at the syntactic or discourse level, leaving future research to extend the scope of priming research to more complicated structures and discourses. Finally, priming research reveals only short-term effects, so it may not offer any insight into retention.</p>
<p>Overall, this volume provides a comprehensive picture of current L2 priming research, and concrete research designs. Researchers and graduate students who specialize in second language learning and teaching will certainly find this book helpful. It is also highly readable for L2 instructors who would like to apply this research to their teaching.</p>
