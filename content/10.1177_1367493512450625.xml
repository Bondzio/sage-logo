         <abstract>
            <p>There has been no research that has investigated the psychosocial impact on children whose parents have undergone a lung transplant. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe children’s concerns and understandings of their parent’s transplant surgery. Artwork was used as a creative medium to enable children to portray their experiences in a safe, non-threatening environment. This was used as a visual primer for follow-up interviews. All children expressed similar and complementary views about uncertainty and anxiety, separation, disruption to family life, their desire for normality, and the importance of social support. Differences were evident in the way that some children managed well by adapting to the changing situations, whereas others tended towards avoidance. The findings provide several themes that may be used as a framework for family support and counselling by nurses, social workers, and other healthcare professionals who are caring for patients and their families during the transplant process.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Studies from patients’ perspectives have identified issues such as psychosocial adjustment and distress requiring supportive therapy whilst awaiting transplant surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512450625">Barbour et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512450625">Rodrigue et al., 2005</xref>). The effects of critical illness reverberate throughout the family unit, and most relatives experience stress symptoms around transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512450625">Ullrich et al., 2004</xref>). Spouses of lung transplant candidates are vulnerable to role strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512450625">Kurz and Cavanaugh, 2001</xref>), and caregivers using emotionally-based coping have poorer quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450625">Myaskovsky et al., 2004</xref>). Although there is some research into parents’ perceptions of their child’s transplant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493512450625">Stubblefield and Murray, 1998</xref>) there is none that focuses on children’s experiences of parents undergoing lung transplantation.</p>
         <p>Little is known about children’s experiences when critically ill adult family members are admitted to hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512450625">Kean, 2010</xref>); serious parental illness may threaten the attachment bond, causing separation fears and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512450625">Armsden and Lewis, 1993</xref>). Known effects on children of a parent’s critical care hospitalisation include short-term responses such as anxiety, sorrow, fear and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512450625">Craft et al., 1993</xref>). Children of terminally ill parents exhibit higher levels of psychological distress, elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, externalising behavioural problems, diminished self-esteem, and deficits in social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512450625">Siegel et al., 1992</xref>), and parental mental illness results in negative outcomes for children, who experience disruption in interpersonal relationships, role reversal, lack of support and insufficient factual information regarding disease processes and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512450625">Garley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512450625">Pölkki et al., 2004</xref>). The needs, fears, responses and coping strategies of children of parents with cancer go unrecognised, and threats to the child’s security are experienced through changes in routine, and the decreased physical and emotional availability of parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512450625">Lewandowski, 1996</xref>).</p>

            <title>Design</title>
            <p>The aim of this descriptive study was to understand children’s perspectives of their parent’s lung transplant. It was informed by phenomenography; a qualitative approach in which data collection is based on a specific phenomenon experienced by a specific group of people in a specific context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512450625">Barnard et al., 1999</xref>). Ontologically, in phenomenography, the phenomenon cannot be separated from the subject’s experience of it. In other words, the research participant’s experience of the phenomenon determines the nature of knowledge. Thus, the ontological assumptions of phenomenography are also epistemological. Therefore, the findings present qualitative descriptions that reflect the participants’ own understanding and experience of the phenomenon of interest. In this context, the main aim of phenomography is to characterise variations in experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512450625">Richardson, 1999</xref>); it is concerned with seeking ‘second order’ perspectives or ‘conceptions’ of phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512450625">Barnard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512450625">Marton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512450625">Sjöström and Dahlgren, 2002</xref>) rather than investigation of what a phenomenon ‘really is’. This was highly relevant to this study, which sought to understand the child’s world.</p>
            <p>The study was conducted in two phases. Initially, children produced artwork that depicted their experience of their parent’s transplant. Artistic expression as a medium for understanding experience has been used previously in phenomenography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512450625">Locsin et al., 2003</xref>), and with children to understand the meaning of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512450625">Tamm and Granqvist, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493512450625">Yang and Chen, 2002</xref>). In phase two, the artwork was used as a ‘visual starter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512450625">Lorentzen and Trell, 1999</xref>) for semi-structured interviews.</p>

            <title>Participants</title>
            <p>Ten children were recruited, aged 8–16 years, whose parents had received a lung transplant within the previous five years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512450625">Table 1</xref>). Younger children were excluded because the reliability of information they provide is questionable due to their developmental stage, and there is doubt about the reliability of their speech in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450625">Kyronlampi-Kylmanen and Maatta, 2011</xref>). Although assumptions about children’s incapacities as research participants – when focusing on informed consent – have been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512450625">Singh, 2007</xref>), in the context of legal interviews there are also concerns about young children’s suggestibility, with pre-schoolers being more vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512450625">Bruck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512450625">Ceci and Bruck, 1993</xref>). Also excluded were children whose parent had received a transplant during the previous three months, or whose parent had died. Information letters were provided for children according to their age group, as well as an adult version provided to parents. Verbal consent was obtained from children and written consent was obtained from their parents. At any time during the research, had children become emotionally distressed they would have been withdrawn, and counselling offered. Ethical approval was received from the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (HREC/09/QPCH/12).</p>

            <p>Initially, a recruitment/invitation letter explaining the purpose of the project, which was written in layman’s terms, was posted to all parents who had received a lung transplant in the last five years, and who had children in the sample age range. A participant information sheet was also attached, which explained how the project would be conducted and what their child’s participation would involve. A second information letter explaining the project, written in age-appropriate language for their child was also sent to the parents, who were invited to use this letter to discuss the proposed research with their child. Parents were invited to express interest in their child participating in the project in writing, using a standardised form with a pre-paid return envelope. On receipt of a positive response an informal telephone interview was conducted by one of the researchers (a senior social worker) to determine whether or not there were potentially emotional or distressing events occurring in the lives of potential participants; for example, a parent might have been experiencing a sudden decline in health. No such events were indentified. However, should this process have identified important emotional issues, then the child would not have been invited to participate at this point. The parents may have been contacted again at a later date, depending upon their circumstances.</p>
            <p>Following the above telephone interview, an appointment was made with the parents for the art workshops, where written consent was obtained. The child’s verbal consent was also sought. Even though the parents consented to their child’s participation, had their child not wished to participate, they would not have been included in the project. Furthermore, prior to the interview, the researcher again confirmed verbally with both the parents and the child that they still wished to participate in the research. If either party had declined to participate, the child would have been withdrawn from the project without prejudice.</p>

            <title>Data collection</title>
            <p>In phase one, groups of three to four children participated in hour-long art workshops in which they made drawings/collages that illustrated their thoughts about ‘transplant’, and provided a brief explanatory commentary (which was audio-recorded). The artwork itself was not analysed, but was photographed and made into posters that were presented to the children in phase two. These were used to introduce 30-minute interviews (recorded), which occurred a few weeks later, in the child’s own home. Focused questions were posed such as: ‘In your picture you drew [an object] – can you tell me what that means?’; ‘In your commentary you said … can you explain what you meant?’ Children were assisted to provide explanations using prompt questions such as: ‘Can you tell me more about …?’; ‘How do you explain that to friends?’ The interviews were conducted in a friendly atmosphere with an attitude of genuine interest in the child projected by the interviewers.</p>

         <sec id="section7-1367493512450625">
            <title>Data analysis</title>
            <p>Following transcription, interview data were subjected to a process of analysis drawn from phenomenography: familiarisation (several readings of the transcripts), compilation (identification of significant elements), and condensation (reducing to central themes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512450625">Barnard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512450625">Sjöström and Dahlgren, 2002</xref>). Thus, categories of description were formed and common meanings were compared, and then grouped by the researchers to derive conceptions. These are presented below in descriptive form, drawing heavily on the children’s own words to reflect their understandings as closely as possible.</p>

            <title>Uncertainty and anxiety</title>
            <p>All children related experiences of insecurity and uncertainty regarding what was happening to their parent, which contributed to their anxiety. They described experiences over a prolonged period; some beginning with stories of their parent’s poor health pre-diagnosis and how it impacted on family life. As Chloe (14) stated, ‘She couldn’t walk around the shops that much … couldn’t do much at all’. Jack (14) described how he was complicit with his father’s behaviour whilst awaiting lung transplant: ‘ … it was pretty funny … the doctors told Dad to give up smoking and he told Mum that he’d gave up smoking but he’d hide his smokes … and go and brush his teeth and spray deodorant and stuff like that to cover up’.</p>
            <p>The time of transplant revealed the children’s mixed emotions. They felt excited at the prospect of their parent receiving treatment, but were also frightened they might die. As Jack said:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>He can die on the table … I remember sitting in the back of the room, everyone crying and stuff, and I was like, I don’t know, I didn’t know what to feel ’cause it’s just knowing that my Dad had to have something bad, like not bad, but something like that happen … Yes, I was excited …</p>
               </disp-quote>However, the children also realised that for their parent to survive, someone else had died (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367493512450625">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

            </fig>
            <p>Zoe (14) was relieved when she visited her father in intensive care after his transplant, as she was expecting it to be ‘a bit more scary’. Her concern and uncertainty at this time are illustrated when she described how her father ‘kept shaking and he was really cold and Mum was a bit scared too’. She worried about his coughing; she wanted to help, but felt helpless: ‘…you couldn’t pat him on the back, it might make him worse. You kind of just have to stand there … felt like you should be helping him but you couldn’t’.</p>
            <p>Ten-year-old Harry described his mother post-transplant, illustrating how close to death he felt she was:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I actually wasn’t there with Mum when she had the transplant but my Dad showed me a photo and she looked half-ghost, half-Mum. She was sitting on the bed smiling at the camera and almost half of her body was white.</p>
               </disp-quote>His artwork depicted his mother as a ghost (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367493512450625">Figure 2</xref>). It also illustrated his mother’s new lungs, the box he imagined they came in, and the flowers his brother brought for her.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>Not knowing whether their parent would live or die was a constant cause of anxiety for the children. Referring to his father’s post-transplant recovery, Jack illustrated this concern: ‘… every day … I can’t leave [the house] without saying “I love you” to everyone ’cause if something bad went wrong I could never forgive myself’.</p>
            <p>Although most children described their happiness when their parent received a transplant, they also described uncertainty afterwards. Daniel (11) reported his mother was in hospital for ‘heaps of different things’ and Laura (10) said:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>What I remember most was that when she came out I was really happy but then I was still worried because it was over but she still had a lot of things to do to keep the lungs working properly.</p>
               </disp-quote>She recalled her mother’s readmission for an infection: ‘I found that kind of worrying because after her transplant I thought she would be all good again’.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section10-1367493512450625">
            <title>Disruption</title>
            <p>Awaiting lung transplant was a particularly disruptive phase in the children’s lives. Some recalled several ‘false alarms’ until the day their parent was admitted, when they had to leave immediately. Chloe described:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>She waited there for ages and then they said she couldn’t have it because it wasn’t right or something … We were just about to go for a swim and then [the hospital] called and then I went over to a friend’s house and then they told her she could have it [the transplant].</p>
               </disp-quote>She described another occasion when, ‘We were out for dinner and Mum got the phone call and we were really shocked. We came home and then I had to go to a friend’s house … ’. Grace (12) reflected:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I didn’t really believe it was happening ’cause when they woke us up they said we had to go to the hospital straight away because they got the transplant … It was really hard to believe … we had to leave everything … it was Easter morning; it was Saturday … we just got some pillows and just drove off!</p>
               </disp-quote>Waiting for their parent’s transplant was a difficult time, when most children thought about their parent’s death. As described by Damian (8), who envisioned his mother’s death:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I was thinking that we’re all at this party and we’re all crying and Mum was already in the coffin … I feel sad and alone and worse … That makes me feel frightened and scared. Sometimes when I get scared and frightened I get very quiet and silent. Sometimes when I’m in bed and thinking about Mum I lie still.</p>
               </disp-quote>And Harry stated, ‘The worst part is knowing I might not have a Mum anymore’.</p>
            <p>Children described their parents’ multiple hospital visits, and the disruption and distress of unplanned admissions. Several children stayed with relatives. For some this was a negative experience, which had a long-term impact. Laura explained: ‘I was upset when I had to stay with Nanna and Pop … it was really upsetting – now I can’t have sleepovers with friends because of the bad memories.’</p>
            <p>Frequent disruption to ‘normal’ family life was a common theme. For example, Harry described how ‘ … we usually had to have a shower right after we came home from school because of her new lungs’. Children also described how their role changed. As Jack said, ‘I had to become “man of the house” and look after everything’.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section11-1367493512450625">
            <title>Separation</title>
            <p>For most children, their parent going to hospital was a time of separation, which they did not look forward to. Hospital visits continued long after the transplant itself. Jaz (9) recalled, ‘Sometimes he says he’s only going for a day and then he’s gone for a week … I just try to get my mind on something else and forget he’s not there … I wish he could come home’. Brandon (11) described the limited contact he had with his father, who, due to the distance, flew to his clinic appointments. Brandon never knew how long his father would be away:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>We get really excited when we see him next … last week he came back the same day! … if he gets stuck there he’ll ring us every night or if he has to see the doctor at that time he’ll ring us earlier and say ‘Don’t try to contact me at this time ’cause I’ll be in the medical room.</p>
               </disp-quote>Jack offered some advice to children in similar situations. Referring back to his experiences with his father he proffered:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>… always go and see him … when I didn’t go and see him I’d always miss him and then I’d want to go and see him again … always go see him; and just love him in your heart like it doesn’t matter if you don’t go see him.</p>
               </disp-quote>Often children would stay with friends or relatives while their parents were away at the hospital. As Daniel said, ‘I remember spending a lot of time at my Grandma’s … it’s a home away from home’. Children were also separated from their friends at different times; Jack had left all his friends behind when his whole family moved from north to south Queensland for nine months to be close to the hospital.</p>

         <sec id="section12-1367493512450625">
            <title>Desire for normality</title>
            <p>Most children expressed desire for normality in their lives, often comparing their experiences before and after their parent’s transplant, as well as earlier, before they became unwell. Even after their transplants, some parents were still limited by their physical capacity. Jaz said:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I just wish he could be better and do stuff with us … he used to play cricket with us and he would come bike riding and stuff with us [before he became unwell], but he doesn’t come anymore … he says … it’s too hard to get the bike back up the hill … I would like to make it so he’s not sick anymore.</p>
               </disp-quote>Jack recalled how before his father’s transplant ‘ … we used to kick around the footy and stuff … then … in three years we couldn’t do anything together … he couldn’t go outside’. Laura described how, since her mother’s transplant she ‘goes to the gym twice a week and we are able to do a lot of gardening now and we have been on lots of holidays and we go to the beach and go fishing and <italic>she</italic> goes fishing’. And Zoe, talked about how her father had more freedom than before:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Sometimes he drops me off at the gym, sometimes he does the chores … we go to family things more often now … It’s weird not hearing him cough during the night but after a while you kind of forget that he did cough … even walking down the driveway was just weird, seeing him without his oxygen … he doesn’t look like he’s even had a transplant!</p>

         <sec id="section13-1367493512450625">
            <title>Importance of social support</title>
            <p>Especially important when their parents were away from home was social support from friends, family and school teachers. As Jack said:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>All my mates at school every day, they’d ask how he was and be there for me … I could always count on them … He [the deputy principal] would call me into the office whenever I needed help and he’d always help me and stuff and then he’d ring up Dad every night and find out how he was and heaps of teachers at school would always ask how he is and stuff like that, so it’s been good.</p>
               </disp-quote>He advised, ‘Pick your mates good!’ Some children did not benefit from good social support from their peer group; however this was sometimes due to their own reluctance to talk with others. As Zoe said, ‘I didn’t actually tell them, I just said “Dad’s really sick”, that’s all’.</p>
            <p>Family members and friends rallied around the family, especially when the parent was away, and several children described the supporting role of grandparents. Laura related how her ‘Nanna and Pop … were really sympathetic to me because I didn’t have my parents to stay’, and Chloe explained that her older brother, who lived away from home, came back to be with her; it was important that ‘He was there’. Damian described how ‘Other mothers at the school made food for us’ and Laura said, ‘When we got back [from hospital] all our friends from church had done our garden and cleaned up our house’.</p>

         <sec id="section14-1367493512450625">
            <title>Adjustment and avoidance</title>
            <p>Most children appeared to deal quite well with their parent’s transplant. This was evidenced by their willingness to discuss their experiences. Mostly, these children were able to identify their feelings, acknowledge their challenges, and recognise positive outcomes. Furthermore, they could suggest coping strategies for other children in similar situations. As Grace advised:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Don’t worry too much because he is going to have [the transplant] when the time is ready, and even though you have all the worry, try not to let it go through all your body, and have some positive thoughts.</p>
               </disp-quote>And Jack stated:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I reckon going through all that toughness made me stronger … [It was] pretty hard but in the end everything’s come out good … you might think you didn’t want this to happen but you’ve got to look at the future.</p>
               </disp-quote>By contrast, some children managed less well. Their interviews were characterised by vague memories of the transplant process, difficulty identifying feelings, and inability to offer advice for other children. Typically, they avoided talking about their experiences. When asked what helps, Daniel replied, ‘Just not talking about it’. He described how, when he had difficulty sleeping or was feeling sad, ‘I just lie down with the dog’. When asked what advice he could give another child he replied, ‘I don’t know. I never met someone [in the same situation] so I’ve never done it’.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Family balance is disrupted when a parental medical crisis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450625">McCue and Bonn, 2003</xref>). This study has yielded rich descriptive information that offers insight into the lives of children whose parent is critically ill. There is little research in this area and most has focused on intensive care visiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512450625">Knutsson and Bergbom, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512450625">Knutsson and Bergbom, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512450625">Nicholson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493512450625">Vint, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493512450625">Vint, 2005b</xref>) and only two studies have investigated children’s perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512450625">Kean, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512450625">Knutsson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>The findings illustrate an emotional journey for the child, which starts when their parent first becomes noticeably ill. For them, the difference is most apparent in the ‘normal’ things their parent is no longer able to do, such as playing games and family outings. The realisation that their parent might die was a major concern, which was often highlighted at the time of transplant. The children’s stories describe a ‘rollercoaster’ of emotions related to the unpredictability of events and the frequent necessity for them to adapt to changing situations. This continues after the transplant due to the need for their parent to return to hospital for follow-up appointments or due to deterioration. Previous qualitative research into children’s experience of parental critical illness confirms it as a time of uncertainty, exclusion and separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512450625">Knutsson et al., 2008</xref>), when it is important for the child to be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512450625">Kean, 2010</xref>).</p>
         <p>When a family is facing the serious or potentially fatal illness of an adult, experience shows that children are always affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450625">McCue and Bonn, 2003</xref>). For a child to experience a parent undergoing major surgery, with its attendant risks and the possibility of an unfavourable outcome, may be one of the most traumatic and stressful times of their life. Children respond in different ways. Some use mechanisms such as denial, whereas others employ effective coping strategies. In this study, whilst most children appeared to adapt fairly well to the changing situations, others seemed to manage less well, tending to avoid talking about their feelings and withdrawing. Older children can feel protective towards their unwell parent and put on a ‘brave face’, which may manifest in a reluctance to talk honestly to their parents about concerns and feelings. Our findings highlight the importance of friendships and family networks in supporting the child. Whilst individual social networks may be beyond the control of the health professional, this is an important area that should be discussed with the family when discussing children’s needs.</p>
         <p>Contemporary children’s healthcare practice is proposed to be holistic, and family-centred care is a global philosophical approach in which families are both recipients of care and active participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512450625">Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2010</xref>). Family-centred care provides a way of caring for children and their families to ensure that care is planned around the whole family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512450625">Shields et al., 2006</xref>). When a parent experiences a biological crisis the child may be experiencing a psychological crisis; children are vulnerable at such times and how they feel and behave will impact on family functioning. To support the whole family during challenging periods, it is important to provide information and counselling to children based on openness and honesty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450625">McCue and Bonn, 2003</xref>). For all children, this requires a tailored approach, which enables carers to focus on concerns and needs from their perspective.</p>
         <p>The conceptions found in this study offer several themes which may be used to seek information and provide guidance to family members, especially children. They provide a framework that could be used by health professionals as a basis for family support and counselling. This may lead to improved family functioning, which in turn will contribute to positive health outcomes for the patient.</p>
