<p>Karen Kilby is better known for her work on Karl Rahner. Here she offers, as is obvious from the sub-title, a rather critical introduction to the work of Balthasar, which makes clear that she admires much of his achievement, but is not convinced of the overall value of his contribution. She accepts that Balthasar deserves the scholarly attention he is increasingly receiving, but she is wary of regarding him as something of a Church Father. In fact, she makes the claim that if one follows his theology as a whole and takes him as one’s theological guide, he actually becomes dangerous. In her view, the one thing not to learn from him is how to be a theologian. She clearly is not a disciple.</p>
<p>Kilby concedes that Balthasar writes more accessibly than most other modern theologians. Nevertheless, she complains that it is easy to get lost in a fog of impenetrability, especially when trying to find one’s way in his longer works. Apart from the magnitude of his canon, one reason she gives for this is his frequently writing in an indirect manner. Perhaps this criticism is due to Kilby’s greater familiarity with Rahner, not that Rahner is more concise. But Balthasar’s style is more circular. He thinks that one ends up closer to the truth by proceeding in this way, as well as by employing metaphor and imagination rather than clear concepts alone.</p>
<p>The book has a useful chapter, while not exhaustive, on the various influences on Balthasar’s thinking. Przywara is only mentioned, but there are good sections on what Balthasar gained from De Lubac, Karl Barth, and Adrienne von Speyr. Kilby could have focussed more critically on the effect on Balthasar of von Speyr’s mystical experiences, some of which remain highly questionable, but she does not. Likewise, she does not rally support for her critique from less balanced nay-sayers who go so far as to reject aspects of Balthasar’s approach as heretical. But one does regret that she does not delve into his implicit indebtedness to Hegel, despite his conscious opposition to Hegel and his influence on, for example, Moltmann and Rahner. But, to be fair, the book is an introduction and everything cannot be included in an introduction.</p>
<p>Since it would be impossible to cover the full range of Balthasar’s corpus, Kilby selects two pairs of central images, the picture and the play, corresponding to his theological aesthetics and theological dramatics, and what she calls ‘fulfillment’ and ‘the circle,’ patterns of thought she finds scattered throughout his writings. The summary nature of these sections makes one wonder if they do not miss some of the nuances. For example, in relation to the beautiful form, we are told that, for Balthasar, the spectator does not meet beauty in general but is caught up in the beauty of the particular work. But Kilby then goes on to state that Balthasar sometimes uses the language of depth, of something beyond or beneath the form which somehow shines in and through the form. Rather than settling for her ‘what seems to be suggested,’ the reader might be better to read the first volume of <italic>Herrlichkeit</italic> itself. In relation to Balthasar’s dramatics, however, Kilby rightly asks how dramatic Balthasar’s dramatic theology really is. As for fulfilment and the circle, she thinks that these illuminate both his theological style and its ‘dangers.’ More attention might have been paid here to the basis for the various fulfilments in Balthasar’s work—for example, that Christianity is the fulfilment of paganism and Judaism—in his belief in the positivity of the finite on the one hand and his acceptance that grace perfects nature on the other. More importantly, Kilby’s remarks in this section of the book are a clear indication of her ambivalence towards Balthasar. She argues that it is not necessary to read his fulfilments in an unfriendly way and think that he sees his own thought as the fulfilment of the tradition in which he stands, but she goes on to claim that he not only has a high view of Christ as the fulfilment of all things, but also a high confidence in his own ability to see how Christ is that fulfilment. She is willing to grant that Balthasar does have a towering intellect, but she objects to his ability to stand above his material and survey it in its totality, what she later calls his ‘God’s eye’ view (p. 162)—hardly a friendly reading. Likewise, in relation to the image of the circle in which rays either lead to or radiate from the centre, she criticizes Balthasar for allegedly placing himself above the fragmentariness of these rays and presuming to be able to see them all from a higher viewpoint. In her treatment of his Trinity too, he is said to be too expansive, knowing his way around the inner workings of the Trinity too well. Kilby is not convinced by his arguing from the cross to an infinite distance inside God. But again her query is not so much with the legitimacy of his argument, but his making it with so much confidence. She disagrees with his ‘too integrated’ a way of relating Trinitarian theology and soteriology. But she is too Hegelian in her reading here. Balthasar does not reconcile worldly suffering and Trinitarian love by divinizing the tragic and introducing it into God’s immanent life. In fact, that is the very thing he rejects in Moltmann. And, finally, in relation to gender metaphysics, her difficulty is, once again, not so much with Balthasar’s particular ideas about gender and ‘the nuptial,’ but with her impression that he writes as someone who knows the deepest truth about gender without having to make a case for this.</p>
<p>In short, the main problem this introduction has with Balthasar is not just that he presumes a greater overview than others, but that, according to Kilby, he seems to transcend the transcendent and to speak from within the Trinity. But if it is true that Balthasar’s razor’s edge method does lead him at times to say too much, particularly about the inner life of God, and then correct himself, this is the risk he takes in order to say something rather than nothing. As for the comprehensiveness of his theology—it is true that there are fewer loose ends than in Rahner—it may be that this is not only because of his genius. But is it necessarily due to presumption? Could it not be because his starting point is the opposite of those Kilby calls modern theologians?</p>
