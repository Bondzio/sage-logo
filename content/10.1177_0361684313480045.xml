<abstract>
<p>According to stereotype threat theory, negative stereotypes impair performance and can lead to reduced motivation. In the present study, we examined whether the female-mathematics stereotype not only impairs women’s performance but also buffers their self-esteem from negative feedback and reduces their motivation to improve. Before completing a mathematics test, 80 (54 female) participants were informed either that men outperform women on the test (stereotype threat condition) or that men and women perform equally well (no-stereotype condition). Following the test, participants received positive or negative feedback prior to rating their self-esteem. Finally, participants were invited to attend free mathematics tutorials and asked to indicate their likelihood of attending. Women under stereotype threat performed worse and were less motivated than non-stereotyped women to attend mathematics tutorials after receiving negative feedback. Furthermore, although men’s self-esteem was higher if they received positive rather than negative feedback, feedback valence had no effect on women’s self-esteem. These results suggest that the effect of stereotype threat on women’s mathematical performance is potentially compounded by its capacity to reduce motivation to improve. Practical implications are discussed, with a particular focus on the need for interventions that produce an identity-safe environment, foster an incremental view of mathematical ability, and provide information about successful role models.</p>

<p>When Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0361684313480045">Summers (2005)</xref>, the then president of Harvard, controversially suggested that innate differences in mathematical and scientific abilities contribute to the underrepresentation of women in the fields of science and engineering, his comments drew reprobation from a number of scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684313480045">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). This censure was, in part, due to recognition that the female-mathematics stereotype, which Summers’ comments reflected and potentially helped to perpetuate, can impair the actual mathematical performance of women through a range of means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684313480045">Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684313480045">Eccles, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0361684313480045">Schmader, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480045">Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0361684313480045">Zhang, Schmader, &amp; Forbes, 1999</xref>). Although his comments regarding innate differences received much attention, Summers also made the somewhat less provocative assertion that the <italic>primary</italic> cause of gender differences is a differential motivation between men and women to dedicate long hours to high-powered jobs in science and engineering. In the present study, we explored whether the stereotype of women’s mathematical inferiority may contribute to the very differences in motivation that Summers cited as the most important cause of gender discrepancies in these fields. More specifically, we designed our study to examine whether the female-mathematics stereotype not only impairs performance on a mathematical task but also decreases women’s motivation to improve their mathematical ability, particularly following individual performance feedback that conforms with the negative stereotype.</p>

<title>Stereotype Threat</title>
<p>According to stereotype threat theory (STT; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>), negative stereotypes interfere with the performance of their targets by inducing a self-evaluative threat, leading to a level of performance that is not commensurate with their true ability (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). A wealth of evidence suggests that stereotype threat can impair the performance of women on mathematical tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684313480045">Brown &amp; Josephs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313480045">Davies, Spencer, Quinn, &amp; Gerhardstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684313480045">Gonzales, Blanton, &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684313480045">Johns, Inzlicht, &amp; Schmader, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313480045">Johns, Schmader, &amp; Martens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684313480045">Keller &amp; Dauenheimer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684313480045">O’Brien &amp; Crandall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0361684313480045">Schmader, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480045">Spencer et al., 1999</xref>), as well as on spatial reasoning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684313480045">Campbell &amp; Collaer, 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313480045">Dar-Nimrod and Heine (2006</xref>) found that women performed worse if they read an essay claiming that gender differences in mathematics are the result of genetic influences than if they read an essay claiming that such differences are due to experiential factors. Stereotype threat has also been shown to affect the performance of other negatively stereotyped groups, such as African Americans in intellectual domains (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>) and White Americans in athletic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0361684313480045">Stone, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0361684313480045">Stone, Lynch, Sjomeling, &amp; Darley, 1999</xref>), demonstrating that these effects are not due to any intrinsic characteristic of individuals, but rather to the experience of being the target of a negative stereotype.</p>
<p>Further, although the majority of STT research has been conducted in North America, there is some evidence for the cross-cultural generalizability of stereotype threat. For example, stereotype threat has been shown to impair the mathematical performance of girls and women in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684313480045">Keller, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0361684313480045">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684313480045">Keller &amp; Dauenheimer, 2003</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684313480045">Cadinu, Maass, Frigerio, Impagliazzo, &amp; Latinotti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684313480045">Cadinu, Maass, Lombardo, &amp; Frigerio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0361684313480045">Muzzatti &amp; Agnoli, 2007</xref>), France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684313480045">Croizet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0361684313480045">Regner et al., 2010</xref>), and the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0361684313480045">Rosenthal &amp; Crisp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0361684313480045">Rosenthal, Crisp, &amp; Suen, 2007</xref>). Stereotype threat has also led to decrements in the chess performance of Italian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684313480045">Maass, D’Ettole, &amp; Cadinu, 2008</xref>), the math performance and general cognitive performance of older people in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313480045">Abrams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684313480045">Abrams, Eller, &amp; Bryant, 2006</xref>), and the intellectual performance of French students of a low socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684313480045">Croizet &amp; Claire, 1998</xref>). Although further cross-cultural research on stereotype threat is required, there is evidence that the effects of stereotype threat are not unique to a particular country or cultural context.</p>
<p>Although some stereotype studies have been conducted in an Australian context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684313480045">Henry, von Hippel, &amp; Shapiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0361684313480045">von Hippel, Issa, Ma, &amp; Stokes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0361684313480045">von Hippel, Wiryakusuma, Bowden, &amp; Shochet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0361684313480045">Yeung &amp; von Hippel, 2008</xref>), the present study is the first known to be conducted specifically on the effects of the female-mathematics stereotype threat on Australian women. There are reasons to suggest that stereotype threat may influence the mathematical performance and motivation of Australian women. A recent cross-cultural study found that Australian girls (14–16 years of age) perform worse mathematically than Australian boys, hold more negative attitudes toward mathematics, and are more mathematically anxious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684313480045">Else-Quest, Hyde, &amp; Linn, 2010</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that Australian girls consider themselves less mathematically talented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0361684313480045">Watt, 2004</xref>) and have a poorer mathematical self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0361684313480045">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>) than do Australian boys. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0361684313480045">Watt (2006</xref>) further demonstrated that Australian girls have lower aspirations than boys to engage in mathematical careers. Moreover, the United States and Australia are relatively similar in terms of gender norms and stereotypes in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0361684313480045">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0361684313480045">Williams &amp; Best, 1990</xref>). The evidence for gender differences in mathematical beliefs, performance, and aspirations—together with the similarities in gender norms between the United States and Australia—suggest that there is the potential for stereotypes to affect Australian women’s mathematical performance and motivation. The present research represents an important step, however, in directly testing whether stereotype threat can impair the performance and reduce the motivation of Australian women.</p>
<p>An important tenet of STT, and one that distinguishes it from many other theories of social causes of gender differences in mathematics, is that the stereotype of female mathematical inferiority need not be internalized, nor even endorsed, for it to impair performance (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002</xref>). Instead, stereotype threat is said to arise from the pressure to <italic>dis</italic>confirm the relevant stereotype. Indeed, stereotype threat appears to have the greatest effect on the performance of those who are highly engaged with the relevant performance domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313480045">Aronson et al., 1999</xref>), and there is growing evidence that stereotype threat does induce a self-evaluative and motivational pressure. For example, stereotype threat manipulations have been shown to lead to increased effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684313480045">Jamieson &amp; Harkins, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313480045">2009</xref>), diminished executive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0361684313480045">Rydell, McConnell, &amp; Beilock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0361684313480045">Schmader, Forbes, Zhang, &amp; Mendes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0361684313480045">Schmader &amp; Johns, 2003</xref>), and an increased tendency to engage in strategies of emotional suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684313480045">Johns et al., 2008</xref>). Stereotype threat has also been shown to increase blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313480045">Blascovich, Spencer, Quinn, &amp; Steele, 2001</xref>), activation of the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480045">Murphy, Steele, &amp; Gross, 2007</xref>), and skin conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0361684313480045">Osborne, 2007</xref>)—as well as to reduce heart rate variability, which is often used as an index of mental load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684313480045">Croizet et al., 2004</xref>). These findings of the effects of stereotype threat on a diverse range of cognitive, affective, physiological, and motivational processes are consistent with the assertion that targets of stereotype threat endure an evaluative pressure when their group membership is made salient.</p>

<title>Disengagement and Disidentification</title>
<p>According to STT, exposure to this pressure can, over time, lead targets of negative stereotypes to lower their aspirations and protectively disengage their global self-esteem from outcomes in the domain in which the stereotype applies (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). This assertion follows the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480045">Crocker and Major, (1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major, Spencer, Schmader, Wolfe, &amp; Crocker, 1998</xref>) who claimed that stereotype targets often disengage their self-esteem from performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480045">Crocker and Major (1989</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major et al., 1998</xref>) further suggested that members of negatively stereotyped groups can disengage their self-esteem by either <italic>devaluing</italic> the relevant domain or <italic>discounting</italic> the feedback they receive by attributing it to bias or prejudice, rather than deficient ability. Both of these processes of disengagement from negative feedback provide the opportunity for individuals to maintain positive self-esteem despite being members of groups that experience negative outcomes in meaningful performance domains.</p>
<p>In support of the claim that stereotype targets psychologically disengage their self-esteem from performance in the relevant domain, it has been demonstrated that members of negatively stereotyped groups often have levels of global self-esteem that are as high, or even higher than, their positively stereotyped counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684313480045">Greenwald &amp; Farnham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0361684313480045">Twenge &amp; Crocker, 2002</xref>). More pertinently, it has been demonstrated that the self-esteem of members of negatively stereotyped groups is often less contingent on feedback in the stereotyped domain than is the self-esteem of non-stereotyped individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0361684313480045">Osborne, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0361684313480045">1997</xref>), particularly when the stereotype is primed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major et al., 1998</xref>). Although disengagement represents an acute strategy to deal with a given threat to self-esteem, Claude Steele and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313480045">Crocker, Major, &amp; Steele, 1998</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">Steele et al., 2002</xref>) have asserted that disengagement has the potential to lead to more chronic disidentification, so that the performance domain ceases to be a basis for self-evaluation. This process, although potentially protective of self-esteem, is likely to deprive stereotype targets of an important source of motivation, which might in turn lead to lower levels of long-term aspirations and achievement in the relevant domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480045">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; C. Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0361684313480045">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">Steele et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is a relative dearth of research into the effects of stereotype threat on engagement and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480045">Davies, Spencer, &amp; Steele, 2005</xref>), there is some evidence that stereotype threat can reduce stereotyped individuals’ interest, domain identification, and aspirations in relevant performance domains. For example, it has been demonstrated that women exposed to stereotype threat report less interest in college majors and careers in quantitative domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313480045">Davies et al., 2002</xref>), as well as reduced leadership aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480045">Davies et al., 2005</xref>). Stereotype threat has also been shown to decrease women’s entrepreneurial intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313480045">Gupta &amp; Bhawe, 2007</xref>) and women’s interest in attending a mathematics, science, and engineering conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480045">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). These findings are consistent with correlational evidence that female students in male-dominated academic domains are more likely to experience stereotype threat, and also to consider changing their academic major, than are women in female-dominated domains and male students in either male- or female-dominated academic domains (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0361684313480045">Steele, James, &amp; Barnett, 2002</xref>). It appears, then, that as Claude Steele and his colleagues asserted, stereotype threat has the potential to lead not only to poorer performance on a task, but also to lower levels of identification and motivation in the given performance domain.</p>
<p>The pressure for negatively stereotyped individuals to disengage their self-esteem from performance should be particularly strong following the receipt of negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313480045">Crocker et al., 1998</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>). Although targets of stereotype threat might be motivated to disconfirm the stereotype before or during performance on a test, once they receive personal feedback that they have performed poorly, their only recourse may be to employ strategies for protecting their self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480045">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>). Indeed, evidence for disengagement following negative mathematical feedback comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684313480045">Burkley and Blanton (2008</xref>) who found that providing women with the opportunity to endorse the female-mathematics stereotype buffered their global self-esteem from the impact of feedback that they performed poorly. Furthermore, following negative feedback, women were more likely to endorse the female-mathematics stereotype, suggesting that the endorsement of a negative stereotype might be employed strategically for the purposes of protecting individual self-esteem. According to Burkley and Blanton, the endorsement of a negative self-stereotype can buffer self-esteem by providing an excuse for poor performance because it implies that such failure is not merely the result of personal merits, but rather membership in a group that is not expected to perform well. Burkley and Blanton also suggested that endorsing a negative stereotype about one’s own group might lead to social comparisons with other members of the ostensibly inferior, and thus unthreatening, negatively stereotyped group. As Burkley and Blanton (p. 48) asserted, “the very stereotype that leads individuals to fail also at times may allow them to live more comfortably with these failures.”</p>
<p>This “comfort” provided by negative stereotypes, however, has the potential to translate into lower levels of identification and motivation (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>). Stoutemyer and C. Steele (1996; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313480045">Crocker et al., 1998</xref>) found that, after receiving negative feedback, women under stereotype threat reported lower levels of mathematical identification than did nonthreatened women. Although C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele (1997</xref>) asserted that such disidentification might deprive stereotype threat targets of a source of motivation, there is as yet no known direct evidence that stereotype threat reduces motivation following negative feedback.</p>
<p>The prediction that individuals exposed to both stereotype threat and negative individual feedback will be less motivated to improve their ability is also in line with transactional stress and coping interpretations of stereotype threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313480045">Cohen &amp; Garcia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684313480045">Major &amp; O’Brien, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684313480045">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). According to these accounts, targets of negative stereotypes experience threat “when the perceived demands of a self-relevant situation are appraised as exceeding one’s resources to meet those demands” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684313480045">Major &amp; O’Brien, 2005</xref>, p. 402). Conversely, a stereotype target who perceives himself or herself as capable of meeting the demands of a stressor is likely to appraise the stereotype as a challenge and to remain engaged and motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313480045">Cohen &amp; Garcia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684313480045">Major &amp; O’Brien, 2005</xref>). In the context of the female-math stereotype, women who are exposed to both stereotype threat and negative feedback about their own performance should be more likely than other women to appraise themselves as lacking the resources to challenge their stereotyped inferiority. According to transactional stress and coping accounts, these women are likely to perceive the female-math stereotype as a threat to avoid. Consequently, they may be less motivated to challenge the stereotype by taking measures to improve their performance. Such a finding would have profound implications for the outcomes of negatively stereotyped groups because it would suggest that stereotype threat has the capacity not only to impair performance but also to reduce motivation to improve in the relevant domain.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>We designed the present research to replicate the finding that exposure to the female-mathematics stereotype impairs women’s mathematical performance and also to examine the impact of this stereotype on women’s self-esteem and motivation to improve. Our study addresses the lack of stereotype threat research that focuses on motivational outcomes and also responds to a call from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684313480045">Major and O’Brien (2005</xref>) for research examining multiple effects of stereotypes on its targets within one study. To examine these multiple effects of the female-mathematics stereotype, male and female students were either informed that men are superior to women at mathematics or that there are no gender differences. They next completed a mathematics test, after which they were provided with either positive or negative feedback, and then asked to complete a measure of their self-esteem. Because we theorized that stereotype threat would affect the degree to which individuals disengaged their general self-concept from negative mathematical feedback, a global measure of self-esteem was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0361684313480045">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>), rather than a measure of mathematical self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684313480045">Boehnke, 2005</xref>). Finally, to measure motivation to improve, participants were asked to indicate the likelihood of attending free mathematics tutorials run by the University.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis related to the effect of stereotype threat on performance. Specifically, we hypothesized that women under stereotype threat would perform worse on a mathematical task than both non-threatened women and men, whereas the performance of men was not expected to be significantly affected by the stereotype manipulation. The second hypothesis related to women’s post-feedback self-esteem: We predicted that among women who received negative feedback, those in the stereotype condition would have higher levels of global self-esteem than those in the no-stereotype condition. The third and final hypothesis was in relation to women’s motivation to improve math ability. Women in the stereotype condition were hypothesized to report less interest than non-stereotyped women to attend mathematical tutorials after receiving negative feedback. Although men were included in the analyses of post-feedback self-esteem and motivation, there were no specific hypotheses relating to these variables for men. Their presence did, however, allow a test of whether the effect of stereotype threat on self-esteem and motivation was moderated by gender and feedback valence.</p>

<title>Participants and Design</title>
<p>Fifty-four women and 30 men participated in the experiment. Their mean age was 21.55 (standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 6.25, age range: 18–48 years). All participants were enrolled in an introductory psychology course at a large Australian university and received course credit for their participation. Sixty-three (63.0%) participants identified as White, 11 (13.1%) as Asian, 6 (7.1%) as Indian, and 4 (4.8%) as Middle Eastern. The study consisted of two stages. The first stage involved the completion of a mathematics test and employed a 2 (Gender) × 2 (Stereotype Condition: no stereotype, stereotype) factorial design. In the second stage, participants received either positive or negative test performance feedback before completing measures of their self-esteem and the perceived likelihood of attending mathematical tutorials. This stage employed a 2 (Gender) × 2 (Stereotype Condition) × 2 (Performance Feedback: positive, negative) design.</p>
<p>A number of participants (14) did not complete the mathematical tutorial measure, which was administered at the end of the experiment: Six were participating in a session when the building in which the experiment took place was evacuated for a fire drill, five did not complete the experiment in the allotted time, and three reported awareness of deception involving the false feedback. These latter three participants were also deleted from analyses of post-feedback self-esteem. There were no significant effects of gender, stereotype condition, or feedback valence condition on the number of participants who did not complete the measures of post-feedback self-esteem or intention to attend the math tutorial. The numbers of participants in each cell for each measure are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684313480045">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Although the number of male participants in each cell was small, particularly for the analyses involving intention to improve mathematical ability, it is important to note that the hypotheses pertained specifically to the effect of stereotype condition and feedback valence on women’s motivation to improve. Furthermore, to address the potential for small sample sizes to be influenced by individual cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684313480045">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>), regression diagnostics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684313480045">Belsley, Kuh, &amp; Welsch, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684313480045">Cook, 1977</xref>) were conducted on the analysis of motivation to improve. As we will describe in more detail in the Results section, these regression diagnostics demonstrated that the analyses were not unduly influenced by outliers. It is also important to note that each of the analyses of variance we conducted employed Type III sums of squares, which are commonly used in models with unequal cells, because they provide estimates that are not a function of cell frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684313480045">Foster, Barkus, &amp; Yavorsky, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Mathematics Test</title>
<p>The test consisted of 30 multiple-choice questions from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The items were a mixture of “solve” and “comparison” items (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313480045">Jamieson &amp; Harkins, 2009</xref>). Question type was initially included in analyses, but it was not involved in any significant main effects or interactions. The test was administered in a paper booklet, but participants were asked to indicate their responses on computer. For each question, there was one correct response from either four or five response options. Participants’ scores were computed by adding the number of correct responses and then deducting (1/<italic>n </italic>response options) points for each incorrect response. This meant that participants were deducted .2 of a point if they incorrectly answered a question with five response options and .25 of a point for incorrect responses to questions with four response options. This correction is consistent with the scoring used in the GRE general test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684313480045">Educational Testing Service, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Self-Esteem</title>
<p>A modified version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (RSEI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0361684313480045">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>) was employed to measure participants’ self-esteem. The RSEI is a global measure of self-worth and includes items such as “I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal basis with others.” Following the procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major, Spencer, Schmader, Wolfe, and Crocker (1998</xref>), the wording of these items was changed, such that participants were asked to indicate how they felt “at this moment.” Also, items that included the words “I usually feel” were changed to “Right now I feel.” This change of wording was made so that the scale measured participants’ state (rather than trait) self-esteem. Items that included negative statements, such as “Right now, I think I am no good at all,” were reverse-scored and a mean was computed, with higher scores indicating more positive self-esteem. The Cronbach’s α in the present study was .85.</p>

<title>Tutorial Intentions</title>
<p>This measure took the form of an advertisement and a 2-item questionnaire from the Macquarie University Numeracy Centre, which is an actual service on campus that provides free tutorials throughout the semester. The tutorial sessions are designed to provide assistance for mathematics and statistics courses at the University, including a core statistics course for psychology students. The advertisement described the Numeracy Centre and explained how it could assist students to improve their numeracy skills. Attached to the advertisement was a sheet of paper on which participants were asked to indicate the likelihood that they would attend Numeracy Centre drop-in sessions during the semester, as well as the likelihood that they would attend scheduled workshops run by the Numeracy Centre. Each of these items employed a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1 (<italic>not at all likely</italic>) to 7 (<italic>extremely likely</italic>). These 2 items, which were strongly correlated, <italic>r</italic>(68)<italic> =</italic> .86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, formed a scale of tutorial intentions. Participants were told that these questions were designed to provide the Numeracy Centre with information regarding the number of students who were likely to attend throughout the semester. Participants were asked to tear off this sheet of paper and hand it to the experimenter for the ostensible purpose of providing information to the Numeracy Centre about the level of interest in their workshops and tutorials.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-0361684313480045">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In each testing session, two to six participants were seated at separate computers and asked not to interact with one another. Stereotype and feedback conditions were randomly pre-entered into the computer, and participants were allocated to a computer on the basis of the order of their arrival at the testing session. They were then directed to follow the instructions on the computer. The instructions stated that they were to work on a mathematics test, after which they would receive performance feedback. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684313480045">Burkley and Blanton (2008</xref>), participants were informed that their score was determined on the basis of both accuracy and speed. This instruction was included so that participants would be less able to determine their level of performance and would subsequently be more likely to believe the feedback they received. Participants were told that the test was scaled according to norms from Australian Universities and that the mean scaled score for students was 100. They were then presented with either the stereotype or non-stereotype information.</p>
<p>Participants in the no-stereotype condition were informed: “Studies have provided evidence that males and females generally perform equally well on this test. That is, in studies so far, both male and female students have received an average score of 100.” In the stereotype threat condition, participants were told: “Studies have provided evidence that males generally perform better than females on this test. In studies so far, the mean score for male students has been approximately 115 and the mean score for female students has been approximately 85.” This manipulation of stereotype threat, in which participants were explicitly informed that the stereotyped group performs worse than a dominant group, follows the methodology of a number of other STT studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313480045">Aronson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684313480045">Cadinu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684313480045">Smith &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0361684313480045">Smith &amp; White, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0361684313480045">Yeung &amp; von Hippel, 2008</xref>). It should also be noted that in the stereotype condition, the scores of <italic>both</italic> men and women differed from their scores in the control condition. Specifically, participants were informed that men scored above the mean (115) and women scored below the mean (85). The decision to manipulate the ostensible mean scores of both genders, rather than keeping one of these scores constant between conditions, was a necessity given the nature of scaled scores and the fact that there are only two relevant groups. If, for example, scores on a test are scaled around a mean of 100 (as was stated to participants), and women are said to perform lower than this average, then the mean of men will, by definition, be higher than the overall mean of 100.</p>
<p>After participants had been exposed to the stereotype information, they were asked to begin the test. They were told that the test was a valid measure of mathematical ability and were given 15 minutes to complete as many items as they could. Once this time had elapsed, participants received false feedback. Those in the positive feedback condition were informed that they had obtained a scaled score of 114. Those in the negative feedback condition were told that they had obtained a scaled score of 86. This false feedback design, similar to that employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major et al. (1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684313480045">Burkley and Blanton (2008</xref>), allowed a test of the effect of feedback valence on men’s and women’s self-esteem in both the no-stereotype and stereotype conditions. It was also designed so that the negative performance feedback was roughly equivalent to the mean for women in the stereotype condition, although not being exactly the same so as to reduce recognition of deception. This manipulation provided a test of whether negative feedback had less effect on the self-esteem of women if it conformed to stereotyped gender differences.</p>
<p>After they had received their feedback, participants completed the RSEI and were told that the experiment had ended. They were then asked to complete a questionnaire as part of separate research conducted by the Numeracy Centre. Participants were handed the advertisement and asked to answer an attached set of questions about their intentions to attend tutorials (see Materials section). Following the experiment, participants were asked to describe what they thought was the purpose of the experiment. They were then informed of its true purpose and told that both the stereotype and the feedback information were false. However, participants were told that the Numeracy Centre was real, and they were encouraged to keep the advertisement and to attend the tutorials.</p>

<title>Tutorial Intentions</title>
<p>Finally, to examine the effect of stereotype and feedback conditions on men and women’s reported likelihood of attending Numeracy Centre tutorials, a 2 (Gender) × 2 (Stereotype Condition) × 2 (Feedback Condition) analysis of variance was conducted. This test revealed a main effect of gender, <italic>F</italic>(1, 62) = 4.90, <italic>p </italic>= .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .07 (medium effect size), with women reporting a greater likelihood of attending the Numeracy Centre (<italic>M</italic> = 3.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.67) than did men (<italic>M</italic> = 2.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.36). This main effect was qualified by the predicted three-way gender by stereotype condition by feedback interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 62) = 4.45, <italic>p </italic>= .04, with a medium effect size of η<sup>2</sup> = .07.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0361684313480045">1</xref></sup> This interaction is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0361684313480045">Figure 3</xref>. Planned comparisons were conducted to examine the hypothesized effect of stereotype condition on women’s motivation to attend Numeracy Centre courses following negative feedback. As hypothesized, among women who received negative feedback, those in the stereotype threat condition reported a significantly lower likelihood of attending Numeracy Centre courses (<italic>M</italic> = 2.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07) than did women in the no-stereotype condition (<italic>M = </italic>4.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.05), <italic>t</italic>(62) = 2.04, <italic>p </italic>= .05. For men in both feedback valence conditions, and women who had received positive feedback, stereotype condition had no effect on their rated likelihood of attending Numeracy Centre courses (all <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1.05,<italic> p</italic>s &gt; .31). Although not a planned comparison, and not significant to the Bonferroni-adjusted α of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0125, it is also worth noting that women in the stereotype threat condition rated themselves as marginally less likely to attend Numeracy Centre courses after receiving negative feedback (<italic>M </italic>= 2.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07, as above) than after receiving positive feedback (<italic>M</italic> = 4.28, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.71), <italic>t</italic>(62) = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> = .02. Conversely, feedback valence had no effect on the reported likelihood of attending Numeracy Centre courses among men, or among women in the no-stereotype condition (all <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1.00, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .37).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our study demonstrate that the same stereotype that impairs women’s mathematical performance can also reduce their motivation to improve following negative performance feedback. As hypothesized, women performed significantly worse on a mathematics test than men did and than women in the no-stereotype condition. Conversely, stereotype condition did not have a significant effect on the performance of men. Also consistent with hypotheses, we found that following the receipt of negative feedback, stereotyped women reported themselves as significantly less likely to attend mathematical tutorials than did non-stereotyped women. Stereotype condition had no effect on the performance or post-feedback motivation of men, suggesting that its unique effects on women’s performance and motivation were due to women being targets of a negative stereotype regarding their gender and mathematical ability. These findings add to a small but growing literature regarding the effects of stereotype threat on outcomes other than performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313480045">Blascovich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313480045">Davies et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480045">Davies et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313480045">Gupta &amp; Bhawe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684313480045">Harrison, Stevens, Monty, &amp; Coakley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480045">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0361684313480045">Purdie-Vaughns, Steele, Davies, Ditlmann, &amp; Crosby, 2008</xref>). Further, they suggest that the effect of stereotype threat on women’s mathematical performance can be compounded over time through its effects on motivation to improve.</p>
<p>Although we also found that women had generally higher levels of motivation to attend mathematical tutorials than men, it is important to note that these tutorials were designed to assist students who anticipated difficulties in their mathematical coursework. Given the endorsement by many people of the female-mathematics stereotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313480045">Blanton, Christie, &amp; Dye, 2002</xref>), as well as the finding that women are generally less interested in mathematical careers and academic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313480045">Ceci, Williams, &amp; Barnett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684313480045">Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006</xref>), this main effect likely reflects a greater belief among women that extra practice is necessary, rather than women having higher levels of generic mathematical motivation per se. Moreover, this main effect of gender does not negate the finding that stereotype threat reduced women’s motivation to improve following negative feedback.</p>
<sec id="section17-0361684313480045">
<title>Disengagement</title>
<p>We also hypothesized that the female-mathematics stereotype would buffer women’s global self-esteem from negative feedback. However, stereotype condition had no effect on women’s post-feedback self-esteem. At first glance, this perhaps appears to cast doubt on stereotype threat’s effects on engagement in the relevant performance domain. However, women’s self-esteem was unaffected by feedback valence in <italic>both</italic> the stereotype and the no-stereotype conditions, whereas men reported lower self-esteem if they received negative feedback than if they received positive feedback. This pattern suggests the possibility that women were more likely to have <italic>chronically</italic> disidentified from mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313480045">Crocker et al., 1998</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">Steele et al., 2002</xref>). Women in the present study, who would almost certainly have had exposure to the female-mathematics stereotype, may have been chronically disidentified from mathematics, protecting their self-esteem from negative feedback in both the no-stereotype and stereotype threat conditions. This speculation is consistent with evidence that targets of negative stereotypes protectively disengage their self-concept from relevant domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0361684313480045">Osborne, 1997</xref>) and, more specifically, with research that women have lower levels of engagement with and interest in mathematics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313480045">Ceci et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the null effect of feedback on women’s self-esteem is that the female-mathematics stereotype may have been salient for women in both the no-stereotype and stereotype threat conditions. Indeed, in both conditions, participants received information about gender in relation to mathematical ability. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major et al. (1998</xref>) found that whereas negative feedback led to lower self-esteem for African American students when their race was not primed, African American students appeared to disengage when an intellectual task was described as racially biased as well as when it was described as racially fair. The latter two manipulations are analogous to the present study’s stereotype threat and no-stereotype conditions, respectively. The no-stereotype condition potentially alleviated the effect of stereotype threat on performance by decreasing the likelihood that the stereotype was <italic>relevant</italic> to outcomes on the test (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480045">Spencer et al., 1999</xref>). However, the <italic>salience</italic> of the mathematics stereotype in both conditions potentially provided women with the means to protectively disengage their self-esteem after receiving negative performance feedback.</p>
<p>It seems likely that the unresponsiveness of women’s self-esteem to feedback in both conditions was due either to women’s chronic disidentification in response to stereotype threat or to the stereotype’s salience in both the stereotype and the no-stereotype conditions. Neither of these interpretations is at all inconsistent with the assertions of STT (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">Steele et al., 2002</xref>). Further research is required to test whether stereotype threat can, in the right circumstances, lead to differential self-esteem among women following feedback on a mathematical test. For example, it would be useful for future studies to examine whether stereotype threat leads women who have high baseline levels of mathematical identification to disengage their self-esteem from performance feedback.</p>

<sec id="section18-0361684313480045">
<title>Potential Mechanisms of Lowered Motivation</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, however, an important finding of the present study is that stereotyping lead to differences in women’s motivation following negative feedback. Given that these differences cannot be explained entirely by disengagement, it is worth considering what may have accounted for the effect of stereotype condition on women’s post-feedback motivation. One possibility is that women who were in the stereotype threat condition and received negative feedback reported low motivation to attend math tutorials because they wanted to avoid the domain of mathematics altogether (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">Steele et al., 2002</xref>). C. Steele and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">2002</xref>) made the important distinction between disengagement, which is a psychological process of disconnecting performance outcomes from self-esteem, and domain avoidance, which entails a literal avoidance of situations in which the relevant stereotype applies. In the present study, although women in both stereotype conditions apparently disengaged their self-esteem from negative feedback, this does not preclude the possibility that the mathematical test itself was an aversive experience for women in the stereotype condition (as perhaps suggested by their poorer performance). Just as C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele (1997</xref>, p .618) suggested that women can avoid the aversive experience of female-mathematics stereotype threat “by moving across the hall from math to English class,” so women were more likely to avoid mathematical tutorials following negative feedback, if they had earlier been exposed to stereotype threat.</p>
<p>Another potential explanation for stereotyped women’s low motivation following negative feedback is that they had lower expectancies and self-efficacy for improvement. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele and Aronson (1995</xref>) suggested that although stereotype threat interferes with performance primarily through self-evaluative pressure, it can also reduce performance expectancies over time. Consistent with this assertion, there is evidence that negative stereotypes can reduce performance expectancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684313480045">Cadinu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0361684313480045">Rosenthal et al., 2007</xref>) and even negate the effects of positive individual feedback on expectancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0361684313480045">Stangor, Carr, &amp; Kiang, 1998</xref>). Moreover, Aronson and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313480045">Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684313480045">Good, Aronson, &amp; Inzlicht, 2003</xref>) argued that stereotypes imply that a given ability is fixed, which can lead to a belief that performance cannot be significantly improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684313480045">Dweck, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480045">1999</xref>), and there is evidence that women exert less effort when exposed to an ability-based stereotype (men are innately better at mathematics) than when exposed to an effort-based stereotype (men expend more effort at mathematics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0361684313480045">Thoman, White, Yamawaki, &amp; Koishi, 2008</xref>). Given the research demonstrating the profound effect of self-efficacy on motivation and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684313480045">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313480045">Bandura &amp; Cervone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684313480045">Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999</xref>), it is possible that women who were informed of both their group’s and their own inferiority had a decreased belief in their capacity for improvement.</p>
<p>Finally, the stereotype threat manipulation might have changed the meaning of the feedback provided and its relevance to self-appraisals. People’s evaluations of others’ qualities and abilities are influenced by stereotype information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684313480045">Biernat, Manis, &amp; Nelson, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, the female-mathematics stereotype has been shown to influence women’s <italic>self</italic>-evaluations following feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313480045">Blanton et al., 2002</xref>). Women who received negative feedback in the present study might thus have evaluated themselves less negatively if they earlier received information suggesting that women generally perform worse than men. In turn, this might have reduced motivation by decreasing their perceived need for improvement. Indeed, although the negative performance feedback in the present study was designed to equate to the average performance of women in the stereotype threat condition, the score that women received in the negative feedback condition was in fact slightly higher than the stated mean for women. It is important to note, however, that the motivation of stereotyped women who received negative feedback was lower than that of women who received positive feedback, which suggests that their low levels of motivation cannot be explained entirely by a perception that their performance did not need improvement.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Because the present study primarily focused on disengagement and its potential effect on motivation, women’s post-feedback self-efficacy and self-evaluations were not assessed. This precludes firm conclusions regarding the causes of lower motivation among stereotyped women who received negative performance feedback. The absence of mediational evidence parallels the early stages of stereotype threat research in which evidence emerged for the effect of stereotype threat on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684313480045">Brown &amp; Josephs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480045">Spencer et al., 1999</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>) before there was a clear understanding of its mediators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0361684313480045">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0361684313480045">Wheeler &amp; Petty, 2001</xref>, for reviews). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480045">Davies et al. (2005</xref>) demonstrated that stereotype threat’s effects on leadership aspirations are mediated by activation of the relevant stereotype, further research is needed to elucidate the processes through which stereotype threat impairs motivation in general. However, although the present study included no mediational tests, it does provide evidence that the valence of feedback is a potential moderator of stereotype threat’s effects on motivation.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the present research is the lack of a neutral feedback condition or a condition in which no performance feedback was provided. The lack of a neutral condition means that it cannot be conclusively determined that negative feedback reduced stereotyped women’s motivation to improve. Rather, it could be the case that positive feedback <italic>increased</italic> women’s motivation following exposure to a negative stereotype, or that both positive feedback and negative feedback influenced motivation. More generally, there were only two levels of performance feedback provided, suggesting the need for caution in generalizing the current findings to women’s motivation following negative feedback of a different extent. It is unclear, for example, how stereotype threat might affect women’s motivation if they receive feedback that they have performed only slightly below the mean or below the mean for their stereotyped group. The present study’s results do, however, suggest that stereotype threat can reduce women’s motivation to improve following the receipt of feedback that is consistent with women’s stereotyped mathematical inferiority.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the present study is unable to provide conclusive evidence as to whether women’s self-esteem was buffered from negative feedback because they <italic>devalued </italic>the domain of math or because they <italic>discounted</italic> their feedback by attributing it to gender bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480045">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major et al., 1998</xref>). As discussed earlier, both of these processes provide stereotyped individuals the opportunity to disengage their self-esteem from negative outcomes and both potentially account for women’s disengagement in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480045">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480045">Major et al., 1998</xref>). However, women’s disengagement in <italic>both</italic> the no-stereotype and stereotype conditions provides evidence that discounting cannot entirely account for their disengagement. Indeed, women in the no-stereotype condition were informed that the genders performed equally well on the mathematics test. Thus, it is unlikely that women in this condition discounted their feedback on the basis of test bias. It seems more feasible that women in both conditions had disidentified from outcomes in mathematics by devaluing the domain, unperturbed by poor performance regardless of whether they perceived the test as biased or not.</p>
<p>The small number of male participants also precludes firm conclusions regarding the interactive effect of stereotype condition and feedback valence on men’s self-esteem and motivation to improve. Although the main hypotheses related to women’s self-esteem and motivation, further research is needed to determine whether the gender-mathematics stereotype also influences the post-feedback motivation of men. However, it is important to note that the number of male participants was sufficient to yield the hypothesized significant interaction among gender, stereotype condition, and feedback valence, demonstrating the there was sufficient power for these hypothesized analyses. Further, regression diagnostics demonstrated that this result was not influenced by individual cases and outliers. Thus, the significance of the three-way interaction suggests that the effect of stereotype condition on post-feedback motivation was moderated by gender and feedback valence in a statistically reliable way, rather than simply being reflective of an overall main effect of stereotype threat on mathematical motivation.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that there was a sufficient number of male participants to reveal that feedback valence did have a significant effect on the self-esteem of men, suggesting that they were less likely than women to disengage their self-esteem from mathematical outcomes. Furthermore, men performed slightly better in the stereotype condition. This finding, although not significant in the present study, is consistent with meta-analytic evidence that positively stereotyped individuals perform better when the relevant stereotype is made salient, a process known as <italic>stereotype lift</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0361684313480045">Walton &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>Notwithstanding the limitations described above, the present study provides important theoretical support for the two central foci of STT (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>). First, it adds to the considerable body of knowledge demonstrating the effect of stereotype threat on performance. Second, it replicates more recent findings that stereotype threat can reduce its targets’ motivation and aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480045">Davies et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313480045">Gupta &amp; Bhawe, 2007</xref>). This supports C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele’s (1997)</xref> assertion that although stereotype threat interferes with the performance of individuals who are the most motivated to disconfirm the relevant stereotype, it also has the potential over time to paradoxically undermine such motivation. In turn, though unmotivated individuals might be buffered from stereotype threat per se, they are also more likely to forego opportunities to improve in the relevant domain. Although C. Steele and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480045">2002</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480045">Steele, 1997</xref>) have suggested that reduced motivation is likely to be an outcome of chronic exposure to stereotype threat, the present study’s findings demonstrate that a situational manipulation of stereotype threat, together with negative feedback, has the capacity in the short term to dissuade women from taking steps that would be likely to improve their mathematical ability. Finally, the results of the present study are, to the authors’ awareness, the first of their kind to demonstrate the effects of the female-math stereotype in an Australian context. Our study thus helps to further demonstrate the generalizability of stereotype threat, not only across a range of stereotyped groups and to a number of performance domains but also across a variety of cultural contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0361684313480045">
<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>The present study’s findings also carry important practical implications for the effect of stereotype threat on women’s mathematical motivation. Although participants’ behaviors were not directly measured, stereotype threat had a significant effect on intentions to attend mathematical tutorials during the semester. Behavioral intentions are often highly predictive of actual behavior, particularly when there is a relatively short delay between the intention and the behavior in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684313480045">Ajzen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684313480045">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0361684313480045">Randall &amp; Wolff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0361684313480045">Sheeran &amp; Orbell, 1998</xref>). Thus, the findings of the present study suggest that stereotype threat potentially reduces women’s likelihood of engaging in behavior that leads to improvement in mathematics. It is also of considerable practical significance that stereotype threat appears to interfere with the motivation of women who receive <italic>negative</italic> feedback, because these are the very women who, in naturalistic settings, are likely to be most in need of improvement. Furthermore, there is ample evidence, including that provided by the present study, that stereotype threat increases the likelihood of poor performance (and therefore the receipt of negative feedback) among its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480045">Spencer et al., 1999</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480045">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). Therefore, negative performance stereotypes potentially lead to a cycle in which underperformance begets a reduced motivation to improve, which in turn leads to further underperformance.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the present research highlights the need for interventions in clinical, educational, and occupational settings that not only provide a buffer against the immediate effect of stereotype threat on performance but also help to sustain women’s interest and motivation in stereotype-relevant careers. Previous studies of stereotype threat’s effects on motivation highlight potential strategies for redressing these effects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313480045">Davies et al. (2002</xref>) found that women’s interest in mathematical careers was higher if they were exposed to gender-neutral commercials than if exposed to gender-stereotypic commercials. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480045">Murphy, Steele, and Gross (2007</xref>) found that when women observed videotapes of a discussion that ostensibly took place at a mathematics and science conference, those who observed discussions with equal numbers of each gender reported a greater likelihood of attending future versions of the conference than did those who observed discussions with a majority of males. These findings demonstrate that the effects of stereotype threat can be reduced in the context of “identity-safe” environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313480045">Davies et al., 2002</xref>), in which cues to the relevant stereotype, such as gender-biased language and an underrepresentation of women in positions of authority, are minimized. The results of the present study further suggest that identity-safe environments are particularly important for the motivation of stereotype targets who have received negative feedback in the relevant domain. Accordingly, interventions that specifically target individuals who have performed below expectation may redress the potential for a cycle of underperformance and low motivation.</p>
<p>Other interventions that have successfully mitigated the impact of stereotype threat on task performance are also likely to reduce its effect on motivation. Specifically, it has been shown that encouraging an “incremental” view of intelligence, in which intelligence is viewed as malleable rather than fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684313480045">Dweck, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480045">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684313480045">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>) can provide a buffer against the effects of stereotype on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313480045">Aronson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684313480045">Good et al., 2003</xref>). The encouragement of an incremental view of intelligence may have particularly profound implications for the effect of stereotype threat on motivation because such a view suggests that performance is not the result of innate characteristics, but rather can be improved with practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684313480045">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of female role models, which has been shown to be a protective factor against the effect of stereotype threat on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684313480045">Marx &amp; Goff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684313480045">Marx &amp; Roman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0361684313480045">McIntyre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0361684313480045">McIntyre, Paulson, &amp; Lord, 2003</xref>), may also help women to maintain motivation in the face of setbacks because it provides compelling and tangible evidence that their gender does not preclude performance at a high level. Importantly, however, not all female role models are equally effective at inspiring motivation and identification. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684313480045">Cheryan, Drury, and Vichayapai (2013</xref>) found that women who interacted with highly stereotypical computer science role models (i.e., those who were obsessed with technology and uninterested in sports) reported less interest in majoring in computer science than women who interacted with non-stereotypical computer science role models. This effect occurred regardless of the role model’s gender. As Cheryan et al. suggested, the success of role models may depend on their ability to convey a sense of belonging in their field. In the context of the present study, women who are successful in mathematics, without strongly conforming to stereotypes of math students, are likely to be particularly effective in promoting other women’s mathematical identification and motivation. In sum, interventions that help to produce an identity-safe environment, foster an incremental view of mathematical ability, and provide access to or information about successful female role models who do not promote current stereotypes of math students seem particularly likely to succeed in reducing the impact of stereotype threat on both performance and motivation, and thus in improving women’s outcomes in mathematics.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0361684313480045">Summers’ (2005)</xref> suggestion that gender differences in mathematics and science reflect innate differences, although controversial, reflected a broader societal stereotype. Although Summers also highlighted the potential contribution of gender differences in motivation, he largely overlooked the capacity for the stereotype itself to contribute to the very performance differences it predicts. The present study demonstrated that there are a number of paths through which the female-mathematics stereotype can contribute to women’s underrepresentation in mathematics. Not only does the stereotype have the potential to impair performance, it can also contribute to lower motivation in women, potentially discouraging them from taking opportunities to improve their performance. Our findings highlight the importance of a serious consideration of social psychological factors, and particularly stereotype threat, when attempting to understand women’s underrepresentation in mathematics. With an increased understanding of the range of stereotype threat’s consequences comes the potential to further redress gender imbalances in mathematics and science.</p>

<p>The small sample size, particularly for men, meant that the 2 (Gender) × 2 (Stereotype condition) × 2 (Feedback valence) analysis of variance on motivation to improve was potentially prone to influence by individual cases, which violate statistical assumptions and can lead to nonconservative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684313480045">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). To address this issue, the authors reanalyzed this three-way interaction with a regression, which provided the opportunity to conduct regression diagnostics. Specifically, the authors obtained measures of Cook’s distance (Cook’s <italic>D</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684313480045">Cook, 1977</xref>) and standardized difference in fit (<italic>DFFITS<sub>i</sub>
</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684313480045">Belsley et al., 1980</xref>). These diagnostics provide a systematic test of whether individual cases have a large influence on estimated regression parameters. For Cook’s <italic>D,</italic> a conventional cutoff of 1.0 is commonly employed in the literature, with anything above this figure considered a potential cause for concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684313480045">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). The analysis revealed that no cases had a Cook’s <italic>D</italic> of greater than .08. Similarly, no cases exceeded the conventional cutoff of |<italic>DFFITS<sub>i</sub>
</italic>|&gt; 1 (all <italic>DFFITS</italic>
<sub>i</sub> figures were between −.8 and .8). These analyses provide evidence that influential cases do not jeopardize the validity of these findings and therefore increase confidence in the reliability of the results.</p>
