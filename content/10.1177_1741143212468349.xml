Yet its meaning remains complex, contested and frequently school-centric. This article examines understandings and applications in developing inter-service and inter-professional practices for children and young people. Drawing upon desk research from the fields of education, health, social care, and social work, base-line literary analysis is used to interrogate leadership. In addressing the implications for ELM theory and practice when engagement beyond single organizations and services becomes the ‘norm’, the article looks towards more futures-orientated leadership theory and research that both define and develop the capabilities needed to lead learning in inter-professional, inter-agency environments, including schools.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>collaborative leadership</kwd><kwd>inter-professional practice</kwd><kwd>leadership capabilities</kwd><kwd>school-centrism</kwd><kwd>teams</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1741143212468349"><title>Introduction</title><p>The increasing clamour for ‘collaboration’ as <italic>the</italic> key framework for leadership in the 21st century, not least in school contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468349">Hallinger and Heck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143212468349">Marks and Printy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143212468349">Mulford and Silins, 2003</xref>), seems unabated. Yet, attempts to establish its precise meaning remain complex and contested. As Morrison and Glenny (forthcoming) point out:</p><disp-quote><p>[Its] … appeal is enticing [and] extends from the macro-levels of the ‘collaborative state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1741143212468349">Parker and Gallagher, 2007</xref>) to the structures, processes, practices, and ultimately professional development and training of its citizens, especially those charged with enacting new modes of service provision across the public/private divide.</p></disp-quote><p>As our opening references suggest, much of the focus upon collaborative leadership in education has been framed within school research, and often in the context of school networks or clusters which are assumed to be ‘collaborative groups’ that ‘empower localities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1741143212468349">Paterson and Ireson, 2011</xref>). While use of the term ‘collaborative leadership’ extends back to earlier international school leadership discourses, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212468349">Lugg and Boyd (1993</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1741143212468349">Smylie (1992</xref>), and to discussions of leadership in the ‘(post)modern era’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212468349">Goddard, 2003</xref>: 17), as ‘effective’ leadership(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1741143212468349">Riley and MacBeath, 2003</xref>), and in relation to ‘new models’ for more facilitative, democratic leaders in educational partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212468349">Briggs, 2009</xref>), the term has remained largely overshadowed by or absorbed within other leadership model discourses. Our core interest lies not in collaboration as a concept that is exclusive to schools, but rather its usefulness as a framework for meeting UK policy objectives to integrate services for children and young people. However, this does not exclude interest in school leadership, and for at least two reasons. First, schools and school principals respectively are viewed <italic>explicitly</italic> by policymakers as among a range of core service sites and leaders to activate and sustain integrated service provision. In England, for example, this stance is embraced by the National College of Leadership for Schools and Children’s Service (NCLSCS), where school leaders are identified as key agents in effecting an inter-agency/multi-agency perspective, albeit within a predominantly school effectiveness/school improvement priority. This means that, second, schools and school leaders are simultaneously both the intended targets of UK policy interventions claimed to be ‘collaborative’, and are also named (indeed, increasingly, name themselves) as among a range of instigators, agitators even, for increased inter-agency activity in the interests of children and young people. This is sometimes referred to in terms of leadership for community and/or extended schooling that is coupled with multi-agency engagement, and, above all, a sense of ‘child-centredness’ and operational arrangements that involve various kinds of team working. For some schools, such engagement extends to the physical presence of and activities by multi-agency workers on the school site, and/or include either strongly or weakly framed joint activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212468349">Coleman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite such trends, the generic terms ‘collaboration’ and ‘collaborative leadership’ remain ill-defined conceptually (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212468349">Close, 2011</xref>), and empirical investigations are relatively sparse. Superficial conceptual ‘seepage’ is multi-directional, with assumptions that what collaborative leadership means for schools, for example, might, with relative ease, be transferrable to the leadership of other services for children and young people, to leadership of a range of intra- and/or inter-agency services, and vice versa. At best, advocacy seems to be towards ‘<italic>some kind of</italic> hybrid [leadership] model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1741143212468349">Purcell, 2009</xref>: 2, emphasis added), that absorbs or lists existing literatures.</p><sec id="section2-1741143212468349"><title>Purpose</title><p>The purpose of this article, then, is twofold. A first task is to unpack what might be ‘lost in translation’ when ‘collaboration’, ‘collaborative leadership’ and a panoply of loosely associated terms are converted into various practices, including leadership capacity building and the identification of those in whom leadership might reside. A second task is to consider the robustness of leadership models in use, not least those which are school-centric. Discussion draws from extant literatures in education, health, social care, and social work, in order to develop a base-line analysis to interrogate leadership and management for collaborative inter-service practice.</p><p>Desk research draws from one element of an inter-departmental project among colleagues at the Westminster Institute of Education (now School of Education) and the Department of Health and Social Care (see acknowledgements) at Oxford Brookes University, UK. In 2009–2010, this included joint seminar engagement and a literature review (of publications from 1980) mainly across the fields of Education, Health and Social Care. Given that effective leadership appeared to be increasingly cited as a key determinant of whether boundary-crossing work between services would succeed or fail, this provided one of several main focal points of interest.</p><p>This article outlines the background to inter-agency activities; identifies the context of inter-agency work in Education, including schools; analyses leadership approaches, roles and models considered appropriate to collaborative activities across services; and discusses the professional development of inter-agency leaders.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1741143212468349"><title>Background</title><p>Despite growing interest in the leadership of <italic>intra</italic>-service provision, namely collaborations, for example, between schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212468349">Chapman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212468349">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468349">Hallinger and Heck, 2010</xref>), or between various constituents of, for example, Health and Social Care provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212468349">Barr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468349">Cameron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212468349">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143212468349">Meads and Ashcroft, 2005</xref>), explorations of leadership of or for <italic>inter-</italic>service practice remain relatively sparse (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212468349">Close and Wainwright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212468349">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212468349">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212468349">Glenny and Roaf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212468349">Hammick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143212468349">Morrison and Glenny, 2011</xref>). Moreover, with exceptions (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212468349">Lumby and Morrison, 2006</xref>), preferences in the education leadership and management field have been to research leadership in terms of relationships between individuals or groups <italic>within</italic> single organizations, usually schools. As our opening comments suggest, ‘collaborative leadership’ has become an ‘operational construct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468349">Hallinger and Heck, 2010</xref>: 657) to consider within-school collaborations, their links (or not) to school improvement, and whether they improve organizational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143212468349">Mulford and Silins, 2003</xref>) or students’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468349">Hallinger and Heck, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the earlier literature such constructs have also been considered in relation to ‘collegial’ (rather than collaborative) models of school leadership in which ‘the collegial leader is not so much a star standing alone as the developer of consensus among … professionals who must share the burden of … decisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212468349">Baldridge et al., 1978</xref>: 45, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212468349">Bush, 1995</xref>: 64). In collegial models, the emphasis has been upon leadership as facilitating team work and participation among staff (and, latterly, students), and is underpinned by the ‘authority of expertise rather than official authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212468349">Bush, 1995</xref>: 65). Along with previous exhortations to demonstrate collegiality have come concerns about the limitations of collegial approaches, notably with reference to their impractical or cumbersome processes, and the validity of assumptions about the possibility, or, indeed, desirability of consensus among all staff.</p><p>Interestingly, such concerns (see later section) resonate with more recent discussion about the personal, social, economic, and education transaction costs of inter-agency collaboration, not least in terms of leaders needing to manage different professional fields, ideologies, organizational priorities and outcome measures. Equally, a more fundamental criticism of collegiality relates to its potentially ‘contrived’ nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212468349">Hargreaves, 1994</xref>: 195-196), when collegial models are ‘administratively regulated’, ‘instigated compulsorily’ rather than with discretion, geared to the implementation of government or school principal mandates, and/or ‘designed for predictable outcomes’. Again, such early concerns signal the potential for accelerating challenges that might be faced by leaders tasked with leading and prioritizing among collaborations of increased scale and scope.</p><p>Given these ‘early warning’ literatures, paucity in attention to inter-service leadership is surprizing, particularly in view of an espoused policy preference for ‘Teams-Around-the-Child (TAC)’ models of inter-service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212468349">CWDC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212468349">DFES, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212468349">Evangelou et al., 2009</xref>), and cultural shifts towards ‘collaborative community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51a-1741143212468349">Hartley, 2010a</xref>: 347) as <italic>the</italic> new multi-organizational form in which the knowledge economy might be developed, not least to get ‘social management and policy work done’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212468349">Ball, 2008</xref>: 762). Even TAC models are open to multiple interpretation, referring commonly, at the micro-level, to case conferences for children and young people that might occur regularly, if infrequently, for children with statemented needs, for example, but also, in another sense, to generic frameworks that imply larger-scale, team-orientated engagement between all services for children and young people. Indeed, as this article will suggest, such approaches have provided multiple drivers towards current leadership capacity building programmes.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1741143212468349"><title>Every Child Matters</title><p>The Every Child Matters (ECM) agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212468349">DFES, 2004</xref>) and its aftermath has sharpened the focus upon inter-agency work, ECM requiring a co-ordinated response to children’s needs that brings together school-based educators, social workers, general practitioners, educational psychologists, health workers, parents/carers, children and others. (Most recently, volunteers and volunteering activities are also given prominence.) It is based on the premise that multi-disciplinary teamwork is essential for delivering integrated children’s services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212468349">DFES, 2006a</xref>). While the concept of ‘joined-up’ services to meet children’s various social and educational needs might appear eminently sensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212468349">Glenny and Roaf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468349">Cameron et al., 2009</xref>), conceptual as well as practical challenges in leading multi-agency work are various, and often obscured. Indeed, some commentators have argued that collaborative inter-agency activity should be avoided altogether unless absolutely necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212468349">Huxham and Vangen, 2005</xref>) often because the social, educational, economic and/or reputational costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212468349">Lawson, 2004</xref>) of engagement are much higher for some agents than for others, and are, indeed, high for all parties involved. Other commentators have continued to emphasize traditional structures of leadership, whether in schools (Cameron et al., 2009) or Children’s Centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1741143212468349">Stacey, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section5-1741143212468349"><title>Policy Rhetoric</title><p>The rhetoric of the ‘greater good’ for children resonates through all recent policy initiatives, ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212468349">DFES, 2004</xref>) being preceded and superseded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212468349">DCSF, 2010</xref>) by numerous exhortations towards networking, partnership, collaboration, and extended systems for schools and other services: for example, <italic>Extended Schools</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212468349">DFES, 2005b</xref>), <italic>Excellence in Cities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212468349">DFEE, 1998</xref>), <italic>Sure Start </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212468349">DFE, 2010</xref>), Multi-agency Working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212468349">2005a</xref>) and <italic>Youth Matters </italic>(DFES, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212468349">2006b</xref>). ECM provided a national framework for 150 local programmes of change, which were intended to be led by local authorities and their partners, and which included more detailed outcomes for Inspectorates ‘to inform local needs analysis and the monitoring of progress towards priority targets and indicators’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212468349">DFES, 2004</xref>: 1).

Reasons cited are both pragmatic and ideological: historical records of integrated services for children working badly or patchily (a fear echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80a-1741143212468349">OECD, 2004</xref>), and a reluctance among schools to accommodate disciplinary or service frameworks different from their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1741143212468349">Smith, 2005</xref>).</p><p>That noted, the National College, with its growing commitment to ‘networked’ and/or ‘system’ leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143212468349">NCLSCS 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143212468349">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741143212468349">2010c</xref>) and school clusters has signalled its determination to move towards leadership development for integrated practices. This is set against a backdrop of policy initiatives that are increasingly located in the ephemera of surface, measurable outcomes. Intended to counteract poor intra- as well as inter-service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143212468349">Hoyle, 2008</xref>), such measures, it is argued, tend to sidestep deep structural inequalities.

As in education, and, in particular, schools, advocacy draws upon various versions of distributed leadership, although rationales are sometimes implicit rather than explicit. This is unsurprising given that both distributed leadership and new forms of inter-professional and inter-service collaborative practice share close affinities with the ‘new work order’ of late modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212468349">Hartley, 2010b</xref>: 282).

As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212468349">Hartley (2010b</xref>: 282) suggests, distributed leadership appeals to ‘a culture of weakened codes of certainty’ in which ‘identities – be they of occupational role or social identity – no longer have the durability or clarity they once enjoyed’. Indeed, tensions about changing professional identities, not least at the boundaries of inter-professional working are identified in numerous publications, in Education as well as interprofessional Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212468349">Adams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212468349">Calder and Grieve, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212468349">Carpenter et al., 2003</xref>) and in relation to changing trajectories for professionalism and career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741143212468349">McLaughlin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1741143212468349">Riehl and Troman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1741143212468349">Robinson et al.

These involve more than exhortations towards ‘joined up’ government but also to new directions in the ‘co-configuration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212468349">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>) of services for children and young people. The turn towards integrated provision and distributed leadership, is inter-linked to terms like team, system, and servant leadership (see below). In this sense, ‘new’ leadership draws upon established theoretical labels or no labels at all, given the tendency among leadership developers (see later section) to eschew the theoretical in favour of what they assume practitioners will value more, that is, direct appeals to self-reflection and/or exemplars from fellow trainees. This fails to recognize that the development of ‘new’ theory has potential to provide/inform the understandings and practices both of individual leaders as well as communities of research-informed practitioners.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212468349">Gronn (2010</xref>: 417) usefully identifies two main understandings of distributed leadership.

He writes:</p><disp-quote><p>If the way leadership works is described as distributed, then this may be because there is more than one leader … That it is to say the totality of organizational influence is not concentrated in or monopolised by just one person, but instead is dispersed or shared around, so that there are a number of sources of influence, initiative-taking or forward-thinking.

(2008</xref>) suggest that ‘multi-agency leadership’ requires a combination of ‘contributive’ and ‘distributive’ (rather than distributed) leadership.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1741143212468349"><title>Leaderless, Elective, Team and Servant Leadership</title><p>In 2006, the then Minister of State for Education, Beverley Hughes, outlined the leadership and management qualities needed for the successful delivery of the ECM agenda stating that:</p><disp-quote><p>We need leaders and managers <italic>who can build teams</italic> competent and confident in this new means of service delivery; who will put the child and family first; who can <italic>lead those from outside their own areas of expertise</italic>; who can manage resources in new ways; and who can reconcile team members’ different working practices and expectations.

Few approaches are given more attention than the importance of working in teams. Such an emphasis, however, is neither understood nor applied uniformly. What is described as team-working can be of large corporate dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1741143212468349">West, 2004</xref>), be made up of many tiny interactions, even on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1741143212468349">Rihani and Geyer, 2001</xref>), and/or comprise team formations of limited tenure, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212468349">Hammick et al. (2009</xref>: 54) describe as ‘teams of the moment’. Many services purporting to serve children’s needs contain elements of all these. A variant of distributed leadership, called team leadership, describes the trend, often in the absence of common understandings about purposes and scale. More recently, in an evaluation of a multi-professional development programme organized by the National College, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212468349">Simkins and Garrick (2010</xref>), for example, note how few ‘team’ members actually saw themselves working in teams, often preferring the terms networks and/or communities of practice. Provocatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212468349">Huxham and Vangen (2005</xref>) have referred to the phenomenon in terms of ‘leaderless leadership’.</p><p>Still more adjectives have been applied to leadership considered appropriate for multi-agency/inter-professional working. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1741143212468349">Whittington (2003</xref>) refers to ‘elective’ leadership in terms not dissimilar to Kirwan et al’s. (2008) use of ‘contributive’. Elective leadership is also a ‘style’ described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143212468349">Miller et al. (2001</xref>), based on six case studies of multi-professional work in Health and Social Care. From such a perspective, elective leadership occurs, it is asserted, when responsibility for leadership is assigned to all those in multi-professional teams. Members continue to work autonomously, maintaining separate roles, but express a value in learning from others in the partnership. Here, we note a move from ‘leaderless’ leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212468349">Huxham and Vangen, 2005</xref>), through team leadership, towards a perspective of ‘everyone being a leader’ in multi-agency teams.</p><p>Or, inter-professional advocates have assumed that with goodwill, the best of attention to team work, and an intensification of inter-professional capacity building, models of ‘servant leadership’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1741143212468349">Neill et al., 2007</xref>; Spears and Lawrence, 2002) are equally or simultaneously appropriate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212468349">Hammick et al. (2009</xref>: 55) consider the fit between ‘servant leadership’ and new demands to be inter-professional:</p><disp-quote><p>The integration of servant leadership principles in practice has less to do with directing other people and more to do with serving their needs and in fostering the use of shared power in an effort to enhance effectiveness in the professional role.</p></disp-quote><p>The extent to which shared power is a feature of systemic development is considered next.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section13-1741143212468349"><title>‘Schoolification’ and System Leadership</title><p>The concept of system leadership is one which has been ‘grabbed’ enthusiastically as an approach which appears to overcome previous shortcomings in defining or applying collaborative practices in the best interests of children and young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212468349">Higham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468349">Hopkins and Higham, 2007</xref>) notably in relation to both children’s learning and schools. Notwithstanding its purported commitment to the systemic development of communities containing multiple agencies, the approach is largely school-centric, with headteachers/principals viewed as having key roles in the ‘systemic development of communities containing students other than their own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468349">Hopkins and Higham, 2007</xref>: 148) Advocated as part of a ‘new professional movement’ in the development of school staff and principals, even the most enthusiastic recognize tensions in the advocacy of system leadership as ‘national policy’ or as ‘a professional movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468349">Hopkins and Higham, 2007</xref>: 147). So, while there seems to be an emerging view of leadership as one which might be collective, ‘stretched’ across multiple services, alliances, and authorities, and which seeks to bring about inter-service collaboration, the system approach seems firmly anchored, at least in the ELM literature, as central to school leadership capacity building. ‘System leadership’ also tends to accept rather than seriously challenge the tensions between leadership of inter-/multi-agency activities and current forms of institutional self-interest and accountability. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51a-1741143212468349">Hartley (2010a</xref>: 360) (albeit in relation to distributed leadership), ‘its coming to the fore seems to have been pragmatic … rather than a response to deep structural changes in the economic and social orders’.</p><p>As in mainstream education policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212468349">DFES, 2005c</xref>), headteachers are increasingly identified in the inter-service literature as visionaries and drivers, who are successful in engaging others in both multi- and inter-agency initiatives; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212468349">Coleman (2006</xref>: 35) for example, refers to them taking a ‘strong strategic and symbolic lead’. Several writers consider school leaders, in particular, to be especially important in the early stages of potential collaboration between agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212468349">Coleman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212468349">Cummings, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143212468349">Kirwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1741143212468349">Siraj Blatchford et al., 2007</xref>) and with key emphases upon headteachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143212468349">Kirwan et al. (2008</xref>) go further to suggest that headteachers ought to encourage external agencies to engage with the vision of the school, an approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212468349">Cohen et al. (2004</xref>: 6) as ‘schoolification’, when schools develop increased power over the lives of children, and dominate professionals from other agencies. This raises issues about the complementarity, sometimes assumed, between ‘the vision of the school’, the multiple purposes and objectives of inter-agency collaboration, and the needs of children and young people. (The earlier reference to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143212468349">Mordaunt (1999</xref>) and ‘predatory partnerships’ might seem apposite here.) Meanwhile, research evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212468349">Huxham and Vangen (2005</xref>) indicates the degree of challenge in agreeing clear visions and purposes for collaborative partnerships.

This follows belated recognition that inter-agency work also required considerations of inter-agency leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212468349">Close, 2011</xref>), and includes ‘official’ recognition of the problems of multi-agency work, ‘the difficulty of managing … complexity in an evolving policy context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212468349">DFES, 2006a</xref>: 2, 7), and in ‘an environment where professionals may be working to conflicting agendas’. Government responses have been predictable: a framework for professional development and the emergence of national standards in terms of the skills, knowledge and behaviours needed for those working across services. Such developments reveal rational responses to managing inter-service work by evoking clearer structures and systems of performance management, standards indicators, and measurable outcomes, despite the acknowledgement of complexity and conflict noted above.</p><p>When the ECM agenda was introduced, there were few professional development opportunities appropriate for those leading new multi-professional teams. Several research and evaluation reports noted paucity in training opportunities for those facilitating work across agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212468349">Anning et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212468349">DFES, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212468349">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212468349">Edwards et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212468349">Hartle et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, when the Hartle et al. (2008) undertook research into the role and development needs of middle managers in multi-agency settings for the Hay Group, they found that even in post-training contexts, there was a lack of clarity among participants about what constituted effective inter- or multi-agency work. Subsequently, training programmes for middle managers were developed, led by the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC), along with a National Qualification for Integrated Centre Leadership (NQICL), led by the National College. Its focus has been on developing ‘internal integration’ between personal and professional values and behaviours in order to help leaders in Children’s Centres to address the ‘complex management of conflicting roles and responsibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1741143212468349">NPQICL, 2010</xref>). In setting out the benefits of this qualification, the programme emphasizes:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>opportunities to reflect in-depth on your leadership;</p></list-item><list-item><p>access to a mentor to support, guide and challenge you;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a leadership learning journal to record thoughts and reflections about key incidents which provides a focus for mentoring sessions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a centre based assessment visit towards the end of the programme. (NPQICL, 2010)</p></list-item></list><p>The programme takes an experiential approach to learning, enabling participants to contribute to its design, and to develop ‘learning communities’ that draw on participants’ professional experience and knowledge. What appears to be lacking, however, is any clear indication of deep theoretical and critical analysis. Rather, the model of leadership preparation is to enable participants (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741143212468349">NCSL, 2008</xref>: 10) to ask: ‘what is it like being a leader in an integrated Children’s Centre and how can I best respond to its challenges?’ While there is clear value in creating a course which encourages the participation of leaders from a wide variety of backgrounds, little attention appears to have been given to the theory-practice nexus. On the contrary, fears were that ‘the assignments might become too academically orientated – at the expense of the professional-practitioner focus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741143212468349">NCSL, 2008</xref>: 9).</p></sec><sec id="section15-1741143212468349"><title>Taking Stock and Moving Forward</title><p>This article has sought to shed light on the extent to which recent trends towards collaborative inter-service provision are matched by the development of appropriate leadership theories and/or practices. Published evidence suggests that the term ‘collaborative leadership’ is open to almost any kind of definition that counters a strictly autocratic position, and that even the latter has the capacity to be absorbed into so-called collaborative models/systems.</p><p>In part, this is because terms like collaboration, cooperation, coordination, federation and networking are used inter-changeably with multi-, inter-service, and systems provision, and at a variety of levels, with little recourse to ‘new’ theory other than in terms of relatively minor adjustments to those which have dominated uni-service provision, frequently evident in the schools literature. In the ELM field, the interrogative lens, with some exceptions noted earlier, rarely focuses on leadership that moves beyond the internal organization of schooling. This suggests that the time is ripe for a new locus of attention that extends beyond the last generation’s focus upon schools as single sites for school improvement and effectiveness towards theoretical and research engagement with interventions that move beyond the school, and demand engagement with more than school-based professionals and services.</p><p>This suggests at least four focal points of interest for the education leadership field: the <italic>first</italic> would centre upon new understandings about what being an inter-agency leader actually means in practice, not least in contexts where leadership influence has, to date, relied more on orchestration tactics than positional power. The <italic>second</italic> might focus on ‘inter-professionality’ as a ‘new’ (and contestable) form of professionalism, and consider its implications for the cultural transformation of work-based practices. Indeed, new approaches to what actually constitute the bases and boundaries of education work and leadership may be overdue, requiring research activity across a range of knowledge disciplines and professional boundaries. <italic>Third</italic>, it follows that leadership development opportunities ought to incorporate deeper, more intellectually supported approaches, which are both people and organization minded. <italic>Finally</italic>, investigations about the contribution of each of the above in meeting the diverse educational and social needs of children and young people would seem essential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section16-1741143212468349"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our desk research suggests that a meeting of minds in terms of the literatures that span Education, Health, Social Work and Social Care is, as yet, only barely discernible, and involves diverse interpretations about how collaboration is being translated into practice. Moreover, theoretical stagnation persists in part because policy tends to be ‘taken’ rather than scrutinized. Notions of boundary-breaking leadership that also run counter to organizational or professional self-interest and accountability remain largely unchallenged other than in terms of developing leaders who have the resilience to cope with contradiction.</p><p>While hierarchy and the market are likely to accelerate as key organizing principles within and beyond schools, hospitals, and care organizations, momentous changes are occurring in terms of the breaking down of long-standing alliances among schools, between schools and local authorities, schools and universities, public and private services, and between service users and an increasingly diverse range of providers. Not only is there uncertainty about what collaboration is but also about with whom leaders ought to collaborate. This suggests that even the relatively novel aspects of inter-service leadership implicated in recent TAC models face imminent modification, even disintegration, since many of the models evoked by terms like federation, networking, partnership, collaboration, and alliance making, are, as we write, being remoulded or dismantled. To use a dance analogy, as the ‘music stops’, organizations may need ‘to change partners’ (again).</p><p>A less pessimistic orientation might be to argue, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212468349">Gronn (2010</xref>), that the leadership models which recent generations of leaders have been required to ‘buy into’ have never, in reality, existed, other than in idealized forms. This presents opportunities. Applying the term leadership as a set of changing ‘configurations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212468349">Gronn, 2010</xref>: 422), in which individual leadership co-exists with various forms of group-based or project-orientated leadership formations within and across organizations, makes it possible for futures-orientated theorists to work with professionals to define the kinds of ‘capabilities’ and professional and work-based cultures needed to lead learning ethically in multi-faceted, inter-professional and inter-agency environments. Perhaps more than ever we need to investigate interventions most likely to succeed in maximizing opportunities for children and young people whose needs the leadership field purports to serve.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The desk research upon which this article rests draws from a project which also included Liz Westcott, Anne Ewans, Gail Lansdown, Netta Lloyd Jones, Sharon Vitali with Judith Bell and Sharon Mickan (Department of Health and Social Care, Oxford Brookes University), Georgina Glenny (Education), and Alan Floyd (now at Reading University).
