<p>Beginning with a vignette of a sidewalk’s appropriation by squatters evicted from an abandoned department store and antipoverty activists in Vancouver, Nicholas Blomley launches into an analysis of sidewalks that ultimately demonstrates why the unimpeded flow of pedestrian traffic generally trumps those advocating for the greater realization of human rights, or rights-based claims, in North American courts of law. Although his choice of story could have prefaced another lament for the loss of public space, <italic>Rights of Passage</italic> serves to document the particular rationality by which sidewalks are understood, regulated, and evaluated. Blomley argues that an inability to appreciate what leads to an engineer’s narrow “goal of balancing street traffic in an inclusionary and rational manner” (p. 30) is to miss how such spaces for the public are reproduced over time.</p>
<p>The book presents the perspectives of governing authorities tasked with sidewalk management; introduces prevailing laws, legal decisions, and design standards; and describes the history that shapes our collective understanding of sidewalks. Blomley introduces the term “pedestrianism” to refer to the rationality that regards the orderly movement of pedestrians as its primary goal. According to this reasoning, “obstacles that impede flow are inherently suspect . . . and are to be limited or placed carefully so as to minimize blockage” (p. 4). Human beings are, thus, conceptually similar to static objects in that both have the potential of becoming obstructions. Mobility is preferenced above all else. So in order to understand why pedestrianism prevails—often to the detriment of other concerns—one must understand its logic and operationalizing mechanisms.</p>
<p>Blomley sets off in Chapter 2 (titled “Civic Humanism and the Sidewalk”) with a concise synopsis of the predominant literature pertaining to the functionality of public space. This civic humanist perspective, or “emphasis upon the social and political effects of the sidewalk, understood in relation to the human subject” (p. 17), serves as the stark background against which to contrast pedestrianism. Blomley does not disagree with the studies that regard sidewalks as spaces for both political expression and social interaction; in fact, he has contributed extensively to the body of knowledge that documents the role of public space in civil society. He argues, however, that the prevailing civic humanist literature is insufficient in helping understand how decisions regarding sidewalks are made.</p>
<p>Rights-based advocates suggest, directly or indirectly, that the state is purposely designing and managing sidewalks to limit their use by certain segments of the population, such as the homeless, and to facilitate economic growth, that is, allowing sidewalks to become extensions of the storefront. Blomley argues otherwise in Chapters 3 and 4 (“Thinking Like an Engineer” and “Producing and Policing the Sidewalk,” respectively). Based on extensive data collected from the review of regulations and interviews with city officials from select cities throughout the United States and Canada, he writes that the efforts of urban administrators effectively depoliticize the street by means of “content neutral” (p. 55) administrative pedestrianism. “Moral and sociological distinctions [of sidewalk users] are seemingly bracketed” (p. 30). Reading Blomley, one imagines hearing the stereotypical bureaucrat saying, “Sorry, I didn’t make the rules, I only enforce them.” The differences between street performers wishing to attract crowds of onlookers, inanimate objects such as mailboxes, and protestors picketing in front of a store dissipate from the perspective that all impede mobility. For the urban administrator, pedestrian circulation is the primary goal for city sidewalks.</p>
<p>The rationality of pedestrianism is based, in part, on an analysis of the source documents that were developed by, and continue to inform, engineers. An optimal walking experience dictates, for example, that a crowded street is bad and an empty street, where the pedestrian has the ability to move freely, is good. Blomley’s research offers insights to the perspectives of people whom he invariably lumps together as engineers, bureaucrats, and local authorities. From an urban manager or engineer’s perspective, sidewalks are not “sites for politics, citizenship and rights” (p. 35) but are strictly a means for pedestrian passage. Geometric engineering specifications contained in texts put forward by the Transportation Association of Canada and the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials are presented as well as many examples of municipal ordinances and by-laws. Ultimately, these various treatises together suggest that the “successful sidewalk is one that separates and buffers [uses], arranging people and objects carefully so that collisions and encounters are minimized” (pp. 39-40). Municipal police powers generally give authorities great discretion and flexibility in sidewalk management (p. 46).</p>
<p>Chapter 5 (“The History of Pedestrianism”) reminds the reader that the hegemony of pedestrianism is relatively new. Only in the mid-eighteenth century city did authorities begin separating those on foot from other users of the street. Specifications for street and sidewalk standards began emerging in the 1930s under the same scientific management aegis that introduced efficiency to the factory floor. At that point in history, municipal engineers were perfectly suited and situated to implement various bureaucratic methods that would organize the public realm. For those readers committed to civic humanist perspective, it is difficult to imagine that the only values underlying the development of sidewalk laws and geometric standards are those that forwarded efficiency, and yet that is exactly what Blomley, by means of his compelling research and writing, asks of us.</p>
<p>Chapters 6 and 7 (“Judicial Pedestrianism” and “Obstructions of Justice,” respectively) recognize that disputes involving sidewalks often become judicial matters. Disagreements arise when expectations associated with the use of space conflict with the assumptions and practices of municipal authorities. Similar to his examination of administrative regulations, the author demonstrates that judges generally rule in favor of unobstructed pedestrian circulation. So-called judicial pedestrianism results in decisions that disregard matters of equity and power, and instead collapses people and objects such that all become potential obstructions, nuisances, or trespassers. For those suspecting a hidden capitalist agenda, the author points out that the needs of businesses or utility companies also have not systematically swayed legal decisions.</p>
<p>Apart from rights-based conflicts that challenge pedestrianism, Blomley acknowledges a growing movement of other constituencies interested in sidewalks. Incorporating more of the civic humanist lexicon, organizations and programs such as the Complete Streets Coalition and Walkable Communities see sidewalks as critical to community life and are pushing for greater variety in street usage. And yet, these organizations generally affirm the primacy of mobility, that is, the central tenet of pedestrianism. Even Jane Jacobs’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X11431865">2002</xref> advocacy of Toronto’s <italic>Pedestrian Charter</italic> is called upon as evidence to support Blomley’s argument that mobility and the proper placement of potential obstructions are fundamental to the many efforts to improve streets for people. Between administrative and judicial pedestrianism, rights-based claims are effectively deactivated.</p>
<p>Whereas many of the administrative and judicial practices of pedestrianism rely on relatively simple understandings and interpretations, so-called political pedestrianism, as described in Chapter 8 (“Taking a Constitutional: Circulation, Begging and the Mobile Self”), is more complex. This reasoning defends unobstructed circulation for the purpose of personal security, safety, and a moral order of conduct in public spaces. Examples of this mode emerge during debates associated with, for example, panhandling. Blomley concedes how pedestrianism can clearly be used as shield, and thus allows for the avoidance of social justice and equity issues, but the rationality of pedestrianism is more complicated, it “cannot be reduced to other logics, such as capitalism, gentrification, neoliberalism or globalization” (p. 109). Blomley successfully teases out its differences and makes a compelling case for the study of pedestrianism on its own terms.</p>
<p>In the final chapter (“Hidden in Plain View”), the author finally reveals his convictions: pedestrianism should be challenged because of its adverse effect on social justice. However, rather than challenge pedestrianism directly, as rights-based advocates have attempted, Blomley recommends challenging it “from within” (p. 111). Decisions pertaining to space cannot always be reduced to matters of circulation, and yet the history of pedestrianism, the court verdicts, laws, professions reared upon this philosophy—are all too robust and embedded in governance such that a frontal attack will likely fail. Although not part of this book’s scope, Blomley only touches upon what a challenge “from within” may entail. Questions could be raised, for example, about who is included when laws refer to “the public”; and so-called “obstructions” could be examined from the benefits they provide instead of from their negative aspects.</p>
<p>This slim, but dense, book should appeal to a varied audience, from public administration and planning students to scholars of public space and urban historians. <italic>Rights of Passage</italic> focuses on sidewalks, but how the problem was framed and then analyzed is widely transferable to projects involving the nexus of space and society. A similar investigation could easily have been conducted on other spaces for the public, like parks or privately owned public spaces. Blomley should now apply the same creativity and methodical tenacity to pursue his next research question: how society might engage with pedestrianism on its own terrain in order to modify its negative impacts on social justice.</p>
