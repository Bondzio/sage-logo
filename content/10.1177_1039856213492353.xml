<title>Objective:</title>
<p>This paper describes a competency based advanced training year in adult Intellectual Disability Psychiatry enabled through a partnership between disability and mental health sectors. This training experience could be viewed as a prototype for further specialised training schemes in Intellectual Disability Psychiatry, and has relevance for the implementation of competency based psychiatric training schemes in Australia.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The need for a specific training curriculum in Intellectual Disability Psychiatry is outlined with reference to epidemiological evidence and human rights. The formulation of the training programme and the training experience itself is described and evaluated. Conclusions on the implications of this experience for the future competency based training schemes are drawn. Building a skilled workforce is necessary to address the significant inequalities in mental health experienced by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. A significant initial step for this would be the development of a specialised training curriculum. Service provision for this population is scattered across many disciplines and organisations with historically little mutual cooperation. Additionally, proposed competency-based training schemes stipulate that a medical expert develops a wide skill set across multiple domains. Thus, formal cross sector collaboration is fundamental for any competency based training scheme to be feasible.</p>

<body>
<p>There is a substantial body of evidence that people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (abbreviated throughout as ID) experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population and have poor access to mental health interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492353">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492353">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This paper describes the need for training in ID mental health (IDMH) and an innovative one-year traineeship realised through strategic partnership between disability and mental health sectors and the NSW Institute of Psychiatry (NSWIOP). It further clarifies the rationale for specific training in this area and outlines the training experience undertaken by one advanced trainee, illustrating how a competency based training scheme could be implemented for training in IDMH in a wide range of settings.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856213492353">
<title>The case for specialist training in adult ID psychiatry</title>
<p>There are over 400,000 Australians with ID.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492353">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492353">4</xref></sup> It has been estimated that up to 57% have psychiatric disability or a mental disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492353">5</xref></sup> Access to health care, including mental health services and supports, is a fundamental human right. Equitable access to health care for people with disabilities, including the right to health care required specifically because of their disability, has been clearly articulated in Article 25 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492353">6</xref></sup> which was ratified by the Australian Government in 2008. In contrast, Australians with ID currently have poor access to mental health services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492353">2</xref></sup> and Australian psychiatrists report a lack of confidence and training in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492353">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492353">8</xref></sup> The current situation therefore falls far short of obligations under the UNCRPD.</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of Australian services for people with ID has both historical and political roots. Post-deinstitutionalisation, state policies in the 1980s and 1990s oversaw a separation of ID and health services, whereby the disability sector became responsible for human services, therapy and behaviour support with all other health and specific mental health needs to be met by the health sector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492353">9</xref></sup> These two service systems have evolved with very different philosophies, skill sets, administrative and training systems, with little provision for cross sector collaboration. This schism between sectors makes the application of a holistic framework of support for mental disorders difficult, as intensive and coordinated input is often required from both sectors.</p>
<p>The assessment and management of mental health problems in people with ID is often poorly performed within general adult mental health services. Services lack staff with appropriate training and clinical skills, and in most jurisdictions there is no operational framework which facilitates the integration of support from disability and health sectors. The clinical territory is complex: signs and symptoms of mental illness that appear in people with ID may not readily map to common nosology. Diagnosis may be confounded by the individual’s developmental stage, psychosocial context and communication abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492353">10</xref></sup> The complexity of the clinical terrain is further evidenced by the range of genetic syndromes which cause ID and give rise to specific behavioural and psychiatric phenotypes; the presence of neuropsychiatric co-morbidities such as epilepsy, ADHD, sleep disorders and autism; and the presence of physical illness and sensory impairments.</p>
<p>Despite the current situation, there is incremental progress toward improving access to mental health supports for people with ID. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) recently supported the establishment of a Special Interest Group in ID, which is lobbying for improved ID health policy and services and recommending ID content for various stages of the new competency based RANZCP training. There is increasing awareness of the needs of people with ID in key mental health policies. For example The Fourth National Mental Health Plan (DOHA 2009)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492353">11</xref></sup> specifically states that those with ID and mental ill health are ‘overlooked and access to appropriate treatment for both disabilities is limited’. The launch of pilot components of the National Disability Insurance scheme in 2013 has also raised community awareness. The wellbeing of people with ID is increasingly in the consciousness of policy makers and the general public. In some jurisdictions, specific agreements have been reached to improve the cross sector cooperation and shared management of disability and mental health support needs. For example, see the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Ageing Disability and Home Care (ADHC) and NSW Ministry of Health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213492353">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Building a skilled workforce is a central component of improving access to and quality of mental health services for people with ID. There are many challenges, as IDMH is not a mandatory component of training in medicine, allied health or nursing undergraduate or postgraduate programmes. Competencies in IDMH are not a mandated component of training within any Australian state or territory mental health service. The building of a specialist psychiatric workforce represents an important starting point in workforce development as such individuals have the potential to lead further service, training and academic developments. At present, the number of clinicians specialising in IDMH is small.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492353">13</xref></sup> To this end, a specialist-training scheme for adult ID Psychiatry has great utility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856213492353">
<title>Training Fellowships in IDMH: a trainee’s experience</title>
<p>The IDMH Fellowships are financial grants available on a competitive basis to Advanced Trainees and provide a registrar’s salary for one year within the NSW Health System. They are funded by ADHC and administered by the NSWIOP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492353">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Fellowships do not specify a curriculum and it is the applicant’s responsibility to propose a training plan as part of their IDMH Fellowship application. Training objectives for the Fellowship year (undertaken by KJ) were largely based on the curriculum for Specialist Training in Psychiatry of Intellectual Disability of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in the United Kingdom. At present this the most comprehensive and well-established curriculum available for training in Intellectual Disability Psychiatry. It is a three-year competency based training programme influenced by the CanMEDS framework,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492353">15</xref></sup> which has also influenced the competency based training scheme in psychiatry being introduced in Australia and New Zealand. To date, attempts at integrating competency-based approaches into the RANZCP Fellowship programme have focused on basic training and drafting appropriate competencies, learning objectives and assessments. The challenge would be adaptation of the RCPsych three-year program into a one-year competency based training scheme for ID Psychiatry in the current Australian setting.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213492353">
<title>Designing the Fellowship training programme</title>
<p>The RCPsych curriculum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492353">16</xref></sup> contains 17 intended learning objectives (ILOs), which are based on the CanMEDS criteria. These criteria recognise that a medical expert requires skills in six overlapping domains: professional, scholar, collaborator, communicator, health advocate and manager. For the IDMH Fellowship, this translated into incorporating experiences in clinical assessment and management, policy, service development, research and teaching, and advocacy.</p>
<p>The RCPsych ILOs were designed to be universal for all psychiatric subspecialities, which meant that the learning objectives for the IDMH Fellowship needed to be more specific regarding clinical knowledge in the management and assessment of mental health problems, to ensure that they were not overlooked. This was especially important regarding disorders managed by specialities outside psychiatry in the Australian context, for example, neuropsychiatric conditions such as epilepsy; neurodevelopmental conditions, for example, autism; and the genetic syndromes.</p>
<p>Time restraints meant certain objectives needed to be prioritised over others. Clinical ID mental health experiences were the emphasis of the timetable throughout the year. Rotations in developmental paediatrics, neuropsychiatry, and social care experiences were undertaken in serial four-month rotations, running concurrently with basic clinical experiences. One day was set aside for research, education and teaching. A list detailing important readings as well as educational events, such as rural visits, conferences and workshops, was also submitted.</p>
<p>An iterative process of supervision was set in place, including weekly supervision with a supervising consultant. Monthly written reports detailing educational activities, educational objectives being completed and any problems and barriers encountered were submitted. There were six monthly reviews with the Head of Medical Education at the NSWIOP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213492353">
<title>Implementing the programme</title>
<p>The base chosen for the Fellowship year was a clinical academic department (Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales) involved in policy making and service development. Clinical experiences occurred within several specialised intellectual disability clinics within the associated South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. This included specialised multidisciplinary clinics at the Kogarah Diagnostic and Assessment Service, St George Hospital, and a tertiary ID neuropsychiatry service based at the Prince of Wales Hospital. Clinical experiences largely took place in an outpatient setting.</p>
<p>The health needs of people with ID are scattered across a wide number of providers in primary and secondary care, posing challenges in gaining adequate clinical exposure. These challenges were overcome by working in specialist mental health clinics, which facilitated comprehensive exposure to a full range of mental health problems experienced by people with ID, including the rarer genetic syndromes.</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary nature of the services enabled collaboration with other disciplines, including developmental paediatricians, neurologists, geneticists and rehabilitation physicians. A formal arrangement with ADHC also granted access to allied health specialists experienced in functional behavioural analysis, sensory testing and communication skills. Placements within ADHC facilitated the development of a better knowledge of different service streams and client pathways within the disability sector.</p>
<p>The ongoing management of a patient in the community using psychological strategies demonstrated how cognitive behaviour principles could be modified for this population and provided an opportunity to develop valuable communication skills, necessary in managing a population with differing degrees of communicative ability.</p>
<p>There were opportunities to develop key academic skills through exposure to research projects, the opportunity for academic presentations and teaching through the university, including the development of a research project to be pursued beyond the life of the Fellowship. Additionally a travel grant enabled first-hand experience of ID Psychiatry training and services in the UK as well as attending international conferences, giving valuable insight into service design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213492353">
<title>Evaluation of the Fellowship experience</title>
<p>There was ample opportunity to develop skills within each of the roles from the Fellowship experiences. The placement in a university department facilitated opportunities to develop research skills, such as research projects, research-focused supervision, workshops in statistics and access to library resources. It was also useful in gaining access to policy-making and service development experiences and access to organisations outside health. Clinical experiences within specialised services for people with ID provided valuable access to clinical issues and supervision.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, there were obstacles in coordinating experiences across numerous locations and within different medical sub-specialities due to time restraints and administrative barriers. This was especially true of the disability sector, where there was often little understanding of the need for the involvement of health practitioners within their organisations. Better collaboration on training matters may create mutually beneficial opportunities, such as developing capacity for home outreach mental health services. Additionally, there were few managerial and clinical governance opportunities as many of the experiences were in services with their own well established administrative and governance processes that did not perceive a need to incorporate an external trainee. Such experience should be built into training programmes in the future.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-1039856213492353" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The IDMH Fellowship demonstrated that the implementation of a specific competency based advanced training programme in ID Psychiatry is feasible in the Australian context. The richness and diversity of the experience enabled the development of important skills that will help to address the significant health inequalities experienced by people with ID. The creation of specialist multidisciplinary psychiatric services for people with ID, well integrated with existing services, would ease many of the barriers to the implementation of such a training scheme. To be feasible, any comprehensive training scheme should have strong formal arrangements with policy makers, universities, other medical disciplines, particularly primary care, and relevant government and non-government organisations. It should also have strong links with tertiary medical services, as many of the clinical disorders are rare from a population perspective. Formal cross sector collaboration is vital in clarifying the role of trainees working across multiple organisations as well as in reducing administrative barriers. Collaboration is growing between government departments, exemplified by the MOU between ADHC and the NSW Ministry of Health. While the specific training of psychiatrists or psychiatry trainees is not a focus of the MOU, the MOU provides a framework on which training could be built.</p>
<p>A curriculum with agreed competencies and assessments would provide a framework to standardise experiences for trainees and elaborate how stakeholders should be involved in IDMH training. As the Special Interest Group in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities within the RANZCP evolves further to a Section and beyond, it is likely that a specific training scheme will be developed.</p>
