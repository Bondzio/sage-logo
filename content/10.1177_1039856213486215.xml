<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>Perinatal depression and anxiety are prevalent in migrant women. The main aims of this literature review were to understand the psychosocial determinants of depression and anxiety in migrant women antenatally and to explore common clinical presentations. In addition, we aimed to identify barriers and facilitating factors for help-seeking and treatment, in order to identify directions for service development and improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213486215">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A review of the literature was performed using electronic databases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856213486215">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Depression and anxiety are over represented in migrant women in the perinatal period. Somatic symptoms are common presentations for emotional distress. An identified difficulty is a perceived lack of support, often as a result of cultural dislocation and social isolation. Significant barriers to help-seeking include the perception that limited assistance is available and reluctance to share personal information with an unknown clinician. Preferred therapeutic approaches include the use of clinical consultants from the same or similar culture, as well as practical and emotional support rather than medical management of symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856213486215">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Clinicians should be aware of psychosocial issues in this vulnerable population. Group programmes with a focus on education about mental and physical health, available supports, and socialisation are effective in engaging and assisting pregnant migrant women.</p>

<p>Australia has a large migrant population. The 2011 census showed that 26% of people living in Australia were born overseas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486215">1</xref></sup> Most migrants (82%) born overseas live in capital cities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486215">1</xref></sup> Nineteen per cent speak a language other than English and 2% speak no English at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486215">1</xref></sup> Antenatal clinics at many public hospitals across Australia, in particular those in capital cities, provide services for migrant women. These women, however, have different psychosocial needs and may present in a variety of ways compared with women born in Australia. The Australian government has highlighted the identification and management of mental health issues as a priority. The Fourth National Mental Health Plan has a particular focus on prevention and early intervention, as well as social inclusion and recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486215">2</xref></sup> Specific issues pertaining to the mental health of migrant women are less well known. Therefore, the aims of this review were to determine the rates at which migrant women experience anxiety and depression in the perinatal period, to describe how they may present to services and which mental health interventions are acceptable and effective in this population.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213486215" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A focused literature review was performed using electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO) and internet searches (Google scholar), with the terms ‘postnatal’, ‘perinatal’, ‘depression’, ‘anxiety’, ‘migrant’, ‘mental health’ and ‘emotional health’. Additional articles were found by screening the reference lists of identified articles and through discussions with transcultural mental health clinicians.</p>

<title>Postnatal depression (PND) and anxiety</title>
<p>In Australia, one in five women with a full-term infant either has a current mental health condition or meets DSM-IV criteria for perinatal mental health issues in the first year post-birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486215">3</xref></sup> In addition to depression, anxiety disorders are common in the perinatal period, either in association with depressive symptoms or as a discrete disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486215">3</xref></sup> Two-thirds of women with depression or anxiety postpartum have been found to be symptomatic during pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486215">4</xref></sup> PND may affect up to 42% of migrant women (rates of 24–42%) compared with 10–15% of native-born women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486215">5</xref></sup> A recent Cochrane review found that 20–40% of women with a previous history of PND are likely to relapse after subsequent births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486215">3</xref></sup> Thus, perinatal anxiety and depression are high prevalence disorders.</p>

<sec id="section7-1039856213486215">
<title>Risks for developing mental illness</title>
<p>Migrant women are more likely to have experienced previous traumatic exposures, loss of family and social supports, and cultural bereavement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486215">6</xref></sup> These women may be particularly vulnerable to developing PND due to the absence of postnatal rituals or organised personal support systems that would have been in place in their birth country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486215">7</xref></sup> Migrant women, as a result of having few family members or friends upon arrival, experience loneliness and social isolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486215">8</xref></sup> This lack of companionship places them at further risk of developing anxiety and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486215">8</xref></sup> For example, a study conducted in Victoria, Australia, over a two year period reviewed 20 Cambodian women in the postpartum period and identified high levels of anxiety and social isolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486215">9</xref></sup> Most symptoms arose as a result of attempting to follow traditional postpartum practices without the presence and support of female kin. These women were identified as being at high risk for the development of PND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486215">9</xref></sup> Similar themes emerged in a Western Australian study where a series of focus groups, including 46 women from three different cultures – Iraqi, Sudanese and Ethiopian – were conducted to determine the needs of perinatal migrant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486215">10</xref></sup> Researchers identified lack of access to information and support, inadequate service provision, lack of partner support, experiences of anxiety and depression, isolation and the absence of cultural practices as risk factors for developing perinatal mood disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486215">10</xref></sup> In general, low mood in women from all cultures in the postpartum period is often attributed to perceived lack of support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486215">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely used, 10-item self-report scale that screens for depression in the perinatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486215">11</xref></sup> There is a maximum score of 30, and women who score 12 or greater are considered to have possible depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486215">11</xref></sup> A Canadian study found that immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees were significantly more likely to score more than 10 on the EPDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486215">12</xref></sup> The women were also found to have lower social support scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486215">12</xref></sup> In addition, an American study assessed Puerto Rican perinatal migrants and found that a lack of social support caused higher levels of stress, while those individuals who migrated with family had a stronger social network and thus lower stress levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486215">13</xref></sup> A study of 41 Javanese women in late pregnancy or early postpartum period identified sociocultural factors adversely affecting their emotional wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>These factors included poor social support, financial difficulties, relationship conflict and family illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Migrants are also at increased risk of developing mental illness when they have experienced trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486215">6</xref></sup> Often this trauma is the reason for emigration, and sometimes further traumas occur during the emigration process, especially for asylum seekers and refugees. Under these circumstances, pregnant women are likely to present with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, correlated with exposure and proximity to traumatising events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486215">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Relationship with health services</title>
<p>It is common for South-East Asian women and women from other non-Western cultures to avoid discussion of personal, physical or mental problems outside the family due to fears of stigma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486215">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486215">16</xref></sup> This limits access to services and often depressive symptoms are not divulged. Migrant women may have had previous negative experiences of healthcare in their birth country, and avoid seeking help after migration due to concerns that this will be repeated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486215">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies have shown that, most commonly, women depressed postpartum had shown signs of prenatal distress, anxiety or somatic symptoms, with worries about postpartum adjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486215">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486215">12</xref></sup> Often, migrant women present to services with somatic complaints which are representative of mental health problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486215">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486215">19</xref></sup> Unlike Western cultures, somatic presentations may be a culturally acceptable means of expressing emotional distress. Common examples of somatic presentations include abdominal pain, whole body itchiness or weakness, or gynaecological symptoms, for example self-reports of vaginal discharge, which are particularly common presentations for migrants from the Indian subcontinent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486215">18</xref></sup> Welsh researchers used a focus group to interview Bengali women in the postnatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref></sup> The group was conducted with the aim of identifying whether postnatal depression was perceived as an illness and how it was interpreted culturally. These women reported somatic symptoms, such as pain or heart problems, but were largely unfamiliar with the term ‘postnatal depression’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref></sup> The researchers were unable to describe the Bengali concept of their condition, due to difficulties in defining and understanding the phenomenon. The women primarily sought support from their family, friends and religious leader in preference to primary care services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although social isolation and cultural dislocation contribute to stress during pregnancy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213486215">21</xref></sup> migrant women have cited lack of familiarity with healthcare practices in the host country, and their inability to speak English and lack of interpreters as further barriers to seeking help.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486215">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486215">22</xref></sup> In addition, lack of knowledge about postpartum depression or the acceptance of myths, such as depression being a sign of internal weakness not a legitimate illness, means that some postnatal women can be unable to recognise the symptoms of depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486215">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>What works</title>
<p>Research has demonstrated that migrant women prefer emotional and practical help, rather than pharmacological management of their symptoms, in some cases to minimise stigma, but generally to access a perceived increased level of support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486215">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486215">23</xref></sup> There is a significant link between social disadvantage, social isolation and mental health, much of which is greatly reduced, and often resolved, with practical social interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486215">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486215">23</xref></sup> Studies have also shown that the perception of having adequate support is more beneficial in improving the mood than the actual supportive behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213486215">24</xref></sup> In addition, in some Asian cultures, the concept of confiding in a stranger, even a professional, is foreign.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486215">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref></sup> The interviewer is more likely to get more information if they spend longer with the information gathering process and allow more time to develop rapport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486215">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>An ethnographic study of Cambodian-born women in Victoria, Australia, discovered that, after midwifery contact in the 10 days postpartum, these women were not seen by health professionals for six to eight weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486215">9</xref></sup> In this immediate postpartum period, migrant women often experience social isolation and significant emotional distress and are thus especially vulnerable to developing postnatal depression. Recommendations were therefore made for intensive postpartum follow-up and support for socially isolated migrant women to mitigate the risk of developing postpartum depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486215">9</xref></sup> It has not been reported whether this intensive follow-up is acceptable or desired by these women.</p>
<p>Clinical consultants in the community who are from the same or similar culture have also been found to be effective in facilitating accurate assessment and improved service utilisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486215">6</xref></sup> In addition, researchers have found that these women are more willing to engage with services if they have a better understanding of the role of the treating clinician and the available resources through the service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref></sup> An eight week group programme for 14 Sudanese women, run in Western Australia, focused on teaching skills in developing psychosocial supports and managing mental health issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486215">25</xref></sup> The researchers found that there was greatly improved awareness of perinatal mental health following the groups. This led to improved service use, as well as improved social supports through the opportunities for interaction during and after the groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486215">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were some common methodological limitations in the studies reviewed. For example, most studies had small participant numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486215">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486215">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486215">25</xref></sup> and short time frames for the interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486215">25</xref></sup> The interventions may have been time-limited to maximise participant attendance or due to limited resource availability. As a result, we are unable to comment upon the long term benefits of any interventions in this population. It has been previously noted that the use of clinical consultants from the same or similar culture may help to engage migrant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486215">6</xref></sup> Some studies did not use bilingual workers in some or all of the participant interactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486215">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486215">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486215">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486215">22</xref></sup> which may have reduced the efficacy of the intervention offered or influenced the quality and depth of information obtained in focus or therapeutic groups. In addition, the studies reviewed involved a range of cultural and language groups, and some were performed in countries with health systems quite different from those of Australia and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486215">12</xref>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Migrant women are at increased risk of developing postnatal depression and anxiety. Due to cultural and language barriers, they are reluctant to seek help, and those who are willing to do so are often unaware of the available services. These women present commonly with somatic symptoms and are often socially isolated. They tend to prefer practical help rather than pharmacological intervention. Clinicians need to be aware of psychosocial issues in this at-risk population and conduct careful screening and follow-up. Group programmes with a focus on education about mental and physical health, available supports, and socialisation have been shown to be effective in engaging and assisting perinatal migrant women. These are best delivered by clinicians from similar cultural backgrounds. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of group programmes in preventing and reducing perinatal mental health problems in migrant women, and to examine long-term outcomes.</p>
