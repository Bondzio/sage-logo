<abstract>
<p>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) may involve hypo-responsiveness of noradrenaline a2 receptors. To test this hypothesis, we used <sup>99m</sup>Tc-hexa-methyl-propylene-amine-oxime (HMPAO) Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography to measure regional cerebral perfusion in patients with untreated GAD, venlafaxine-treated patients and healthy controls during word generation before and after clonidine. Concurrent psychological and physiological measures supported noradrenergic hypofunction in GAD in some cases. A single-day split-dose technique was used. Images were processed using SPM5 (Institute of Neurology). Factorial analysis revealed no significant results. Exploratory analyses were done. Regional perfusion during verbal fluency differed by group pre-clonidine. Compared with healthy controls, patients with untreated GAD displayed increased perfusion in the left Broca’s area and left occipitotemporal region. Treated GAD patients displayed increased cerebellar perfusion bilaterally. Clonidine was associated with different changes in cerebral perfusion in each group. Increases were seen in the right supra-marginal gyrus in healthy subjects, in the left pre-central gyrus in treated GAD patients and in the right cerebellum and middle frontal gyrus in untreated GAD patients. Despite these differences, the findings were not consistent with a noradrenergic hypo-responsiveness hypothesis, as the treated group showed a different pattern of response rather than a normalization of response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is hypothesized to involve chronic excess of noradrenaline with consequent, or possibly pathogenic, hypo-responsiveness of inhibitory a2 receptors, identified as a blunted response to challenges of this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111415730">Nutt and Ballinger, 2005</xref>), although the evidence is inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415730">Kalk et al., 2011</xref>). For example, patients with GAD show a blunted growth hormone response to clonidine, an agonist at the a2 pre-synaptic auto-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111415730">Abelson et al., 1991</xref>), and decreased platelet binding of [3H]clonidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111415730">Cameron et al., 1990</xref>). However a challenge study using yohimbine, an a2 receptor antagonist, showed no difference in psychological or physiological response between GAD patients and healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111415730">Charney et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Functional imaging studies of central noradrenergic activity have the potential to investigate dysfunction directly. To date, no positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that specifically image noradrenaline receptors or reuptake sites have been available for use in man. However, imaging of changes in regional brain blood flow or glucose metabolism as a consequence of a noradrenergic pharmacological challenge can be utilized. Such studies can be further tuned to examine particular brain regions by examining the effect of the pharmacological challenge on brain activation in response to specific tasks targeting regions, or functions, of interest. From their studies with clonidine and H<sub>2</sub>
<sup>15</sup>O PET, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111415730">Fu et al. (2001)</xref> have suggested that clonidine induces increased perfusion in ‘right anterior cingulate, right superior prefrontal, bilateral insular, and superior temporal cortices’ with decreased perfusion in ‘a large right-sided contiguous cluster that extended to involve the thalamus’. To date, such studies have not been performed in GAD.</p>
<p>Prior studies in depression have been conducted and may provide a basis for extrapolation to GAD patients. Notably, GAD and depression share genetic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111415730">Kendler et al., 2007</xref>) and commonly occur in the same individual: GAD is often found to precede the onset of major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111415730">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>). In the studies mentioned above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111415730">Fu et al. (2001)</xref> showed that clonidine induced a differential response in the superior prefrontal cortex, with healthy women showing decreased perfusion and depressed women showing increased perfusion, despite no difference in growth hormone response or performance on the concurrent sustained attention task.</p>
<p>Verbal fluency is a reliable test of frontal lobe function known to be sensitive to noradrenergic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111415730">Arnsten, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111415730">Coull, 1998</xref>). It has also been shown to be associated with an increase in perfusion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111415730">Moffoot et al., 1994</xref>). The same study showed that, in patients with Korsakoff’s psychosis, clonidine improved verbal fluency and increased perfusion in the anterior cingulate gyrus.</p>
<p>We therefore adapted this study design to investigate noradrenergic function in patients with GAD. We hypothesized that GAD patients, like depressed patients, would respond to clonidine differently when compared with healthy controls, in terms of neuropsychological test performance, peripheral measures and regional perfusion. We further speculated that treatment might attenuate or reverse this abnormality. This paper describes the imaging data, whilst an accompanying paper reports in detail the psychophysiological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415730">Hood, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881111415730">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>In total 24 subjects, ten patients with untreated GAD, seven patients with treated GAD and seven healthy control subjects, were recruited. Healthy participants were recruited from the university volunteer database and via newspaper advertisement. Untreated GAD patients were recruited via newspaper advertisement. Treated GAD patients were recruited from a specialist psychiatric clinic. Diagnosis of GAD was made using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111415730">Sheehan et al, 1998</xref>). The treated group were considered for inclusion in the study if they had a Clinical Global Impression score of 1 or 2, that is ‘very good improvement’ or ‘good improvement’ on treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111415730">Guy, 1976</xref>). Five of the seven treated GAD subjects were treated with venlafaxine for at least 12 weeks, titrated to an effective dose. The mean dose was 150 mg. The two patients who were not treated with venlafaxine were treated with paroxetine 30 mg. Exclusion criteria included the following: age &lt; 18 or &gt; 65 years, a history of epilepsy, head injury, serious medical disorder, arrhythmias, tachycardia and hypertension, substance abuse; current pregnancy or lactation. Participants suffering from a co-morbid psychiatric disorder within the last 6 months were excluded from the study. Subjects on long-term glucocorticoid medication or those suffering from hyperthyroidism were excluded, as these attenuate the rise in growth hormone following clonidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111415730">Giustina et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111415730">1992</xref>). All participants spoke English as their first language.</p>
<p>On the day of the Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans, Beck Depression Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111415730">Beck and Steer, 1990</xref>) and Spielberger State Anxiety questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111415730">Spielberger, 1983</xref>) were completed. Informed, written consent was obtained. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee.</p>

<title>Neuropsychological task</title>
<p>The time points at which the neuropsychological task was done is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111415730">Figure 1</xref>. All subjects underwent a phonemic verbal fluency task, during which they said out loud all the words they could think of beginning with a specific letter within 1 min. The task took place over 4 min, using four different letters in each case. The letters used were S, A, O and U in the pre-clonidine condition and T, W, I and J in the post-clonidine condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111415730">Moffoot et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881111415730">
<title>Clonidine administration</title>
<p>Clonidine was administered intravenously, at a dose of 1.5 µg/kg dissolved in 9 mL saline injection, over a 10-min period prior to the second SPECT scan (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111415730">Figure 1</xref>). Doses between 1.5 and 2.0 µg/kg are commonly used in challenge studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415730">Kalk et al., 2011</xref>). In this case the lower dose was used, as the higher dose can produce intolerable hypotension. The beginning of this injection is considered time = 0 with reference to the measures in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881111415730">
<title>Psychological and physiological monitoring</title>
<p>Visual analogue scales (VAS) relating to GAD symptoms and the recognized effects of clonidine and physiological measures were collected over 3 h (the time points are shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111415730">Figure 1</xref>). These are fully described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415730">Hood (2011)</xref>. The VAS used in this study measured anxiety, sedation, happiness, mental alertness and relaxation. These were measured at −70, −25, −15, −5, +15, +30, +45, +90, and +95 min with respect to the time of the clonidine infusion. Saccadic eye movement measures included peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, acceleration to deceleration ratio and reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111415730">Glue et al., 1991</xref>). These were collected at the same time points as the VAS. Blood pressure and pulse were collected using a Finapres<sup>©</sup> machine, with readings at the same time points as the preceding measures. Blood samples were taken for cortisol, growth hormone and MHPG levels, at the following time points with respect to the clonidine infusion −15, −5, +15, +30, +45, and +90min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881111415730">
<title>SPECT brain scan procedure</title>
<p>Two whole-brain 99Tc-HMPAO scans lasting 35 min were acquired, one during each verbal fluency task. There was a mean interval of 137 min, (range 105–198 min), between the end of the first scan and the beginning of the second scan. Stabilized 99Tc-HMPAO was prepared according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Ceretec®, Amersham, UK). A split-dose technique was applied using 300 MBq 99Tc-HMPAO in the first scan and 200 MBq 99Tc-HMPAO in the second scan. Mean injected dose in first scan was 300.69 MBq (range 261–323 MBq) and second scan was 208.53 MBq (range 191.2–250 MBq). The start of the verbal fluency task coincided with the injection of the radioligand.</p>
<p>SPECT acquisition was performed using a SMV DST-XLi gamma camera. Images were acquired using 360 degree SPECT with Low Energy High Resolution Collimators with a non-circular orbit. There were 64 projections of 25 s, using a 1.33 zoom and a 128 × 128 matrix. Raw projections were checked for patient movement and sliced. They were then filtered using a Butterworth filter with power 5 and cut-off 2.0. The isometric voxel size was 3.38 mm, with a spatial resolution (full width half maximum) of 10 mm on reconstructed cuts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881111415730">
<title>Image processing and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Brain images were processed and analysed using SPM5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111415730">Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, 2005</xref>), implemented in Matlab® 7.3 (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA). Pre- and post-clonidine images were realigned. Inherent to the split-dose technique is that the second scan is contaminated by the remaining activity of the first one. We removed these residual effects from the post-clonidine image by subtraction of a pre-clonidine image decay-corrected to the start time of the post-clonidine image. Difference images were produced by a second subtraction of the pre-clonidine images from the post-clonidine image, this time without decay correction. These show the change in perfusion following clonidine and wereused in the second analysis. Images were normalized to the standard SPM5 template using default parameters and were smoothed using a 16 mm kernel.</p>
<p>In the statistical analysis, proportional scaling was used to set the global mean value of all images to 50. The primary hypothesis that clonidine would have differential effects on perfusion between groups was tested by two similar SPM analyses. Firstly, a flexible factorial 3 × 2 design was used, with group as the between-subject factor and two images per subject, one pre-clonidine, the other post-clonidine corrected for residual activity from scan 1 as described above. Secondly, a full factorial design was used with one image per subject, comparing double-subtracted images between groups, to delineate differences in changes induced by clonidine between the three groups. Due to the small numbers of individuals in each group, we then conducted a series of exploratory analyses, using paired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests, to examine perfusion changes induced by clonidine within the groups. Images of control and patient groups, treated and untreated, separately and together, prior to clonidine were compared to test for baseline differences between groups. In all designs, both implicit masking and an explicit mask using SPM’s standard grey matter plus white matter mask (Institute of Neurology, 2005) were used.</p>
<p>Only those areas of increased or decreased perfusion that reached set-level ( <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected cluster-level significance ( <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.01, corrected) are reported. FWE and cluster- and set-level significance are used as correction for multiple comparisons in imaging studies, in order to prevent reporting of false positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111415730">Friston et al, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Covariance with Spielberger State Anxiety score, Beck Depression Inventory score, change in verbal fluency score and sedation score were also evaluated. Current anxiety, depressive symptoms, change in performance and sedation were chosen as possible additional explanatory factors in the association between clonidine and changes in cerebral perfusion.</p>

<sec id="section9-0269881111415730" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three of the ten subjects from the untreated GAD group had imaging data that could not be analysed for technical reasons. This left 21 images, seven from each group, for analysis. Age range was 30–65 years, with a mean age of 46 ± 12.5 years. There was a significant difference in baseline Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory score between untreated GAD patients and both treated patients (Bonferroni: 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.50–37.29; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and healthy controls (Bonferroni: 95% CI = 14.86–43.46; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415730">Hood et al, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychological and physiological data from this study are presented elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415730">Hood, 2011</xref>). Briefly, the expected significant effects of clonidine were seen, with an increase in sedation, a rise in growth hormone, decrease in blood pressure, decline in saccadic eye movement (SEM) variables and improvement in verbal fluency. Cortisol levels were lower in controls. Higher blood pressure was found in GAD-treated subjects. GAD-treated subjects had SEMs intermediate between control and GAD groups and clonidine-induced sedation was reduced in this group.</p>
<sec id="section10-0269881111415730">
<title>Imaging results</title>
<p>The flexible factorial model using first and subtracted images and the full factorial model using double-subtracted images, with a FWE-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.001 and an extent threshold of 100 voxels, yielded no significant differences. The exploratory analyses did, however, reveal that regional cerebral perfusion in both treated and untreated patients with GAD differed from that of healthy controls during a verbal fluency task, prior to treatment with clonidine (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111415730">Table 1</xref>). Untreated patients showed greater perfusion relative to controls in the left Broca’s area and left occipitotemporal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881111415730">Figure 2</xref>), while treated patients had greater perfusion in the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881111415730">Figure 3</xref>) (FWE-corrected; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; cluster threshold &gt; 100). Treated and untreated GAD patients’ perfusion did not differ significantly from one another. Notably, no significant differences in verbal fluency score were seen between treated patients (43.0 ± 10.3) and untreated patients (44.0 ± 10.6; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415730">Hood, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We believe that this is the first neuroimaging study of a noradrenergic challenge in patients with GAD. The results of our exploratory analyses suggest that patients with GAD have a different pattern of perfusion during a verbal fluency task, to that in healthy controls. Patients with untreated GAD displayed greater perfusion in the left Broca’s area and left occipitotemporal region during a verbal fluency task. Treated GAD patients displayed greater perfusion in the cerebellum bilaterally.</p>
<p>Clonidine induced the same increase in perfusion in the anterior cingulate cortex as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111415730">Moffoot et al., 1994</xref>), but in our study this was restricted to the right side only. We did not see the increase in the left dorsolateral prefrontal that they also reported, nor did we demonstrate any decreases in perfusion in the clonidine condition. This difference may relate to the underlying pathology of Korsakoff’s syndrome or the lack of a control group in the earlier study. This may also represent the relative insensitivity of the split-dose <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO technique to decreases in perfusion, as the tracer crosses the blood–brain barrier irreversibly and would have remained in the tissue for the second scan. However, the split-dose technique was used to enable within-subject comparisons where two full doses would contravene regulatory guidelines concerning radiation dose in a study involving women.</p>
<p>The effect of clonidine on other frontal lobe tasks has been studied in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy volunteers. The majority of the findings in healthy subjects have shown a decrease in BOLD response following clonidine, in contrast to our findings and for some regions in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111415730">Moffoot et al. (1994)</xref> study. Healthy subjects during a spatial and temporal orienting task showed a decrease in perfusion in the left temporoparietal junction, right superior parietal lobe and left anterior insula following clonidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111415730">Coull, 2001</xref>). During rapid visual information processing, healthy volunteers showed a decrease in perfusionin the right intra-parietal sulcus following clonidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111415730">Coull et al., 1999</xref>). Clonidine administration was associated with an increase in the right thalamus during a paired association task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111415730">Coull et al., 1997</xref>). However, as explained, the split-dose HMPAO protocol has limited sensitivity to detect reductions and these tasks may demand different noradrenergic activity.</p>
<p>In our study, clonidine improved verbal fluency in all three groups. In other healthy volunteer studies studying the effects of clonidine on alternative prefrontal lobe tasks that tax working memory, such as spatial working memory or paired associate learning, there have been conflicting findings. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111415730">Coull et al. (1995)</xref> found that a low dose of clonidine impaired spatial working memory but a high dose improved it, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111415730">Jäkkälä et al. (1999)</xref> found that both high and low doses impaired spatial working memory. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111415730">Frith et al. (1985)</xref> found that clonidine impaired paired associate learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111415730">Coull et al. (1997)</xref> found no effect. However, the literature seems to support a decrease in performance after clonidine, in other tasks which involve working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111415730">Chamberlain et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Concerning the effects of the verbal fluency task on regional perfusion, since our study did not have a rest condition, we cannot directly compare our results with neuroimaging studies comparing blood flow during verbal fluency with rest. For example, <sup>15</sup>O-H<sub>2</sub>O PET studies have reported activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with decreased perfusion in the superior temporal gyrus during intrinsic word generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111415730">Friston et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111415730">Frith et al., 1991</xref>). fMRI experiments have found a more extensive network of activation including left lateralized prefrontal activation including Broca’s area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and pre-motor cortex, right cerebellar activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415730">Cuenod et al., 1995</xref>) and bilateral parietal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111415730">Schlosser et al., 1998</xref>), with deactivation in the posterior cingulate and superior temporal gyri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415730">Cuenod et al., 1995</xref>). The only SPECT study on verbal fluency in healthy controls found activation in Broca’s area, the anterior cingulate cortex, the right medial gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus and no deactivation clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415730">Audenaert et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore it is interesting to note that we found areas of increased perfusion predominantly in areas previously related to verbal fluency in functional imaging experiments. No specific increases in perfusion were related to performance in verbal fluency in these studies, or in our own.</p>
<p>We had originally hypothesized that if there was an abnormality in the a2 receptor noradrenergic system associated with GAD, treatment would help to ‘normalize’ this. It is therefore interesting to note that the treated GAD and untreated GAD groups showed different patterns of activation in the pre-clonidine condition and seemed to be affected differently by clonidine. However, we did not see ‘normalization’, since those with treated GAD continued to differ from controls. This may have represented incomplete remission or neuroplasticity in response to treatment, which does not represent a return to normal noradrenergic function. A history of co-morbidity could also have affected the results. Although we excluded patients with co-morbid psychiatric disorders within the past 6 months, data on their psychiatric status prior to this time were not recorded. However, recruiters were mindful of the confounding effect of co-morbid depressive history on the study.</p>
<p>Our initial speculative hypothesis that the post-clonidine response in treated GAD patients would be intermediate between untreated GAD patients and healthy controls, and would involve the same brain areas, was not borne out by our results. We acknowledge that the number of individuals in our study is small but is an acceptable number for SPECT studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the first imaging study examining verbal fluency and the noradrenergic system in GAD, we found that untreated GAD patients, treated GAD patients and healthy controls have differing patterns of cerebral perfusion during a verbal fluency task. Exploratory analyses suggest that clonidine may affect cerebral perfusion differently in different regions in different groups, but it is difficult to draw this conclusion given that the factorial model yielded negative results. Our findings are not consistent with a general noradrenergic hypo-responsiveness in GAD. Rather, our data are more consistent with the psychophysical data from the same subjects reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415730">Hood etal. (2011)</xref>, in which some parameters, such as SEM, showed a difference between groups, but others, such as growth hormone response, showed no difference. Our results could be explained by regional differences in noradrenergic receptor responsiveness, as previously described in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111415730">Fu et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
