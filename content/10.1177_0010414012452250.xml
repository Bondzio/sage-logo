<p><italic>Revolution and Constitutionalism in the Ottoman Empire and Iran</italic> maintains that although the makings of modern Turkey and Iran are usually associated with Ataturk and Reza Khan, “it was the preceding revolutions that were responsible for the radical reorientation to politics, institutions, religion and nationality” (p. 1). Without the Iranian revolution of 1906 and the Young Turk revolution of 1908, “the transformations later would indeed appear to be outside history” (p. 1). Sohrabi deals with multiple questions. First, where do the Young Turk and Iranian experiences stand vis-à-vis the historiography of revolutions? Second, who were the relevant actors and what kind of revolutions did they seek? Third, how can we explain the variant outcomes in Iran and the Ottoman Empire, where revolution in the latter led to a considerably more resilient constitutionalism?</p>
<p>Sohrabi highlights that revolutions are usually associated with the unification of “the [legislative] and the executive into one” (p. 7) through sudden and violent “seizure of the executive and the overthrow of the entire structure of the old regime” (p. 9). However, “revolutions are not timeless categories with fixed definitions suitable for all eras” (p. 9) and “revolutionary models are political constructions naturalized in different historical epochs” (p. 13). Although the conventional conceptualization is built on the unique Bolshevik experience of 1917, the dominant rhetoric and theory of revolutions between the French Revolution and 1917 emphasized <italic>constitutionalism</italic>, which aimed not at unification but “redefinition of the legislative and the executive, and separation of the two” (p. 7). The Iranian and Young Turk revolutions, it follows, are best understood in the context of constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Sohrabi tackles his cases through a framework that is built on three levels of analysis: global, regional, and local. While global “master templates” refer to ideologies that are dominant at a particular historical epoch, regional factors stand in for geopolitical pressures. Local dynamics, in turn, entail the individual characteristics of a polity. As far as global and regional dimensions are concerned, the Ottoman and Iranian experiences shared a similar starting point. Both states were facing external military threats, pushing them to seek strategies for self-strengthening. Given the “global diffusion of constitutionalism” and the dominant belief that European states owed their prowess to their constitutions, “similar geopolitical challenges turned constitutionalism into hopeful doctrines of self-strengthening” in Iran and the Ottoman Empire (p. 16).</p>
<p>It was the differences at the local level in Iran and the Ottoman Empire that led to variant paths to, and outcomes of, constitutionalism. Beyond the variation with respect to ethno-religious homogeneity, the key difference involved state structures. Although the Ottoman state, by the time of the revolution, “had penetrated into the layers of the social, not on the same level as its European rivals, but certainly along the lines of a modern state,” the Iranian state was still governed through a “decentralized patrimonial tradition” (p. 24). In the Ottoman case, it was the <italic>partial</italic> rationalization of the state (and subsequent neopatrimonialism) that created incentives for the revolutionaries to intervene in state-making processes; in Iran, it was the disintegration of the central authority that motivated revolutionaries.</p>
<p>The Ottoman modernization efforts included (state-sponsored) aggressive educational reforms, which led to the emergence of an urban middle class that eventually penetrated into the bureaucracy and military by the late 19th century. This new class, which found its voice with the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), perceived the quasi-patrimonial structure of the state as the biggest roadblock in front of their upward mobility. Constitutionalism, by further rationalizing the state, could remove the barriers to merit-based advancement. In such a setting, global, regional, and local factors simultaneously pointed toward the possibility of radical political transformation. Acting as the agent of change and benefiting from its superior organizational network, the CUP eventually orchestrated the constitutionalist revolution of 1908 in the wake of similar developments in Russia (1905) and Iran (1906).</p>
<p>The Iranian revolution, by contrast, was “the product of a fateful contingency” (p. 338). Although the global and regional dynamics hinted constitutionalism, the local factors were not favorable. Different from the Ottomans, the Iranian state had not initiated educational reforms, ruling out the emergence of a large and cohesive urban middle class. The intelligentsia remained small in size and carried marginal weight in politics and bureaucracy. Furthermore, the clerics, in the absence of a strong state, remained as important political actors. The “chance factor” worked for the revolutionaries when the clerics, who were traditionally the leading actors in popular uprisings, moved their protest outside Tehran in December 1905 during a crisis, “creating an opportunity for the intelligentsia to rise to . . . leadership and capture the center stage” (p. 338), forcing the shah into radical constitutional reforms as of early 1906.</p>
<p>The different local exigencies in Iran and the Ottoman Empire eventually led to variant constitutional outcomes. The CUP-backed constitutionalism proved itself to be resilient even in the face of counterrevolution in 1909, which was instantly crushed by the CUP. The revolutionaries in Iran were in a far more precarious position. The “minimally reformed, decentralized, patrimonial state structure” rendered the consolidation of constitutionalism in Iran a “daunting” task (p. 336). Furthermore, revolutionaries had been compelled to make an uneasy alliance with the clerics. Once the clerics comprehended the nature and extent of the radical changes that revolutionaries had been devising, the alliance fell apart, prompting the way for counterrevolution. The constitutionalists emerged victorious in the end, but theirs was a Pyrrhic victory; the confrontation lasted for months, and the outcome involved numerous and extensive compromises to the “old regime” that in turn “diluted” the constitution.</p>
<p>Although the revolutionaries in both states initially aimed to separate the executive and the legislature, in the face of strong opposition they found themselves compelled to mobilize “organizations that resorted to extra-legal or illegal methods and means” (p. 427). Such measures implied the emergence of crucial ideological contradictions within the constitutional movement and, when combined with the ever-increasing geopolitical challenges, prompted the erosion of constitutionalism. Regardless, the revolutionary episodes, even though they were short-lived, had significant and variant impacts on the state-building programs in both modern Turkey and Iran, paving the way for a more resilient constitutionalist tradition in the former.</p>
<p>To sustain the arguments summarized above, Sohrabi draws on detailed historical narratives that are built on an excellent command of not only the relevant literature in social sciences and secondary sources but also primary sources that range from official state documents to classical texts, from official state documents to classical texts, from novels to newspapers of the day. It is difficult to find fault with the ways in which Sohrabi goes to lengths to provide a rich narrative. However, the same richness in details and nuances, at times, makes it difficult for the reader to evaluate the relationship between the author’s general claims and the dense narrative. Consequently, the book performs better as an exploration of these two revolutions than as an explanation of their origins and consequences. Although this is not necessarily an essential problems for Sohrabi, who suggests that “the fundamental indeterminacy of agency and contingency make revolutions unpredictable” (p. 29), it also points toward the difficulty of “recognizing the shortcomings of [the social sciences, history, and area studies] and then overcoming them by relying on the strengths of others,” a task that Sohrabi intends to accomplish (p. 2). While it is not fair to criticize Sohrabi for not fully accomplishing such a momentous task, it should also be noted that the book’s attempt to create a truly eclectic account sometimes leads to a narrative that brings too much to the table without providing the reader with a theoretical handle to interpret the link between the master framework and the details provided by the author.</p>
<p>Beyond concerns about eclecticism, two issues, both of which follow from the author’s exclusive emphasis on constitutionalism as the engine and the outcome of the respective revolutions, deserve attention. First, Sohrabi avoids the elephant in the room: the role of (ethnic) nationalism especially in the Ottoman case. It is almost universally acknowledged that constitutionalism and <italic>nation</italic> building went hand in hand before the Young Turk revolution as well as during CUP’s reign. Sohrabi tries to bracket this issue by claiming that CUP was in fact trying to create an “Ottoman nation” (p. 174), which, especially in the context of the early 20th century, would be an oxymoron. A second issue involves the “cultural” nature of the changes that were sought by the revolutionaries in both cases. The conventional wisdom suggests that revolutionaries in both Iran and the Ottoman Empire, despite all the “strategic” references to religion, also aimed at Westernization of culture as well as secularization of the society. Although Sohrabi occasionally seems to recognize this dimension, he never engages it. Reluctance to engage revolutionaries’ drive for nationalism and “cultural” Westernization, accordingly, weakens the core arguments of the book such omission may lead to misleading interpretations of the revolutionaries’ intentions as well as the motives of the reactionary elements that opposed constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Such criticisms should not detract from the value of the book. By forcing the readers to reevaluate their assumptions about revolutions and constitutionalism, it scrutinizes two of the most important revolutions in a region that is once again going through radical political transformation. Sohrabi, pointing toward the importance of the interaction between the global zeitgeist and local dynamics, makes a very strong case for historicizing revolutions “by considering the times—and the ideologies associated with those times—as a chief organizing principle” (p. 2). <italic>Revolution and Constitutionalism</italic> is a most <italic>timely</italic> book that can help us understand not only the historical roots of revolution in the Middle East, but also its present-day incarnations.</p>
