<abstract>
<p>Terrorist groups have exploited the internet and other information technologies to advance their strategies since the mid-1990s. Violent jihadi groups are no exception. They have located the internet at the core of their media strategies, which has given birth to a vibrant global jihadisphere: an online community of militants and sympathizers united by their common adherence to a global Salafi jihadi ideology. Not only do jihadi groups devote increasing energy to attempting to connect with global audiences, but jihadi sympathizers from all around the world are more involved than ever in widening the spread of jihadi online content through para-personal media. The expanding use of non-Arabic languages such as French, English, German, Russian and Dutch by jihadi groups and ideologues has not yet been adequately examined in the academic literature. This article represents a preliminary effort at delineating the nature of the French-speaking jihadisphere, including discussion of the major websites and forums composing it, the real and virtual links between these, and how forum users originally learned of the forums’ existence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Terrorist groups have exploited the internet and other information technologies to advance their strategies since the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635211434366">Conway, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1750635211434366">Weimann, 2006</xref>). Radical Islamist militants and jihadi groups are no exception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750635211434366">1</xref></sup> Over the last decade, we have seen the emergence of an incredible number of websites, blogs, forums and message boards openly advocating violent jihad and terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635211434366">Brachman, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750635211434366">2009</xref>). The rise of these numerous online jihadi media has given birth to a vibrant ‘jihadisphere’: an online community of militants and sympathizers united by their common adherence to a global Salafi jihadi ideology; a virtual space where one can easily share thoughts and ideas and thus an important channel for jihadi proselytization and violent radicalization.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, the overwhelming majority of jihadi websites were published in Arabic alone and were thus inaccessible to a large proportion of internet users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635211434366">Awan, 2007</xref>). However, as jihadi organizations began to feel themselves becoming marginalized among their traditional audiences, they were keen to utilize new media to reach wider, more Westernized and younger audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750635211434366">Moss and Mekhennet, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750635211434366">Magnus Ranstorp (2007</xref>: 31) described this ‘virtual migration’ as opening up ‘infinite and powerful avenues to project the Salafist jihadi narrative’. By now, many jihadi organizations have recognized the utility of providing jihadi propaganda in multiple languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750635211434366">Lia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1750635211434366">Torres Soriano, 2007</xref>). There have been numerous clear attempts by radical jihadi leaders and ideologues to disseminate messages directly aimed at Western youth, including Anwar al-Awlaki’s popular English-language sermons, which are widely available online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750635211434366">Heffelfinger, 2010</xref>). Not only do contemporary violent jihadis devote large amounts of energy to connecting with a global audience, but jihadi sympathizers from all around the world are more involved than ever in the spread of jihadi materials through para-personal media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750635211434366">Mascini, 2006</xref>). This trend is exemplified by the increasing number of translated documents circulating through the online jihadisphere, as well as the multiplication of jihadi websites specifically addressing non-Arabic speaking internet users.</p>
<p>The expanding use of non-Arabic languages such as French, English, German, Russian, and Dutch by jihadi groups and ideologues has not been adequately examined to date. This article is a preliminary effort to understand the nature of the French-speaking jihadisphere. Section one of this article provides a brief history of attempts to make jihadi materials available online for French-speaking internet users. The second section investigates the evidence for an already-existing French-language jihadisphere by clarifying the evidence of a burgeoning network of jihadi websites, blogs and forums, actively promoting a jihadi discourse in French. Methodologically, this section is based on network analysis using URL links as ties of affinity, paths of communication, and potential avenues for propaganda dissemination. The final section of the article comprises a case study of the most active French-speaking jihadi forum: Ansar al-Haqq.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750635211434366">2</xref></sup> The analysis contained herein underlines the necessity for more careful consideration of the hypothesis that a double socialization process is becoming apparent, with radicalization taking place both in online extremist forums and within pre-existing, offline, Salafi jihadi communities. The article thus represents an attempt not only to draw attention to the current growth of non-Arabic jihadi websites as an expanding arena for violent radical proselytization, but also to recast the debate about online versus offline radicalization as less distinct than sometimes portrayed.</p>

<title>A brief history of French-language online jihadism</title>
<sec id="section3-1750635211434366">
<title>The initiators: Ansaar.info and Minbar-Sos forums</title>
<p>An originator of the French-speaking jihadisphere, along with the conspiracy website La Voix des Opprimés,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750635211434366">3</xref></sup> Ansaar.info<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750635211434366">4</xref></sup> first appeared in February 2004. It can be considered one of the first key attempts at making available a large amount of translated jihadi material to French-speaking audiences. Among many examples is the early French translation of the classical jihadi text ‘Sisters’ role in jihad’, a propaganda document initially published by Chechen militants that discusses the legitimacy of women fighting in jihad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750635211434366">Cook, 2005</xref>). Although precise details are not available, it is known that Ansaar.info was a static website featuring several translated jihadi documents<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750635211434366">5</xref></sup> and a simple message board supervised by an administrator using the pseudonym ‘Abou Aymane’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1750635211434366">Terrorisme.net, 2004</xref>). Ansaar.info’s slogan was explicit: ‘Jihad and the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogue’, a quotation borrowed from Abdullah Azzam’s most famous book, <italic>Join the Caravan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635211434366">1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Following Ansaar’s precipitous shutdown in September 2004, another French-language jihadi website appeared to take its place: Minbar-Sos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750635211434366">6</xref></sup> Established by Moez Garsallaoui, this forum was run by his wife Malika El Aroud, better known by her username ‘Oum Obeyda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750635211434366">Sciolino and Mekhennet, 2008</xref>). At that time, Garsallaoui was already a well-known jihadi militant who, between June and December 2004, established at least three other radical Islamist websites hosted in Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750635211434366">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635211434366">Cour de droit pénal du Tribunal Fédéral, 2007</xref>). Initially established to centralize fundraising for Muslim detainees and their families around the world, Minbar-Sos gradually became an online platform for inflammatory postings and exchanges of extremist material among a small but flourishing number of French-speaking jihadi sympathizers. Shortly after the temporary closure of the original forum in February 2005, Malika El Aroud was able to reactivate the site using a new address,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1750635211434366">8</xref></sup> employing a server based in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635211434366">Cour de droit pénal du Tribunal Fédéral, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Following their arrest in Switzerland in February 2005, El Aroud and Garsallaoui were initially expelled to Belgium before being sentenced in June 2007 by the Swiss Federal Criminal Court for ‘supporting a criminal organization and complicity in portrayal of violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635211434366">Anon., 2007</xref>). Swiss court documents provide a description of the various jihadi websites run by Malika El Aroud:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These websites included in the discussion forum threads: messages of hostage-taking, attacks and threats similar to the claim by the ‘Al-Islambouli Brigades – al-Qaeda network’ of the attack against Pakistan’s Finance Minister … The websites also provided texts and documents containing jihadi propaganda and allowed, through hypertext links, access to several videos, made by supporters of radical Islamism, inciting violence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635211434366">Cour de droit pénal du Tribunal Fédéral, 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For many observers, Minbar-Sos had become as much a personal platform for Malika El Aroud to promote her individual struggle, her radical views, and her book—<italic>Soldiers of Light</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750635211434366">2004</xref>)—as a virtual platform for the dissemination of jihadi propaganda targeted at French-speaking jihadi sympathizers. For Malika El Aroud, support of the global jihadi narrative appeared to have become a lifestyle that could not be detached from her own personal story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635211434366">Bloom, 2011</xref>: 197–206).</p>
<p>Despite several prolonged disappearances, Minbar-Sos continued to operate until the arrest in December 2008 of Malika El Aroud and five men suspected by the Belgian police of belonging to a terrorist cell planning suicide attacks during a European summit in Brussels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750635211434366">Erlanger, 2008</xref>). Under Belgian law, El Aroud was initially released by the police, but then arrested again for her alleged involvement in terrorist activities and finally sentenced to eight years in prison in May 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635211434366">Anon, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750635211434366">Hammouche, 2010</xref>). It seems clear that during 2007–2008 Minbar-Sos had become more than just a discussion forum for jihadi sympathizers and had additionally begun facilitating ‘real world’ connections between militants who then travelled to Pakistani tribal areas in order to join terrorist training camps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635211434366">Cruickshank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750635211434366">Renard, 2009</xref>). The centrality of Minbar-Sos in the recruitment of jihadi volunteers during this period should not be overestimated, however. While some members of the cell might have entered into contact with Malika El Aroud directly through the Minbar-Sos forum, it appears that Moez Garsallaoui was, at the same time, actively trying to recruit young Muslims in person in the streets and mosques of Brussels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750635211434366">Renard, 2009</xref>). In this case, as in many others, the internet should be seen as a complement in the radicalization and recruitment process rather than a substitute for face-to-face interactions. After five years of irregular online activity, Minbar-Sos went offline in early 2009 and has not reappeared.</p>

<p>Closely associated with Ansaar.info and Minbar-Sos, another French-language jihadi forum also appeared in 2004: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Assabyle.com">Assabyle.com</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1750635211434366">9</xref></sup> was renamed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1750635211434366">10</xref></sup> after a trial in Brussels in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635211434366">Anon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635211434366">Borloo, 2006</xref>). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link>, also known online as ‘al-Mourabitoune’, was a discussion forum created and run by Abdel Rahman Ayachi and Raphael Gendron, young Frenchmen settled in Belgium. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> became well-known for the translation, jointly with the Minbar-Sos forum, of many official statements emanating from jihadi media outlets such as al-Qaeda’s as-Sahab, the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF), al-Farj Media Center, etc. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> was also a regular place for online preaching by several extremist figures close to the Algerian Islamist movement, especially the Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat (GSPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635211434366">Chichizola, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While in cyberspace, Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> were characterized by ideological proximity and reciprocal hyperlinks, these forums also reflected a physical proximity between the people who were running them. Malika El Aroud and Raphael Gendron were both members of the same Salafi network established in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek around a Franco-Syrian imam and head of the Belgium Islamic Center (BIC) named Bassam Ayachi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750635211434366">Planchar, 2009</xref>). In 1999, Ayachi officiated at the wedding of Malika El Aroud to the Tunisian Abdessatar Dahmane, the fake ‘reporter’ who killed Ahmed Shah Massoud two days before September 11, 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750635211434366">Planchar, 2003</xref>). Raphael Gendron was equally close to Ayachi and his son Abdel Rahman, with whom he co-managed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link>. The November 2008 arrest in Italy of Bassam Ayachi and Gendron eventually shed light on the ramifications of this network, which was operating as much on the internet as through interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750635211434366">Crumley, 2009</xref>). Essentially, the connections between Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> were not only virtual, but mirrored ‘real life’ interactions.</p>
<p>Despite the arrests of Bassam Ayachi and Gendron, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> forum continued to operate, probably under the control of Abdel Rahman Ayachi. The site was finally shut down in mid-2009, but was replaced shortly afterwards by an English website known as Word of Islam, at the same address.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1750635211434366">11</xref></sup> Word of Islam is a huge URL directory providing links to, amongst others, some of the most active Arabic-language jihadi forums, such as Al-Faloja, As-Ansar, Al-Jahafal, Al-Qimmah, along with jihadi forums addressing English-, German- and Russian-speaking audiences.</p>

<title>The successor: Ansar al-Haqq</title>
<p>Following the closure of Minbar-Sos and then <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link>, until that time the most active jihadi websites available in French, jihadi sympathizers gradually moved to an alternative forum created in December 2006: Ansar al-Haqq.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1750635211434366">12</xref></sup> In the immediate aftermath of this move, it was not uncommon for new users of al-Haqq to mention their past membership of either one or both of Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> forums:</p>

<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750635211434366">Forum Ansar al-Haqq, 2011a</xref>)</p>
</speech>
<p>Currently hosted on a Malaysian server, the Ansar al-Haqq forum demonstrates strong support for violent jihadism as underscored by its graphic design, the type of content made available via the site, and discussion topics among its registered members. Even if the forum may at first appear Salafi-oriented, but essentially apolitical, it is unquestionably promoting a jihadi narrative as evidenced by the extensive collection of radical texts written by jihadi ideologues, such as Abdullah Azzam, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, Abu Basir al-Tartusi, Sheikh Atiyatullah and even the recently killed American-born jihadi ideologue Anwar al-Awlaki, and downloadable from Ansar al-Haqq.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1750635211434366">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, Ansar al-Haqq, like many other jihadi forums, includes a large subsection delivering news and official statements released by various terrorist groups from around the world, including al-Qaeda central, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Islamic State of Iraq, and even Chechen militants from the Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus. Frequently updated, this subsection entitled ‘Official News from the Mujahideen’ allows forum members to check and comment on the latest news distributed by miscellaneous jihadi media outlets. More recently, Ansar al-Haqq has begun publishing its own material aimed at French-speaking audiences. Beginning in mid-2008, Ansar al-Haqq has to date released four issues of its own French-language magazine, <italic>Labbayk Ya Oummati</italic>.</p>
<p>Ansar al-Haqq is a heavily trafficked, content-rich French-language site, indicating that there seems to be a clear appetite for this type of content and discussion amongst French-speaking internet users. The likelihood then is that this is not the only French-language site of its type in existence. The next section therefore seeks to uncover the larger French-speaking jihadisphere.</p>

<title>Uncovering the French-speaking jihadisphere</title>
<sec id="section7-1750635211434366">
<title>Methodology: Network analysis and snowball sampling</title>
<p>This research was driven by the question of whether there is in existence a French-speaking jihadisphere. The methodology employed to determine this fits within the general network analysis paradigm. Network analysis can be a very useful tool to employ to determine the existence of and explore online jihadi activities. Simply put, network analysis provides a method for collecting data about a set of nodes (i.e., webpages, forums, blogs) and to examine ties that link one node to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750635211434366">Marin and Wellman, 2010</xref>). In doing so, it allows the researcher to gather information that will, for example, allow him or her to evaluate the scale of an entire network. Several network research designs have been developed in the past few years, but not all of them can be applied in order to explore the scope of the contemporary French-speaking jihadisphere.</p>
<p>On one side are whole-network methods. These approaches yield the maximum information, but they can also be very costly, difficult to execute, and hard to generalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750635211434366">Hanneman and Riddle, 2005</xref>). Whole-networks are traditionally used to describe the relationships within a clearly demarcated group of networked objects. Usually, within a whole-network analysis, the researcher poses questions about the dynamics of the overall group structure, the particular location of some network members, or the importance of preeminent nodes in relation to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750635211434366">Carrington et al., 2005</xref>). Even if whole-network methods have numerous advantages, deciding on the set of objects or actors to be included within the sampled network can be quite complicated, especially in the case of jihadi websites that vacillate between active and inactive states, thus making them difficult to follow and capture.</p>
<p>On the other side are partial-network methods that resemble some of the conventional methods used in the social sciences, which are essentially based on the application of snowball sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750635211434366">Goodman, 1961</xref>). One of the most straightforward partial-network methods employed for website analysis is link analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1750635211434366">Thelwall, 2004</xref>). It consists of tracking online connections across websites via hyperlinks (URLs). The data collection can start with a single webpage (the focal website) and the links contained therein, then follow and collect all the pages linked from these, and so on.</p>
<p>Data aggregation for the research presented herein began with a focal website: the Ansar al-Haqq forum. All links from this site were identified, and each ‘new’ website was searched for all URLs linking to other jihadi websites, and so on until all ‘new’ links identified were either already recorded or were irrelevant to the research. In this study, the snowball sampling was achieved by using URL extracting software called ‘Web Data Extractor’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1750635211434366">14</xref></sup> To precisely define the borders of the data corpus, it was decided to apply two main criteria for selecting which websites should be included or, alternatively, excluded. The first criterion was obviously language, thus all the websites identified should be wholly or mainly in French. The second criterion was the extremist character of the website content: only websites displaying a clear support for terrorist violence, violent jihadism and/or jihadi terrorist groups were included in the data set. Islamist, including Salafi, websites that did not contain any violent radical content were systematically excluded from the sample analyzed in the following sections. The purpose of this was to compile all links listed on French-language jihadi websites as well as those cited in forum threads, subsections and postings in order to build-up as comprehensive a picture as possible of the French-speaking jihadisphere.</p>

<p>The initial URL extraction from the Ansar al-Haqq forum led to the collection of 48 new links. After manual verification, only 10 websites matched the selection criteria detailed above. Accordingly, all other webpages were excluded from the next step of the sampling process, which required the identification of all relevant links from these 10 jihadi websites, and so on until a final dataset consisting of 64 URLs was compiled. Having identified, analyzed, and classified these 64 jihadi websites, it is possible to make a preliminary assessment of the French-speaking jihadisphere.</p>
<p>The network analysis revealed the existence of numerous webpages actively sustaining jihadi discourse and promoting extremist material amongst French-speaking audiences. There is an active French-language jihadisphere in existence, in other words. The latter appears relatively small, however, and composed mainly of static websites and blogs (approx. 91%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1750635211434366">15</xref></sup> Although they accounted for only 9 percent of all the URLs aggregated, discussion forums and message boards are nevertheless the preferred platform for the dissemination of French-language jihadi propaganda. In fact, a cross-sectional analysis suggests that the forums offer a much wider choice of translated material, both in terms of quantity and diversity, than other platforms. Forums are also much quicker than the latter to publish statements issued by terrorist leaders and organizations; only messages coming from the most important jihadist leaders, such as the late Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, gain the attention of the administrators of traditional websites. A majority of the static jihadi websites/blogs analyzed also contained very similar collections of French translations of ‘classic’ texts written by celebrity extremist preachers such as Abdullah Azzam, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, and Anwar al-Awlaki. Discussion forums, on the other hand, offer much greater diversity of access to violent radical literature since these websites not only make available classical jihadi texts, but also eagerly publicize original French-language analyses such as ‘Salafiyya jihadiyya, la France, Nous et les autres’ (Salafiyya jihadiyya, France, We and the others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635211434366">Abou Ishaq Saif Al Masoul, 2007</xref>). So even if the French-speaking jihadisphere appears mainly composed of static websites and blogs, the heart of its activity clearly revolves around discussion forums and message boards.</p>
<p>While six French-language jihadi forums were identified in the URL collection, three are currently closed: Minbar-Sos, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link>, and Le Sentier des Itinérants. Preliminary findings therefore show that the French-speaking jihadisphere coalesces around just three currently active forums: Ansar al-Haqq, Le Jardin des Croyantes, and Nidâ<sup>2</sup> At-Tawhîd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1750635211434366">Figure 1</xref>). This is a relatively small-scale network, even if there are clearly overlapping activities and strong URL connections amongst these forums.</p>

<title>Ansar al-Haqq: Case study of a French-speaking jihadi forum</title>
<p>To provide a richer understanding of the French-speaking jihadisphere, this section contains a more detailed analysis of a particular French-language jihadi website. The Ansar al-Haqq forum was chosen for this case study primarily because of its centrality within the French-speaking jihadisphere. As mentioned previously, the closure of the Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> forums greatly helped to raise al-Haqq’s reputation as a crucial alternative for many French-speaking jihadi sympathizers. Compared to the other French-language jihadi forums identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1750635211434366">Figure 1</xref>, Ansar al-Haqq is presently the most active message board, both in terms of registered users and numbers of postings. Based on long-term observation, conducted between October 2009 and March 2011, it appears that Ansar al-Haqq gets an average of 230–250 unique visitors per day. Although relatively low in contrast to Arabic jihadi forums, these numbers still indicate the attractiveness of Ansar al-Haqq for a small community of committed French jihadi sympathizers who regularly visit the website either to participate in discussions with other users or simply to read the latest jihadi material available online.</p>
<sec id="section10-1750635211434366">
<title>The over-involvement of a small group</title>
<p>The level of online involvement of Ansar al-Haqq’s 2517 registered users is neither consistent nor homogeneous. Indeed, the audience of the forum is clearly divided between a huge majority of passive users and a small minority of active members who are nevertheless extremely effective in maintaining the continuous flow of discussions and the dissemination of jihadi content. Between its creation in December 2006 and March 2011, 48,073 messages were posted on the message board, an average of 19 messages per user. This very low average figure is in contrast to the very heavy involvement of a small yet zealous cluster of 130–140 French-speaking jihadi sympathizers who compose the majority of posters. In fact, the 10 most active forum users have contributed more than 16 percent of all Ansar al-Haqq’s published postings during the same period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1750635211434366">Table 1</xref>). In this respect then, jihadi forums are no different from ‘normal’ message boards.</p>

<p>Many academic studies have already shown that the internet clearly fosters the over-involvement of a small number of active users who contribute relentlessly to the life of cyber-communities, but who coexist with much greater numbers of passive consumers of the content and discussion on the same sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750635211434366">Leimeister and Krcmar, 2005</xref>: 140–141; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750635211434366">Silverstone, 2005</xref>: 66–70). As can be seen above, the data gathered perfectly illustrate this extreme concentration of online activities among few users deeply embedded in the everyday life of Ansar al-Haqq. A similar tendency was observed in the forum sub-section ‘Official News from the Mujahideen’, where no more than 20 registered users are eagerly pursuing the translation and editing of official statements released by jihadi media outlets from around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this over-involvement of a small cluster of online sympathizers seems to be a recurring phenomenon within virtual jihadi communities as previously remarked upon by Akil N Awan. His (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635211434366">2007</xref>: 78) examination of the English-language forum <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Mujahedon.net">Mujahedon.net</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1750635211434366">16</xref></sup> led him to conclude that ‘the vast majority of messages posted on the forum originated with a very small core group of active users: 99% were passive or casual users’, a proportion quite similar to that observed in the case of the Ansar al-Haqq forum.</p>

<title>Women’s mobilization in the French-speaking jihadisphere</title>
<p>The present research determined, on the basis of publicly accessible data, that the Ansar al-Haqq forum, in March 2011, was rallying a total of 2517 users, of which 26.6 percent were registered as women, 61 percent as men, and 12.4 percent did not specify their gender. Certainly, some user profiles might contain spoof information, however it is strongly believed that these statistics fairly accurately depict the demographic reality of Ansar al-Haqq users. For many, the surprising thing with respect to these figures may be the relatively high percentage of women present on the Ansar al-Haqq forum. Three explanations may be advanced to explain this phenomenon: first, the symbolic influence of ‘Oum Obeyda’ (aka Malika El Aroud) should not be underestimated. Aroud was a strong role model for women’s mobilization not just within the French-speaking jihadisphere, but the global online movement. Both the American Colleen R LaRose (aka ‘JihadJane’) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750635211434366">Conway and McInerney, 2012</xref>) and the Senegal-based Islamist Barbara Aisha Farina<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1750635211434366">17</xref></sup> created user profiles on the Ansar al-Haqq forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1750635211434366">Urbina, 2010</xref>), for example.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1750635211434366">18</xref></sup> Second, several women—particularly a forum member using the pseudonym ‘Oum Majda’—hold influential positions as forum administrators on al-Haqq thus potentially attracting other female militants who might originally have been ambivalent about their involvement in such radical discussion forums. Finally, the close virtual connections between the Ansar al-Haqq forum and another French-speaking Salafi-jihadi forum known as Le Jardin des Croyantes, whose access is exclusive to women, may have helped to foster the circulation of female users between the two websites. The significant number of females among Ansar al-Haqq users adds credence to the argument that the internet has now become an important space of engagement for female supporters of the jihadi narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635211434366">Bloom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750635211434366">Mostarom and Azalin, 2010</xref>). In the last two years, jihadi forums have been increasingly framed as legitimate platforms for female jihadi engagement. Consequently, material encouraging women to take a more active role in supporting a violent radical agenda has been widely distributed, translated and circulated. The latest example of this trend is the release of <italic>al-Shamikha</italic> (i.e. ‘Majestic’) magazine by al Fajr Media Center in March 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750635211434366">Cavendish, 2011</xref>). In the context of the French-speaking jihadisphere, several texts currently accessible via the Ansar al-Haqq forum similarly endorse this discourse of female mobilization in support of the jihadi cause.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1750635211434366">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>The constitution of an online jihadi community: How did users come to join the Ansar al-Haqq forum?</title>
<p>This sub-section examines a particular point of interest: the constitution dynamics of the Ansar al-Haqq forum understood as a virtual jihadi community. It attempts to identify key bridges for accessing jihadi websites by mapping the trajectory of Ansar al-Haqq users to the site. Indeed, the most interesting feature of the analysis of this message board was undeniably the ability to identify how its members originally became aware of its existence. How, it was wondered, did people initially come to join an online community such as Ansar al-Haqq that openly supports a violent radical agenda? What were the online and/or offline bridges that led them to access Ansar al-Haqq in the first instance?</p>
<p>Based on freely accessible data collected from each user’s profile page, the author determined a series of key channels through which users eventually came to visit the Ansar al-Haqq forum. Indeed, when registering to gain access to the message board, each new member is required to provide answers to a series of questions, including ‘How did you get to know about the forum?’ After extracting individual responses from all members’ profile pages, it was decided to classify these into five different categories:</p>
<list id="list2-1750635211434366" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Online bridges/internet</bold>: when registered users indicated that they arrived at the Ansar al-Haqq forum through following hyperlinks or references or suggestions displayed on websites, discussion forums, video-sharing portals (e.g. YouTube, Dailymotion, Google Videos, Metacafe) or social network platforms (e.g. Facebook).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Real life social bonds</bold>: when registered users indicated that they came to know about the Ansar al-Haqq forum via friends or personal acquaintances.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Outreach</bold>: when registered users indicated they first learned of the Ansar al-Haqq forum via emails sent directly by forum administrators.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Random link exploring</bold>: when registered users indicated they stumbled across the Ansar al-Haqq forum when surfing the internet.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Unknown</bold>: when members of the forum did not clearly indicate how they originally came to visit the Ansar al-Haqq forum.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The data show that a majority of Ansar al-Haqq’s registered users became aware of its existence through two major channels: online bridges and real life social bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1750635211434366">Figure 2</xref>). In answer to the question ‘How did you get to know about the forum?’, 51 percent of Ansar al-Haqq members declared that they initially accessed the website via online bridges.</p>

<p>This is not greatly surprising given that the internet has a network-based architecture with the central purpose of linking disparate nodes; its design therefore facilitates easy hyperlink connectivity. Accordingly, these findings seem to reinforce the argument in favor of substantial numbers of ‘disconnected’ jihadi sympathizers joining extremist-oriented cyber-communities <italic>via</italic> online bridges.</p>
<p>A more detailed analysis of the data can help to better understand the role of online bridges (i.e. other jihadi websites, chat-rooms, video-sharing portals and social network platforms) in users’ decisions to access Ansar al-Haqq in the first place. By consulting disaggregated data, it was learned that nearly half of all those forum users who first accessed al-Haqq via online bridges indicated that this original access was via other jihadi websites and forums (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1750635211434366">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the small size of the French-speaking jihadisphere, it seems likely that the launch of a new French-language jihadi website would quickly be relayed among other jihadi websites, which can explain the increased flow of new members to the Ansar al-Haqq forum observed in the aftermath of Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link>’s closures. French-language jihadi forums are at the top of the list of those jihadi websites frequently cited by Ansar al-Haqq users as a discovery pathway, and include <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> (41%), Minbar-Sos (21%), Le Jardin des Croyantes (16%), and Nidâ<sup>2</sup> At-Tawhîd (7%). Interestingly, only a few users mentioned well-known Arabic-speaking forums, such as al-Ekhlaas (5%), as their online bridge to al-Haqq, which suggests that the French-speaking jihadisphere is very ‘French-centric’ and only loosely connected to the rest of the global jihadisphere.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1750635211434366-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Additionally, numerous Ansar al-Haqq members indicated that they connected with the forum through other platforms, such as chat-rooms (e.g. Paltalk), video-sharing portals (e.g. YouTube, Dailymotion, Google Videos, Metacafe) and, albeit less commonly, social networking sites (e.g. Facebook).</p>
<p>Paltalk is one of the most popular internet chat services. It features thousands of chat-rooms on a vast range of topics and allows its users to communicate via instant messaging, voice and video chat. Paltalk has been described by terrorism analysts as an antechamber for radicalization, fostering exchanges between jihadi sympathizers around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750635211434366">Kohlmann, 2005</xref>). In recent years, Paltalk has been used extensively by extremist preachers like Omar Bakri Mohammed, Sheikh Abdullah al-Faisal and many amateurish ‘wannabe’ jihadi ideologues such as administrators of the English-speaking website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://RevolutionMuslim.com">RevolutionMuslim.com</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1750635211434366">20</xref></sup> in their attempts to recruit new followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635211434366">Cruickshank, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750635211434366">Somaiya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1750635211434366">Zelin, 2010</xref>). While the use of Paltalk to disseminate violent extremist propaganda is nothing new, either amongst jihadis or adherents of other radical movements (i.e. violent far-right militias in the US), the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1750635211434366">Figure 3</xref> further confirm its function in sustaining online jihadism, albeit in a minor way with respect to how al-Haqq members first learned of the forum, which is not to say that it is not used more extensively by forum members in other capacities.</p>
<p>Video-sharing portals (e.g. YouTube, Dailymotion, Google Videos, Metacafe) have also emerged as new bridges to capture potential sympathizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750635211434366">Goldenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750635211434366">McGregor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750635211434366">Shane, 2011</xref>) while at the same time raising complex issues of ‘self-’ or ‘auto-radicalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635211434366">Conway and McInerney, 2008</xref>). Even if only 2 percent of Ansar al-Haqq users acknowledged video-sharing websites as playing a role in their original exposure to the forum, this figure nevertheless sheds light on the fact that these platforms are not just isolated hosts of jihadi content, but can act as bridges into the global jihadisphere. Video-sharing sites allow any internet user to become progressively more familiar with jihadi material and then navigate to dedicated jihadi websites thus opening the possibility for individuals, even those with little or no apparent prior interest in violent jihadism, to become ensnared in the global jihadisphere.</p>
<p>Finally, Facebook was only mentioned by a small minority of Ansar al-Haqq users. Even if some jihadi media groups have been active on Facebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635211434366">Al-Shishani, 2010</xref>), the social networking service does not appear to be a privileged way to connect with new followers. Several reasons may be posited for this, including that ‘administrators can easily close or remove controversial groups, intelligence agencies can see easily who accesses these groups and Facebook seems to attract a relatively liberal crowd’ (Hegghammer, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635211434366">Al-Shishani, 2010</xref>: 3–4).</p>
<p>In sum, the data presented above reflect the flourishing and multi-layered dynamics of online bridges, as well as their key role in channeling users to jihadi websites. At the same time, they also appear to have a central role in structuring the trajectory by which potential followers are gradually exposed to and familiarized with violent online jihadism. In his book <italic>Au Coeur de l’Antiterrorisme</italic> (In the Heart of Anti-Terrorism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1750635211434366">2011</xref>: 221), the French anti-terrorist judge Marc Trévidic relates a discussion between himself and a terrorist suspect that fairly depicts these trends:</p>

</speech>
<p>While these figures might suggest contradictory trends, they should be interpreted instead as two sides of the same coin. In the past decade, many studies have explored in great detail the virtual dimensions of extremist cyber-communities (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635211434366">Bowman-Grieve, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635211434366">Bowman-Grieve and Conway, 2012</xref>). Much of this research questioned whether these virtual communities could function in ways that would allow their members to match the accomplishments of offline extremist groups. Such dichotomization is, however, problematic because it minimizes the ‘real world’ ramifications of virtual communities while at the same time potentially overestimating the levels of social interaction taking place in cyberspace.</p>
<p>There are, without doubt, some limitations to this single case study. Nevertheless, collected responses from Ansar al-Haqq users’ profiles certainly demonstrate that a large number of them gained knowledge about the forum via real-life social bonds, that is to say through personal acquaintances who already knew of the existence of the site. These figures should push scholars to consider more seriously the argument for dual violent radical socialization processes taking place simultaneously across online extremist forums and pre-existing offline social networks. Indeed, the socialization of jihadi sympathizers does not necessarily have to be compartmentalized into online interactions on the one hand and offline social ties on the other. If online communication increases the frequency of weak ties and indirectly raises the ‘Strength of Weak Ties’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750635211434366">Kennedy and Weimann, 2011</xref>), it seems quite dangerous from an analytical standpoint to make a clear distinction between online and offline audiences, especially when it comes to understanding the effects of individual exposure to radical discourse and extremist material. Interconnection dynamics between radical cyber-communities and pre-existing ‘real life’ Salafi-jihadi networks should be recast into a less binary opposition. The decision to register on jihadi websites might often reflect the identification of individuals with radical elements already circulating around them in their close personal social network. As stated by Marc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750635211434366">Sageman (2008</xref>: 121): ‘The overall situation is therefore more complicated than just pure online or offline networks. They are networks within networks, offline and online links, which cross geography and time.’</p>
<p>A detailed look at the history of the French-speaking jihadisphere should convince us that ‘real life’ interactions between members of radical cyber-communities are neither exceptional nor inconsequential. Many of these extremist virtual environments are influenced and shaped by real world factors. The examples of Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link> forums, discussed earlier, are instructive. The administrators of these—Malika El Aroud, Raphael Gendron, Abdel Rahman Ayachi, and Bassam Ayachi—knew each other in ‘real life’ for many years and combined face-to-face socialization within a small-scale radical network in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek with an extensive range of online interactions. During all this period they appeared to be largely mirroring in cyberspace their preexisting ‘real life’ community in a small Belgian town. Moreover, the dual online–offline life of this Salafi-jihadi network still endures today, the arrest and imprisonment of its main protagonists notwithstanding. Sentenced to eight years in prison in May 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750635211434366">Hammouche, 2010</xref>), Malika El Aroud continues to appeal as a role model for many members of the Ansar al-Haqq community with a member using the pseudonym ‘Oum Usama’ actively posting the content of what she claims are letters written by El Aroud in her cell to the forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750635211434366">Forum Ansar al-Haqq, 2011d</xref>). El Aroud thus continues to pursue the extended conversation with online sympathizers that she inaugurated with the creation of Minbar-Sos.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>‘Although jihadism has an enormous influence on more radical segments of Muslim populations, its influence has been very limited on the vast majority of Muslims who have seen al-Qaeda as a dangerous threat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1750635211434366">Torres Soriano, 2007</xref>: 2) This ineffectiveness has prompted jihadi organizations to devote increasing attention to Western audiences, resulting in the formation of a multilingual jihadisphere. At the same time, jihadi sympathizers have become more involved than ever in widening the spread of online jihadi content to non-Arabic-speaking audiences. The internet is at the core of these changes.</p>
<p>The main findings of this study support the existence of a small yet active French-speaking jihadisphere. Initiated by Salafi-jihadi entrepreneurs (Malika El Aroud, Raphael Gendron and Abdel Rahman Ayachi), this online community has survived the disappearance of its two original websites (Minbar-Sos and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ribaat.org">Ribaat.org</ext-link>) and the shift to a new site (Ansar al-Haqq) as well as the arrest of its main initiators. Despite its very limited size, the contemporary French-language jihadisphere clearly demonstrates that the appeal of violent jihadism to French-speaking sympathizers remains.This article also represents a first step in demonstrating how an online jihadi community such as the Ansar al-Haqq forum can represent an extension of preexisting social ties between people already embedded in ‘real life’ radical networks. More often than we assume, perhaps, online communities appear to recreate social bonds that already exist in the ‘real world’. A story found on the Ansar al-Haqq forum perfectly illustrates this argument. Arrested by the French police in April 2010, four members of Ansar al-Haqq were indicted for incitement to terrorist violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635211434366">Anon, 2010a</xref>). Based on the following testimony from the only individual freed after this arrest (who used the pseudonym Abu Houdaïfa), it appears that the four terrorist suspects and Ansar al-Haqq members were not complete strangers to each other:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Abu Houdaïfa</bold></p>
<p>I hope you are well, I was one of five brothers arrested, I was released around 8pm last night after about four days in custody. I am the first of five to be released, I do not know what happened to the other brothers, but I think that for them the situation may be more complex than for me. I know three brothers among the four arrested, the fourth I didn’t know and I could not manage to see him […] May Allah preserve them where they are and their family, I know that some of them just became fathers for the first time and some others will soon become fathers. Afidhakoum ALLAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750635211434366">Forum Ansar al-Haqq, 2011e</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the complex intricacies of the relationship(s) between terrorism and new media continue to puzzle scholars, we should never lose sight of the potentially close links between virtual communities and pre-existing extremist networks. All of them, ‘online’ as well as ‘real’ communities, have their own characteristics and social dynamics, which can often make them appear largely independent of each other, but this is not always the case. Future research on violent radicalization and terrorism should therefore pay closer attention to relational socialization dynamics that can exist between online forums and pre-existing ‘real world’ extremist networks.</p>
