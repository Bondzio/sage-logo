<p>The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent ‘war on terror’ have served to animate debates surrounding conventional understandings of media and terrorism and the relationship between these two communicative phenomena. Having already been the subject of an extensive body of cross-disciplinary research, one might question the value of yet another intervention into this area. <italic>Media and Terrorism: Global Perspectives</italic> is, however, a welcome addition to the existing literature, with editors Des Freedman and Daya Kishan Thussu exploring those areas which have been either largely unnoticed or completely left out of previous debates.</p>
<p>Engaging with the topic in a detailed yet accessible manner, the volume is distinguished from other works in this area by the sheer range of perspectives offered. It incorporates contributions from a global cast of academics, activists and journalists, and reflects debates within critical theory, terrorism studies and media and political communication. In addition to this, rather than discussing the relationship between vaguely defined, monolithic notions of ‘terrorism’ and ‘the media’, Freedman and Thussu have actively encouraged contributions from commentators who focus their analysis on a wide range of terrorisms and media, breaking away from previously limited conceptions of these two phenomena. As stated in the introduction, <italic>Media and Terrorism</italic> aims at providing<disp-quote>
<p>a broader perspective on the relationship between media and terrorism: to recognize and discuss the ways in which media technologies and practices have helped to transform our understanding of terrorism (as well as the manner in which it operates), but also to highlight the full range of contextual factors that shape media’s relationship to terrorism. (p.16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The book is divided into four key parts, each of which aims to critically explore the most salient issues surrounding the mediation of terrorism and political violence. Part 1 provides a number of contexts for studying the relationship between media and terrorism. The focus here is less on providing a historical background to the ‘war on terror’ and more on mapping out the various media contexts through which it has been played out. David Miller and Rizwaan Sabir, in particular, highlight the crucial role propaganda has served to both advance and enact political, security and military agendas throughout this ‘war’.</p>
<p>Part 2 engages with ‘Global Representations of Terrorism’, focusing on the way in which various forms of popular media, such as the video gaming industry and mainstream Hollywood cinema, have functioned to normalize state-led practices and demonize those who are at the receiving end of such actions. Here, and in contrast to other studies on media representations of terrorism, Freedman and Thussu have invited contributions from scholars who have sought to broaden the representation of ‘terrorism’ to take into account, amongst other things, the states’ cultural and military apparatus.</p>
<p>Part 3, ‘Terrorism on the Home Front’, again seeks to step outside of these dominant discourses, moving away from the Anglo-American framework of interpretation, to investigate terrorism-related activities in other parts of the globe. In a particularly noteworthy example, Thussu describes how, despite a long history of regional conflicts in Kashmir, Nepal and West Bengal, news coverage of terrorism-related events in India has been largely influenced by the US-defined ‘global war on terror’.</p>
<p>Finally, Part 4 addresses the relationship between ‘Journalists and the “War on Terror”’, demonstrating how journalists often find themselves trapped between a moral responsibility to report the ‘truth’ and a commercial commitment to provide ‘good copy’. Importantly, this section includes contributions from Dahr Jamail and Danny Schechter, two working journalists who provide authentic, jargon-free assessments of the complicity between mainstream news media and the official accounts offered by political and military elites. Despite being limited to the accounts of two journalists, it is here that <italic>Media and Terrorism</italic> differs from other works in this area, providing readers with an insider perspective on the apparently systematic management of mainstream news media accounts throughout the war on terror.</p>
<p>As is often the case with edited volumes of this nature, however, the critical approach adopted by many of its featured contributors all too often highlights the negative role media serve in representing, contextualizing, communicating and stabilizing forms of terrorism for audiences and spectators. Though this is most often the framework through which thinly-defined notions of terrorism are presented, it is not always such a monolithic process. There have been numerous instances throughout the ‘war on terror’ where the media, in its various manifestations, have actively sought to unseat dominant representations of terrorism and deconstruct the identities of those regarded as ‘terrorists’ – something that has served to broaden audience understanding of who the terrorists are and what they want.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742766512463043">1</xref></sup> While Freedman and Thussu do indeed highlight the way in which ‘media are not simply external actors passively bringing the news of terrorist incidents to global audiences’ (p.10), this is a notion that is not always shared by their contributors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this edited volume is a welcome addition to the existing literature in this field, demonstrating the extent to which debates surrounding media and terrorism have moved away from a limited concern with ‘the oxygen of publicity’ and are now encouraging new spaces for critical engagement. <italic>Media and Terrorism</italic> is a timely and accessible intervention and will be of much value to students and media practitioners alike.</p>
