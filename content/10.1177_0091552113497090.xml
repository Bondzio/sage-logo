<abstract>
<p>While there has been increased scholarship in recent years on diversity in higher education, most of this research has failed to include 2-year institutions in its analyses. This study examined whether the racial composition of the community college student body is correlated with an institution’s normative climate toward three diversity outcomes: student conversations with racially different peers, student conversations with peers holding different beliefs, and student understanding of racially different others. The results indicate that having a more diverse student body had a positive, statistically significant relationship with each outcome. This finding suggests that community colleges, like 4-year institutions, can be positively influenced by enrolling a more racially heterogeneous student body.</p>

<body>
<p>As the United States becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, institutions of higher education are being called on to prepare students to live and work in an increasingly multicultural society. Educational organizations, college and university administrators, elected officials, and the U.S. Supreme Court have all charged postsecondary institutions with a key task: making the preparation of students to function in a diverse society a core institutional mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552113497090">Bowen &amp; Bok, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552113497090">Pike &amp; Kuh, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, many have argued that colleges and universities must provide students the opportunity to engage with diverse others by enrolling a racially heterogeneous student body. The belief is that the enrollment of a more diverse student body creates a peer-normative environment in which cross-racial and cross-cultural interactions among students are more common. These interactions with diverse others are believed to contribute to students’ intellectual and personal development as well as their understanding of individuals from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, there has been increasing empirical support for this argument, often referred to as the <italic>diversity rationale</italic>. Several studies have found that student body racial diversity, or <italic>structural racial diversity</italic>, helps an institution create a normative environment in which student interactions with diverse others occur more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552113497090">Chang, Astin, &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552113497090">Hurtado, Dey, Gurin, &amp; Gurin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552113497090">Hurtado &amp; Wathington Cade, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552113497090">Pike &amp; Kuh, 2006</xref>). Student interaction and engagement with diversity have in turn been found to be positively correlated with a range of desirable educational outcomes, including higher levels of student cross-cultural competence, increased academic engagement, and greater gains in critical and active thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552113497090">Adams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552113497090">Astin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552113497090">Milem, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of this research on diversity in higher education has been motivated by the desire to protect race-based admissions programs such as affirmative action. Therefore, research on the diversity rationale has focused almost exclusively on selective 4-year colleges and universities. Four-year institutions, however, enroll only around 57% of undergraduates in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091552113497090">“Undergraduate Enrollments,” 2010</xref>). The remaining 43% of students (around 6.9 million) attend various types of 2-year colleges. Little published research, however, has attempted to explore racial diversity at 2-year institutions. This study used data from the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to examine whether community college student body racial diversity is correlated with an institution’s normative environment toward diversity outcomes.</p>
<p>The following section outlines the motivation for this study by reviewing previous research on the impact of diversity in higher education and providing a rationale for investigating this relationship at 2-year institutions. This is followed by a detailing of the empirical questions that guided this study and the research methodology employed. The article concludes with a presentation of the study results and a discussion of the research findings.</p>
<sec id="section1-0091552113497090">
<title>Study Motivation</title>
<p>Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in the <italic>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</italic> case in 1978, a substantial body of research has accumulated examining whether ethnic and racial diversity among college students yields significant educational benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091552113497090">1</xref></sup> This research has two distinct strands. The first examines whether enrolling a more heterogeneous student body increases the likelihood that students will engage and interact with diverse others. The second focuses on whether these interactions with diverse others improve the educational experience of students.</p>
<p>A review of both strands of research reveals that community colleges have been largely excluded from analysis. Using data on over 2,000 undergraduates at a racially diverse 4-year university, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552113497090">Antonio (1998)</xref> found evidence that attending a more racially diverse institution of higher education increases the likelihood that a student’s friendship groups will be racially heterogeneous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552113497090">Chang (1999)</xref>, using Cooperative Institutional Research Program data from over 300 four-year colleges and universities, found evidence to suggest that “when there is a diverse student body, one also tends to find enhanced chances that students will socialize across racial groups and discuss racial issues” (p. 389).</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552113497090">Chang et al. (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552113497090">Pike and Kuh (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552113497090">Pike, Kuh, and Gonyea (2007)</xref> found a positive relationship between student body racial diversity and the frequency of student interactions with diverse others. Using updated Cooperative Institutional Research Program data from over 134 colleges and universities, Chang at al. found that enrolling larger proportions of students of color could increase cross-racial interactions in higher education. None of 134 institutions studied, however, were community colleges. In fact, the authors noted that 2-year institutions were dropped from their analyses. Pike and Kuh used data from over 300 institutions participating in the National Survey of Student Engagement and found that “there was a substantial positive relationship between structural diversity and informal interactional diversity” (p. 441). None of the 300 institutions used in this analysis were 2-year colleges. National Survey of Student Engagement data from 4-year colleges and universities were also used by Pike, Kuh, and Gonyea, who found that among first-year students and seniors, student body diversity was positively correlated with the frequency of diverse interactions among peers.</p>
<p>Community colleges have also been absent from research looking at the relationship between interactions with diversity and student educational outcomes. High-profile empirical studies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552113497090">Astin (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552113497090">Chang (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552113497090">Gurin (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552113497090">Hurtado (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552113497090">Nelson Laird (2005)</xref> each appear to exclude community colleges from their samples.</p>
<p>A likely explanation for this lack of focus on 2-year colleges in diversity research is the desire of scholars to provide empirical support for race-conscious admissions policies, which are employed primarily by selective 4-year institutions. Understanding the impact of diversity in higher education, however, should be broader than simply looking for evidence to support race-based admissions programs at a handful of institutions. To gain a more complete understanding of diversity and its role in postsecondary education, it is important to understand if and how diversity can be used to create enhanced learning environments for students at all levels of higher education.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The conceptual framework guiding this analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091552113497090">Figure 1</xref>. In this model, which has guided much of the research on diversity in higher education, positive educational outcomes are presumed to be affected by the amount and quality of student interactions with diverse others while in college. The amount and quality of student interactions with diverse others are proposed to be strongly correlated with various institutional characteristics, especially the overall diversity of an institution’s student body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113497090">Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, &amp; Gurin, 2002</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This contention that student body racial diversity results in more opportunities for students to engage with racially and culturally diverse others is based largely on the idea that organizational environments shape the dynamics and frequency of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552113497090">Kanter, 1977</xref>). The hypothesis is that as the relative proportion of a minority social type within an organization approaches parity with the majority social type, interactional isolation decreases, and organizational members will engage with one another more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552113497090">Hoffman, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In the higher education sector, this hypothesis has been tested only at institutions with high levels of interaction among its students. The residential 4-year colleges and universities that have typically been the subjects of research on the diversity rationale are characterized by their on-campus living facilities, large student affairs departments, and mostly full-time students. These organizational design elements mean that 4-year institutions are often successful in creating the type of environment that encourages frequent contact and interaction among students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552113497090">Kuh et al., 1991</xref>). At these types of institutions, it might be expected that higher levels of student body diversity would be positively related to the frequency of interactions among diverse peers given the high number of overall opportunities that students have to interact with one another.</p>
<p>Extrapolating the findings of this research at 4-year schools to the community college setting, however, is problematic, primarily because of the different levels of student involvement at 2-year schools as compared to 4-year schools. While many community colleges are working to increase engagement among students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552113497090">Center for Community College Student Engagement, 2012</xref>), “community college students are less engaged in college than are students at four-year institutions, a phenomenon certainly related to the nonresidential nature of most community colleges and the external constraints that occupy students’ time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552113497090">A. Cohen &amp; Brawer, 2008</xref>, p. 213). In addition, although almost two-thirds of beginning students at 4-year institutions live on campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552113497090">King, 2002</xref>), most community colleges do not offer on-campus student housing. While most residential colleges enroll full-time students, over 60% of community college students are enrolled part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552113497090">Bryant, 2001</xref>); around 60% work more than 20 hours per week; and over 25% work more than 35 hours per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552113497090">Evelyn, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These housing and enrollment patterns often leave community college students little opportunity for campus involvement, in comparison with that of students at 4-year colleges and universities. Therefore, while diversity at 4-year schools (where student interactions are more frequent) may lead to a normative environment with more frequent engagement among diverse peers, at 2-year schools (where student interactions occur less frequently) diversity may not have the same positive impact. In other words, the organizational environment of 2-year institutions may limit community college student engagement with diverse others, even in situations where the institution has a higher level of student body racial diversity. Exploring this hypothesis was the goal of this study. Specifically, it examines whether the first part of the conceptual model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091552113497090">Figure 1</xref> is supported among 2-year colleges.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The aforementioned research questions were each estimated using ordinary least squares regression on data from a national sample of 2-year colleges. This sample came from the CCSSE. Established in 2001, the CCSSE surveys students and faculty members nationwide in an effort to gain a better understanding of student engagement and institutional practices at 2-year institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091552113497090">2</xref></sup> In the spring of 2008, 316 two-year institutions participated in the CCSSE. Student survey responses for 17 of these institutions were not reported on the CCSSE website, and these schools were dropped from analysis. Seven additional schools were dropped due to missing Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System enrollment data, making it impossible to determine the racial composition of the school’s student body. One institution was dropped because it was located outside the United States. Finally, because this study focused on public 2-year institutions, 4 private junior colleges were dropped from analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091552113497090">3</xref></sup> The remaining 287 community colleges served as the sample used for this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0091552113497090">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As part of the 2008 survey, students at these institutions were asked three questions regarding their interactions with diverse others. The first asked, “In your experiences at this college during the current school year, about how often have you engaged in serious conversations with students of a different race or ethnicity?” Students responded on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 4 = <italic>very often</italic>). The second question asked, “In your experiences at this college during the current school year, about how often have you engaged in serious conversations with students with different religious beliefs, political opinions, or personal values?” Students responded on the same 4-point scale. The final question asked students, “How much has your experience at this college contributed to your understanding of people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds?” The response scale ranged from 1 (<italic>very little</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very much</italic>). Institutional mean scores for the questions were used as dependent variables for this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091552113497090">5</xref></sup> The mean score was computed using all students who completed the CCSSE at each sample institution. This aggregation of individual responses to the institutional level is representative of the normative environment of a college or university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552113497090">Ethington, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552113497090">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552113497090">Milem, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary independent variable of interest for this study was community college student body racial diversity among all students (full- and part-time). The operationalization of this variable was a modified version of the diversity index score used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552113497090">Chang (1999)</xref>:</p>

</p>
<p>where µ is the average of the percentages of the student enrollment for the five racial groups.</p>
<p>This index calculates an institution’s level of racial diversity based on the amount of variance in student populations across racial groups. Chang’s original index was based on the distribution of students across four racial/ethnic groups (Black, Asian, White, and Latino). The index used in this study adds a fifth group to the equation (American Indian/Alaskan Native), in an effort to be more inclusive of the major racial/ethnic groups reported by colleges and universities. According to this index, community colleges with similar proportions of students across the five groups (e.g., 20%, 23%, 17%, 19%, 21%) would have higher diversity scores than would institutions with less distribution across the five groups (e.g., 85%, 5%, 4%, 4%, 2%). Information on community college student enrollment was collected from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. Because the CCSSE used here was conducted in the spring of 2008, enrollment figures from the 2007-2008 academic year were used to calculate the equation.</p>
<p>One of the motivating factors for this study was the idea that organizational characteristics, which affect overall student involvement, could serve to moderate the relationship between student body racial diversity and an institution’s normative climate toward diversity outcomes. To control for this, several institutional characteristics where included in model estimation. Each characteristic has been found in previous research to affect an institution’s ability to increase student involvement and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552113497090">Kuh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552113497090">Porter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091552113497090">Schuetz, 2008</xref>). The geographic location of an institution was controlled for using dummy codes to indicate whether a community college was located in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, or West.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0091552113497090">6</xref></sup> Dummy codes were also used to control for the degree of urbanization of an institution’s geographic location (i.e., whether an institution is located in a city, suburb, town, or rural area). To control for whether a community college offered on-campus housing, dummy coding was used; colleges without on-campus housing were assigned a value of 0, while colleges with on-campus housing were assigned a value of 1.</p>
<p>The remaining control variables were continuous. To control for institutional size, the natural log of the total number of students enrolled during the 2007-2008 academic year was used. Institutional cost was controlled for using the natural log of published in-district tuition and fees for full-time students in the 2007-2008 academic year. To control for the fact that some 2-year institutions enroll higher proportions of full-time students than others, the percentage of a community college’s 2007-2008 student enrollment that was full-time was included in model estimations. Finally, faculty racial diversity was controlled for by using the equation to calculate a faculty diversity index score for each community college based on the racial composition of full- and part-time faculty members during the 2007-2008 academic year. Data for each control variable came from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.</p>
<p>The inclusion of these control variables help to ensure that the estimated relationship between student body racial diversity and the normative environment of a community college toward diversity is not contaminated by omitted variable bias. While this is by no means an exhaustive list of factors that could contaminate the relationships studied here, it is believed that the most salient measurable institutional characteristics are controlled for that could be correlated with both community college student body racial diversity and each of the three outcome variables studied.</p>

<p>On-campus housing was the one area where there was some difference between the larger population of community colleges and the sample used in this study. Around 27% of community colleges offer some form of on-campus housing to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552113497090">American Association of Community Colleges, 2011</xref>). Among the institutions in this study, however, only 19.16% offered on-campus housing.</p>
<p>Other interesting notes from the descriptive findings of this study relate to community college racial diversity and student enrollment. In comparing student and faculty diversity index scores among the institutions, it appears that on average there was more racial diversity among community college students (<italic>M</italic> = 71.21) than among community college faculty members (<italic>M</italic> = 66.55). A <italic>t</italic> test revealed that these mean diversity index scores are significantly different, <italic>t</italic>(286) = 14.80, <italic>p</italic> = .000. This finding is likely a symptom of the underrepresentation of minorities among community college faculty members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552113497090">Kirkpatrick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552113497090">Perna, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Institutional enrollment numbers indicate wide variation in the size of the community colleges studied here. Average student body enrollment was 6,189 students, with a standard deviation of 6,107. This large standard deviation indicates the considerable variety of community colleges, large and small, captured in this data set.</p>

<p>In examining the magnitude of this coefficient, it was found that student body racial diversity had a strong statistical relationship with the normative environment of a community college toward student conversations with racially/ethnically diverse others. Cohen’s <italic>f</italic> <sup>2</sup> effect size for student body racial diversity in the model was .684. Based on the metric established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552113497090">J. Cohen (1988)</xref> where <italic>f</italic> <sup>2</sup> effect sizes of .02, .15, and .35 are considered small, medium, and large, respectively, the effect size found in this study would be considered very large. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of the full model used to examine Research Question 1 was .664.</p>
<p>With regard to Research Question 2 (as shown in column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091552113497090">Table 3</xref>), the same statistically significant positive relationship was found (β = .007, <italic>p</italic> = .000). More racially diverse community colleges were able to create a normative environment in which student conversations occurred more frequently with peers holding different religious beliefs, political opinions, or personal values. The effect size of student body racial diversity in this model was .104. Based on the Cohen matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552113497090">J. Cohen, 1988</xref>), this effect size suggests that the strength of this relationship was small to medium. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value for this estimation (.300) was lower than that of the model used to estimate Research Question 1.</p>
<p>The final column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091552113497090">Table 3</xref> suggests that enrolling a more racially heterogeneous student body, controlling for other factors, helps a community college create a normative environment in which students have a greater understanding of people from other racial and ethnic backgrounds (β = .008, <italic>p</italic> = .000). As with the model used to estimate Research Question 2, the effect size of student body racial diversity in this estimation (<italic>f</italic> <sup>2</sup> = .08) is considered of small to medium strength according to Cohen’s matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552113497090">J. Cohen, 1988</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of this estimation was .569.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations should be taken in account when considering the findings of this study. First, despite the number of control variables used, the estimations from this analysis could be adversely affected by omitted-variable bias. If an institutional characteristic (observable or unobservable) is correlated with student body racial diversity and the outcome variables studied but not controlled for in the regression models, there is the potential for omitted-variable bias. As a result, causal claims about the relationships studied here should not be made.</p>
<p>A second limitation involves the CCSSE instrument. Scholars have recently raised questions about the design and psychometric properties of this instrument as a tool for assessing student engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552113497090">Olivas, 2011</xref>)—specifically, questions concerning the ability of students to accurately respond to survey questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091552113497090">Porter, 2011</xref>), the survey’s consideration of “intercultural effort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552113497090">Dowd, Sawatzky, &amp; Korn, 2011</xref>), and the CCSSE’s benchmarks of effective educational practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552113497090">Nora, Crisp, &amp; Matthews, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091552113497090">McCormick and McClenney (2012)</xref> offer a strong defense of the CCSSE instrument, and several studies have shown the it to be a valid tool for assessing student engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552113497090">Mandarino &amp; Mattern, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091552113497090">McClenney, Marti, &amp; Adkins, 2007</xref>). The findings of this study, however, must be considered in light of the debate regarding the quality of the CCSSE instrument.</p>
<p>Finally, the dependent variables studied here were measured using student responses to a single question. Using a single question to operationalize these variables represents a fairly narrow view of an institution’s normative environment toward a diversity outcome. Ideally, additional questions would have been used to help operationalize the outcomes of interest. These questions, however, were not included in the CCSSE instrument.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The educational benefits of diversity have been the subject of much research over the years. Some have found significant educational benefits associated with the creation of a diverse student body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552113497090">Milem, 2003</xref>), while others have found little evidence that diversity has any impact on student educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552113497090">Herzog, 2007</xref>). This research, however, has focused almost exclusively on diversity in 4-year colleges and universities. No published research to date has examined the influence of student body racial diversity at community colleges.</p>
<p>The development of a better understanding of diversity at 2-year colleges is essential for a number of reasons. One, attacks on diversity research from commentators such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091552113497090">Wood and Sherman (2001</xref>, p. 81) have been based in part on the fact that 2-year colleges had been excluded from analyses on the educational impact of diversity. Research on diversity and student interaction with diversity at community colleges would aid the higher education community in addressing this criticism.</p>
<p>Research at 2-year colleges would also add a level of nuance to our understanding of the impact of diversity in higher education. A variety of structural, input, and output differences make the organizational environments of 2- and 4-year institutions quite different. Currently, the bulk of our knowledge regarding the educational impact of diversity is concentrated in the organizational environments of 4-year institutions. By focusing on 2-year institutions, stronger claims may be made about diversity’s impact in a variety of organizational environments within higher education.</p>
<p>A focus on 2-year institutions can also serve to broaden the utility of research on diversity in higher education. For many scholars, the motivating factor for better understanding the educational impact of diversity has been attacks on race-based admissions programs. Diversity, however, is both a policy initiative and a broader educational initiative. If it is believed that the cognitive dissonance created by diverse learning environments positively affects the intellectual growth of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113497090">Gurin et al., 2002</xref>), it should be encouraged within all sectors of postsecondary education. Community colleges represent a large sector of higher education responsible for producing graduates who will serve in important leadership positions within an increasingly diverse society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552113497090">A. Cohen &amp; Brawer, 2008</xref>). A better understanding of if and how diversity can be used to create enhanced learning environments at 2-year schools extends the utility of this line of scholarship.</p>
<p>This study takes an initial step in this direction by exploring the relationship between student body racial diversity and an institution’s normative environment toward diversity outcomes among a nationally representative sample of community colleges in the United States. The findings support the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552113497090">Chang et al. (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552113497090">Pike and Kuh (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552113497090">Pike et al. (2007)</xref>, and others who have found that more racially diversity institutions of higher education are able to create a normative environment in which student conversations with diverse others occur more frequently. Even after controlling for a variety of institutional characteristics, community college student body racial diversity was positively correlated with a normative environment in which students engaged more often in conversations with racially different others and with peers holding different personal beliefs and values.</p>
<p>From an organizational perspective, this study suggests that even among institutions where interactions among organizational members occur less frequently, higher levels of diversity aid institutions in creating a normative environment in which interactions with diverse others occur more frequently. The first part of the conceptual model detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091552113497090">Figure 1</xref> now has empirical support within the organizational environments of 4- and 2-year institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>This study also found a direct correlation between community college student body racial diversity and one important educational outcome. As noted earlier, supporters of affirmative action–type policies propose that a diverse student body leads to increased cross-racial and cross-cultural interactions among students. These interactions in turn contribute significantly to students’ intellectual and personal development. The hypothesis that student interactions with diversity lead to a variety of positive educational outcomes could not be directly tested here given the available data. It was found, however, that community colleges enrolling a more racially heterogeneous student body appear to have a normative environment in which students develop a greater understanding of people from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. This suggests that further investigation into the second part of the conceptual model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091552113497090">Figure 1</xref> would show a positive relationship between community college student interactions with diverse others and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552113497090">Gurin (1999)</xref> describes as student “democracy outcomes” (p. 366).</p>
<p>In sum, these findings show that community colleges can benefit from enrolling a more racially heterogeneous student body through the creation of a normative environment that supports more frequent contact among diverse peers and that fosters increased student understanding of diverse others. This raises several interesting questions regarding student recruitment among 2-year institutions. In general, community colleges are more racially diverse than 4-year colleges and universities in that they often have high concentrations of minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552113497090">A. Cohen &amp; Brawer, 2008</xref>). Creating a more racially heterogeneous student body, however, remains a challenge for many 2-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091552113497090">Kallur, 2006</xref>). The findings of this study suggest that accepting this challenge and attempting to create a more racially balanced student body can be beneficial for students. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552113497090">Pike et al. (2007)</xref>, there are generally two ways in which colleges and universities become more diverse: when the demographics in the surrounding area change and through the intentional recruitment of students from diverse backgrounds. For 2-year institutions, more diversity may require substantial recruitment of students outside an institution’s home district. Is this type of student recruitment within the budgetary constraints of 2-year institutions? Does it conflict with tuition policies in states that require out-of-district students to pay higher tuition rates than in-district students? Given the nature of community college students, would this type of recruitment be effective at creating more diverse community colleges? These are questions that institutions would have to ask as they attempt to balance the educational advantages of diversity with the realities of their organization contexts.</p>
<p>These findings also raise interesting questions about how more diversity in community college student populations facilitates increased cross-racial interactions. Are these informal interactions that naturally occur during the course of the academic year? Are they more formal interactions facilitated by the institution? Do they occur inside or outside the classroom? What other conditions are necessary if community colleges hope to increase student interactions with diverse others? These are questions that should be part of a larger research agenda on diversity at community colleges.</p>
<p>Future research should also more thoroughly explore the validity of the second part of the diversity rationale within community colleges. Given the data available, this study could explore only the direct relationship between community college student body racial diversity and the normative climate toward one educational outcome. Before a true proclamation regarding the educational benefits of interactions with diverse others at community colleges can be made, however, more research is needed. Particularly, student-level research is needed examining if community college student interactions with diverse others are correlated with learning outcomes, democracy outcomes, citizenship engagement, process outcomes, or material outcomes. Research in that area, in combination with the findings here, would give the higher education community a more complete understanding of the role that diversity plays in the educational experiences of students at 2-year colleges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0091552113497090" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Just as many 4-year institutions extol the educational benefits of creating a more diverse student body, this study shows that community colleges also have a compelling interest in enrolling a more heterogeneous student body. As community colleges continue to play a critical role in the preparation of students to live and work in a diverse society, they should strongly consider the educational relevance of diversity. The larger discussion regarding diversity in higher education should not focus exclusively on 4-year colleges and universities. If the goal is to foster an educated citizenry for a diverse democracy, efforts should be focused at all sectors of postsecondary education, including 2-year institutions. It is hoped that this study serves as a catalyst for research and debate in this area.</p>
