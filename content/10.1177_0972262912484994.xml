<title>Case Analysis I</title>
<sec id="section2-0972262912484994">
<title>Brief Introduction</title>
<p>The case revolves around an investment bank which manages assets worth USD 1 billion. So far, it has presence in mature financial markets. Owing to the financial crisis and ensuing problems of unemployment and liquidity crunch, it has become difficult for said investment bank to generate abnormal profits for its investors. The bank is now looking to explore investing opportunities in emerging markets. Admittedly choppy markets, but in the present scenario, they seem to be good investment opportunities. The company decides to focus on BRIC economies based on the following:
<list id="list1-0972262912484994" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Economies growing at a high rate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Boast of a combined GDP of USD 15 trillion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysts’ reports envisage these countries to become globally dominant by the year 2050 leaving behind the developed nations of the day.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A well-qualified professional from the investment banking space with prior experience in equity firms and mutual funds has been identified to handle emerging markets. He has requisite skills, training and experience in emerging markets to handle the job at hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0972262912484994">
<title>Problem Identification</title>
<p>Post sub-prime crisis of 2008, an American investment bank is no longer able to sustain the high growth rates they were generating by investing in Europe and US financial markets, is looking to expand to emerging markets which seem to offer high rates on investments made. After having decided to focus on BRIC economies, the decision to be taken by the protagonist is to choose which sectors of industry he should invest in.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0972262912484994">
<title>Criterion Used to Arrive at the Decision</title>
<p>In order to evaluate which sectors should the protagonist be investing in, he can employ two widely used methods:
<list id="list2-0972262912484994" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Absolute/Intrinsic Valuation using Discounted Cash Flow method according to which price of the asset is equal to the present value of all cash flows expected in future. Inputs required for this method are expected cash flows, discount rate and growth rate. It suffers from numerous assumptions about cash flows, discount rates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relative valuation—value of an asset is its market value. In this method, comparison of standardized multiples across assets rather than absolute market price is undertaken. It reflects market volatility and requires fewer inputs than DCF. Problem arises because multiples are sometimes loosely defined.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Protagonist uses relative valuation by choosing P/E and P/BV multiples to examine which sectors are likely to provide good investment opportunities. Using classification provided by BSE, P/E and P/BV multiples are looked at for 17 sectors for the last 21 years. BSE being the oldest exchange in India and also one of the two main exchanges, reliability and ready availability of data was assured.</p>

<title>Decision</title>
<p>While a low P/E stock indicates that investor is wary, a high P/E indicates optimism. But this is to be viewed with the fact that different P/E ranges for different sectors are acceptable. For example a high P/E range for IT is acceptable as opposed to a low range for transport or textiles based on perceived rate of growth of sector. While low P/E may indicate stock is undervalued, that is, it is right time to enter market; it could be a function of a lot of factors such as incompetent management, loss of key customers, etc. It will have to be examined whether weakness is across the entire sector, industry, or economy, or is it caused by firm-specific factors. A high P/E could imply stock is overvalued, but it also means that if company does not sustain its earnings in future, then share price will drop. A slight instance can make share price slide. Therefore, multiples are not a crystal ball. The decision criteria will also be based on management philosophy. If the management wants to go for value stocks it chose low P/E stocks, whereas if they want to invest in growth companies they will go for new economy stocks like IT, Healthcare, etc.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a comprehensive case to be presented to students for a discussion in a session on equity valuation. It will help them to understand how different sectors have different high and low price multiples over longer period of time. Critical aspect of ‘which multiple to use’ can also be alluded to during course of discussion. Moreover, the idea that these metrics are dynamic and limitation of historical multiples can be brought out. Besides the case writer has also touched upon the concept of normality which is very important while we are using averages as a benchmark. The case would be able to generate sufficient interest among students and provides sufficient room for discussion in the class to generate new ideas from students.</p>

<title>Case Analysis II</title>
<p>This is an important case study on sectoral analysis in Indian equity market. Present case study explains the uses of relative valuation using two important multiples (Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Value ratio) for 17 sectors (namely Agriculture, Capital Goods, Chemical, Consumer Durables, Finance, FMCG, Health care, Housing Related, Information Technology, Metal, Oil and Gas, Power, Telecom, Textile, Tourism, Transport Equipments and Transport Services) of Indian equity market represented in BSE 500 index. Total time period of 21 years (1990–2010) has been divided into three sub-periods viz. 1990–1996, 1997–2003 and 2004–2010 due to their economic relevance in the context of India. The first sub period (1990–1996), represents the post economic reform and high growth phase of Indian economy due to high foreign capital inflow. Second sub period (1997–2003) represents the phase of foreign capital withdrawal from the Indian equity market and the third sub period (2004–2010) represents the phase of high co-integration of Indian equity market with global equity market. Comparative study for the three sub periods explains the cyclicality of foreign capital flows into the Indian equity market and impact of foreign capital flows on various sectors of the equity market. The investments in the first and second sub periods (1990–1996) and (1997–2003) respectively, by the international equity inventors helped them to diversify their investment portfolios, as Indian equity market was less co-integrated with the global equity market at that time. The third sub period (2004–2010) is a very volatile period registering very high growth initially in the presubprime crises (2004–2007), touching its lowest in crisis period (2008–2009) and fast recovery in post crisis period (2010). This case study can be effectively used to teach following areas in an investment management class:
<list id="list3-0972262912484994" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Compare the methods by which companies can be grouped, i.e., products and/or services supplied; business-cycle sensitivities and statistical similarities. Case study has currently classified the companies based on the products and/or services supplied by them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Explain the factors that affect the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle and the uses and limi tations of industry and company descriptors such as ‘growth companies’ and ‘value companies’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Since the study period has been subdivided into three sub-periods, the case also enables another important industry and company descriptor ‘Cyclical’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In our analysis we can link Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) and Price to Book Ratio (P/B) to the fundamental valuation by breaking the multiples into their determinants.</p>
<p>According to infinite period dividend discount model:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0972262912484994">
<label>(1)</label>
Price = (D1)/(Ke ‒ g)
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where, D1 = Expected Dividend</p>
<p>Ke = Cost of Equity Capital and</p>
<p>g = growth rate of dividend</p>
<p>Dividing both the sides of equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0972262912484994">1</xref>) with Earning Per Share (EPS):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0972262912484994">
<label>(2)</label>
Price/Earnings per Share
(P/E) = (D1/E)/(Ke ‒ g)
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Thus according to equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0972262912484994">2</xref>) Price/Earning Ration depends upon firm’s Dividend Payout Ratio (D1/E), expected return by equity holders (Ke) and expected growth rate in its dividends. Growth rate (g) can be defined as product of firm’s Retention Ratio and Return on Equity (ROE). Thus a high or low sectoral P/E ratio should be analyzed in the light of its determinants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Describe the product and industry life cycle models, classification of industry as to life cycle phase (e.g., nascent, growth, shakeout, maturity and decline) based on economic growth stage of the country. Here instructor can emphasize upon the fact that how the life cycle stages vary from developed equity markets like USA and UK to emerging markets like BRICS countries. There are many industries which have attained maturity stage in the developed equity markets, while these industries and companies are in high growth phase in emerging economies. For example Electricity Utility industry is a mature industry in US, but it is a high growth phase in India. This distinction is highly useful in relative valuation as determinants of Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) and Price to Book Value Ratio (P/B value) like growth rate (g), Dividend payout and Retention ratio and Return on Equity (ROE) will vary significantly from developed market to emerging markets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The case study also explains the need for normalization of mean and standard deviation of P/E and P/B. Value multiples for various sectors in Indian equity market. If we are not normalizing the mean and standard deviations, then it is appropriate to use median instead of mean.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The case study can also be used for the purpose of teaching the need of international diversification by the global fund managers managing large amount of funds. Instructor can show how low correlations in the returns between developed equity markets and emerging equity markets can benefit the investors by investing in emerging markets like India. However, we must follow caution while investing money from developed equity markets to emerging markets and comparing P/E and P/Book Value multiples for developed and emerging equity markets. Price multiples are generally quite high for similar sectors in emerging markets in comparison to developed equity markets, because emerging markets are characterized by high risk due to scare and unevenly distributed information, underdeveloped financial infrastructure and high degree of political risk.</p></list-item>

<title>Case Analysis III</title>
<p>The turmoil in the financial market and overall economy state of USA and developed countries forced the companies to change their strategy of investing. Clearly when Arctic International LLC was not able to maintain the return on investment, it became urgent to look in the issue and revive the companies’ fortune.</p>
<p>Barbara Hall, CEO Arctic International LLC and her team were right in finding a solution for the ongoing crisis. Their last two quarters’ results were disappointing and they had to take a strategic decision soon. The suggestion from James Rodricks, Vice President—Arctic International LLC—to Invest in Emerging market was a good idea. But again a thorough analysis was required, as the Arctic International Board decided.</p>
<p>James Rodricks came out with the suggestion to invest in BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). His analysis was based on the reports from multiple sources, which described BRIC countries a great opportunity to invest considering their overall GDP and the forecast which suggested that by 2050 these countries would be ahead of G-7 Countries economy wise.</p>
<p>When it came to investing in India. The prime question was which sectors to look at. Here selection of Alok Singh by James was based upon his past experience of Indian Market and his analyzing skills. The stats also favoured Alok as he had managed $ 200 Million investment in Europian region and had a decent work experience to add up to.</p>
<p>Alok had a task before him and he had to select specific sectors to invest in to. Now since Alok was out of Equity market of India since almost a decade, he needed to study multi aspects of investing. He included Krishna in his team to help him in reaching the results.</p>
<p>Alok decided to value the Indian companies using valuation technique and then Alok had to make a choice between the two predominant valuation techniques, that is, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Relative valuation for valuing various companies/sectors. He understood the delicate balance of finding out the best way of valuation.</p>
<sec id="section9-0972262912484994">
<title>Techniques and Flow Chart for Identifying Profitable Sectors</title>
<p>Alok had to decide between two valuation techniques, that is, Discounted Cash Flow method and Relative Valuation. DCF has always been a preferred way but the assumptions taken to find out the result may hamper the study overall, so Alok decided to go with checking the price multiple of Companies following Relative Valuation. As a start Alok wanted to study Behaviour of Price multiples and he chose two ratios popular for their efficacy that is Price to earnings (P/E) and Price to Book Value (P/BV) for his analysis.</p>
<p>To get accurate result Alok opted to study the distributional properties of Price Multiples at sector level. His call to make base BSE 500 index to study the different sector was again a calculated move, as almost all sectors were under classification of BSE 500 index.</p>
<p>His selection of 17 Sectors out of 20 specific sectors was also valid considering Media and Publishing sectors are still not a very profitable sector in Indian Economy and omission of Diversified and Miscellaneous sector was also justified to some extent.</p>
<p>The Time period selected to study the Indian companies was a significant one. As Alok selected from 1990 to 2010, 1991 was the year when economic reforms started in India and afterwards results are known to all. The blocks of study of Indian Companies were apt due to the importance of these phases considering Indian relevance.</p>
<p>Alok then entrusted to carry out analysis of distributional properties for the total period and three sub-periods which they had decided to study on. Using basic Mean &amp; SD formulas Krishna got results which were not correct. His explanation that Companies which are having a High (Low) P/E for the total period also shows high (Low) P/E for sub periods. Also the study said the price multiple trend is on a low from first sub-period to next sub-period.</p>
<p>Krishna had forgotten to apply distribution for Normality test and that’s why his analysis was not accurate. However scenarios changed once when Krishna used K–S Test to check Normality.</p>
<p>Once the Normality test was done. There were significant results showing certain sectors had shown low P/E even when the market was bullish, to name Agriculture/ textile/Transport whereas in bearish phase also there were sectors like IT and Housing sectors which showed high P/E ratio.</p>
<p>One trend came which suggested some sectors had high Mean price multiples and had also shown High standard deviation for all the periods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0972262912484994">
<title>Selection of Sectors to Invest in to</title>
<p>Alok and Krishna’s analysis showed varied results. Decision regarding which sectors to invest in was left now. The three sub periods helped Alok in analyzing in a compact manner. If you go by the results of P/E ratio study: IT industry showed a high Mean price multiple for the total period. The first two sub-periods showed high mean and the last sub period is showing a higher mean but on a decline mode. The interpretation should be that IT sector is already at a high mean and chances of increase are not bright atleast in the near future, so this sector should be avoided. The same goes for housing related sector. It has a high mean and it may not go yield the expected results.</p>
<p>Again we talked about certain sectors having low P/E even in bullish phases to name, agriculture/transport/textile. Now these are some sectors which never showed much hopes, it has a reason, it is limited in Indian context due to several reasons, agriculture for that instance is still one segment which lags far behind others considering less modernization efforts from central authorities. Also, the trend is also not much inspiring, so to start with, this sector should also not be considered much. The same applies to transport and textile sectors.</p>
<p>Winning Horses are many if you look at following sectors: Finance/FMCG/Oil and Gas/Power. It has been observed that these sectors are still undervalued and the same is suggested by the study if we follow P/E ratio method. The mean of finance for the whole period is 15.84 and currently is at 17.94. There is a clear scope of getting these sector positives in near future. Definitely a good bet to put money on.</p>
<p>FMCG/oil and gas/power are some other sectors which should definitely be looked upon. They are undervalued and their past analysis suggests good growth prospects for coming future.</p>
<p>The case gives an insight and depth analysis by using multiple mediums, techniques to reach at a conclusive study. The use of ratios and the Valuation technique used are executed in an excellent way. It represents a complete over view of last three decades, that too of all the leading sectors. The results can be debated but to my knowledge, it’s a scientific and unbiased report on Indian Economic sectors.</p>

<title>Case Analysis IV</title>
<p>The case study is an engaging story of a USA based investment company that wants to enter the Indian market. The case provides opportunity for understanding various valuation techniques and offers insight into the fund managers’ approach in selection of the appropriate valuation technique. The small but very rich case is particularly useful for illustrating the process of investment analysis especially the fundamental analysis. The various areas that are discussed in the Case can be analyzed one by one starting with the attractiveness of Indian market for foreign institutional investors. Indian stock market is consistently outperforming the US and European market. Mr Barbara Hall is well informed about that. This gives an opportunity here to discuss about the market returns and other economic parameters.</p>
<sec id="section12-0972262912484994">
<title>The Anatomy of Indian Market for Foreign Investment Flows</title>
<p>According to the Economic Survey (ES) 2012–2013, Indian stock market last year gave the second highest returns globally, driven largely by higher inflows from foreign institutional investors (FII). The ES also highlights that Nifty, the NSE’s 50-share index, gave the second highest cumulative returns, while the highest returns were given by Germany’s DAX. Among major indices globally, while Germany’s DAX, posted a cumulative return of 29.1 per cent in the calendar year 2012 over 2011, NSE’s Nifty Index recorded 27.7 per cent and BSE’s SENSEX achieved 25.7 per cent respectively. Owing to the Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) inflows into the country during the year 2012, Indian markets become one of the best performing in the world and the rise in the indices stood at 11.62 per cent for the SENSEX and 11.51 per cent in case of Nifty. In 2012, FIIs bought equities worth USD 24.4 billion in 2012, which indicates that FII confidence in the performance of the Indian economy in general and Indian markets in particular.</p>

<title>The Key Ingredients of Investment Analysis</title>
<p>Understanding the economy in isolation does not help much in investment analysis as the return on stocks is based on a number of factors, the exact number is not yet known. To determine the prices of assets in capital markets the analysts use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years due to its inability to explain fully the pricing of risky assets. A plethora of current studies looking beyond a single market factor show that factors other than the market return, which are industrial and economic, are critical in predicting the stock return variability. Hence, the analysis of economy, industry and company fundamentals is the main ingredient of investment analysis. Operationally to base the investment decision on various fundamentals, all the three stages must be taken into account as these are potentially important in explaining the variations in stock returns. Among the key factors in predicting the stock returns other than the market factors are company’s size, dividend yield, price volatility of energy, interest rate risk, money supply, risk free rate, exchange rates, inflation and industrial production index.</p>

<title>Valuation—Different Approaches</title>
<p>Valuation techniques focus on specific part of a company’s financial performance; hence majorly there are three types of valuation techniques used in analysis. While one category is based on balance sheets others use multiples based on income statement. Slightly deviated from the two, the third approach focuses on cash flow method of valuation. Valuation professionals, merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) specialists and market participants often use market multiples to estimate the value of a business or parts of a business. The methodology invokes the law of one price (LOOP), according to which identical assets must have identical prices. In practice using some benchmark or parameter, one estimates the value of the subject asset or company under consideration by observing prices paid for similar assets or companies in the market. In case of companies, the benchmark can be enterprise value and the corresponding EBIT or enterprise value and the EBITDA, Price earning while in case of a particular financial asset like equity it can be PE multiple or Price to Book ratio.</p>

<title>Market Multiples—Are They Good Substitute for Comprehensive Valuations?</title>
<p>Although the actual valuation process used by market participants is unobservable, we assume that stock prices can be replicated by comprehensive valuations that convert all available information into detailed projections of future flows. Given this efficient markets framework for traded stocks, what role do multiples play? Even in situations where market valuations are absent, either because the equity is privately-held or because the proposed publicly traded entity has not yet been created (e.g., mergers and spinoffs), multiples prove superior to comprehensive valuations by surpassing the explicit projections and present value calculations. Multiples are forward looking in stable environments and rely on the same principles of comprehensive valuation: value is an increasing function of future payoffs and a decreasing function of risk.</p>
<p>Further multiples can be easily communicated and specified well ahead of time leading to a better stock transfer in buy and sell agreement. Therefore, multiples are used often as a substitute for comprehensive valuations, because they communicate efficiently the essence of those valuations. Multiples are also used to complement comprehensive valuations, typically to calibrate those valuations and to obtain terminal values.</p>

<title>Significance of P-E in Investment Analysis</title>
<p>By comparing price and earnings per share, one can analyze the market’s valuation of a stock relative to the earnings it is generating. Stocks with higher (or more certain) forecast earnings growth will usually have a higher P/E and those expected to have lower (or riskier) earnings growth will usually have a lower P/E. Investors can use the P/E ratio to compare the value of stocks: if one stock has a P/E twice that of another stock, all things being equal (especially the earnings growth rate), it is a less attractive investment.</p>
<p>Various interpretations of a particular P/E ratio are possible as mentioned below:
<boxed-text>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>Usually treated as having an undefined P/E ratio. A company with no earnings or negative earnings has an undefined P/E ratio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0–10</td>
<td>Either the stock is undervalued or the company's earnings are thought to be in decline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10–17</td>
<td>For many companies a P/E ratio in this range may be considered to represent a fair value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17–25</td>
<td>Either the stock is overvalued or the stock may be a growth stock with earnings expected to increase substantially in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25+</td>
<td>Either the company is expecting a high future growth in earnings, or the current earnings is considered to be exceptionally low, or the stock is subject to a bubble.</td>
</tr>

<title>PB Ratio—The Relation with P-E Ratio</title>
<p>P/E throws light on the price which investors are willing to pay for one rupee of earnings whereas P/B gives the price which the investors are willing to pay for one rupee of book value. While P-E is income based approach, P-B is based on the balance sheet. As with most ratios, P/B ratio varies a fair amount by industry. Industries that require more infrastructure capital (for each dollar of profit) will usually trade at P/B ratios much lower than, for example, consulting firms. P/B ratios are commonly used to compare financial institutions, because most assets and liabilities of banks are constantly valued at market values. A higher P/B ratio implies that investors expect management to create more value from a given set of assets and in no chance the P/B ratios provide any information on the ability of the firm to generate profits or cash for shareholders.</p>
<p>P/B ratio has certain advantages over P/E ratio. Firstly, where the company and/or its peers suffered losses in the trailing 12 months, P/E does not provide a meaningful comparison across peers or history. This is where P/B stands out. Second, in case of industrial and financial companies, there is a stronger link between their assets on the books and their income generating ability hence valuation using P/B than P/E would be more appropriate. Both P/E and P/B are of little or no use for companies which are serial acquirers as both assets and earnings are subject to significant distortions.</p>
<p>Best of all, since P/B = (P/E * E/B), the price to book ratio is important because it draws together the external and internal factors of price, completing the cycle of market and company analysis, for the price/earnings ratio is the stock market aspect of a company and the return on equity the stockholder’s vindication. P/B provides a valuable reality check for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price. Large discrepancies between P/B and Return on Equity (ROE), a key growth indicator, can sometimes send up a red flag on companies. Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and high P/B ratios. If a company’s ROE is growing, its P/B ratio should be doing the same.</p>
<p>Many researchers and analysts have found that combining several simple multiple valuation outcomes of a firm, each of which is based on a stock price multiple to a historical accounting performance measure of the comparable firms (historical multiple), improves the valuation accuracy of the simple multiple valuation using a single historical multiple.</p>

<sec id="section19-0972262912484994">
<title>How Industry P/E or P/B are Useful in Investment Analysis?</title>
<p>It is usually not enough to look at the P/E ratio of one company and determine its status. Usually, an analyst will look at a company’s P/E ratio compared to the industry the company is in, the sector the company is in (the sectoral index if it is listed in a National Stock exchange), as well as the overall market (Nifty). Often, comparisons will also be made between quarterly and annual data. Only after a comparison with the industry, sector and market can an analyst determine whether a P/E ratio is high or low with the above mentioned distinctions (i.e., undervaluation, over valuation, fair valuation, etc.).</p>
<p>The market-multiple approach when used to estimate a subject company’s equity value rather than its enterprise value, the multiples are computed from comparable companies that are derived from stock prices or market capitalization rather than enterprise values. Hence the obvious question is how large should be the sample of comparables for a relevant multiple? As with most statistical exercises, the easy answer is that more is better since a larger sample size tends to increase the reliability of the estimated multiple. In absence of a clear definition of comparable companies practitioners use the industry ratios as a proxy.</p>

<title>The Intricacies of Calculating Industry P/E or P/B</title>
<p>Various multiples for the industry or sector can be calculated by simply using the mean values of various companies in that particular sector. The basic assumption behind calculation and use of average is that the sample is normally distributed. But many times practitioners overlook it like that happened in case of Mr Krishna. In case the distribution of price multiples is not normally distributed, one cannot employ mean P/E ratio of companies in a sector as a relevant parameter for the purpose of benchmarking. Perhaps it will be better if one uses median instead of mean values in case of non-normal distributions. Median is also better if some companies in the industry have negative earnings and undefined price multiples.</p>

<title>Case Analysis V</title>
<p>Arctic International LLC being beginners in an emerging economy should have a composite of sectors which achieves their basic objective of entering India—better returns—thus going for the sectors which offer attractive returns; at the same time stay safe by investing in sectors with relatively lower volatility obviously might need to live with a bit moderated investment returns.</p>
<sec id="section22-0972262912484994">
<title>Sector-wise Analysis</title>
<p>In the early life of any sector, most factors would be internal as in the sector would be recognized by an investor/entrepreneur as an ignored opportunity with huge potential for business. Huge untapped customer need, product/solution designing, several refinements, attracting talent and training and retaining them, getting bank and investors funding, etc. Later they become subject to various industry practices, government regulations and investors focus.</p>
<p>Expected valuation and eventual returns on investment in any sector would depend on its performance broadly in terms of ‘growth’ and ‘margins’. These growth and margins would depend on variety of factors—systemic and internal.</p>
<p><bold>Systemic factors:</bold> Fundamental nature of the sector—life cycle stage of a sector, its positioning regionally, nationally and internationally, its national importance, its public welfare correlation, international political importance, pure trade plays, international commodity, market economics, consumption led, etc.</p>
<p><bold>Internal factors:</bold> Innovation, quality of management, ability to retain talent, continuous expansion, location of the core operations, target customer segment, trade formulae or recipe, etc.</p>
<p>Now, from the generic thesis Krishna developed for Alok, from Indian perspective following ones would generally stay more expensive than others for a combination of higher returns and growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0972262912484994">
<title>Period-wise Valuations</title>
<p>During the first period, most sectors demonstrated very high levels of valuation for the first opening of the economy for foreign capital, thus not really representative of their real relative merit. Some sectors had undue advantage, some were in infancy, industrial and investment law and regulations were not seasoned.</p>
<p>During the second period, it was a mixed bag with emerging growth period for some sectors (IT, Telecom), slowdown in some sectors around year 2000 and beginning of high growth again in 2003.</p>
<p>The third period has been interesting for multiplicity of factors—global slowdown affecting export oriented sectors (textiles, IT), rising domestic consumerism (Agri, Tourism, Finance, Healthcare, Housing, O&amp;G), policy paralysis and corruption affecting investors’ confidence (Metals, Power, Telecom) and high inflation curbing consumption in later half amongst others.</p>
<p><bold>Sector Characteristics:</bold> Let’s analyze the sectors on the basis of their peculiar characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0972262912484994">
<title>Consumerism Led Sectors</title>
<p>As Indians become increasingly economically powerful, purchasing power rises, domestic consumption is exponentiating every few years. Coupled with plateauing growth in US/Europe and Japan
<list id="list4-0972262912484994" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>driven by growth in consumption across a very wide population base</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>for huge untapped market in most consumerism plays, CAGR is very high coupled with higher margins for economies of scale</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relatively stable long term perspective for visible growth in domestic consumption for next two decades.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Government regulations, macro factors and national factors’ impact in the short term notwithstanding, middle class growth led domestic consumption will stay fuelled.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>With plateauing growth in the US, Europe and Japan, for these sectors, investors have been paying and will continue to pay premium over others. Agriculture, FMCG, Housing, Capital Goods, Oil &amp; Gas, Tourism and Transportation broadly fall here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0972262912484994">
<title>Government Controlled/ Regulated Sectors</title>
<p>Such sectors would most times stay reasonably valued and will provide returns a bit lower than consumerism though, have relatively moderated volatility. Government would regulate them:
<list id="list5-0972262912484994" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>For protecting public interest at large, sectors like ‘financial services’ Banks, Mutual funds, insurances businesses would continue to operate under strict government regulations. Funds for all these businesses across the world are mobilized through small savings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For finite availability of resources: wherever limited resources are involved, government control shall drive the overall supply side and thus lesser likelihood of wide oscillations. ‘Metals, Mining, Oil &amp; Gas, Power’.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Growth would largely be driven on consumption, these sectors stay relatively safer for consistent state watch. Businesses with better business models and performing better within them would surely be more attractive and thus more expensive than others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0972262912484994">
<title>Other Sectors with Specific Peculiarities</title>
<p><bold>Agriculture:</bold> has been serving relatively weaker consumers, that is, farmers. Food production continues to suffer from operational inefficiencies, undesired opaque market intermediation, lack of innovation and financing issues. To add there is always a state control on output pricing. However for strengthening middle class, rising consumption is clearly giving it a fillip. Business model is asset light though, price realization is relatively lower.</p>
<p><bold>Information Technology:</bold> the most innovative thing ever occurred to India. It is an exceptional sector for the investors.</p>
<list id="list6-0972262912484994" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Business model so far working on huge cost arbitrage between India and customer countries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No use of tangible resources, extremely asset light and very high margin.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No dearth of manpower—generic skillset required unlike O&amp;G, Healthcare, Telecom, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Almost NIL government regulation—no large public interest involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One of the highest foreign currency earners for the country addressing CAD.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Most business is done for the US, most investors hail also from the US too, thus higher level of confidence. All companies do operate with a meaningful set up onshore too.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><bold>Textile:</bold> One of the leading private sectors when economy opened in the first period, it was one of the most exciting sectors for investors initially. However it has not been able to match up with the others. Has generally been a non-exciting sector for a while now. Neither its very buoyant nor very regressive with the market.</p>
<list id="list7-0972262912484994" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Mostly exports to US/Europe of low value add products</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low margin realization</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Marred by government intervention, operational challenges and competition</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Of late thin volumes in retail are being driven on consumerism by select players (Page industries, Raymond, Lovable). However conversely, recessionary global consumption has taken a toll on their business over last 3–4 years.</p>

<title>Recommendation</title>
<p>Alok can go ahead with the recommendation to James and Barbara that the opportunities are galore in India and a prudent strategy to pick an assortment of sectors would suit best to start with. These sectors on one hand would ensure high growth, returns and stability with downside protection on the other.</p>
