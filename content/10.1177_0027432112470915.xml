<p>As a collegian looking forward to a career in music education or music performance (or some of both!), you might not be giving a lot of thought right this minute to the future of the profession. The health of music education, however, both now and down the road, will have profound effects on your job prospects and the education of your students and your audiences in the coming years.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432112470915">
<title>Becoming an Advocate for Music</title>
<p>Advocacy (from the Latin <italic>advocare</italic>, “to call forth, summon, or invite”) <italic>is speaking out on behalf of a cause</italic>—in this case, music education and the importance of music in the lives of everyone.</p>
<p>There are many ways to be an advocate, starting with being a role model for young people in your community. An excellent teacher sends a strong message about the importance of the field. Beyond staying current in your field and maintaining your musicianship across your career, here are a few things you can do to support music education wherever you end up:</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112470915" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Get to know your local media.</bold> Visit your local newspaper and community website editor a few times a year (especially about a month before your next public event or concert) with pictures of your students playing or singing. (Make sure you have proper parental permission to share these images; most schools have students sign blanket permissions at the beginning of each school year.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Spread the word online!</bold> Make sure your administration, school board, and community are aware of your program. Via your school’s website (or one you create for your music program), share your calendar of events and the highlights of your students’ learning. Be sure to offer readers a way to get in touch with you by e-mail; respond promptly to queries from site visitors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Stay politically connected.</bold> Know your local, district, state, and national representatives, from the local town council all the way up to your senators. Communicate with them frequently on important education issues.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Boosters provide a boost for music!</bold> Ask for assistance and advice from students, parents, and the community at large. By keeping your supporters informed and calling on them a few times a year for short-term, specific help, you’ll be able to make best use of this source of energy, ideas, and backup at critical events from car washes to concerts!</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Use NAfME resources.</bold> Make use of the many advocacy resources of the National Association for Music Education (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nafme.org">www.nafme.org</ext-link>) in the “For Advocates” website section. You’ll be amazed at the statistics, stories, videos, and research you’ll find there to support your music program and music learning in general.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Participate in MIOSM</bold><sup>®</sup>. Become a visible advocate for music education by participating in Music In Our Schools Month. Throughout March 2013, schools across the United States and Canada will engage in various activities designed to raise awareness for music education, including displaying promotional merchandise, securing public media coverage and political support, and participating in the Concert for Music In Our Schools Month. Your school and community can be part of it. Visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://musiced.nafme.org/events/music-in-our-schools-month/">http://musiced.nafme.org/events/music-in-our-schools-month/</ext-link> for more information on how to get involved!</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Remember that “you must be the change you wish to see.”</bold> Mahatma Gandhi spoke of living our beliefs by acting on what we most value. One person can start something big. Your efforts can make all the difference in your community.</p></list-item>
