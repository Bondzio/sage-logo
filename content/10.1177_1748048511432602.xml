<abstract>
<p>4-1-9 is a multi-billion-dollar international email scam that is believed to have originated from Nigeria. This study examines the framing of email communications used in this fraud and content-analyzes their lexical features. Findings indicate that the scammers used Realism as the main persuasive lexical characteristic in the messages, that is, language that suggests meeting tangible needs in people’s everyday lives. The scammers also framed their messages as ‘business’ proposals to disguise their fraudulent tactics and plans. But while the scam may have originated from Nigeria, it appears that it may no longer be operationally restricted to that country.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell was reported to have off-handedly characterized and dismissed Nigeria as ‘a nation of scammers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048511432602">French, 2004</xref>). While this statement might have hyperbolic and stereotypical undertones, the former top US diplomat was referring to the ubiquitous and unique brand of international scam known as 4-1-9 advance fee fraud, whose origins are associated with Nigeria in West Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432602">Chang, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>4-1-9 advance fee fraud (known simply as 4-1-9 or AFF) is a scheme designed by fraudsters purporting to have lucrative but bogus business, humanitarian or philanthropic related deals where the victim is promised large sums of money for no initial investment. The potential victim is contacted via an unsolicited email message and he or she is only required to assist the promoter of the scam to retrieve a ‘legitimate’ fortune the con artist claims to have inherited or a stash of cash he or she fortuitously discovered. As the deal progresses, the victim is persuaded to advance some cash to the scammer for a variety of purposes such as the payment of unanticipated taxes, duty fees and outright bribery. The victim will later discover that there is no fortune to be retrieved or business to profit from, as the scammer disappears with the advance fee he or she had collected, hence the name advance fee fraud.</p>
<p>4-1-9 international fraud has attracted a number of studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432602">Okogbule (2007</xref>), who linked it with money laundering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048511432602">Oriola (2005</xref>), whose concern is the Nigerian regulatory and legal response to the phenomenon, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048511432602">Edelson (2003</xref>), who looked at how the use of the internet facilitates the fraud. So far, there hasn’t been any specific and systematic examination of the contents of the email communication/messages initiated by the scammers. Consequently, this study was designed to fill this void by examining how the 4-1-9 email messages are framed. In this regard, the objective of this study is not about measures to curb the fraud and apprehend the criminals or why their victims fall for the hoax, although these issues can be inferred. The email messages appear to be the most effective and direct means through which the scammers access their potential victims, persuasively entice and ultimately exploit them. It is therefore crucial to examine how the messages are framed and nuanced, with emphasis on their lexical characteristics as instruments of persuasion.</p>
<p>To attain this objective, a content analysis of the 4-1-9 email messages was undertaken, with the use of the computerized Diction 5.0 program. Since this study is about the use of language in 4-1-9 email messages, Diction 5.0 is an appropriate tool for the content analysis. It is a program that is specifically designed to ‘look for certain features of language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048511432602">Hart, 1984</xref>: 14). This program will be further examined in the literature review section. Theoretically, framing served as the backdrop to this research.</p>

<title>Major features of 4-1-9 messages</title>
<p>The 4-1-9 email messages largely share common properties, the most prominent of which are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>They are usually addressed to an ‘unknown recipient,’ suggesting that what any potential victim receives has probably been sent to thousands of recipients around the world. This red-flag is often ignored by would-be victims (see Appendix 1 for a sample of the letter).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To establish trust and confidentiality, the sender shares his/her ‘identity’ and suggests a reciprocal gesture. Here is an example: ‘I am Mr Mensah John, the manager of auditing and accounting department of Bank of Ghana (ICB) ACCRA-GHANA AFRICA BRANCH. I am contacting you based on Trust and confidentiality…I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don’t know ourselves… [but] I believed that you are a reliable and Honest Person capable for this important business transaction’ (email of 23 February 2010). To further build trust, the sender provides his or her contact address, email, telephone and fax numbers and appeals to the recipient to do the same. Furthermore, the sender requests for the name of the bank and account number into which he/she will deposit the recipient’s share of the dividend from the transaction.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Each 4-1-9 email message has an appeal such as sharing in an inheritance or participating in a ‘business’ proposal. Here is an example: ‘My name is Madam CeillPaine mamaduk A complete citizen of the Philippines… I inherited a total sum of 12 .3 million dollars from my late husband.’ The writer then pleads for help in retrieving her fortune (email of 15 February 2010).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Recipients are promised attractive rewards for no initial financial investment in the deal. This is an email from ‘Princess Fustina karom’: ‘I am a female student from University of Burkina faso, Ouagadougou. I am 23 yrs old… my father died and left I and my junior brother behind. He was a king… He left the sum of USD 7, 350, 000.00 dollars… I am ready to pay 20% of the total amount to you if you help us in this transaction and another 10% interest of Annual After Income to you’ (email of 20 August 2009).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The email messages are not always written in a grammatically correct manner. The letters above suffice as examples. This factor will be further addressed in the discussion section of this study.</p>
</list-item>

<title>Literature</title>
<p>The origin of the advance fee fraud scheme appears to be obscure. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432602">Akinladejo (2007</xref>, quoting Sydney et al., 1999) traced the history of the scam back to the 1840s, and also noted that in the 1920s, Spanish criminals used it extensively in what was then known as ‘the Spanish prisoner con.’ However, there is a fairly common agreement among scholars that the variety of the scam known as 4-1-9 is of Nigerian origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432602">Buchanan and Grant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432602">Chang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432602">Chawki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432602">Glickman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432602">Okogbule, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048511432602">Oriola, 2005</xref>). It would appear that between the late 1970s and early 1980s the Nigerian fraudsters polished, redesigned and rebranded a fraud scheme that had existed for over a hundred years, elevated it to an art and managed to internationalize its reach.</p>
<p>The Nigerian connection is reinforced by the reality that the title ‘4-1-9’ actually refers to section 419 of the Nigerian penal code which deals with penalty for fraudulently obtaining money from victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048511432602">Lanford and Lanford, n.d.</xref>). Nigeria’s Decree No. 13 of 1995, which is known as the ‘Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Offenses Decree 1995,’ further expanded the scope of fraudulent acts punishable under section 419 of the code.</p>
<p>Echoes of the 4-1-9 scheme now reverberate across Europe, the USA, Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432602">Smith et al., 1999</xref>) and the Caribbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432602">Akinladejo, 2007</xref>), with Asia being the new sphere of operation by the scammers (Ultrascan Advanced Global Investigations [UAGI] Report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048511432602">2010</xref>). This spread has been actively facilitated by modern technology, especially email (Buchanan and Grant, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432602">Holt and Graves, 2007</xref>). Today, millions of 4-1-9 unsolicited email messages are received around the globe. Yet, this practice had started with the simple act of posting hand-written letters, or sending faxes to potential victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432602">Smith et al. (1999</xref>) note that early in 1998, the Australian customs service intercepted 302 advance fee fraud (4-1-9) letters in a courier package that was sent from Nigeria, for onward posting to destinations around that region. But, with the internet, the fraudsters now have access to a technology that facilitates an increase in their scope of operations with minimal detection and cost.</p>
<p>Although 4-1-9 is mostly perpetrated by individuals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048511432602">Malgwi (2004</xref>) suggests that some syndicates might also be behind the scheme, hence their ability to obtain sensitive and closely guarded government and company documents and signatures that are part of the emails sent to victims.</p>
<p>The major motive behind the 4-1-9 fraud is to make money. However, within the 4-1-9 confraternity, there are suggestions that the fraudsters’ international operations, especially in Europe and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048511432602">Ultrascan Advanced Global Investigations, 2010</xref>: 13), are a form of reparation. In other words, since Europe underdeveloped Africa (see Walter Rodney’s book, <italic>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</italic>), it was time Africans got back the wealth and resources stolen from their continent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432602">Glickman (2005</xref>) recounts the story of a Nigerian lawyer, Fred Ajudua, who was arrested in 1995 for alleged 4-1-9 activities. Ajudua claimed that the frauds ‘were compensation from white men for slavery and colonialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432602">Glickman, 2005</xref>: 478). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048511432602">Edelson (2003</xref>) reiterated the same assertion that 4-1-9 was a form of ‘payback for colonialism and official corruption’ and disputed the suggestion that the scheme was linked with terrorism by asserting that ‘they [4-1-9 scammers] seem more likely to want to ride in first class, not to bring down the plane’ (2003: 395).</p>
<p>Quantifying the loss incurred by victims of the 4-1-9- advance fee fraud is almost impossible primarily due to the fact that there is no central, global collation center that monitors these fraudulent activities. Besides, not all victims report their loss either through a sense of embarrassment and shame or the avoidance of possible legal consequences for engagement in such illegal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432602">Holt and Graves, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048511432602">Rosenberg (2007)</xref> reported that in 2006 US victims of the scam lost an average of $5,000 each. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048511432602">Ultrascan Advanced Global Investigations Report (2010)</xref> notes that globally over 300,000 people are involved in 4-1-9, scamming a total of US$41 billion to date, with US$9 billion swindled from victims in 2009 alone. The largest reported haul in the scheme took place between a Nigerian female 4-1-9 con artist and Banco Noroeste, a commercial bank in Sao Paulo in Brazil. Between 1995 and 1999 the lady and her associates siphoned a whopping US$242 million from the bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048511432602">Rosenberg, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The 4-1-9 scheme begins with a simple email message to a potential victim. The victim is promised fantastic sums of money just for agreeing to ‘help’ the message sender retrieve a hidden fortune or inheritance or a lucrative business deal for no initial financial investment. But, just when the ‘business’ is about to mature, the scammer will make demands for some advance funds to pay for unanticipated official fees. According to a warning in a press statement circulated on the internet by the Central Bank of Nigeria, ‘the “victim” would be required to pay “advance fees” for various purposes: e.g. processing fees, unforeseen taxes, license fees, registration fees, signing/legal fees, fees for National Economic Recovery Fund, VAT, audit fees, insurance coverage fees etc. The collection of these “advance fees” is actually the real objective of the scam!’ The fact that the scammers demand the would-be victim’s banking information (e.g. bank account) ostensibly to pay in the money when it is released, has nothing to do with the scam itself; it is just a confidence-building measure. It is also not related to the possibility of raiding the victim’s bank account. According to a US Secret Service internet advisory on 4-1-9, ‘It is a misconception that the victim’s bank account is requested so the culprit can plunder it – this is not the primary reason for the account request – merely a signal they have hooked another victim.’</p>
<p>International response to the 4-1-9 phenomenon is massive. Several internet sites are devoted to warning potential victims about the scam. Various Nigerian governments and their agencies have mounted campaigns to warn against 4-1-9, and have enacted laws to criminalize the activity and punish its perpetrators, such as the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act of 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048511432602">Oriola, 2005</xref>). In the Nigerian Central Bank’s press statement mentioned above, the institution boldly warns: ‘DON’T BE FOOLED! MANY HAVE LOST MONEY!! IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT IS NOT TRUE!!!’ The statement pleads with everyone to ‘Please join the CBN and the Federal Government of Nigeria to fight the criminal syndicates who play on the gullibility and greed of their “victims” by reporting any solicitations to your local law enforcement agencies or the local International Police Organisation (Interpol)’ (Central Bank of Nigeria [CBN] Press Release, n.d.). Writing in <italic>Issues in Global Crime</italic>, a publication of the US Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432602">Corsun (1998</xref>) documented the early activities of the 4-1-9 fraudsters and warns about getting involved with them in any way. Other US agencies and various governments around the world have since done the same, and continue to do so. The victims have also been warned against traveling to Nigeria or its neighboring states for the purpose of collecting their loot or meeting their ‘business’ partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432602">Glickman, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432602">Chang (2008</xref>, quoting Thompson, 2003) reports that victims who embark on a mission to Nigeria to recover their lost money only endanger themselves, indicating that as at 1992 about 17 people had been killed while on such a mission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432602">Dyrud (2005</xref>) documents the tragic fate of some of the fraud victims who attempted to travel to Nigeria to reclaim their lost fortune and concluded that ‘despite Internet cautions, people continue to swallow the bait’ (2005: 4).</p>
<p>Despite these warnings and the dangers involved in encounters with 4-1-9 fraudsters, thousands of people around the world continue to take the bait, probably because of the persuasive nature of the email messages sent by 4-1-9ners, in which there is a promise of amassing instant wealth. The generous offers made by the scammers – which can be as much as 35% of a sum worth millions of US dollars for little or no investment initially – appear to be too tempting to resist. By succumbing to this temptation, it would also appear that the ‘victims’ themselves are fraudulent, greedy and possibly naive people who are unfortunate to be outsmarted by people who are more ‘professional’ and adroit in the scam game. Glickman believes that the advance fee fraud continues to grow because ‘the obvious answer is greed, suckerdom, and [a sense of] low cost of profit’ (2005: 480). He noted that having sent out hundreds of thousands of email messages with lucrative offers and deals, all any 4-1-9 person needs to profit from the fraud is one positive response from a recipient of the message.</p>
<p>The literature therefore shows that the 4-1-9 operators are quite creative and savvy in their ‘business’ dealings, and tend to prey on their clients’ naivety and greed.</p>

<title>4-1-9 email analysis with Diction 5.0</title>
<p>Diction 5.0 is a dictionary-based computerized content analysis software designed to analyze text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432602">Lowry, 2008</xref>: 489). It also has the capacity to process volumes of text for quantitative analysis, while enabling the user to qualitatively analyze its output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048511432602">Jarvis, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In developing Diction 5.0, Roderick P Hart produced a program that basically analyses text with the help of 40 dictionaries or word lists in a matter of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048511432602">Hart and Childers, 2004</xref>: 519). Its primary function is to ‘look for certain features of language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048511432602">Hart, 1984</xref>: 14). Hart further explains that ‘lying at the heart of the program are five master variables’ (2001: 45) which are independent and statistically mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>According to the program’s User Manual (2000: 42–48), the five master variables are: (1) Certainty, which is language that indicates ‘resoluteness, inflexibility, and completeness and a tendency to speak ex cathedra.’ (2) Optimism: language that endorses ‘some person, group, concept or event or highlighting their positive elements.’ (3) Activity: language that is conceptualized to suggest ‘movement, change, the implementation of ideas and the avoidance of inertia.’ (4) Realism: the language used in ‘describing tangible, immediate, recognizable matters that affect people’s everyday lives. (5) Commonality: language that highlights ‘agreed-upon values of a group and rejecting idiosyncratic modes of engagement.’</p>
<p>As with other computerized content analysis software, Diction 5.0 is a highly reliable instrument which eliminates subjectivity issues encountered in manually categorizing and coding data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048511432602">Diefendbach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432602">Lowry, 2008</xref>). It has also been used in several earlier studies, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048511432602">Bligh et al. (2004</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048511432602">Loomis and Meyer (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432602">Lowry and Naser (2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since this study is about the use of language in luring people to buy into the hoax peddled by 4-1-9 fraudsters, Diction 5.0 is a most appropriate tool for use in analyzing these email messages sent to the thousands of ‘undisclosed-recipients.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1748048511432602">
<title>Theory and research questions</title>
<p>A typical 4-1-9 advance fee fraud email communication has two major underlying elements: its content; and how that content is presented to the potential victim. The researchers of this study focused on the realm of presentation and chose framing as the most appropriate theoretical prism through which to examine the messages.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432602">Byrant and Miron (2004)</xref> found that framing is one of the most prominent theories used in communication studies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048511432602">Entman (2003</xref>: 417) framing ‘entails selecting and highlighting some facets of events or issues, and making connections among them so as to promote a particular interpretation, evaluation, and/or solution.’ Earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432602">Entman (1991</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048511432602">Gamson (1992</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432602">Graber (2002</xref>) had underscored framing as involving the selection of an aspect of reality or information and presenting it in such a way that limits the decoder’s choice of interpretation to that of the encoder. However, this expectation on the part of the encoder does not always materialize.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432602">Iyengar (1991</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432602">De Vreese et al. (2001</xref>) and later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048511432602">Dimitrova (2006</xref>) all assert that framing has two major categories: episodic and thematic. Essentially, the latter deals with information that is put according to ‘themes’ – a generic classification – while the former focuses on events or issues on an individual basis and in greater detail. In this regard, the 4-1-9 letters obtained for this study tend to be more thematic than episodic.</p>
<p>But, whatever their classificatory status, the objective in 4-1-9 letters is more or less the same: the sender of the email messages anticipates that the recipients will interpret them the way he or she wants, that is, being lured into participating in the scam. And in examining these messages, the features of the sender’s language becomes of paramount concern and importance. This is where the theoretical utility of framing complements our use of Diction 5.0’s master variables which deal with features of language.</p>
<p>In composing and sending out emails, the 4-1-9 fraudsters essentially appeal to the recipients to become involved in the deal they suggest in the communication. In making these appeals, the fraudsters dangle tempting offers or partnerships that are supposed to be mutually beneficial to all participants. Consequently, the first research question in this study asks:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ1</italic>. <italic>What is the most frequently expressed objective in the appeal made by 4-1-9 advance fee fraud scammers in their email messages?</italic>
</p>
<p>The 4-1-9 advance fee fraud scheme is widely acknowledged to have its origins in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432602">Chawki, 2009</xref>) but has since become internationalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432602">Akinladjo, 2007</xref>). Do most of the practitioners of this fraudulent scheme still reside in and operate from Nigeria or have they shifted their operational headquarters to other countries or regions of the world, or indeed have other countries taken over the lead role in the 4-1-9 industry? It is against these issues that we posed the following research questions:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ2. Which region of the world and countries appear most frequently in the 4-1-9 emails as an indication of their origin?</italic>
</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ3</italic>. <italic>Has the within-region origin of the email messages remained the same over the years?</italic>
</p>
<p>The language feature is a vital instrument of persuasion. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432602">Chang (2008</xref>) opines, 4-1-9 scammers are diligent in persuading their potential victims to become involved in the deals they offer. In order to understand the language style adopted in the 4-1-9 letters, we ask a fourth research question:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ4. Which lexical variables appear most prominent in 4-1-9 email communication?</italic>
</p>
<p>Providing answers to these research questions will enhance knowledge and understanding about the unsolicited 4-1-9 email messages.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The main objective in this study is to assess the framing and language features of email communications sent out by 4-1-9 advance fee fraud scammers. Consequently, this study employed content analysis as its main tool of research. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432602">Riffe et al. (2005)</xref> explain, content analysis is ‘the systematic and replicable examination of symbols of communication, which have been assigned numeric values according to valid measurement rules… to describe the communication, draw inferences about its meaning, or infer from the communication to its context, both of production and consumption’ (2005: 25).</p>
<p>In applying this definition, this study not only examined manifest content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048511432602">Berelson, 1952</xref>) but went beyond to examine the email messages with a view to drawing inferences from them. Consequently, 587 advance fee fraud email messages were analyzed in this study.</p>
<p>The sample of 4-1-9 email communication used in this study was drawn from two sources:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Messages obtained from the private and official email accounts of the principal investigator in this study, from 1 August 2009 to 29 February 2010. Three hundred and thirteen (313) messages were obtained from the private ‘yahoo’ email account, while 26 messages were from his official (university) email box. These messages – a total of 339 communications – are not a sample of the 4-1-9 letters obtained from both email accounts; they are the universe of messages that came into the in-box of both email accounts in the period above.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Messages (248) obtained from following websites which store sample 4-1-9 letters sent out to various individuals around the world from 1 December 1998 to 31 March 2006:</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>  http://www.419eater.com/index.php</p>
<p>  http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/nigeria-fraud.html</p>
<p>  http://www.lpconline.com/Nigerian_fraud_sample_index.html</p>
<p>  http://www.quatloos.com/cm-niger/nigerian_scam_letter_museum.htm</p>
<p>The messages used in this study can therefore be classified as a convenience sample. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432602">Riffe et al. (2005)</xref>, a convenience sample can be used in research when the following three criteria are met: (1) when the material is not easy to obtain, (2) there is a lack of resources to generate a random sample and (3) the exploration is of an underresearched but important area. The email letters used in this study meet these recommendations.</p>
<p>Upon collating the email messages, they were converted to a plain text document as required by Diction 5.0, and the data were processed by the software. Thereafter, the output was examined to determine the prevalent lexical variables in the email messages.</p>
<p>Since Diction 5.0 can only provide ‘certain features of language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048511432602">Hart, 1984</xref>: 14) expressed in the lexical structures or master variables (Realism, Certainty, Commonality, Activity and Optimism), we also resorted to manual coding to determine the types of appeal and national origin of the email messages as encapsulated in the research questions. Both researchers in this study did the coding of the email messages. This was preceded by three pre-coding training sessions with email messages not included in this study. To establish inter-coder reliability, the researchers independently coded 60 email messages, which represent 10.22% of the 587 advance fee fraud letters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432602">Wimmer and Dominick (2006)</xref> recommend that a figure between 10 and 25% of the total material used in content analysis is sufficient to establish inter-coder reliability. Consequently, the following inter-coder reliability coefficients were obtained using Scott’s pi, which accounts for agreement by chance: Appeal, .84; Origin, .88. We consider these inter-coder reliability coefficients to be adequate for this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048511432602">Scott (1955</xref>) recommends that an inter-coder reliability coefficient of .80 or above is sufficient for content analysis.</p>
<p>We also examined email messages from the West African region to identify the specific countries from which they were sent. The reason for this will be explained in the discussion section of this study. Finally, we compared the email messages sent between 1998 and 2006 with those sent between 2009 and 2010, in order to determine if there have been any shift in the indication of the origins of these letters.</p>
<p>The 4-1-9 advance fee fraud scheme is based on email communications that belong to the same category as an appeal that involves some money. However, the objectives in the monetary transactions vary, and we have identified them as follows:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Business:</italic> Email that explicitly makes a business proposal to the recipient in the form of a partnership for project execution and profit sharing.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Philanthropy:</italic> Email that asks the recipient to accept the entire fund and use it for projects that benefit humankind, e.g. building schools, hospitals and churches. The message sender does not want any part of the money.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Humanitarian:</italic> Email that asks the recipient to assist the sender in retrieving what he/she (sender) was left in a will or bank account by his/her parents, husband, wife, significant other or relative. The rationale for this invitation is that there are powerful people (usually related to the dead person) that are poised to deprive the message sender of his/her legitimate inheritance. The recipient is promised a handsome reward for his or her support.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Other:</italic> Emails that do not belong any of the above.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
We concede that the examination of the email address of an electronic message may not be a reliable measure of its origin. For instance, it is not easy to decipher the origin of an email message with an ‘@yahoo.com’ or ‘gmail.com’ address as the sender could be operating from anywhere in the world. However, since we are interested in the region of the world and countries that appear most frequently in the 4-1-9 emails as an indication of their origin, we came up with a system that is a reasonable indicator of the origin of such messages. This method entailed looking for where the fraudster indicates in the message that the money or business deal being mentioned is located, which is often where he or she is based. This method is also supported by the fact that the scammers often invite their collaborators to visit them as further proof of the authenticity of the deal. Some of the would-be victims are known to have made such trips, as mentioned in the literature review section. Consequently, we examined the predominant region and nations that appeared most frequently in the email messages.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 4-1-9 international advance fee fraud scheme is predicated on persuasive messages from the fraudsters to their potential victims. Consequently, this study investigated the most frequently indicated objective in the appeal used to attract the attention and participation of message recipients to the scam. It also examined the lexical characteristics of the email messages.</p>
<p>Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048511432602">Table 1a</xref> indicate that the most frequently used objective in the appeal in 4-1-9 email communications is about a mutually profitable Business transaction. This form of objective was found in 63% of the messages examined in this study, and provides a response to the first research question. This is further corroborated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048511432602">Table 1b</xref>, which specifically examines the scam messages from West Africa, where 64% of the messages were about business partnerships, and the chi square result, χ<sup>2</sup>(d.f. = 24) = 2.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>N</italic> = 447, shows that significant differences exist in the emphasis placed on the objectives in the appeal of the messages sent by scammers from various countries in the region. Consequently, the fraudsters in Burkina Faso (91%) and Nigeria (68%) concentrated their attention on ‘business’ messages, while those in Cote d’Ivoire focused on the ‘philanthropic’ message.</p>

<p>Another primary concern in this study is to establish the origin of the 4-1-9 letters. As indicated in the literature review, it is generally assumed that the letters predominantly come from Nigeria in West Africa. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1748048511432602">Table 2</xref>
confirm that most of the messages originated from West Africa (76%), while <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1748048511432602">Table 3</xref>
shows that 40% of the letters emanating from that region come from Nigeria, with 33% from Burkina Faso and 15% from Cote d’Ivoire. The response to the second research question therefore is that most of the 4-1-9 letters originate from the West African region and more specifically from Nigeria.</p>

<p>As also noted in the literature section, the 4-1-9 scam may have had its roots in Nigeria but it might have spread to other countries, most likely those within the West African region. This necessitated the examination of the email messages across two periods: December 1998 to March 2006; and August 2009 to February 2010. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1748048511432602">Table 4</xref>
show that while Nigeria (87%) was the principal source of the email communication in the period (1998–2006), by the second period (2009–2010), Burkina Faso (57%), also in West Africa, had overtaken Nigeria as the major source of the email messages. Consequently, the response to the third research question is that the main origin of the scam email messages has not remained the same over the years.</p>

<p>The fourth research question is about the main features of the language employed by the scammers in their email messages, since their success largely depends on how persuasive they come across to their victims. The Diction 5.0 analysis results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1748048511432602">Table 5</xref>
show that Realism is the most prominent lexical feature in the language used by the email fraudsters to frame their messages to their recipients. It is worth noting however that Optimism is another feature that is almost as prominent as Realism in the email messages (both are in the 51-point range).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The 4-1-9 international advance fee scam is a concerted design and strategy to lure recipients of unsolicited email messages into a plot that will ostensibly enrich them for little or no investment, but which ends up swindling them of their resources.</p>
<p>While it is arguable that the con artists involved in this scam may not have formal expertise and experience in communication as an academic discipline or profession, it is evident that they employ the theoretical techniques of framing in their email messages. Their strategy is to use a thematic approach to message construction: an overall appeal for participation in a deal that has a handsome financial reward. Here is an example. A scammer who goes by the name ‘Mr. Natan Williams,’ and claims to be ‘a senior staff in file department, Bank of Africa (BOA), Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso,’ assured the recipient that ‘30% of this money ($22.5 million) will be for you as foreign partner’ (email dated 20 February 2010).</p>
<p>This reward-centered thematic approach to framing email messages appears to be designed to achieve a number of objectives. First, the message encoder attempts to limit the decoder’s latitude in message interpretation, which is the essence in framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432602">Entman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048511432602">Gamson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432602">Graber, 2002</xref>), by highlighting a monetary reward for participation in a deal that has no financial commitments, at least initially. Second, the message is persuasively framed, not by the power of argument but by the logic of incentive and huge material benefit such as the ‘30% of $22.5 million’ involved in the example above. Third, the concept of ‘trust’ is brought in to reinforce the financial reward. For instance, in the same email message above, the sender ends by making a pledge that: ‘I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is <italic>hitch free</italic> and that you should not <italic>entertain any atom of fear</italic> as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer’ (emphasis added).</p>
<p>The more ‘experienced’ and ‘professional’ 4-1-9 con artists tend to go farther in exploring ‘trust’ as an element of reinforcing their persuasive messages. In an email message of 19 February 2010, the sender, who described himself as ‘Mr. Aman Amir manager of a bank in Asia-India,’ offers his potential collaborator 25% of $4.3 million and adds a caveat: ‘But I really need to be convinced that <italic>I can totally rely on you to carry out this deal and also keep the money</italic> until I meet with you in your country’ (emphasis added). In other words, the onus of ‘trust’ has been shifted by the sender, who implicitly vouches for his/her trustworthiness and reliability, to the message recipient. The sender further demonstrates his/her level of trustworthiness by pledging to leave the money in the hands of an ‘unknown’ recipient, if only the recipient can show evidence of reciprocating the same level of integrity and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>This framing strategy is directly linked to our message content analysis using the Diction 5.0 software, which is well-suited for analyzing features of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048511432602">Hart, 1984</xref>). This also takes us to another level in this discussion. When the email messages were analyzed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1748048511432602">Table 5</xref>) Realism emerged as the most prevalent lexical feature of the language used in the communications. Realism, according to Diction 5.0 user manual (2000: 46), is language that describes ‘tangible, immediate, recognizable matters that affect people’s everyday lives.’ By using huge monetary rewards as a form of bait, the scammers are sufficiently aware that they are leveraging a tangible, immediate and recognizable issue that affects people in their everyday lives in executing their plans. The content of their emails also draws on another lexical quality: Optimism; as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1748048511432602">Table 5</xref> shows, the use of Optimism is nearly as prevalent as that of Realism. Optimism is a language feature that endorses an idea by putting emphasis on its positive elements. All 4-1-9 email messages examined in this study had a positive ring about them: the assurance that the deals will definitely lead to rewards. Where necessary, the writers will use the element of trust and tempting rewards expressed in attractive percentages to reassure the message recipients about how good and rewarding the deals are.</p>
<p>If framing and the use of effective and persuasive language features have been identified in this study as the strategies used by the 4-1-9 scam merchants, their tactics tend to lie in the objectives in the appeals to the recipients of these unsolicited email messages. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048511432602">Table 1</xref> indicates that the Business objective is the most commonly used (63%) in these communications. This involves a straightforward proposal to the recipient to become involved in a deal with the promise of a percentage of the profit.</p>
<p>This no-investment-high-reward proposal has led scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432602">Glickman (2005</xref>) to conclude that the victims of the 4-1-9 scams are also people with questionable business ethics themselves, if not outright crooks. This position appears to have some merit. For instance, in an email business proposal of 28<sup> </sup>November, 2009 from ‘Mr. Khaled Mohamed Faitour,’ who described himself as the ‘Foreign Remittance Director Banque Commerciale du Burkina Ouagadougou,’ the sender, like his counterparts in the scam, tried to establish trust by demanding that ‘If you are really sure of your, Trust worthiness, Accountability and confidentiality on this transaction, contact me and accept not to change your mind to cheat, or disappoint me when the deposited funds is released to you by our bank.’ But unlike most of his associates, he promised to offer the recipient a whopping 45% of the US$22.5 deal, while he takes 50%, leaving 5% for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction. And all he required from the recipient were: ‘Full Name, Address, Telephone number, Country.’ For a 22.5-million-dollar business, these requirements do not appear to be substantial. We believe that it is reasonable, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048511432602">Peel (2006)</xref> does, to cast aspersions on the motives of whoever subscribes to this type of deal.</p>
<p>To an extent, a similar argument can be made with respect to the victims of the 4-1-9 scams with a Humanitarian appeal. This is a case where the sender pleads with the recipient to assist in the recovery of an inheritance. The case of the email message from ‘Miss Evelyn Koroma,’ a self-identified citizen of Sierra Leone who resides in Abidjan, Ivory Coast in West Africa, illustrates this scenario. In her 4-1-9 email (24 September 2009), she said her late father, ‘Ernest Koroma,’ a former naval officer and gold and diamond merchant, had left her and her younger brother the sum of US$15.5 million in a fixed deposit in a bank in Abidjan. She wants the email recipient to help her transfer the money out of Ivory Coast for investment purposes. Since she and her brother are students and orphans, she wants the recipient to arrange for their continued education in the recipient’s country and invest the inheritance on their behalf. She offers 20% of the amount to this portfolio manager. Our conclusion on this type of deal is that to accept this generous offer of slightly over US$3 million just for being nominated a guardian and investment manager by an unknown person, and most likely without the requisite professional competence, equally leaves a trail of suspicious intentions.</p>
<p>The case of the Philanthropic appeal appears to be somewhat different. Here, the message sender only wants to donate a fortune to the recipient for the sole purpose of carrying out some designated philanthropic activities for no explicitly stated personal gain to the recipient. A case in point is that of ‘Mrs. Miami Al-Musallam,’ a Kuwait national whose husband, ‘Dr. Husain Al-Musallam,’ was said to be a diplomat in the Kuwait embassy in Cote d’Ivoire for nine years before he died in 2003. Both of them are Christians. Her late husband had left her US$3.2 million in a bank in Cote d’Ivoire. But, because she has been diagnosed with cancer, and had recently suffered a stroke, doctors gave her no more than three months to live. ‘Mrs Al-Musallam’ is childless, and since none of her husband’s relatives shares their Christian belief, she does not want ‘the money to be misused by unbelievers.’ She wants a trustworthy person or Church to inherit the money ‘for churches, orphanages, widows, less privileged for propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.’</p>
<p>Being a victim of this type of fraud laced with philanthropic appeal, especially for someone who is a devout Christian, and probably of the Pentecostal denomination, might not attract as much opprobrium or suspicion of greed as in the other types of appeal. Nonetheless, one can justifiably query why the recipient would accept the privilege of being singled out of millions of people by an unknown person for this messianic and philanthropic mission.</p>
<p>In addition to the appeals embedded in these 4-1-9 email communications, their origin also demands attention. As already noted, various scholars believe that these scam emails originated from West Africa and more specifically Nigeria. This contention is sustained by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1748048511432602">Table 2</xref>, which shows that 76% of the letters examined in this study emanated from the West African region. Our within-region analysis also shows that Nigeria (40%) is the country from where a majority of the letters are sent.</p>
<p>However, given that the scam is generally accepted to have started in the late 1970s or early 1980s, but now the scammers virtually have a global reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432602">Akinladejo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432602">Smith et al., 1999</xref>), the segmentation of our data into periods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1748048511432602">Table 4</xref>) becomes important. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1748048511432602">Table 4</xref> show that while Nigeria was the major operational center of the scam in West Africa in the 1998–2006 period (87%), its market share of the fraud declined to 13% in the 2009–2010 period. Burkina Faso, which now leads in the origin of the letters (57%), used to account for just 1% in the first period. Countries such as Cote d’Ivoire (65%) and Ghana (6%) appear to have also dislodged Nigeria as the main sources of these scam emails from West Africa.</p>
<p>We did not specifically investigate the reasons for this shift. However, we suggest that it is possible that the worldwide focus on Nigeria as the epicenter of the scam, coupled with sustained international effort to curb the crime and apprehend the criminals, might have contributed to the scammers diversifying their operational zones. Besides, as expressed in the literature section of this study, Nigeria has toughened its anti-419 laws, possibly making it more difficult for the con artists to operate from the country.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, since modern technology is now exponentially facilitating the activities of the 4-1-9 scammers (Buchanan and Grant, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432602">Holt and Graves, 2007</xref>), we cannot categorically say that as the figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1748048511432602">Table 4</xref> suggest, fewer people are now involved in the scam from Nigeria as opposed to other countries in the region. If fewer 4-1-9 emails now originate from Nigeria, it is plausible that the scammers have availed themselves of the vast opportunities offered by modern technology to embark on a virtual, as opposed to a physical, relocation of their operational headquarters to other countries in the region and beyond. It is also plausible that given the financial gains made through the 4-1-9 fraud, indigenous scammers in Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and other countries in the region and beyond have also become active entrepreneurs in the illegal business.</p>
<p>Our main point here is that while it may be true that the 4-1-9 scam started in Nigeria, it might now a myth to assume that its perpetrators are limited to one nationality: Nigeria. By focusing only on Nigeria, this myth has the potential to expose people all over the world to believe in the authenticity of 4-1-9 letters that do not originate from that country.</p>
<p>Finally, the poor quality of English grammar used in the 4-1-9 messages merits some attention. Since we did not interview the 4-1-9 con artists or their victims, we cannot categorically explain why such evidently grammatical flaws inundate the email messages. However, we suspect that the explanation lies between these two possibilities: (a) some of the scammers might have real handicaps in terms of their mastery of English language or (b) the poor grammatical construction might be a part of the scammers’ strategic deception of their potential victims, especially Europeans, into believing that they (scammers) are naive, uneducated and less intelligent folks who need supposedly wiser benefactors to help them acquire wealth, even fortunes left to them by their spouses or parents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048511432602">Peel (2006)</xref> regards this latter view as part of the psychology of being a con artist.</p>
<p>Our position however is that this manifestly poor grammatical structure of the 4-1-9 email messages notwithstanding, the messages are so sophisticatedly framed and persuasively presented with words that indicate immediate, recognizable and tangible material benefit (money) that affects everyone irrespective of color or creed, that their recipients find them incredibly hard to ignore.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This lexical study of the 4-1-9 advance fee fraud email communication shows that the effectiveness of the scammers lies in using language features that dwell on materialism to persuade their victims to take their bait. This satisfies our basic objective of examining how the scammers frame their messages such that their victims buy into their fraud. On the other hand, this study also reinforces the power of framing as a tool of persuasion. In framing their messages, the 4-1-9 merchants employed the notion of trustworthiness to underscore their sincerity in their business, philanthropic or humanitarian proposals. And, the Business appeal is the main tactic in their overall strategy to hoodwink their victims. But, while their email messages initially originated from Nigeria in West Africa, it appears that more scammers have joined the business across the globe.</p>
<p>There is no certainty regarding why some people fall for this scam despite several warnings against doing so on a variety of websites, by the US State Department and even various government agencies in Nigeria and other countries. This could be the subject of another study.</p>
<p>Perhaps our method of determining the origin of the letters is one area of insufficient strength in this study. Here, we were constrained by modern technology, which virtually shields where the messages come from. Perhaps a more technological savvy approach might take care of this problem. Second, using a convenience sample imposes limitations in making research generalizations and conclusions on the basis of our findings. We recommend these as areas future research should explore. Equally worthy of examination are the opportunities which the new social media such as Facebook and Twitter might have inadvertently opened up for the 4-1-9 scamming agents.</p>
<p>The main strength in this study, however, lies in the uniqueness and novelty of doing a study that examined the lexical characteristics of the 4-1-9 email communications and their implications to message recipients, whereas other studies have focused mostly on the legal aspects of the scam and how the scammers utilize modern technology to boost their trade.</p>
