<abstract>
<p>This article is inspired both by the radical feminist work of Daly and the post/modern possibilities of deconstruction. The author adopts a monstrous textual form to show and warn fellow voyagers in the academic mode of production that challenging exclusion and assimilation involves thinking beyond existing forms and going beyond “methodolatory”. Shelley’s <italic>Frankenstein</italic> provides the basis for a feminist gothic approach that emphasizes research as a written, passionate, and embodied process with consequences for the researcher and the researched. The article asserts the narrative inevitability of intertextuality, examines the gendering of knowledge, and presents a discursive challenge to the subject/object binary.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The starting point of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077800411434278">Paul Ricoeur’s (1992)</xref> work on the link between narrative and identity is Aristotle’s <italic>Poetics</italic>. This text from 4BCE is also the key source for contemporary Hollywood screenwriters (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077800411434278">Vogler, 1998</xref>). Aristotle states that the purpose of a plot is to organize a diversity of incidents into the harmony of a story, a story that is told. This story is “an unstable compromise between the dispersion of events and the unity of a plot” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077800411434278">Ricoeur, 1992</xref>, p. 39). The plot provides a means of organization for sense making. Ricoeur’s work considers the possibility that characters in a story are told and plotted in much the same way as the actions. From this he develops the idea that identity is formed in narrative and “relies on the capacity to tell a story about oneself, or maybe several stories . . . our story is also a part in the story of others” (p. 39). Ricoeur therefore regards literature as, “a huge laboratory of thought experiments” and personal identity as, “the result . . . of the internalization of narrative models which I find in my culture” (p. 39).</p>
<p>During doctoral work exploring the dilemmas facing a social researcher working in the UK poverty industry under Thatcherism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800411434278">Madden, 2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley’s (1831/1963)</xref> <italic>Frankenstein</italic> became the sense-making text that guided me in encounters with the restrictive discipline(s) of social science. As a researcher and advocate, I was concerned that I was contributing to the representational denigration of the young homeless people with whom I worked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411434278">Madden, 2002/2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800411434278">Madden 2003</xref>). Against a conservative idealization of the Victorian home and the rebirth of the urban underclass, I made an attempt to contextualize and historicize processes of knowing by experimenting with form to highlight relationships between form and content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077800411434278">Madden, 2010</xref>). Like many women before me, when faced with misery and absurdity I ventured into the arts of “sensation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800411434278">Pykett, 1992</xref>). As I inhabited high contrast political landscapes of good and evil, my writing took on a gothic flavor and I narrated myself and the people with whom I worked as “‘figure[s]’ against the ‘ground’ of culturally given [gothic and social scientific] images of ‘the self’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800411434278">Parker, 2005</xref>, p. 71).</p>
<p>In <italic>Frankenstein</italic>, the teenage runaway Shelley debates enlightenment ideas about knowledge, sentiment, and reason; in particular, the ideas of Rousseau that paved the way for romanticism. Victor Frankenstein (a researcher) and his creature (a research subject/object composed from the bodies of the poor and assorted animals) are two disillusioned, debating creatures of the enlightenment. The possible existence of a third figure, the discarded-before-created “female” creature, hints at possibilities outside of the dichotomies of masculine romance and rationality; things that “have hitherto remained unknown, terrifying, monstrous: . . . mad, unconscious, improper, unclean, non-sensical, oriental, profane” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800411434278">Jardine, 1985</xref>, p. 73). Frankenstein feared that “she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made [between ‘men’] before her creation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 167). Intrigued by the potential of this feminized “Other” voice to disturb binary thinking, I sought out its or her power to haunt and disrupt the disturbingly violent and restricting late twentieth century neo-gothic rationalities that were perpetuating inequalities.</p>

<title>A Journey into Metaphor</title>
<p>Frankenstein regards his creature, the product of his research, as horrifying and monstrous at the moment he realizes that it will acquire its own subjectivity. While piecing his anatomical mechanism together, he sees the parts of his project as objects of beauty. The horror comes when epistemology shifts to ontology and it is clear that the creature will have its own embodied subjectivity. Its dull yellow eye opens and the creature gains the power to look back at its creator: “Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 61), Frankenstein abandons his creation.</p>
<p>Shelley writes ambivalence into Frankenstein’s desire to pass on the terrible knowledge acquired in his transgressive studies:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted. . . Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge . . . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 56)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Frankenstein’s ambivalence is understandable. His quest for knowledge led to the creation of things he could not control; just as it is impossible to control how any narrative is consumed by readers and policy makers. No author is immune to the anxiety this causes. It is with this in mind that I explain how I became Frankenstein, his monster and more. This extraordinary form is the result of what some might consider an unhealthy appetite for knowledge. Philosophy is the genius that regulated my fate and reformed me: “I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelly, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 42). This is an assembly that provides a metaphoric warning for fellow travelers dabbling in the dirt of the academic mode of production. Listen and learn that neither desire nor detachment will protect you from the risk of being changed by what you do—perhaps, utterly. For in the process of observing ourselves, it is important to attend to Roger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077800411434278">Smith’s (1997)</xref> question, “Do we not make ourselves into something different?” (p. 15).</p>
<p>I was a community/social welfare worker in pursuit of further knowledge about the factors that created poverty and so I re-entered the academy. I had long been an ill, though paradoxically devoted, disciple of a number of disciplines, interested in theories both “musty” and “trendy” and with an ardent devotion to application. Publicly eschewing what I feared might be perceived as a frivolous desire for art and literature. I began to conduct my researches in the persona of a “social scientist,” a persona I soon found confining. Developing a passion for knowledge in the social sciences had the incongruous effect of putting passion and knowledge in conflict with each other. Academia set logos, head, knowledge, reason, and authority to war with pathos, body, emotion, dependence, and obedience. I was torn in my attractions between the academic master’s detached cerebral self-control and the domestic mistresses’ ability to indulge full physical feeling. I shared with Frankenstein a view that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The ambition of the inquirer [in this discipline] seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science [and art] was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411434278">Game (1991)</xref> I found “contemporary sociology as a form of writing particularly closed, and at its worst, authoritarian in form of address” (p. 18). Nevertheless, I shared Frankenstein’s “almost supernatural enthusiasm” for intense study and while attending to my new lessons, I continued to seek out those writers that would encourage a growing interest and disdain for parts of what I’m sure Frankenstein would consider another “would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 45).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077800411434278">
<title>The Distance Between Words and Things</title>
<p>I was working in a discipline riddled with the anxiety that unless a rigid boundary between knowledge and fiction was maintained, social science texts would lose their content of truth and philosophy would lapse into poetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411434278">Barrett, 1999</xref>). It seemed that the very vividness of writing jeopardized the dull ideal of abstracted, uncontaminating researcher neutrality that was a requisite part of good social scientific practice. An insecure, empiricist fetishization of the “real” combined with a crude scientism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411434278">1</xref></sup> to produce a defense against all passion in the social sciences that led to “a genre of stories and texts that have at least one thing in common-they are usually monstrously boring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077800411434278">Rudberg, 1997</xref>, p. 94).</p>
<p>I learned that the content of research reports was not to be obscured by an obvious writing style that would “get in the way.” So, I practiced the textual art of separating knower from known, made futile attempts to abolish the distance between words and things and refined the techniques of report writing that perpetuated the fiction “that research is reported, not written” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411434278">Barthes, 1986</xref>, p. 70). This attention to dullness manifested itself in my writing, which made such deadly reading as I too aspired to objective, unambiguous, precise, noncontextual, and nonmetaphorical language. Yet as Laurel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077800411434278">Richardson (1990)</xref> said and everyone knew “even the ‘plainest’ scientific writing used literary devices to constitute value and convey meaning” (pp. 119-124). The idea that metaphor might be avoided in the social sciences was ludicrous. The whole idea of a social “system,” or “structure” was itself metaphorical (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411434278">Derrida, 1978</xref>, p. 278).</p>
<p>There were of course those in the social sciences who were critical of the self-defeating desire to banish life from language. Some had long advocated a freer “sociological imagination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411434278">Mills, 1959</xref>) while others were willfully “turning to language” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411434278">Burman &amp; Parker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077800411434278">Wetherell, Taylor, &amp; Yates, 2001</xref>) and calling attention to the forms through which they produced and inhabited knowledge:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The essays collected here . . . see culture as composed of seriously contested codes and representations; they assume that the poetic and the political are inseparable, that science is in, not above, historical and linguistic processes. They assume that academic and literary genres interpenetrate and that the writing of cultural descriptions is properly experimental and ethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411434278">Clifford, 1986</xref>, p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I sought out this kind of sentiment but soon began to recognize what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411434278">Debbie Oates (2001)</xref> later described, “that whilst such ideas have been widely accepted and (re)explored, most of the exploration is on the level of theory, an <italic>application</italic> of such ideas is less common.” This journal is an exception to the rule. To apply such ideas was to take risks with credibility.</p>

<title>The Gendering of Knowledge</title>
<p>I became increasingly perplexed by the art of the social scientist, a creature that seemed to me to be burdened with the task of separating the inseparable: arts from sciences, observation from action, and mind from body. This is to match the ambition of those philosophers who have been credited with the performance of miracles. Waldman, one of Frankenstein’s tutors, celebrated the achievements of such men, those who displaced the alchemists:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They penetrate into the recesses of nature, and show how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the heavens: they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such philosophers gained a great vantage-point when they rose out of their bodies and above the earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800411434278">2</xref></sup> But what a strange fantasy that is, the possibility of ascension into a heaven of pure mind! As Adriana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411434278">Cavarero (1995)</xref> states, “[i]n effect the philosopher abandons the world of his own birth in order to establish his abode in pure thought” (p. 38). What kind of life could there be in such deathly disembodiment?</p>
<p>The promise of power in the penetration of secrets filled me with an excitement made up of unequal parts repulsion and attraction. Adriana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411434278">Cavarero (1995)</xref> cautioned me to remember that although Athena was Greek goddess of wisdom, the symbolic order of western philosophy of which Athena is part, constructs women as absent, ignorant/naïve, or as driven female mentor or vessel whose purpose is to bring truth to “man.” So, while women and their bodies may signify and contain knowledge, women are not credited with the capacity to know:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Thus we find a subtle and ambiguous symbolic game. It almost seems as though women (excluded from the realm of thought both in reality and because of the “unthinkability” of their gender) become the sacrificial food for the journey towards the realm of philosophy that will exclude them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411434278">Cavarero 1995</xref>, p. 39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My desire to understand the feminized workings of nature’s body was tempered by a fear that my gaze into her living inside implied death, not only for her, but also for me. I aspired little towards the command of thunders or the mimicry of earthquakes. I remain to this day, however, filled with a great enthusiasm to celebrate the open secrets of life and a desire to mock the deathly, disembodied, invisible world with its living fleshy shadows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800411434278">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Seeking Threads of Connectedness</title>
<p>Mine is an uneasy and ferocious devotion to knowledge. My engagement comes laced with the desire to explode and rebuild, and with a devotion to the pleasure and danger of resurrecting bodies of knowledge incarcerated by the “grave keepers of tradition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, pp. xiii-xiv). I relished the possibility of “opening the coffers/coffins in which ‘knowledge’ has been stored, re-stored, re-covered . . . seeking the threads of connectedness within artificially separated/segmented reality [and] starting to put the severed parts together” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, pp. xiii-xiv). This was not in a naive assumption that it was possible to reveal or work a “truer” alternative or more complete pattern of reality but with a desire to acknowledge and take pleasure in constructive processes that sought to cultivate knowledges and possibilities of difference. With Virginia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077800411434278">Woolf (1976)</xref> I felt I might be able to</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>make it real by putting it into words. It is only by putting into words that I make it whole; this wholeness means that it has lost its power to hurt me; it gives me, perhaps because by doing so I take away the pain, a great delight to put the severed parts together. (p. 72)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Written from a point of exclusion from masculinist constructions of the subject, I recognized Woolf’s desire for “wholeness” not as naïve holism but as an expression of the desire to articulate flourishing “other” ways of being. I dreamed of constructing my own literary journey away from paralyzing fragmentation and deathly abstraction. I celebrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411434278">Cixous’s (1981)</xref> bold assertion that, “writing is precisely working (in) the in-between, inspecting the process of the same and of the other without which nothing can live, undoing the work of death” (p. 254). I did not want to be confined to the artificial limitations of dichotomous thinking. Why be confined to “either/or” when one could have the promise of “both, and . . . ”? From Woolf, Cixous and Morrison (1993) and from my own initial studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800411434278">Madden, 1995</xref>), I began to see writing as a potentially generative process: “word-work is sublime, she thinks, because it is generative; it makes meaning that secures our difference . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411434278">Morrison, 1997</xref>, p. 50).</p>

<title>Re-Visioning</title>
<p>One day, “partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 50), Frankenstein found his way into Waldman’s lessons while I found myself in Professor Stanley’s Women’s Studies. There, under the very noses of great grave keepers, I witnessed others emerging from encryption in the libraries that had trapped them in basket weaving and folklore boxes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077800411434278">4</xref></sup> Once out, they engaged in vigorous eating and mental training in order to face the contortions ahead, preparing to leap, “over the walls that separate the halls in which academics have incarcerated the ‘bodies of knowledge’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, pp. xii-xiv). Here, at last, I found an interdisciplinary place where I was encouraged to, “open the coffers/coffins in which ‘knowledge’ had been stored, re-stored and re-covered,” to seek out the “threads of connectedness within artificially separated/segmented reality,” and to strive “to put the severed parts together” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, pp. xii-xiv). Professor Stanley termed this the de/construction of research knowledge.</p>
<p>It was here that I relearned what I already knew but always “disremembered” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077800411434278">Morrison, 1987</xref>, p. 274), that she must not only know the works of the Masters but also go much further. She must heed the warnings of Lorde, Woolf, and Smith that the apparatuses of knowing are also apparatuses of ruling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077800411434278">Smith, 1990</xref>). Together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800411434278">Lorde (1984)</xref> we asked, “[w]hat does it mean when the tools of racist patriarchy are used to examine the fruits of that same patriarchy? It means that only the most narrow perimeters of change are possible and allowable” (pp. 110-113). We recognized that the “master’s tools” could not be used unchanged to remake “the house,” the academic institution. Instead, they had to be themselves dismantled. We asked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077800411434278">Woolf’s (1938/1998b)</xref> question of ourselves as Outsiders:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Shall I ask them to rebuild the college on the old lines? Or shall I ask them to rebuild it, but differently? Or shall I ask them to buy rags and petrol and Bryant and May’s matches and burn the college to the ground? (p. 198)</p>

<p>With Daly and Woolf, we took a common “vow of derision” and pledged ourselves to see through the grave keepers and make them transparent to other Voyagers as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, p. xiv).</p>

<p>[T]he act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction – [it] is for us more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival. Until we can understand the assumptions in which we are drenched we cannot know ourselves. And this drive to self-knowledge, for women, is more than a search for identity: it is part of her refusal of the self-destructiveness of male-dominated society (pp. 90-91). </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I determined that in this intertextualizing process of re-visioning I would not reconstruct a simple narrative of progress. A bildungsroman wasn’t the type of example I wanted to make of myself. Although it could chart the life of a woman or a man, I found it an ill-fitting form that presumed a masculine protagonist. As Hans-Georg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800411434278">Gadamer (1975)</xref> states,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The rise of the word Bildung calls . . . on the ancient mystical tradition, according to which man carries in his soul the image of God after whom he is fashioned and must cultivate it in himself . . . It is the universal nature of human Bildung to constitute itself as a universal intellectual being . . . Hence Bildung, as being raised to the universal, is a task for man. It requires the sacrifice of particularity for the sake of the universal. (pp. 12-13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I was uneasy about sacrificing particularity for the sake of a universal and had no intention of reflecting god sized images of intellectual “man” back to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077800411434278">5</xref></sup> I decided I would actively resist reproducing the mechanisms for his inflation in my story and not be confined to the “acceptable/unexceptional circular reasonings of academics that are mere caricatures of motion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, p. 23). I determined that mine was to be a metaphorical otherworld journey: A journey of becoming that would take me a long way away from fixed forms and static “ologies.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077800411434278">6</xref></sup> The journey I embarked on would lead me to examine the power dichotomy “knower” and “known,” re-acknowledge the significance of “high” and “low” cultural regimes of representation and confirm that social science discourses are productive rather than merely reflective of identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800411434278">Madden, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>First I had to ready myself. By day, I busied myself gathering and re-assembling. I chose a beautifully crafted portable workbasket and filled it with all that had inspired me to date, regardless of its disciplinary acceptability. This basket of sources and resources served as a matrix for my re-assembly. It contained food, water, ink, mirrors, music, memories, curves, colors, yarn, and other tools and ingredients of domestic literary alchemy. In amongst these I placed selected works begun by physicians, lexicographers, and madmen including Dr. Peter Mark Roget, Dr. James Murray, and Dr. W. C. Minor (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077800411434278">Winchester, 1999</xref>). I had been warned that the grave keepers of tradition would continue to bar my way unless I was equipped with the correct passwords. It was imperative that I gather words, keep adding to my studies, and begin to write myself; for, the transgressive parts of me “easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the[m] . . ., I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 116).</p>
<p>I called on Theuth, the Egyptian god of writing and Maat, the Egyptian goddess of truth to guide my journey and bless my basket of tricks and then set about relearning the science of letters and the art of language as if I were a stranger to it, “and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 121). Theuth fancied himself god/doctor/pharmacist/magician:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]his messenger-god is truly a god of the absolute passage between opposites . . . he is precisely the god of nonidentity . . . The god of writing. . . He cannot be assigned a fixed spot in the play of differences. Sly, slippery and masked, an intriguer and a card . . . a floating signifier, a wild card, one who puts play into play. . . Every act of his is marked by this unstable ambivalence. This god of calculation, arithmetic and rational science also presides over the occult sciences, astrology and alchemy. He is the god of magic formulas that calm the sea, of secret accounts, of hidden texts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411434278">Derrida, 1981</xref>, p. 93)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maat and I wondered how fixed and assigned this god’s “he” identity could be.</p>
<p>Despite or perhaps because of our slipperiness, Theuth and Maat helped me to adopt strange forms and experience the power of experimental articulation. I discovered the joy and impertinence of what Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077800411434278">Shapiro (2001)</xref> terms <italic>insurrectional textuality</italic> (p. 320). I began to pursue a writing practice different from the familiar explicitly argumentative form. One that I hoped might prove “resistant to familiar modes of representation, one that is self-reflective enough to show how meaning and writing practices are radically entangled in general or one that tends to denaturalize familiar realities by employing impertinent grammars and figurations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077800411434278">Shapiro, 2001</xref>, p. 320).</p>
<p>My insurrection meant I was no longer willing to participate in and perpetuate a fiction of selective knowledge production. This would have limited me to the ludicrous idea that my “knowing” was only informed by the appropriate canon and not by film, TV, gossip, action, friends, an inner-city Catholic upbringing, a brother who is a fan of science fiction and horror, and so on. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077800411434278">Shapiro (2001)</xref> says,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[i]nsofar as ‘social reality’ emerges in various writing genres, investigations of how the world is apprehended require inquiries into various pre-texts of apprehension, for the meaning and value imposed on the world is structured not by one’s immediate consciousness but by the various reality making scripts one inherits or acquires from one’s surrounding cultural/linguistic condition. (p. 318)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I began to focus on the “pre-texts of apprehension” that produced assumptions about contemporary homelessness and poverty. Reconceiving myself in this way brought its pleasures and many sleepless nights as I wrestled with the return of the repressed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, pp. 51-52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I had to do much in order to pay heed to previously suppressed or discredited knowledges and to make sense of the re-emerging and remembered science<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077800411434278">7</xref></sup> of the “female” monster. A concern for the dissected and re-assembled led me to biology. I found much of interest in its stories of the quick and the dead: “As a way of knowing the world it is kin to Romantic literature with its discourse about Organic form and function” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800411434278">Haraway, 1992a</xref>, p. 5). As Waldman told Frankenstein:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, pp. 52-53)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Good advice. Nor should the artful woman of science neglect alchemy, despite the grave keepers’ presentation of it as a rather dated and unsuccessful wizards’ game. I learned much about magical compositional processes and the potential benefits of putting the unlikely into combination from metaphorical adventures in alchemy. Waldman acknowledged the gifts left to the modern masters of knowledge by the alchemical fathers: “[They] had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 52). However, he also told Frankenstein that “the labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 52). But, this is not true. The 20th century made it plain, if it wasn’t before, that there is no such thing as innocent knowledge. As Frankenstein found out, the quest for knowledge, even on the basis of good intentions, is in itself absolutely no guarantor against horror. Walter Benjamin knew that “[t]here is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism” (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077800411434278">Shohat &amp; Stam, 1994</xref>, p. 88).</p>

<sec id="section7-1077800411434278">
<title>The Quest for Gold</title>
<p>Although Waldman’s “modern masters” of science claimed to “promise very little, they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 51), they nevertheless seemed to share Victor Frankenstein’s huge ambitions. For all their disavowal of the alchemical quest for gold, at the root of much of their work lay the desire to turn base material into products of permanence, purity, and value. This was evident in their wish to transcend their own bodies and transform the bodies of others into tradable knowledge: “Knowledge is and will be produced in order to be sold, it is and will be consumed in order to be valorized in a new production: in both cases, the goal is exchange” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411434278">Lyotard, 1992</xref>, p. 4). A capitalist economy in pursuit of earthly wealth and deathly immortality commodifies bodily matter while rendering it worthless.</p>
<p>Virginia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077800411434278">Woolf (1929/1998a)</xref> helped me to face up to what I might become in a barbarous economy where greed and knowledge overlap:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]hey had money and power, but only at the cost of harbouring in their breasts an eagle, a vulture, forever tearing the liver out and plucking at the lungs - the instinct for possession, the rage for acquisition which drives them to desire other people’s fields and goods perpetually . . . (pp. 49-50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Woolf warned me that it was not possible to compete with the Promethean Masters on their own terms. They would tempt me. They could bully me. They might deprive me of my senses. They might assimilate me. They could destroy me. She reminded me that it “is unpleasant . . . to be locked out [but] . . . it is worse perhaps to be locked in” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077800411434278">Woolf, 1929/1998a</xref>, p. 31).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly (1978)</xref> has long let it be known that the grave keepers are “the demonic forces of [racist capitalist] patriarchy which assume ghostly forms (that is, are difficult to perceive) and function as noxious gases” (p. 29). She promises us that with the power to name ourselves we are able to confront the demons blocking our way at each passage on the journey. When they challenge us for passwords, we expose them by shouting their names: “they—in effect—drop dead. To put it another way, the gases drop down (condense) into a merely messy puddle” (pp. 29-30). What promise! And if only! Even now after the embarrassing revelations of the “credit crunch” the demons have the magic to resurrect themselves.</p>

<title>Feminist Fabulation</title>
<p>We, who have been transformed into monstrous others through discourses of class, patriarchy, radicalization, disablement, “perverse” sexuality, and so on, also find ourselves with a monstrous power to disrupt such categories. Difference originates in process, not mere fact and transgressors reveal the fact that, “‘fact’ is subject to constant reconstruction and chance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411434278">Cohen, 1996</xref>, p. 14). Take it from the now victor/ious, monstrous I that bodies and being are always at stake in the pursuit of knowledge. We have learned much about the pleasures and dangers of transforming the word and the image into flesh (and vice versa). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly (1978)</xref> helped me detect the pattern behind the deceptive patterns of phallocracy. Instead of lamenting my complicity in its reproduction I came to realize that I had powers to haunt and inhabit its structures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800411434278">Derrida, 1976</xref>, p. 24).</p>
<p>There remains so much still to learn about the technologies of performative transformation required for adventures in “feminist fabulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411434278">Barr, 1992</xref>):<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077800411434278">8</xref></sup> “[I]n order to re-member our dis-spelling powers, Hags must move deeper into the Background of language/grammar” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly, 1978</xref>, p. 328). The academy, like alchemy became much more interesting and promising in the hands of word witches. I did not want to “give new names, and arrange in connected classifications” the fact of the forefathers. That is merely shuffling sameness and I wanted difference. It takes great vigilance to avoid becoming more of the same, those who “rearranged lies and called it truth, seeing in the new pattern of an old idea the Revelation and the Word” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800411434278">Morrison, 1990</xref>, p. 163).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434278">Daly (1978)</xref> advocated gyn/ecology as a means of weaving past the dead past and the dry places. The “female” monster and other voyagers tempted me with the promise of moving beyond the restricting binaries of Western metaphysics. All voyagers were wise to the fact that trying to free up the language and open up spaces of difference would make us subject to ridicule</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[t]o give a new language to these other spaces is a project filled with both promise and fear. . . .

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The point of such monstrosity is to be read: It has etymological roots in “monstrum”—“that which reveals” and “that which warns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800411434278">Foucault, 1967</xref>, pp. 68-70). Transgressive forms do not fit easily into the classificatory “order of things” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800411434278">Foucault, 1970</xref>). Our intertextual “promise” lies in our refusal of easy categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411434278">Haraway, 1992b</xref>). A monstrous existence is a state of ontological liminality, policing the borders of the possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411434278">Braidotti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411434278">Halberstam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411434278">Haraway, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800411434278">Shildrick, 1997</xref>). Such late modern monsters do not threaten in fairy tale manner, we are not confined to forests and haunted houses. Instead, our existence is an unsettling, every day promise of deconstructiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411434278">Cohen, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Be warned, there is no ease in a monstrous existence and no reward for difference. There is however, pleasure if not profit to be gained from putting unlikely things into combination, pointing out “thetic and phallic fallacies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800411434278">Hodge, 1997</xref>), journeying “beyond methodolatory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800411434278">Daly, 1973/ 1986</xref>, pp. 11-12) and beginning to “make a dirty difference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411434278">Haraway, 1997</xref>). This is an assertion of power that flies in the face of the unfashionableness of feminism. Voyagers need allies. I am grateful to Shelley and Stanley for offering me their help:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Then [s]he took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science (not) to derange their mechanism. [S]He also gave me the list of books which I had requested; and I took my leave.</p>
<p>Thus ended a day memorable to me: it decided my future destiny. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077800411434278">Shelley, 1831/1963</xref>, p. 53)</p>
