<title>1<sup>st</sup> April: 6<sup>th</sup> Sunday in Lent - Liturgy of the Palms</title>
<p>Psalm 118 is the text in the lectionary connecting the Liturgy of the Palms and Easter Sunday, connecting the imminent suffering and the triumphant rescue, the light and the darkness that it is shining in. Both are fundamentally related and one could not happen without the other. So why not emphasise this connection by putting a focus onto Psalm 118?</p>
<p>One option for putting the emphasis on Psalm 118 could be using the song “Liberation” by the late Martyn Bennett from the album Grit. The Celtic fusion song unites the words of the psalm in speaking and Gaelic psalm singing. With the background of Martyn Bennett’s early death from cancer this provides food for thought here and in the sermon. Go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.martynbennett.com/">http://www.martynbennett.com/</ext-link> for more background, information and licensing.</p>
<p>Another option could be to use the psalm in a “sandwich prayer”, where the lines of the prayer are alternated with the lines of the psalm. The prayer takes up the style of the psalm being rather a creed and a praise than a prayer. It could be used as a response, the congregation reading the well known words of the psalm and the leader of worship the lines in italics, or with two speakers reading the parts. Whichever way you choose, it should be the same style on both Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday.</p>
<p><bold>Sandwich prayer with Psalm 118:1-2, 19-29 for Palm Sunday</bold> (Psalm 118 from the NIV UK Version)</p>
<p>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures for ever.</p>
<p><italic>Through highest highs and lowest lows he has been at my side</italic></p>
<p>Let Israel say: His love endures for ever.</p>

<p><italic>Lead me to a place where I am secure and safe</italic>.</p>
<p>This is the gate of the LORD through which the righteous may enter.</p>
<p><italic>Give me a rest from all this constant threat in your safeplace</italic></p>
<p>I will give you thanks, for you answered me; you have become my salvation.</p>

<p>The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the LORD has done this, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
<p><italic>From a hopeless and futile situation God has brought forward health and salvation and I know he can do it again!</italic></p>
<p>This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.</p>

<p>You are my God, and I will give thanks; you are my God, and I will exalt you.</p>
<p><italic>I put my faith in you, my God, I am not ashamed of my faith</italic>.</p>
<p>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures for ever.</p>

<title>6<sup>th</sup> April: Good Friday</title>
<p>Good Friday is not an easy occasion for all age worship and probably in most congregations there will be only a few children in the service. Though we tend to overprotect children from themes that are “not nice”, children have their own experiences of disappointment, failure, grief and sadness.</p>
<p>From an early age, we learn that tears are a sign of weakness and can make others uncomfortable. Tears are hard to bear, too often they are stopped too soon. Good Friday is the day to assure young and old that God can stand their tears and their questions. Heb 5:7 from the lectionary sets the theme and can be accompanied by Ps 6. Ps 56:8 can form the basis of a meditation during which symbolic tears are collected in a bottle/jug. Crystal or glass drops are available in craft shops or on the internet, I would recommend 1.5 times as many as you expect the turnout for the service. Ask the flower convenor for a jug vase with barren twigs and convince your Guild to do the threading of the teardrops for you. For the service place the teardrops around the vase on a table and invite people during a quiet piece of music to place their uncried tears/tears that threaten to drown them in the twigs of the jug. Rev 21:1-4 would make a suitable ending to the meditation.</p>

<title>All-Age Talk</title>
<p>The Rose of Jericho/ Anastatica is a good prop to show that life can win over death. It is a desert plant that dries up to a dry cluster ball but when soaked in water it unfolds, greens and grows again.</p>
<p>The roses are available in garden centres or on the internet.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the service (to allow some time for the plant to soak) hand the dry rose to the children and let them guess what this is and if this is alive or dead. Then tell them about the plant and put it into a glass bowl and let the children pour warm water over it. The plant needs some time so at the end of the service have Part 2 of the all-age talk and have a look at the plant again. By then it should have unfolded to some degree. Unless you have a very long sermon it would be advisable to have another rose of Jericho which has been soaked since the day before to show the full result. Looking at the unfolding plant should give enough rise to conversation with the children.</p>

<title>15<sup>th</sup> April: Second Sunday of Easter</title>
<p><bold>All-Age Talk- “One heart and soul”</bold></p>
<p>Both Acts 4:32-35 and Ps 133 focus on the unity of believers, with Acts 4 especially being very idealistic. “One heart and one soul” has become a catchphrase for a very idealistic idea of unity and is a metaphor that can be understood and explored by all ages.</p>
<p>Start the talk with a short introduction to the bible passage, then ask the children what they know about their heartbeat, when they feel it, when it goes fast etc.</p>
<p>Ask one child to imitate the heartbeat by clapping or knocking the rhythm, ask the others to join in. This will most probably end in a wild mixture of rhythms but not “one heart”. Stop the noise and deliberate together with the children how to find a way to come together to one heartbeat rhythm and try it until you succeed. Analyse together with the children what helped to be “one heart and one soul”. Probably keywords like paying attention to one another, patience, regard, mindfulness, carefulness should pop up. So this little exercise shows which qualities are needed to form a community.</p>
