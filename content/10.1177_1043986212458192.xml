<abstract>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Esbensen and Winfree published an article in which they challenged the stereotypical image of gang members, specifically with regard to race/ethnicity and sex. In the ensuing years, a number of other publications have reported findings similar to those reported by Esbensen and Winfree, especially with regard to the sex composition of American youth gangs. Studies from Europe have also reported gang member demographic characteristics similar to those reported in the United States. The current article replicates Esbensen and Winfree’s research by examining the sex and racial/ethnic characteristics of self-reported gang members in a seven-city study. In addition, the article explores these characteristics across 5 years of data, examining the extent to which gang member demographics remain constant as youth age. Furthermore, given the attention to immigration, the article also assesses the extent to which gang membership is linked to immigration status. More important, the article also explores the extent to which offending rates vary by these demographic characteristics of the gang and nongang youth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past 20 years have witnessed considerable advancement in our understanding of youth gangs and their members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458192">Bjerregaard &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>). Qualitative studies continue to provide excellent descriptions of gang life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986212458192">Decker &amp; Van Winkle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458192">Fleisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458192">Miller, 2001</xref>), law enforcement data have been used to document the existence of gangs in jurisdictions across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986212458192">Egley &amp; Howell, 2011</xref>), and surveys (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) have identified risk factors associated with gang membership as well as the increase in delinquent activity that is associated with gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458192">Esbensen, Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Freng, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458192">Hill, Howell, Hawkins, &amp; Battin-Pearson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986212458192">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, Smith, &amp; Tobin, 2003</xref>). In spite of these diverse research methodologies, there is a convergence of findings. Gangs can be found in cities and communities across the country, in large cities, small towns, suburban areas, and rural communities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458192">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458192">Howell &amp; Egley, 2005</xref>). Most of this recent research also highlights the fact that gang members tend to reflect the communities in which they live; that is, both boys and girls are gang-involved, gang membership is not the unique domain of racial/ethnic minorities or immigrants, and gang membership is not restricted to older adolescents and young adults. Despite this body of research, the common stereotype of the American gang member continues to be that of a young male from a racial/ethnic minority and living in a deteriorating urban area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Tusinski, 2007</xref>). In this article, we rely on data from a recently completed 5-year study of youth in seven cities across the United States to highlight the extent to which this common stereotype fails to be supported by research.</p>
<p>Our objectives in writing this article are modest; we seek to provide a descriptive account of youth gang members in the first decade of the 21st century in the seven cities across the United States. We believe that it is important, indeed essential, to accurately describe a social problem if we are to understand it, to explain its presence and, more important, to suggest strategies for addressing the problem. Politicians, practitioners, and the general public tend to rely on media-generated stereotypical impressions of gangs and gang members, thereby failing to appreciate the true nature of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458192">Decker &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Tusinski, 2007</xref>). This reliance on media accounts results in either (a) underestimating the magnitude of the problem (failing to identify the full range of youth involved in gangs), (b) misidentifying the problem (believing that the gang problem is primarily a minority male problem), or (c) overreacting to the problem (the proverbial moral panic).</p>

<title>Gang Member Characteristics</title>
<p>In this article, we seek to replicate the prior work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree (1998)</xref> in which they described the sex and race/ethnic composition of youth gangs (and their level of involvement in illegal activities) in an 11-city survey conducted in 1995. This work, and other studies described below, reveal a contrasting picture to those common stereotypes and provide the basis for our current study examining the extent to which this broader portrayal of young gang members is upheld using recent self-report data.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043986212458192">
<title>Sex</title>
<p>Prior to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree’s (1998)</xref> work and that of several other surveys conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458192">Bjerregaard &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>), girls were generally ignored and considered to comprise but a small fraction of gang-involved youth. Collectively, these publications questioned such assertions, revealing that girls comprised as many as half of all gang members in general samples of youth, a finding that has been replicated in a number of studies in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458192">Battin, Hill, Abbott, Catalano, &amp; Hawkins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Deschenes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458192">Maxson &amp; Whitlock, 2002</xref>) as well as in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986212458192">Bradshaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986212458192">Haymoz &amp; Gatti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458192">Pedersen &amp; Lindstad, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458192">Sharp, Aldridge, &amp; Medina, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986212458192">Weerman, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043986212458192">
<title>Race/Ethnicity and Immigrant Status</title>
<p>Relying primarily on early ethnographic studies, law enforcement data, and surveys conducted on urban samples of high-risk youth, a long-standing belief has been that gang youth are racial/ethnic minorities. Beginning with the early work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458192">Thrasher (1927/1963)</xref>, gang members have regularly been described as members of primarily White national or ethnic minorities (e.g., Irish, Italian, Polish, and Jewish), and membership was linked to immigration status. By the late 1950s, gangs and gang members were increasingly described as African American, Puerto Rican, and/or Hispanic to the extent that by the 21st century, the gang problem was viewed essentially as a racial/ethnic (rather than national/ethnic) minority problem. This trend can also be observed in European accounts of the gang problem (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986212458192">de Jong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458192">Lien, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043986212458192">
<title>Age</title>
<p>Another question of interest is the extent to which gang membership is associated with age. According to the National Gang Survey of law enforcement, most gang members are older than 18 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986212458192">National Youth Gang Center [NYGC], 2012</xref>). Based on youth surveys, however, it was found that a sizable portion of youth report gang affiliation and youth as young as 11 identify themselves as gang members. Several studies have reported that gang membership appears to peak around 14 and 15 years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986212458192">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>). Data from these studies were collected in the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, so the question remains as to whether this pattern still holds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043986212458192">
<title>Delinquent Activity</title>
<p>Regardless of data source, one consistent finding is that gang-involved youth are more delinquent than their nongang counterparts. Of interest, however, is whether all gang members are equally involved in illegal activity or are there distinct patterns based on sex and race/ethnicity? For instance, do gang boys offend more than gang girls; are girls involved in violent offenses at the same level as boys? Or do members of different racial/ethnic groups commit the same type and volume of crime? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree (1998)</xref> reported that gang boys and girls (and nongang boys and girls) had similar rates of offending; the ratio of gang boy to gang girl offending was approximately 1.5:1, but more important, the gang girls were considerably more delinquent than the nongang boys (a ratio of 2.3:1 for violent offending). With respect to offending levels by race/ethnicity, that ratio of gang to nongang offending was quite stable across all of the race/ethnic groups examined (generally in the range of 4:1).</p>
<p>Although a number of sophisticated analyses examining trajectories of gang membership, life-course consequences of gang membership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458192">Melde &amp; Esbensen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986212458192">Krohn &amp; Thornberry, 2008</xref>), and factors contributing to leaving the gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458192">Pyrooz &amp; Decker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986212458192">Pyrooz, Decker, &amp; Webb, in press</xref>) have been published in the recent past, basic description of gang members is lacking. In this article, we address this gap in the literature by providing a replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree’s (1998)</xref> descriptive account. We frame our analysis and presentation of findings around the following seven research questions:</p>

</list>

<sec id="section7-1043986212458192" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>We utilize data collected as part of the second National Evaluation of the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program conducted between 2006 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986212458192">Esbensen, Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Osgood, 2012</xref>). Selection of sites for this longitudinal evaluation of a school-based gang prevention program was guided by three main criteria: (a) existence of an established G.R.E.A.T. program, (b) geographic and demographic diversity, and (c) evidence of gang activity. A total of 31 schools in the following 7 cities were selected for inclusion: Albuquerque, NM; Chicago, IL; a Dallas-Fort Worth area suburb; Greeley, CO; Nashville, TN; Philadelphia, PA; and Portland, OR. The sample consisted of sixth-grade students in 26 schools and seventh-grade students in the remaining 5 schools.</p>
<sec id="section8-1043986212458192">
<title>Active Parental Consent and Retention Rates</title>
<p>Active parental consent was obtained with close collaboration of the classroom teachers, who were recruited and compensated for their assistance in collecting the consent forms from their students. (For more detailed description of the active consent process, consult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986212458192">Esbensen, Melde, Taylor, &amp; Peterson, 2008</xref>.) This strategy was quite successful, yielding consent from parents of 3,820 students (78%); 552 parents (11%) declined their child’s participation, and 533 (11%) students failed to return a completed form. Students in this active consent sample were surveyed 6 times in the span of 5 years (pre- and post-tests during the first year of the study and four annual follow-up surveys). The current study utilizes data from the pretest and four annual surveys; completion rates were 98%, 87%, 82%, 75%, and 73%, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043986212458192">
<title>Student Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>The overall sample is evenly split between males and females; most (55%) youth reported living with both biological parents, and the majority (88%) of them were born in the United States (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986212458192">Table 1</xref>). The sample participants are racially/ethnically diverse, with Hispanic youth (37%), White youth (27%), and African American (17%) youth accounting for 81% of the sample. With the majority of study participants enrolled in sixth grade at the outset of the evaluation, approximately two thirds of the youth (61%) were aged 11 or younger at the pretest. Three of the six Chicago schools and two of four schools in Albuquerque taught G.R.E.A.T. in seventh grade; thus, students in these sites were somewhat older than students in the other sites.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Students participating in this longitudinal evaluation completed group, self-administered questionnaires each year for 5 years. The questionnaire, with the exception of some questions that were added after Wave 3, remained the same across all 5 years. Students required approximately 35 minutes to answer the more than 220 questions. The questionnaire contained a number of items intended to assess the effectiveness of the G.R.E.A.T. program. For the purposes of the current article, we are interested only in the demographic questions, self-reported gang membership, and self-reported levels of offending. Students provided information regarding their sex, their racial/ethnic identity, their living arrangement, their age, and whether or not they were born in the United States.</p>
<p>Following a number of attitudinal questions, students were asked about their involvement in 14 different illegal activities, ranging from truancy to robbery. To be consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree’s (1998)</xref> study, we created summary measures of property and violent crime and analyzed drug sales separately. We also asked respondents about four different types of substance use that we combined into a summary index. For property offenses, violence, and drug sales, students were asked how many times in the past 6 months they had committed each of the illegal acts, while for substance use they were asked how often they used each substance. Given the highly skewed nature of frequency measures of delinquency, we truncated the individual items at 10 before creating a summary score.1 The property index consists of five items (“purposely damaged or destroyed property that did not belong to you,” “illegally spray painted a wall or a building,” “stolen or tried to steal something worth less than US$50,” “stolen or tried to steal something worth more than US$50,” “gone into or tried to go into a building to steal something”) and, therefore, had a range of 0 to 50. Violent crime was a composite of four behaviors (“hit someone with the idea of hurting him or her,” “attacked someone with a weapon,” “used a weapon of force to get money or things from people,” “been involved in gang fights”) and had a possible range of 0 to 40. Substance use included (a) tobacco products, (b) alcohol, (c) marijuana or other illegal drugs, and (d) paint, glue, or other inhalants. Response categories ranged from <italic>no use</italic> to <italic>daily use</italic>, which resulted in a range of 0 to 16. Drug selling consisted of a single-item measure asking youth how many times in the past 6 months they sold drugs. As with property and violence, this index was truncated, resulting in a range of 0 to 10.</p>
<p>The past 20 years have provided a number of studies relying on self-nomination techniques to identify gang-involved youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986212458192">Esbensen, Winfree, He, &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458192">Hill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986212458192">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, &amp; Chad-Wiershem, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986212458192">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>). Researchers have concluded that this technique is quite robust and results in classification of a group of youth who are substantively different on a number of indicators than youth who do not self-report gang affiliation. Drawing on past efforts examining the validity of the self-nomination approach, we use a single item (“Are you now in a gang?”) to classify youth as gang or nongang members.</p>

<sec id="section11-1043986212458192">
<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>Whereas the GREAT evaluation represents a longitudinal panel design (i.e., the same individuals are followed across time), we treat the five annual surveys as a series of cross-sectional studies, capturing the students at one point in time each year. Consequently, we do not control for length of gang membership (the vast majority are members for only one wave of data collection), we do not exclude students if they did not participate in all 5 years of data collection, and we do not attempt to test the effects of gang membership from a theoretical perspective (e.g., we are not interested in testing the selection/facilitation/enhancement effect); our objective is to provide a descriptive account of gang membership among a sample of American youth at five different points in time. As such, we utilize simple descriptive and bivariate statistics to highlight (a) differences between gang and nongang youth both demographically and behaviorally, and (b) differences and similarities among gang youth at five different ages (mean ages ranging from 11.5 to 15.5 years). Attrition analyses do reveal that by Wave 4, the sample participants experienced some differential attrition of higher-risk youth and, therefore, differences between the gang and nongang respondents at Waves 4 and 5 are likely underestimates.</p>
<p>Chi-square measures of association, independent-sample <italic>t</italic> tests, and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used, as appropriate, to determine differences between and among gang and nongang members. Differences across the demographic variables, with the exception of age, were examined using chi-square analyses. Tests for differences between gang and nongang members and between boys’ and girls’ offending and substance use were conducted using independent-sample <italic>t</italic> tests. Finally, race/ethnic differences in frequency of offending were examined using one-way ANOVA analyses.2</p>

<title>Results</title>

<title>Demographic Characteristics of Gang Members</title>
<p>The percent of the participating youth who report gang membership varies across time, with the peak of gang membership (5.3%) occurring during middle school (when the students were in seventh or eighth grades and aged 12 to 14). By 10th grade (average age of 15.5) only 2.8% of the sample participants reported gang affiliation. Across the five annual waves of data collection, the sample participants’ age ranged from an average of 11.48 at Wave 1 to 15.52 at Wave 5; this longitudinal sample of youth, therefore, taps the lower age range of gang-involved youth. For the first four waves, gang members tend to be older than their nongang counterparts.3As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986212458192">Table 1</xref>, the difference in age of gang and nongang youth declines as the sample participants age so much so that the participants in the two samples are virtually of the same age by Wave 5.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043986212458192">4</xref></sup> With respect to sex, these findings are remarkably similar to findings reported in a number of other youth surveys during the past 20 years; girls comprise 45% of gang members at Wave 1 (mean age of 11.5 years), but only 31% at Wave 5 when the average age of the sample participants was 15.5 years.</p>
<p>Gang members’ race/ethnicity, though fluctuating from year to year, remains relatively stable although White youth tend to be underrepresented. White youth account for approximately 27% of the total sample participants at Wave 1 but account for only 10.5% to 18.9% of gang youth across the 5 years. At younger ages (Wave 1 &amp; Wave 2) Black youth tend to be overrepresented in the gang sample; although African Americans account for 18% of the total sample, they represent 38.7% of Wave 1 gang members and 25.6% at Wave 2. By Wave 5, African Americans account for 21.6% of gang youth but only 16.6% of the nongang youth. Hispanic youth, unlike the Black youth, are underrepresented in the gang sample in the first two waves but are overrepresented among gang members at Wave 3, Wave 4, and Wave 5. “Other” youth tend to be proportionately represented in the gang and nongang samples.</p>
<p>In recent years, growing attention has been given to the role of immigration (both legal and illegal) on gang activity. Contrary to some reports (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458192">Vigil, 2008</xref>) youth in this sample who were born outside of the United States are less likely to be gang-involved at younger ages, but by Wave 5 (when the youth are 15 years of age) they account for a disproportionate share of the self-identified gang youth (20.3% compared to 11.4% of nongang youth).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043986212458192">
<title>Delinquent Activity of Gang Members</title>
<p>As in past research, the gang youth are significantly more delinquent than the nongang youth, generally in the range of a ratio of 7:1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986212458192">Table 1</xref>). At Wave 1, the gang members reported committing 6.85 property offenses in the prior 6 months compared to 0.95 offenses by nongang. Property offending for nongang youth appears to peak at about Wave 4 with a frequency score of 1.62 and it peaks at Wave 2 (13.34) for gang members. The violent offending pattern for nongang youth is remarkably stable, fluctuating from a low of 0.96 at Wave 1 to a high of 1.28 at Wave 2. The gang members report higher scores and greater absolute fluctuation across the five waves, ranging from 8.27 at Wave 1, increasing to 11.05 at Wave 4, and declining to 9.05 by Wave 5. Substance use, contrary to the two forms of delinquency, continues to escalate for both groups, although at a sharper incline for the gang members. The frequency score for nongang members increases from a low of 0.22 to a high of 1.30, still reflecting a relatively low level of drug use among this group. In contrast, the gang members report significantly higher rates of substance use, increasing from a low of 1.76 at Wave 1 to 4.95 and 5.65 at Wave 4 and Wave 5, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section15-1043986212458192">
<title>Delinquent Activity by Sex</title>
<p>As was the case in the earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree (1998)</xref> article, we find significant differences between gang and nongang boys and girls. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986212458192">Table 2</xref> reports the mean frequency score for property and person offenses as well as substance use and drug sales. The consistency of results, among both gang and nongang members, across the five waves (i.e., ages) of the sample is noteworthy. To highlight the differences in offending, in addition to the mean scores, we also present the ratio of gang girls to nongang boys offending for each category (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043986212458192">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043986212458192">4</xref>). The mean level of offending is quite similar for the gang boys and girls, although there are statistically significant differences on property offending at Waves 1 and 2 and on violence at Wave 1. As the gang members age, the differences between the sexes disappear. By contrast, significant differences between nongang boys and girls are found across all waves for all types of offending except drug use. More important, and consistent with prior research, in all five data waves, the differences between the gang girls and nongang boys are substantial. Depending on the wave and the particular behavior, gang girls commit from 3.93 (Wave 1 property) to more than 20 (20.7 for Wave 1 drug sales) times as many offenses as nongang boys, with most of these ratios falling in the range of 5 to 1. It is particularly noteworthy that gang girls commit 9 times as many violent crimes at Wave 3 relative to nongang boys (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043986212458192">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Delinquent Behavior by Race/Ethnicity</title>
<p>At Wave 1, the rate of offending is virtually identical among the racial/ethnic categories. Although there is some slight variation, the differences are not statistically significant for the gang youth. Among the nongang youth, however, there are some significant differences with the African American and Hispanic youth reporting higher rates of offending than the White youth. Interestingly, the ratios of delinquent involvement of gang to nongang youth within each racial or ethnic group are substantively important. For example, at Wave 1 White gang members commit approximately 10 times as many property, person, and substance use offenses (9.8, 9.3, and 10.9, respectively) as the nongang White youth. For drug sales, the rate is 105 to 1. The offending ratios of gang to nongang members are less pronounced for African American and Hispanic youth but remain substantial; for instance, Black gang members commit 5 times as many crimes against persons as do the nongang youth and the ratio is 9.8:1 for the Hispanic youth. Across Waves 1 through 4, this patterns holds; the White gang members are significantly more delinquent relative to their nongang peers in comparison to African American and Hispanic youth. At Wave 5, however, this pattern disappears and the White youth report levels more comparable to the African American and Hispanic youth. It is interesting to note that there are virtually no race/ethnic differences in the rates of offending among gang members at all five waves; regardless of race/ethnicity, all of the gang members report similar levels of involvement in property and violent offenses as well as drug sales. Black gang members report lower levels of substance use relative to the Hispanic gang youth at Wave 1, Wave 2, and Wave 3.</p>

<title>Delinquent Behavior by Immigration Status</title>
<p>In the previous sections we have reported that there appear to be differences by sex, race/ethnicity, and age with regard to the delinquent behavior of gang and nongang youth. We now turn our attention to the role of immigrant status (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043986212458192">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, although there are some minor differences in offending by gang and immigrant status, the most noticeable finding is the lack of an “immigrant effect.” The few statistically significant differences we did find tended to reveal lower rates of offending among the foreign-born gang members relative to the non–foreign-born gang members.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this article was to provide a current description of gang membership using a large sample of youth enrolled in public schools in seven cities across the United States. To do this, we drew on prior work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree (1998)</xref> to examine demographic and offending behaviors across gang and nongang youth. In addition, we expanded on this prior work by examining these variables over five waves of data to determine whether differences and similarities between gang and nongang youth vary over time, at least at the bivariate level. At the outset of this article we identified seven descriptive research questions that guided our analyses. Overall, we find a depiction of youth involved in gangs that is remarkably similar to that which has evolved in both American and European research over the past 20 years. First, similar to Esbensen and Winfree’s as well as other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458192">Bjerregaard &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458192">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>), this study found that girls comprise a substantial percentage of gang-involved youth, with 45% of gang members being female at Wave 1. This percentage decreased at later waves with 31% of gang members being female at Wave 5. This is consistent with Esbensen and Winfree’s assertion that differences in the estimates of female gang participation can be attributed to the age of the sample participants. Second, it appears that female gang members participate in levels of offending similar to their male counterparts. This finding is fairly consistent across all time points, with male respondents participating in more property offending at Waves 1 and 2. One of the most pronounced findings with regard to sex is the remarkable offending differences between gang girls and nongang boys across time.</p>
<p>Third, gang-involved youth include a diverse constellation of youth from all racial/ethnic backgrounds, but Black and Hispanic youth are somewhat overrepresented, which is also similar to research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458192">Esbensen and Winfree (1998)</xref>. When looking over time, we see that the overrepresentation decreases in later waves for Black youth in the gang sample but increases for Hispanic youth. Fourth, when looking at offending behavior by race/ethnic composition, the ratio of offending for gang versus nongang youth is more pronounced for White youth than for Black and Hispanic youth. However, these differences decrease with time and the ratio of gang to nongang offending is comparable for White, Black, and Hispanic youth by Wave 5.</p>
<p>Fifth, this study was able to examine the relationship between immigrant status and gang membership. Findings demonstrate that immigrant status is not a major descriptor of gang youth—immigrants were less likely to be gang-involved in middle school years, although they were slightly more likely than nonimmigrants to be involved by the time the youth were in high school. Sixth, there is also a lack of an “immigrant effect” when looking at the offending frequencies for these youth. Finally, youth are gang-active at a relatively young age with the peak period of gang affiliation occurring in middle school (seventh and eighth grade).</p>
<p>Regardless of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and immigrant status, gang-involved youth are more delinquent than their nongang counterparts. This finding remains stable over time for all illegal activity, including property and violent offending, substance use, and drug sales. Although our objectives in examining demographics and offending across gang and nongang youth were fairly modest, the findings are nonetheless informative. Gang-involved youth include (a) boys and girls, (b) members of all racial/ethnic groups, (c) youth from diverse family structures, and (d) represent both immigrant and native-born. As Esbensen and colleagues (2010, p. 86) concluded, “Gang membership appears to provide an equal opportunity for all.”</p>

<p>Given the small samples, we tested for equal variances using both Levene’s test of equal variances and Welch’s robust test. In terms of post hoc analyses, Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) was used when the assumption of equal variances was met. However, Games–Howell’s test was used when the variances were not assumed to be equal. This is a modified HSD test that allows for unequal variances as well as unequal sample sizes.</p>
