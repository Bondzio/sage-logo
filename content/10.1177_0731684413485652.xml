<p>Experimental investigations were conducted on kenaf–polypropylene composites manufactured from preformed mats consisting of kenaf and polypropylene fibers in a ratio of 1 : 1 in weight to explore the prospects of annual natural plant fibers as reinforcements for polymer–matrix composites. Surface treatments to the comingled kenaf–polypropylene fiber mats were first carried out using different coupling agents to increase the compatibility of the natural fiber and the polypropylene matrix. Kenaf–polypropylene composite laminates were fabricated from the mats via compression molding. Experimental results indicated that, among the coupling agents chosen, maleated polypropylene was the most effective coupling agent to significantly improve the mechanical performance of the composites. Analyses using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and scanning electron microscopy revealed that maleated polypropylene was able to promote strong adhesion between the kenaf fibers and the polypropylene matrix at their interfaces. The outcomes of the study indicate that the use of the preformed fiber mats in combination with fiber surface modifications makes it possible to efficiently produce natural fiber reinforced composites with excellent mechanical properties.</p>

<p>Although natural fibers have been used in polymer–matrix composites for many years, interests in natural fibers as reinforcements in load-bearing composite structures have been overshadowed in the last few decades by synthetic fibers, such as glass and carbon fibers, due to the excellent mechanical properties of the synthetic fibers and the relative low strength and modulus of the natural fibers. However, there has been a reappearance of attention to natural fiber reinforced composites in recent years, due to low cost, low density, competitive specific mechanical properties, and, most importantly, environmental benefits, such as carbon dioxide reduction, sustainability, recyclability, and biodegradability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413485652">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413485652">4</xref></sup> Natural fibers are now emerging as viable alternatives to glass fibers either alone or combined in manufacturing composite materials for various applications, such as automotive parts, building structures and rigid packaging materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413485652">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413485652">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The major constituents of natural fibers are cellulose and lignin. The amount of cellulose in lignocellulosic systems determines the mechanical performance of the fibers, depending on the species and age of the plant. Most natural fibers are extracted from annual plants, such as kenaf, flax, sisal and hemp, except for wood fibers which are obtained from woody plants that grow over years. Annual plants are abundant in supply and cheap in raw material market. Consequently, the use of annual plants as a cellulose source for reinforced plastic composites is deemed to have the potential to increase their applications to compete with other composites, such as wood-plastic composites (WPC) and synthetic fiber (glass, carbon, aramide, etc.) reinforced composites. Among the natural fibers, kenaf fibers are derived from an annual herbaceous crop, which can be grown under a wide range of weather conditions. Kenaf fiber has approximately similar strength and modulus to other bast fibers, such as hemp and flax.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413485652">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413485652">2</xref></sup> However, kenaf can grow very fast and absorb significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – about 1.5 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> is needed for a production of 1 ton of dry matter of kenaf, making it more attractive than other crops.</p>
<p>A number of techniques can be employed to produce composites using natural fibers as reinforcements, such as impregnation of long fibers with thermoset resins, compounding/extruding, and compression molding of short fibers with thermoplastic polymers or pultrusion using comingled fiber yarns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413485652">9</xref></sup> Natural fibers can be used in different forms, such as long fibers, chopped short fibers, fiber mats, and fiber preforms. Blended fiber mats, consisting of randomly distributed natural and thermoplastic fibers, can be directly formed into composites with required shapes by means of hot compression molding, so as to provide some promising advantages in mass production for certain applications such as making automotive components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413485652">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413485652">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the basis of our preliminary experimental results, the blended fiber mats did not show very obvious advantages in the mechanical performance of their composites, compared with those of the kenaf (KF)–polypropylene (PP) composites prepared by extrusion using chopped fibers and PP pellets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413485652">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413485652">11</xref></sup> The main reason was attributed to the weak interfacial adhesion between kenaf fibers and the PP matrix.</p>
<p>Extensive research effort has been made in the past to increase the compatibility of the hydrophilic natural fibers and the hydrophobic thermoplastic matrix through either physical or chemical methods, including the use of coupling agents and fiber surface modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413485652">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413485652">18</xref></sup> For thermoplastic-based composites without coupling agents being used, their mechanical performance is normally inferior to the neat matrix plastic as a result of poor interfacial adhesion between the polar natural fibers and the non-polar thermoplastics. Coupling agents can bridge the polymer and natural fibers by either covalent bonding, polymer chain entanglement or by secondary bonding, and thus increase overall performance of the composites. The most commonly used coupling agents are isocyanates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413485652">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413485652">18</xref></sup> various organosilanes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413485652">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413485652">21</xref></sup> and maleated polyolefins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413485652">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413485652">24</xref></sup> For polyolefin matrix composites, currently maleated polyolefins, such as maleic anhydride (MA)-grafted polyethylene (MAPE) and MA-grafted polypropylene (MAPP), were among the most popular coupling agents used for natural fiber reinforced composites. However, the efficiency in using maleated polyolefins as coupling agents greatly depends on a number of factors, such as the MA content (or acid number), the optimum amount to be added, and the processing methods to be used. Therefore, a proper amount of the coupling agent with a uniform distribution in the fiber–matrix interfaces in composites should potentially provide significant enhancement of the mechanical performance of the material without causing a considerable increase of the production cost.</p>
<p>In this article, outcomes of a systematic investigation are presented. The research work was aimed to explore the effects of different coupling agents on the mechanical properties of the KF–PP composites using the KF–PP blended fiber mats, with the main focus being on the use of the maleated polypropylene as the coupling agent. The resulting approach would therefore be applicable to pre-fabricated commingled natural fiber mats, and provide a method for significantly enhancing the performance of their composites.</p>

<p>The KF–PP fiber mats were prepared by the Material Science and Engineering Group at CSIRO, Australia, using Malaysian kenaf fibers and polypropylene fibers obtained from Godfrey Hirst, Australia. 50 wt% cleaned kenaf fibers were mixed with 50 wt% PP fibers and then the blended fibers were carded, cross-laid and needle-punched to obtain a cross-laid kenaf-PP mat with a nominal areal density of 700 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Five types of materials, diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI), poly(hexamethylene diisocyanate) (PHDI), Z6030 silane, Z6300 silane, and MAPP were used as coupling agents. Selection of these coupling agents was based on previous research outcomes on wood-plastic composites (WPC) and natural fiber composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413485652">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413485652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413485652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413485652">24</xref></sup> Maleated polypropylene (MAPP) was provided by Clariant (Australia) Pty Ltd with the trade name of ‘Licocene PP MA 7452’. The coupling agent was in the form of fine granules, having a high percentage of maleic anhydride (MA) functional groups (∼7 wt%). The other coupling agents, including MDI, PHDI, Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (Dow Corning Z6030), vinyltrimethoxysilane (Dow Corning Z-6300), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Australia.</p>
<p>Reagent grade stearic acid (SA) with a purity of 95% was also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Australia, and was used in combination with MDI and PHDI, on the basis of the optimal amount recommended by a published article.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413485652">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-0731684413485652"><title>Surface treatments of blended KF–PP fiber mats</title>
<p>For the treatments of the fiber mats using MDI/SA and PHDI/SA, both of MDI (or PHDI) and SA were first dissolved in acetone (40 mL) and then 2000 mL warm distilled water was added to the solution, followed by stirring with a mechanical mixer. After that, six KF–PP mat sheets, measuring in 250 × 250 mm<sup>2</sup>, were immersed in the solution, and then dried in oven at 70°C for 48 h (together with the solution). Final concentrations of MDI/SA (also PHDI/SA) in the mats were around 2 wt%/0.5 wt%, respectively.</p>
<p>For the treatments of the mats using silanes (Z-6030 and Z-6300), the coupling agents were first mixed with acetic acid (12 g) and distilled water (50 g) and then followed by the further dilution with water (2000 mL). Six layers of KF–PP mat (250 × 250 mm<sup>2</sup>) were then immersed in the solutions, subsequently drying in oven at 70°C for 48 h. The content of Z-6030, or Z-6300, in the dried KF–PP mats was around 2 wt%.</p>
<p>For the surface treatments of KF–PP fiber mats using MAPP, <italic>m</italic>-xylene (1000 mL) was used as solvent to dissolve MAPP to form a solution, and then six layers of KF–PP mat (250 × 250 mm<sup>2</sup>) were immersed into the solution. Different amounts of MAPP (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 wt%), relative to the weight of the mats, were dissolved into solutions to be used separately with the mats in various designated sample groups. The mats were then dried in a fume hood at ambient temperature for 24 h and then relocated to an oven for further drying at 70°C for 24 h, allowing the solvent to fully evaporate. During drying, the mats were turned over a few times to allow uniform distribution of the dissolved MAPP on the KF and PP fiber surfaces. KF–PP composite using the as-received mats (untreated) was also prepared as a baseline sample. The difference between the KF–PP composite using the as-received mats and the composite with 0 wt% MAPP was the later was immersed in xylene prior to drying in oven at 70°C for 24 h.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0731684413485652"><title>Preparation of KF–PP fiber mat composites</title>
<p>Six layers of the oven-dried KF–PP fiber mats (untreated or treated) for each sample group were stacked (alternately, three mats in the mat rolling direction and three mats in the transverse-to-the rolling direction) and compressively molded into a flat panel in a steel mould with a dimension of 250 × 250 × ∼5 mm<sup>3</sup> using a hot press. As the KF fibres in KF–PP mats may have non-uniform distribution due to processing and handling, such as rolling, the use of the above-mentioned procedure during stacking was to ensure the in-plane isotropic performance of the resultant composites. The molding temperature was maintained at 195°C and the molding pressure was applied at ∼4 MPa for 10 min before water cooling began. As the melting temperature of PP is 165–170°C, selection of the molding temperature 20–30°C over the melting point of the matrix, such as 195°C, can reduce the viscosity of the matrix and increase its wettability to KF fibers. On the other hand, the use of the temperature lower than 200°C can also minimize the damages caused to the KF fibers as a result of oxidation. During cooling the pressure was kept constant until the temperature of the composite panel was reduced to around 40°C to prevent deconsolidation and panel distortion. Photographs of the KF–PP mat and the compression-molded KF–PP composite are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413485652">Figure 1</xref>.

<p>As an alternative method without the use of the xylene solvent, three KF–PP fiber mat composites with 3, 5 and 7 wt% of MAPP were also prepared by evenly dispersing MAPP granules on top of the KF–PP mat sheets using a fine metal mesh prior to sheet stacking.</p>

<p>Tensile properties were measured using an Instron 5567 testing machine according to ASTM D3039. The nominal size of a tensile specimen was 170 × 25 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>.

<p>Strengths, moduli and strains at failure for the composite samples with different types of coupling agents are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413485652">Figure 2</xref>. It can be seen that KF–PP fiber mat composites with the use of 3 wt% MAPP coupling agents have much higher strength and moduli than those of the baseline and those panels using the other coupling agents, including MDI, PHDI, and silanes, though their failure strains are roughly the same.

</p>
<p>Due to the pre-treatments using dissolved MAPP (3 wt%) in xylene, significant improvements in strengths of KF–PP fiber mat composites (∼50% in tension and ∼40% in flexure) have been achieved, accompanied by the improvements in moduli (∼30% in tension and ∼10% in flexure). However, the other coupling agents were not so effective, with only about ∼10% in strength enhancement for MDI/SA and PHDI/SA treated mats and almost no improvement in modulus. The improvements in failure strains for all the composites using treated fiber mats were marginal, compared with the composites using the untreated fiber mats.</p>
<p>Charpy impact energies of the KF–PP fiber mat composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413485652">Figure 3</xref>. Generally, there are no significant differences between the impact energies among the various KF–PP fiber mat composites. The impact energy of the composites using the fiber mats treated with MAPP dissolved in xylene are slightly lower, while the composites using the fiber mats treated with other coupling agents show higher impact energies.

<sec id="sec9-0731684413485652"><title>Effect of MAPP concentrations</title>
<p>As MAPP was found more effective in improving the mechanical performance of KF–PP mat composites than the other coupling agents selected in this study, further investigations were conducted to explore the optimal amount of MAPP and the most suitable method for the surface modifications of the commingled fiber mats.</p>
<p>To make best use of the coupling agent, MAPP granules were dissolved in xylene and were then deposited on the fiber surfaces on the basis of the procedures described previously. The modified fiber mats were made into composite laminates by compression molding. Strengths, moduli and strains at failure obtained from tensile and flexural tests of the composite samples with different amounts of MAPP coupling agents are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413485652">Figure 4</xref>. It can be seen that, with pre-treatment of the fiber mats using MAPP dissolved in xylene, significant improvements in strengths were achieved, accompanied by increases in moduli. However, the optimal amount of MAPP was approximately 3 wt% and further increases in MAPP contents (up to 7 wt%) did not show extra improvements in the strengths and moduli of the KF–PP composites, while the failure strains of the composites were nearly independent of the coupling agent contents.</p>
<p>Charpy impact energies of KF–PP fiber mat composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413485652">Figure 5</xref>. Generally, there are no significant differences between the impact energies among the various KF–PP fiber mat composites.

</p>
<p>The significantly increased strength and modulus of the KF–PP fiber mat composites through surface modifications with MAPP are believed to be attributed to the improved KF–PP interfacial adhesion as a result of the coupling effect of MAPP.</p>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the post failure surfaces of tensile specimens in order to obtain information related to the KF–PP interfacial adhesion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413485652">Figure 6</xref>, KF fibers are loosely distributed on the fracture surfaces of the KF–PP composites with untreated mats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413485652">Figure 6(a)</xref>), showing interfacial separations between the fibers and the PP matrix and fiber pull-outs due to the poor interfacial adhesion. In comparison with the fracture surfaces of the composite specimens with fiber mats treated with MAPP (3, 5 and 7 wt%), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413485652">Figure 6 (b) to (d)</xref>, there are fewer sites of interfacial separations, accompanied by significant levels of fiber breakage, indicating that the KF–PP interfacial adhesion has been significantly improved due to the coupling effect of MAPP.

<p>MAPP has received wide spread application as a coupling agent in natural fiber reinforced PP composites and it was believed that the treatment of natural fibers with MAPP provides covalent bonds across the interface through the esterification of anhydride groups of MAPP with hydroxyl groups of natural fibers.</p>
<p>A Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific) was used in this study to measure the spectra of the raw materials and the resultant composites in order to identify the possible strengthening mechanisms of MAPP for the KF–PP composites. Typical spectra of the neat PP, MAPP, the KF–PP mat, the KF–PP composite made from untreated mats, and the KF–PP composites using the mats treated with 7 wt% MAPP are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413485652">Figure 7</xref>. The spectrum peaks of the MAPP copolymer were detected at around 1711 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1774 cm<sup>−1</sup> (marked in the circle), which are consistent with the findings reported by Paunikallio et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413485652">23</xref></sup> Kim et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413485652">24</xref></sup> Felix and Gatenholm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413485652">25</xref></sup> and Kazayawoko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413485652">26</xref></sup> The peaks are characteristic of the diametric form of a dicarbonylic acid and the cyclic anhydride. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413485652">Figure 7</xref>, the FT-IR spectrum of the KF–PP composite containing 7 wt% MAPP looks basically the same as that of the KF–PP composite using the untreated mats. This is due to the overlapping of the spectrum of the fiber and that of the esterification of the between the fibers and MAPP. For natural fibers, the peak at 1730 cm<sup>−1</sup> was attributed to the C = O stretching of the acetyl groups of the fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413485652">23</xref></sup> Kazayawoko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413485652">26</xref></sup> indicated that the ester functional groups absorb in the 1750–1720 cm<sup>−1</sup> region and the natural fibers also have ester groups that absorb near 1730 cm<sup>−1</sup>, so that the confirmation of esterification between the natural fibers and MAPP may only be observed through an increase in the intensity of the absorption bands near 1730 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Based on the data manipulation method used by Kazayawoko et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413485652">26</xref></sup> a data subtraction spectrum, obtained from subtracting the spectrum of the KF–PP composite containing 7 wt% MAPP by the spectrum of the KF–PP composite using the untreated mats, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413485652">Figure 8</xref>. It can be seen that the obviously increased intensities near 1730 cm<sup>−1</sup> for the KF–PP composite containing 7 wt% MAPP may be associated to ester links between hydroxyl groups of KF fibers and anhydride groups of MAPP.

<p>An alternative method was also adopted to directly incorporate MAPP into the KF–PP fiber mats during compression molding, without the use of the xylene solvent. Three sample groups of KF–PP mat composites with 3, 5 and 7 wt% of MAPP were prepared by evenly dispersing MAPP fine granules on top of the KF–PP mat layers with the help of a fine metal mesh. The amounts of MAPP in each layer were calculated on the basis of the designated formulations. The MAPP granules were distributed on top of each mat sheet as uniformly as possible. The KF–PP mat layers with MAPP were then stacked in the mould, followed by hot pressing with the same procedures as those for fabricating the other groups of composites. Mechanical properties of the composites were then measured to make comparison with those of the composites with fiber mats being pre-treated with dissolved MAPP in xylene.</p>
<p>From the tensile and flexural test results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413485652">Figure 9</xref>, it can be seen that the strengths of the composites with the direct incorporation of MAPP coupling agent with the KF–PP fiber mats through dispersing them on top of the mat layers are slightly lower than those of the composites with the use of the dissolved MAPP, while their moduli are more or less the same. The lower strengths of the composites with the direct application of MAPP were attributed to the inhomogeneity of the MAPP in the composites. Nevertheless, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413485652">Figure 9(a)</xref>, there was still around 40% increase in both tensile and flexural strengths, compared with that of the composite made from the untreated KF–PP fiber mats.

<sec id="sec11-0731684413485652"><title>Comparison of blended KF–PP fiber mat composites with PP and extruded chopped KF–PP composites</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413485652">Table 1</xref> provides a comparison of the mechanical properties for the two selected KF–PP fiber mat composites (untreated and with 3 wt% MAPP dissolved in xylene) with those of the neat PP, PP-5 wt% MAPP, PP-3 wt% MAPP, and the KF–PP composites made from chopped kenaf fibers and PP pellets by means of compounding with a twin-screw extruder and compression molding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413485652">10</xref></sup> It can be seen that the mechanical performance of the KF–PP fiber mat composites is much superior to that of the chopped KF fiber–PP composites due to the presence of longer fibers in KF–PP mats. Furthermore, because of the use of xylene-dissolved MAPP, considerably higher strengths (33% in tension and 11% in flexure) and moduli (49% in tension and 24% in flexure) were achieved for the KF–PP fiber mat composite with 3 wt% MAPP, compared with its counterpart in which chopped kenaf short fibers and the same amount of MAPP were incorporated during the compounding process. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413485652">Table 1</xref>, the incorporation of MAPP into PP did not obviously improve the mechanical properties of the matrix. However, it can significantly improve the mechanical performance of the KF–PP composite due to the coupling effect of MAPP at the KF–PP interfaces. Note that the chopped KF–PP composites and the KF–PP mat composites in comparison were not prepared with the same fiber content. The reason was that it was unable to produce chopped KF–PP composites with 50 wt% KF by the extruding method in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413485652">10</xref></sup> due to the low density and high volume of the chopped KF fibers. However, on the basis of our unpublished research results on wood (flakes and sawdust)-PP composites, the mechanical properties of the 50 wt% wood-PP and 40 wt% wood-PP are indeed comparable, with the 50% wood composites slightly higher in modulus, but the ones with 40% wood somewhat better in strength. As KF–PP composites have obvious similarities with wood-PP composites, so that the above comparison is still considered meaningful.

<p>In comparison with the KF–PP composites in which MAPP was absent, the KF–PP composites with 3 wt% MAPP resulted in significant increases in both tensile and flexural strengths (50–60% in tension and 30–40% in flexure) in the composites made from the blended fiber mats and also from the chopped kenaf fibers. The incorporation of MAPP also noticeably enhanced moduli (10–33% in tension and up to 11% in flexure). In particular, the MAPP dissolved in xylene could increase the efficiency of the coupling agents in KF–PP composites due to the uniform deposition of MAPP on the kenaf and PP fiber surfaces. However, the treatment using xylene solvent would certainly induce some extra cost. Therefore, direct application of MAPP to the KF–PP mat sheet during compression molding is also a viable choice, as already demonstrated in this study.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0731684413485652" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Methods of applying interfacial enhancement treatments to mats pre-formed from commingled kenaf and polypropylene fibers were investigated, focusing on treatment type, application method and optimization of coupling agent concentrations. MAPP was found to be the most effective coupling agent among the coupling agents selected in this study to considerably improve the mechanical performance of KF–PP composites made from KF–PP blended fiber mats.</p>
<p>Experimental results obtained in this study indicated that the enhanced mechanical performance of KF–PP composites treated with MAPP was attributed to the formation of the ester links between hydroxyl groups of KF fibers and anhydride groups of MAPP at the fiber/matrix interfaces. Improvements in strengths of KF–PP mat composites due to the pre-treatments of fiber mats using dissolved MAPP (3–6%) in xylene were up to ∼50% in tension and ∼40% in flexure, while enhancements in moduli were ∼30% in tension and ∼10% in flexure. However, the optimal amount of MAPP was found to be around 3 wt%. Further increases in MAPP content (up to 7%) did not show additional improvement in mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Direct dispersion of MAPP granules on top of the KF–PP mat sheets prior to compression molding could also provide enhancements of mechanical performance (up to 40% in tensile strength and 15% in tensile modulus), though this method was not as effective as the use of dissolved MAPP in xylene solvent.</p>
<p>Compared with the KF–PP composites made from the chopped kenaf short fibers and compounded with PP pellets, the KF–PP composites made from the blended KF–PP fiber mats could provide higher strength and modulus, particularly in the presence of the MAPP coupling agent. Therefore, the use of the preformed fiber mats in combination with fiber surface modifications provides an effective approach for manufacturing composites with excellent mechanical properties.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413485652"/>
