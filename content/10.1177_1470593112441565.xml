<abstract>
<p>Experiential consumption emphasizes emotional and hedonic qualities in the marketplace stressing the importance of experiences for ‘the good life’ and positioning consumption as a legitimate way to generate interesting and relevant experiences. The concept of emotional regimes (Reddy, 2001) is used to emphasize the dialectics between structural changes in the modern marketplace and the modern way of perceiving and practising hedonic behaviour. The article considers the main ideas that have furthered modern hedonism and the practices that have transformed the abstract longing for sensitivity into concrete experiential appetites. The development of a regime of experiences is outlined, consisting of a set of techniques to bring about sensual pleasure, a discourse to verbalize the methods of pleasure seeking, and an ideology that turns pleasure into a legitimate existential goal in life for the sake of self-actualization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The market is an inherently emotional place. The subject of emotions and emotional behaviour remains highly relevant to marketing theory and consumer research. It is generally accepted, almost as common sense that consumption is implicated in emotion one way or another and consumption can be understood as generating emotional responses in consumers, for example by facilitating feelings of happiness, joy, frustration or anger. Consumer research has tended to imply a moral economy in analysing emotional experiences. Activities and strategies that produce, facilitate or allow for the co-creation of positive, pleasurable and rewarding emotional consumer experiences are generally regarded more positively than those that facilitate or produce negative ones. This paper is concerned with examining some of the mechanisms and social processes that resulted in consumers and consumption becoming defined in emotional terms and through emotional practices. The first section briefly considers the application of theories of emotions in consumer research and the development of research into emotion in psychology and cultural theory. The next section introduces Reddy’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>) writing on ‘emotional regimes’, defined as official rituals and practices that express and inculcate normative emotional behaviour underpinning stable political regimes (Reddy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>: 129). Emotional regimes offer a means to resolve problems in both psychological and cultural accounts of emotional experience and in the third section we outline structures and features of the emotional regime of experiential consumption for which modern hedonism is a central principle. The latter sections of the paper critically examine aspects of hedonism as features of the emotional regime of experiential consumption, in terms of ideology and the democratization of pleasure.</p>

<title>Emotional experience</title>
<p>Throughout the 1980s the study of emotions remained largely confined to a narrow set of theories, understandings and ideas. Marketing and consumer behaviour theories of emotion were and are heavily influenced by behavioural and cognitive psychology in which many of the core concepts were derived as much from intuition and everyday observation as they were from experimentation and theory. While it is possible to measure the physiological and psychological effects that emotions such as fear or happiness have on heart rate, adrenalin levels, or performance in a memory recall test for example, these analyses do not provide insight into what ‘fear’ or ‘happiness’ is (or is not), what function or purpose these emotions might serve, or the processes and systems by which emotions are derived, maintained and experienced.</p>
<p>More recently psychologists have challenged and modified many of these previously dominant assumptions, taking on board advances in neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112441565">Damasio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593112441565">LeDoux, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112441565">Pessoa, 2008</xref>) as well as responding to broader critiques concerning the social, cultural and even political aspects of emotional behaviour. Psychologists have moved away from models of cognition in which emotions are associated with certain types of non-linear free association thinking that are linked or causally related to certain types of physiological arousal, to theories that involve greater complexity. Clear dividing lines between controlled and involuntary behaviour, between cognition and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112441565">Pessoa, 2008</xref>), or between ‘thinking’ and ‘feeling’ are no longer prevalent in psychological theories of emotion. Nonetheless, what emotions are, how they function, whether they are universal or culturally constructed, and even how many emotions can be discerned, remains just as much the topic of intense discussions in and outside psychology as it was two decades ago (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593112441565">Ortony and Turner, 1990</xref>). What is clear is that emotions play an important role in decision making, the automatic processing of information, and the formation of preferences. These insights reject the Cartesian distinction between body and mind, feeling and thinking, suggesting that feeling is an intrinsic aspect of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112441565">Damasio, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Consumer behaviour research into emotion retains many of the core expectations of the traditional psychological approach and may benefit greatly from revision and re-evaluation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112441565">Elliott, 1998</xref>). Emotions are neither irrational remnants from earlier stages of evolution nor irrelevant by-products of consumption. There is little evidence to support a clear differentiation between ‘rational’ and emotional decision making, that certain types of consumers are more emotional than others, that some products are more rational than others, or that consumer choices involving emotion are more or less credible or sensible than so called rational choices. In some important respects the subject of emotions illustrates and indicates more fundamental critiques in consumer behaviour research. The critique against cognitivism launched by Holbrook and Hirschman some 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593112441565">Hirschman and Holbrook, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593112441565">Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982</xref>) was predicated on an argument that existing psychological paradigms were incapable of adequately accounting for the full range of consumer experiences and behaviours. In order to grasp consumption in its totality they proposed that fun, feelings and fantasies, traditionally neglected by the cognitive approach, should be integral parts of consumer research. By calling attention to the importance of hedonic aspects of consumption, Hirschman and Holbrook reinstated consumer experiences on the theoretical agenda and this played a significant part in the advancement of new methods, philosophy and theory in consumer research. In effect, the perceived inability of the cognitive approach to adequately account for emotion and emotional experience led to the introduction of phenomenology, interpretivism and cultural theories into consumer research.</p>
<p>There are, however, equally obvious problems with accounts and concepts of emotions that rely solely on cultural theories. Anthropologists have taken a keen interest in emotion and culture, and few marketers would dispute that there are significant cultural aspects to emotional norms, behaviours and practices. There is little controversy in the idea that different cultures have different ways of expressing emotions, that some cultures are more ‘emotional’ than others, or that emotional codes vary. But if this line of argument is pursued it is likely that it will lead to theoretical positions that are less widely accepted. A cultural account of emotions opens up the prospect of considering the idea that emotions are not only culturally variable but culturally constructed. Where, we might ask, is the evidence or rationale to assume that all cultures have the same experience of emotions? There are clearly many different ways to express an emotion such as grief for example, and in different cultures many different ways of expressing grief would be expected to be observed. But is it conceivable to imagine a culture in which individuals are unable to experience this emotion of grief, where the emotion of grief is completely alien and unknown? In a slightly less emotive context we might question whether consumer society ‘creates’ certain types of emotions, such as intense pleasure and desire for goods, or apathy and misery for unsatisfied needs and wants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470593112441565">Shankar et al., 2006</xref>). Of course we would have to appreciate that desire, hedonism and pleasure are all in evidence in other periods of history and in other cultures, but this does not completely exclude the prospect that the particular manifestations of these emotional responses in consumer culture are product of that culture, creating both the objects and subjects of desire. In fact, it makes good sense to see emotions as social, cultural and biological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112441565">Harré and Parrott, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Emotional regimes</title>
<p>Cognitive psychological and cultural accounts offer competing perspectives on emotions. Reddy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>) seeks to overcome this distinction through an analysis of the history of feeling. In this account emotions are systematic bodily responses to stimuli, which direct the organisms’ (re)actions. Emotions are universal because they have a biological foundation. This does not, however, imply that all individuals respond in the same emotional way to sensations and perception. Emotions are culturally flexible, which means that different groups favour emotions differently and express clusters of emotions in various ways. Emotions can be understood as ‘overlearned habits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593112441565">Isen and Diamond, 1989</xref>) and are as such malleable and adaptable. As habits, emotions serve as a relatively stable foundation for preferences and the individual’s strategic goal setting in the short term. Emotional expressions are automatic and therefore to a large degree involuntary. By being over-learned they depend on social interaction, which explains historical changes and cultural differences in the way emotions are individually expressed or publicly valued.</p>
<p>Emotional expressions are moulded by social interaction, and not voluntarily (re-)fashioned by the individual. The acceptability, desirability and ‘practicability’ of specific emotions are regulated by ‘emotional regimes’ which serve to assess and instruct which emotions are socially valuable and how such emotions could or should be properly practised. Reddy’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>) analysis focuses on the changing values, status and purpose of emotions in French society since the 16th century. As emotional regimes adapt and change, new ways of expressing, evaluating or accounting for emotions are possible and desirable. Different forms of <italic>emotional management</italic> emerge, and open up new forms and opportunities of <italic>emotional liberty</italic> as well as closing off others (Reddy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>: 129). These regimes provide a framework that delimits and sanctions deviance which in turn structures <italic>emotional suffering</italic> as well as places of <italic>emotional refuge</italic> and escape (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593112441565">Goulding et al., 2002</xref>). Reddy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>: 216) concludes his argument as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>In the late eighteenth century reason and emotion were not seen as opposed forces; in the early nineteenth they were. In the late eighteenth century natural sentiment was viewed as the ground out of which virtue grew. In the early nineteenth, virtue was regarded as the outgrowth of the exercise of the will, guided by reason, aimed at disciplining passions – much as it has been from ancient times up to the seventeenth century. In the late eighteenth century, political reform was deemed best guided by natural feelings of benevolence and generosity. In the early nineteenth century while some would have continued to grant benevolence and generosity a role in politics, much more importance was attached to personal qualities such as commitment to principle, soldiery courage, a willingness, if necessary, to resort to violence and, above all, a proper understanding of justice and right.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Reddy’s concept of ‘emotional regimes’ is not totally at odds with Foucault’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112441565">1980</xref>) ‘power/knowledge regimes’ in that both emphasize the formative role played by structures of social interaction in shaping individuals’ feelings, thoughts and desires. Unlike Foucault however, Reddy stresses two universal features grounding any emotional regime. In the first place all ‘communities construe emotions as an important <italic>domain of effort</italic>’ (Reddy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>: 55, emphasis in original).</p>
<p>And secondly, all communities ‘provide individuals with prescriptions and counsel concerning both <italic>the best strategies</italic> for pursuing emotional learning and <italic>the proper end point or ideal</italic> of emotional equilibrium’ (Reddy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>: 55, emphasis in original). An emotional regime (Reddy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">2001</xref>: 61) thus consists of:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>a coherent set of collectively shared emotional goals to strive for (prescriptions of preferable emotions and preferable objects)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a set of instructions on how to obtain mental and bodily control (tactics leading to a code of conduct)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a set of ideals concerning the individual and collective meaning of specific goals and of emotional control (strategies outlining the purport of emotionality).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The variations between emotional regimes may be considerable but they all contribute to stabilizing the relationship between individuals and their community. On an ideational level an emotional regime grounds common causes and goals for acting in the world. By enhancing self-coherence and by establishing a common code of conduct, an emotional regime secondly strengthens social identity and an individual becomes recognizable as a member of a certain group.</p>
<p>Third, the regime guides the individual towards private gratifications thereby strengthening personal identity. It teaches how and where to find interesting and relevant (i.e. meaningful) pleasure and satisfaction. A major advantage of Reddy’s conception of regimes compared to Foucault’s is that it explains gradual historical changes. An emotional regime should not be conceived as a determining factor for individuals’ feelings and thoughts, but as guidelines for actions that individuals may or may not follow. These guidelines are open for new or alternative prescriptions, instructions and ideals, which match the malleable quality of emotions and account for many and mutually conflicting regimes. Each emotional regime is hence characterized by a dynamic stability.</p>

<title>The emotional regime of experiential consumption</title>
<p>Reddy’s account offers a method for analysing the emotional regime of experiential consumption. For this analysis it is necessary to understand aspects of modern emotional and experiential life as culturally contingent while not overlooking the universal, biological aspects of all emotions. Consumer cultures generate and moderate certain types of domains of effort as well as providing a means through which emotions can be exhibited and demonstrated. To illustrate, consumer culture theorists have often discussed the importance of excitement, gratification and wonder in structuring aspects of consumption experience. Excitement and wonder are relevant to a wide range of consumption situations, with obvious examples including extreme tourism and spectacular events, recreational drug consumption, clubbing, and gaming. From an emotional regime’s perspective is it necessary to ask at what point did these emotional forms or domains of effort begin to take on their contemporary character? In an historical analysis of boredom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470593112441565">Spacks (1995</xref>: 10) argues:<disp-quote>
<p>If life was never boring in pre modern times, neither was it interesting, thrilling or exciting, in the modern sense of these words. And one has to assume that people without such terminology didn’t need it – not necessarily because they weren’t by our standards bored or interested or whatever, but because other categories of interpretation satisfied their understanding of their own situations.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This comment implicitly acknowledges the dualism at play here, between the ‘universal’ aspect of emotional behaviour and experience, and its cultural construction and representation. Interpreted through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112441565">Reddy (2001)</xref>, we can say that the contemporary significance of boredom is closely linked to a particular emotional regime in which its dichotomies between boredom/excitement, and apathy/engagement, for instance are salient structuring devices. Current emotional regimes derive meaning from earlier regimes, which by being intertwined with economic interests, political thought, therapeutic practices and moral philosophy have made new appetites possible and desirable.</p>
<p>The emotional regime for experiential consumption is aligned to hedonism, a moral philosophy which asserts the pursuit of pleasure as an ethical principle. Hedonist philosophies can be traced back to ancient Greece and are formalized as a modern philosophical orientation in the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112441565">2007</xref> [1789]). From a utilitarian perspective a hedonist is a person who calculates how and where the largest sum of pleasure is to be found with as minimal an effort as possible. By defining pleasure in purely quantitative terms, Bentham formulated a felicific or hedonic calculus, which, simply put, equates the amount of happiness with the intensity of pleasure multiplied by its duration. This has lead to a denigrating view of hedonists as people who are primarily directed by a need for satisfying sensual lust and are therefore typically superficial, egoistic and unconcerned with social and political issues. Only recently has this somewhat skewed picture of hedonism been reconsidered. In psychology there has been a redirection towards issues concerning happiness and subjective well-being as a supplement to the overwhelming interest in the negative aspects of life (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593112441565">Argyle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470593112441565">Huppert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112441565">Kahneman et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In sociology the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593112441565">Schulze (1992</xref>) announced the coming of the ‘experiential society’ as successor to the ‘abundance society’, which characterized the first post-war decades. Schulze argued convincingly that this new form of society gives rise to a range of hedonic strategies, each formative for different group-based styles of pleasure seeking. Hedonism is thus a complex matter involving various types of goals (objects) and various ways of defining pleasure and finding happiness. In consumer research an increasing number of contributions have focused on both the subjective qualities and social implications of experiential consumption (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593112441565">Arnould and Price, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593112441565">Goulding et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112441565">2009</xref>; Joy and Sherry, Jr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593112441565">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470593112441565">Thompson et al., 1989</xref>). Consumption of goods (external objects) serves to produce inner emotional effects due to changes in the level of arousal. By increasing tension above the everyday level, life may be experienced in a more intense way. On the other hand, the reduction of tension may lead to equally pleasant states of tranquillity, contemplation or meditation. By causing such effects experiences become memorable and meaningful breaks from daily life. Experiences can in other words enhance self-conception, further a sense of belonging, feeling accepted or partaking in a collective fate or contribute to the construction of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593112441565">Jantzen and Vetner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593112441565">Jantzen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One problem with this kind of emotional calculation is that the distinctions explain quite different emotional states. Some positive emotions (e.g. relief) are related to the absence or termination of pain and discomfort. Other positive emotions are related to an increase in the level of arousal (elation, ecstasy) or a decrease in this level (well-being), whereas ‘pleasure’ is a general term for both physiological and emotional responses to changes in arousal. This also explains why physical or mental pain may be pleasurable (e.g. masochism): the suffering is more than counterbalanced by the joy that increasing tension produces.</p>
<p>Consumption can produce extraordinary effects for consumers even though this may not have been the intention of the consumer or producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112441565">Goulding et al., 2009</xref>). Crucially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470593112441565">Scitovsky (1976</xref>) argues that such unintended consequences have become increasingly rare. Modern welfare economy has predominantly been oriented towards comfort, reducing distress and suffering. But as a side-effect modern life has become remarkably ‘joyless’. Experiential consumption might be understood as a way of restoring joy and pleasure as legitimate concerns even though the fulfilment of these concerns is now mediated via marketplace transactions. For Scitovsky, what used to be an automatic by-product of consumption – pleasure, joy – now needs to be an independent goal in order to be generated and experienced. But this goal-setting presupposes an emotional regime that favours experiences and joyful emotions as a meaningful access to ‘the good life’.</p>
<p>The marketization of experiences presupposes the interplay between objective and subjective conditions. To achieve this emotional regime the market must actually offer goods and events with experiential qualities or potential, and consumers must be both willing to derive, and capable of deriving, experiences from buying and using goods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593112441565">Fitchett, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112441565">2004</xref>). Both criteria are necessary if consumption of marketed commodities is to be perceived as pleasurable. The emotional regime of experiential consumption is based on a dialectics between the emergence of a world of objects mainly consisting of consumer commodities <italic>and</italic> a modern way of perceiving hedonism. This dialectics is summarized as follows: Structural conditions of modernity have brought about a modern form of hedonism, which in turn promotes these structural conditions. Changes in market supply and the practices of market communication have increased the range of experiential opportunities, but this presupposes individuals wanting consumer experiences. Increasing numbers of individuals give priority to experiential appetites which is thus dependent on the emerging existence of a world of experiential objects.</p>
<p>The importance of subjective conditions in the generation of pleasure is important here. Pleasure is an inner effect, only measurable by the experiencing individual; and the mere desire for pleasure is not in itself a sufficient prerequisite for actually experiencing joy. A range of mental activities from consumers themselves, such as planning for experiences, manipulating the senses and counting the means are implied in this hedonic operation. These can be broken down into aspects including imagination to spot and assess experiential opportunities; knowledge of the experiential market; understanding how the experiential qualities of products can be actualized most efficiently; and a willingness to be surprised by the unexpected. It also requires an ability to bring about the right mood for experiences and possessing the means to pursue experiential goals successfully.</p>
<p>These subjective qualities rely to a large degree on instructions on ‘how to do’ (imagination, ability) and ‘what to buy’ (knowledge) provided by media, peer group or marketers. This learning is affected by the supply side of the social, political and economic structure of corporate capitalism. As far as ‘means’ concerns consumers’ spending power, they are related to the demand side of this structure. Consumer demands are crucial to the development of an experiential market. A dramatic growth in the wealth of many ordinary citizens of the western world during the last century has promoted the appetite for hedonic consumption by enhancing the opportunities for acquiring experiential products. In this respect wealth should be understood as the liberty to set goals for consumption other than those determined by the needs for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470593112441565">Schulze, 1997</xref>). Rising levels of income, available for goals other than the satisfaction of basic needs, combined with increases in age, spare time and level of education, has affected life expectancies quantitatively as well as qualitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593112441565">Lebergott, 1993</xref>). The wealth of nations has been transformed into personal affluence and mass consumption, which has in turn highlighted the ‘hedonic treadmill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112441565">Brickman and Campbell, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593112441565">Kahneman, 1999</xref>). Over time, pleasure derived from new products diminishes as the individual adapts to novelty, which leads to an insatiable urge for ever more novel products. The absence of famine and starvation in affluent society has made the pursuit of happiness a more critical endeavour. Acquisition of and desire for more and more goods produce less and less in terms of hedonic pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593112441565">Easterbrook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470593112441565">Schwartz, 2004</xref>). Material progress does not automatically lead to greater joy in life but it sharpens the awareness of how consumption might contribute to or impede the pursuit of happiness in both the short and long term.</p>
<p>Consumer demand for novelty products is amply met by the supply side of the market. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470593112441565">Schudson (1986</xref>: 63) the average American general store or supermarket increased its range of products from 900 in 1928 to 3000 in 1950 and 8000 in 1970. The coming of hypermarkets in the last decades has no doubt multiplied these figures considerably. It is thus neither the lack of means nor that of goods that poses the biggest problem for modern consumers. Most often consumers do not have direct physical or sensual contact with the product they are about to buy. This, and the fact that many products seem more or less similar in price, quality and utility would make deliberate decisions virtually impossible without marketing communication and branding technology. Branding is just one of the tools by which market communication has been able to aestheticize goods. The first successful attempts at aesthetization are nearly as old as industrial mass production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112441565">Ritzer, 1999</xref>). At department stores, which in the 19th century became the pleasure domes of metropolitan life, new forms of display were developed which placed quite ordinary products within an exotic and exuberant realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593112441565">Miller, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470593112441565">Sennett, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112441565">Williams, 1982</xref>). Modern malls with their blends of hyper real settings from different epochs and cultures, popular culture, high fashion and consumer goods have intensified the suggestion that consumption represents a dream world of sensual pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112441565">Crawford, 1992</xref>). Window-shopping has thus become an obvious way for consumers to train their imagination, to elaborate on their longings and even to elicit imaginative gratifications for ‘free’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112441565">Friedberg, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Advertising also functions as a primary mode of aesthetization. In text and image ads disseminate knowledge of what and how to consume. Over the last century the content of advertising has changed from information on the product’s origin and its utility towards emphasizing the social and personal gratifications that buying and using the good might bring about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112441565">Falk, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593112441565">Leiss et al., 1986</xref>). The message conveyed is that consumption should be a matter of fun and joy, that emotions and meaningful experiences are seminal to ‘the good life’, and that the advertised product gives access to these qualities. The rhetorical style has become elliptic and elaborate, relying ever more on the reader’s own ability and willingness to interpret the message.</p>

<title>The emergence of modern hedonism</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593112441565">Schulze (1992</xref>) the experience society emerged as a result of the youth rebellion of the 1960s. This revolt was directed against the way in which the parent generation had administered the economic boom in the years after WW2. Not only the distribution of wealth was protested but the whole way in which life had been moulded came under scrutiny. A popular slogan of those years was ‘everything is political’. This implied that issues and realms that had been thought of as belonging to the private sphere and hence not really suitable for public discussions – gender roles, sex, education, intergenerational relationships, manners and conventions, etc. – were turned into political topics.</p>
<p>The key point of critique was mass consumption as championed by the political and economic elite and practised by the vast majority of new consumers who in the post-war era experienced an unprecedented increase in spending power. An early concise analysis of the dominant personality type in those first decades after 1945 was by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593112441565">Riesman (1950</xref>) who pointed out how individuals had turned from pursuing inner goals to other-directed behaviour. ‘The group’, and what others liked and bought, became the agenda setting for ambition and preferences. Consumption was primarily motivated by status and by the wish to maintain or improve one’s position in society by choosing the right commodities. The broader implications of this mentality were sketched out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112441565">Marcuse (1964</xref>) in what was to become a canonical text for the protesting youth. Mass consumption functioned as a new form of social repression by integrating classes with revolutionary potentials into the capitalist system. Mass consumption was thus a form of ideology based on false needs and leading to ‘one dimensionality’ by erasing any opposition.</p>
<p>For institutions and individuals in the new affluent society mass consumption was a tool for diminishing the experienced shortage in goods as well as in opportunities. Western welfare states were established with the ambition to create a better life for all, but this meant a standardization of tastes and styles which consequently erased pluralism and made domestic life even more uniform and therefore controllable. Consumers chose more and more of the same, which was more or less similar to what ‘others’ chose.</p>
<p>The primary political goal for youth culture rebellion became liberation. Private as well as public life had to be liberated from the constraints of consumption, the control by authorities, the false and subduing distinctions between high and low culture, private and public. The uniformity and false needs served by mass consumption were to be replaced by a good life for each based on the respect for heterogeneity and differences and on the meticulous search by each individual for his or her inner longings. This places emotions, sensuality and private sentiments on the public agenda, most notably in the ‘sexual revolution’. Surveys made by Inglehart since the 1980s document a trend in western societies towards ‘post-materialism’, which seems to increase for each new generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593112441565">Inglehart, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593112441565">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112441565">Inglehart and Welzel, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This process of self-actualization is in stark contrast to the form of self-control earlier generations had tried to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593112441565">Elias, 1969</xref> [1939]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1470593112441565">Simmel, 1957</xref> [1903]). According to Simmel modernity favoured a personality that utilized a reserved and blasé attitude to protect the integrity of the self in an ever more impersonal and atomized metropolis. For Elias, self-control was the result of an on-going civilizing process originating in the 16th century by internalizing external compulsion (<italic>Fremdzwänge</italic>) as sophisticated manners, a pleasant social appearance and other forms of bodily restraint. Throughout modernity individuals had gradually learned to control the body physically in order to give an emotionally correct presentation of the self to the outer world (<italic>Selbstzwänge</italic>). These formal constraints should ease social interaction in a world inhabited by strangers.</p>
<p>Youth culture in the 1960s made researchers in the Elias tradition reconsider whether emotional expressions could be regulated in ways other than restricted self-control. They coined phrases like ‘informalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470593112441565">Wouters, 1986</xref>), or ‘controlled decontrol of emotions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593112441565">Elias, 1989</xref>) to grasp the more outgoing, spontaneous and extrovert qualities of the younger generation. As a result, not only had it become legitimate to express emotions, but also valid and often irrefutable to evaluate objects, other persons and situations by invoking emotions and own experiences. This is evidenced by examples such as ‘That is not the way I experience it’ or ‘It didn’t feel right to me’. Consumers may justify their buying decisions by saying: ‘I like it’, ‘It is cool’, ‘This brand is just me’, ‘I think it looks exciting’. Such arguments are purely subjective, based on the inner evidence that feelings have generated in the consumption process.</p>
<p>The economic system has been able to adapt to the new currents of emotionality and to integrate aspirations from the 1960s in its marketing practices. The market increasingly offers commodities aimed not only at satisfying social ambitions and generating outer recognition, but also at increasing inner pleasure. Such experiences are not caused by getting more of the same or by acquiring something similar to what others buy. Experiential products are expected to reveal a novel aspect of the ‘true me’ behind the social mask. Consumption has thus reaffirmed its role in bringing about self-identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470593112441565">Shankar et al., 2009</xref>) at the same time at least potentially replacing the treadmill of social respectability with the hedonic treadmill of perpetual novelty seeking.</p>
<sec id="section6-1470593112441565">
<title>Hedonism and asceticism</title>
<p>From a history of mentality point of view there are at least two plausible explanations for this new emotional regime of experiential consumption. The first stresses the importance of Protestant ideas and practices in founding Romanticism, which makes up the ideational core of modern hedonism. The second emphasizes how the consequences of industrialism around 1900 created an understanding of experiences as beneficiary for the mental well-being of strained individuals. These two perspectives can easily be combined because they both elaborate on Weber’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593112441565">1976</xref> [1904]) analysis of the <italic>Protestant Ethic</italic>.</p>
<p>In his influential study on Protestantism Weber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593112441565">1976</xref> [1904]) challenges Marx’s (1976 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112441565">1867</xref>]) materialistic explanation of the rise of capitalism. According to Weber capitalism was not the inevitable outcome of objective laws of history but an unintended consequence of a set of ideas and values taught by Calvinism. Here the concept of predestination was seminal in that it prescribed individuals to work for his or her own salvation. By exercising self-control and asceticism the individual was able both to handle lust and desire correctly and to avert energy and means towards more prospective outcomes. The idea that the individual’s wealth was a sign of divine grace in that way led to behaviour directed towards investments instead of spending, thus creating the financial basis for capitalism.</p>
<p>Following Weber’s thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593112441565">Campbell (1987</xref>) studied the other side of asceticism, namely how the restraints implied in self-control increase awareness of the sensual and emotional sides of the body. Renunciation arouses the senses and draws attention to the body as a locus of pleasure and fantasies. As an unintended consequence individuals began to perceive themselves as sensitive beings thereby emphasizing the importance of subjective experiences, imaginations and feelings. This sensitivity reached a climax in Romanticism around 1800 where experiences, spontaneity and sensuality were defined as positive values against Rationalism, which in turn was criticized for being barren and hostile towards human nature.</p>
<p>Campbell’s argumentation is important for two reasons. First, it shows that the ethics of Protestantism is not just an ethics of production. By its preoccupation with the right use of the body it is, from the start, also an ethics of consumption. It does not exterminate lusts or extinguish drives, but actually diverts these towards sensitivity. Pleasure is not caused by the satisfaction of needs, but by the fulfilment of a desire that stems from the individual’s imagination. This desire and these imaginations were advanced because the Puritans tried to conceal sensuality from public life. Attempts at controlling emotions refined sensitivity. There is no absolute distinction between self-actualization and self-control; and contrary to suggestions by the disciples of Elias the process of civilization and ‘formalization’ has not been reversed into ‘informalization’. The origins of the contemporary emphasis on experiences are instead located in Puritanism and its renunciation of all worldly exuberance.</p>
<p>Second, Campbell introduces an important distinction between traditional and modern hedonism. In its traditional form the hedonist tried to obtain pleasure by choosing objects, which would arouse the senses. Pleasure was a simple sensory response to a pleasing stimulus. In contrast, the modern form of hedonism relies much more on imagination. Pleasure is not so much based on actual experiences with the object, but to a larger degree on the meanings individuals can produce about the object. Moreover, individuals can long for absent and unattainable objects, they can envision the object completely differently from how it really is, and they can even abstain from using the object of desire. Most crucially, they can do all this, without diminishing the experience. The modern hedonist, who is a skilled manipulator of own impressions and sensations, can play on a much wider and more sophisticated scale of possible experiences than even the mightiest despot in the era of traditional hedonism. This modern hedonist is a ‘dream-artist’ who has learned to control the world of objects and to modulate his or her own feelings and senses in order to optimize pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112441565">Friedberg, 1993</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1470593112441565">
<title>Hedonism as therapy and ideology</title>
<p>By focusing on the consequences and not the origins of capitalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593112441565">Lears (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112441565">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112441565">1984</xref>) highlights another aspect of Weber’s analysis: how technology, scientific knowledge and bureaucratic control lead to the rationalization of life. The world, according to Weber’s analysis, had been differentiated into separate compartments no longer united by shared values. Rationality progressively pervaded all spheres of life, thereby threatening to erase humanity as the core of human existence. By the end of the 19th century these frustrations had given rise to a new therapeutic ethos that presented an alternative to the doctrine of reticence and abstention that had dominated in the Victorian era. The spiritual and psychological wounds of rationalization could be healed by abundance. Modern mental diseases like neurasthenia or melancholy could be cured by intensive sensual experiences. Shock therapies utilizing strong sensations were seen as the means by which the self could be reintegrated.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593112441565">Lears (1981</xref>) this type of ‘abundance therapy’ was diametrically opposed to the established ‘scarcity therapy’, which had prescribed a cure of rest, moderation and reticence as the core elements in restoring balance in life. Whereas the older therapies had emphasized restraint, this new therapy made personal growth and spontaneity seminal to regaining happiness. Individuals had to let go, embrace the world and express their feelings if they wanted a fuller and richer life. The growth metaphor meant that the process of experiencing became more important than its result: growing in itself became a goal in life. Personality was conceived as constantly emerging as flexible and mutable, without an inner core, and thereby open to new impressions and sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593112441565">James, 1950</xref> [1890]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470593112441565">Mead, 1934</xref>). This concept bears remarkable resemblance to the way in which postmodern psychologists conceive of the self: personality can be moulded to fit a vast range of situations, and identity is an instantaneous effect of the individual’s ongoing interactions with the world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112441565">Gergen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470593112441565">Zurcher, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of humanistic psychology around 1950 marked a turning point in this new role for psychology. The existential approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470593112441565">Maslow (1943</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470593112441565">Rogers (1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593112441565">1970</xref>) stressed in theory and practice the importance of individual autonomy and sketched a route map towards a free and better life. Because freedom was characterized by spontaneity and authenticity, it became the aim of therapy to guide the individual towards as high a degree of self-actualization as possible. Therapy should restore the individual’s contact with his or her own nature, thought of as an unconditionally ‘good’ quality that had been corrupted by culture. Therefore therapy focused on restoring the individual’s natural authenticity. In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs self-actualization is realized on the highest and most desirable level, where the individual has grown out of his or her cultural constraints and thereby regained freedom.</p>
<p>Self-actualization is seminal to the emotional regime of experiential consumption by being presented as the ideal end point of balanced emotionality. Contemporary consumer culture presents this goal as a primary right and possibly a primary obligation. Self-actualization is <italic>the</italic> method to adapt, mend or profit from the consequences of modernity. It has become an integrative part of market economy, sold by certified psychologists but also by a vast cottage industry of self-made therapists, healers, and other groups of ‘emotional engineers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470593112441565">Kvale, 2003</xref>). It is impossible to measure the precise effects of this whole gamut of commercial advice on emotions and experiences. But it seems reasonable to assume that these talks and instructions have conveyed the impression that it is good to be sensitive and spontaneous, and not least that it might even be morally right to strive for pleasure. The emotional regime of experiential consumption may thus redeem the long nourished wish of social reformers from around 1900 as well as marketers in the 20th century for a new morality based not on scarcity and thrift but on abundance and extended consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112441565">Patten, 2004</xref> [1907]).</p>
<p>Patten’s prophecy of a transition from an ‘age of deficit’ to an ‘age of surplus’ and the passage from a ‘pain economy’ to a ‘pleasure economy’ was influential in the discussions on the economic revolution of that time. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470593112441565">James (1911</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593112441565">Lippmann (1986</xref> [1914]) drew upon Patten’s observations in their attempt to understand the cultural revolution, which was implied in the transformation of capitalism from property ownership to corporate business. Consumption was emerging as the driving force of economy, destabilizing traditional gender distinctions, questioning the existing ethos of work, and making the inner-directed personality type obsolete. One of the main consequences of this revolution was that it gave women a totally new role and self-confidence in social life. As Lippmann aptly remarked: ‘We hear a great deal about the class-consciousness of labour. My own observation is that in America to-day consumers’ consciousness is growing very much faster’ (Lippmann cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593112441565">Livingstone, 1998</xref>: 424). As consumption was very much conceived as an activity belonging to the female sphere this meant a ‘feminization’ of society and a higher emphasis on subjectivity, on feelings and sensitivity, in the public sphere.</p>
<p>Another of the consequences of this revolution was that social integration and the conditions of labour had to be reconsidered. Patten pointed at the necessity of civilizing the working class by incorporating them in the ‘pleasure economy’. Work should cease to be painful, and workers should be enabled to use the profits of their labour for enjoyable consumption. Amusement was hence seen as an emancipating <italic>and</italic> integrating tool:<disp-quote>
<p>Vice must be fought by welfare, not by restraint; and society is not safe until today’s pleasures are stronger than its temptations. Men must enjoy, and emphasis should be laid upon amusement so extended and thorough that primitive people may be incorporated by its manifold activities into the industrial world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112441565">Patten, 2004</xref> [1907]: 142 f.)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was not until the post-war era that this programme could begin to be achieved and required more than simply giving workers access to mass consumption. As foreseen by Patten and regretted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112441565">Marcuse (1964</xref>), access to pleasure, that is to specific ideals of why, how, what, and where to consume in an experientially gratifying way, was also necessary.</p>
<p>A fully developed democracy of pleasures would, if imaginable, imply that all social groups or lifestyles have equal rights to define and to find their own specific form of pleasure. But as shown in Bourdieu’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112441565">1984</xref>) extensive analysis of styles and tastes in France of the 1960s there remained significant differences between the working class and the middle classes in ways of relating to the world of goods. The working class preferred to satisfy needs immediately in order to generate actual sensual pleasures. Because ‘luxury’ and ‘affluence’ were perceived as ‘more of the same’ this set of preferences was still embedded in the paradigm of traditional hedonism. The upper-middle classes on the other hand rejected immediate sensations in favour of more contemplative attitudes where pleasure is derived in a more refined and controlled process of imagination.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593112441565">Schulze (1992</xref>) identifies the emergence of new distinctions in 1980s Germany. According to Schulze, the experience society is characterized by a third set of preferences that value excitement as an alternative to preferences for high culture (contemplation) as well as those for comfort (affluence) as outlined by Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112441565">1984</xref>). Preferences for excitement emphasize bodily sensations and appreciate action as a way of producing experiences. They aim at inner rewards either by sensual stimulation or by actualization of the authentic self. Schulze states that such preferences are typical for the generations following the youth rebellion of the 1960s. Modern hedonism thus implies such complex and contradictory operations as reacting spontaneously to unexpected events, manipulating moods and sensations, and choosing self-confidently from the world of objects. The ideal experiential consumer must be able to plan and organize his or her experiences, and at the same time be capable of being surprised. He or she acts deliberately, reacts emotionally uninhibited, and moreover has the capacity of verbalizing how mass-produced goods contain authentic messages about the self.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We began by outlining how both cognitive and cultural accounts of emotion are overly limiting in being able to understand the role and priority of emotion and experience in modern consumer cultures. The concept of emotional regimes is useful in providing a way to develop a more hybridized account, in which the universal character of emotion and the historical and political development of emotionality in culture can be brought together in a common explanation. One of the most salient characteristics of the emotional regime of consumer culture is a derived form of hedonism and the emphasis that this places on pleasure, and sensory and ‘inner’ experiences. Our analysis of hedonism, in which we described some of its historical conditions and antecedents, can be read as an attempt to describe in some detail the specific character of this emotional regime.</p>
<p>In some respects the modern marketplace can appear to be a realization of the pleasure economy prophesized by Patten a century ago. Corporate capitalism and welfare economics have shaped the structural conditions for abundance, giving citizens in the western world access to pleasurable products, goods, services and experiences, as well as creating the possibilities for subjectivities in which pleasure seeking is understood as a justifiable and even admirable life-goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593112441565">Firat and Venkatesh, 1995</xref>). But it has not created a new social and economic reality where joy reigns eternal. Wealth has been invested in order to optimize comfort: i.e. the absence of pain; and this may have produced joylessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470593112441565">Scitovsky, 1976</xref>) and disenchantment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112441565">Ritzer, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of this emotional regime of experiential consumption is the unintended outcome of the interactions between structural conditions of modern corporate capitalism, advancing both the supply and the demand side of consumer commodities aimed at experiences, and subjective conditions of modernity, favouring modern hedonism as a both sensual and active way of relating to the external world. The emotional regime of experiential consumption is a <italic>technique</italic> for intensifying sensibility, developed and taught by the ethics of Protestantism in which the individual has learned to calculate pleasure. It is a <italic>discourse</italic> through which to verbalize the methods of pleasure seeking, the quality of experiential products and the value of emotions, generated by ‘therapies of abundance’ in which individuals learn to express and assess experiences. And it is an <italic>ideology</italic> turning pleasure into a legitimate existential goal in life for the sake of self-actualization, derived from Romanticism and explicated by humanistic psychology. The individual has learned to measure his or her success in life in terms of experiences. Together, these aspects have contributed to the modern urge and ability to relate in an experiential way to the market, what we might term ‘overlearned habits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593112441565">Isen and Diamond, 1989</xref>). The core premise of this regime is that fun and pleasure are important to life, because they are essential for personal development as well as for social dynamics.</p>
<p>Pleasurable experiences are certainly no less important or significant than other types of experience or consumption goals. But at the root of this emotional regime is a contradiction between authenticity as a goal and inauthentic commodities as the means to reach this goal. Furthermore the regime establishes new fields of social comparison and therefore competition and when we fail to achieve pleasurable ambitions, anxieties, or kinds of emotional deficit, result.</p>
<p>This apparent contradiction might originate in a misconception about satisfaction. Pain and pleasure are not opposite poles on a scale of more or less discomfort but, and as implied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112441565">Bentham (2007</xref> [1789]), two separate forces of motivation. Pain motivates a pattern of consumption directed at satisfying needs, which is emotionally experienced as relief. The fulfilment of this motivation on a social level fosters stability and harmony. Pleasure on the other hand motivates a pattern of consumption driven by the urge to experience the extraordinary, which produces bodily excitation or relaxation leading to either ecstatic or meditative emotions. On the social level this urge for pleasure may have a destabilizing effect by favouring transgressions of and excess from ordinary life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112441565">Bataille, 1985</xref> [1932]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593112441565">Jantzen and Østergaard, 1998</xref>). The youth rebellion of the 1960s aimed precisely at destabilizing such social harmony, criticized for being a new form of social repression. Transgression and excess were perceived as the means for overthrowing the capitalist system, but certainly also as tools in the private politics of identity construction.</p>
<p>This foregrounding of bodily excitement and/or mental absorption as methods for self-development gave fun, feelings and fantasies political significance. In time, however, cultural industrial and commercial interests began to cater for the tastes of this new generation of young consumers by offering product and services that were capable of delivering pleasurable experiences. <italic>Herbie</italic> the anthropomorphic Volkswagen Beetle was an early remarkable example. It featured in the Disney movie <italic>The Love Bug</italic> (1968) and in a number of sequels. These films successfully depicted the car as a fun and ‘young’ personality able to laugh or ‘wink’ its headlights. As ordinary products were redesigned as pleasurable, for example by being marketed as new, extraordinary and inherently emotional, the reintegration of pleasure into social stability began. This has led to the hedonic treadmill where short moments of happiness soon become succeeded by longer stretches of indifference.</p>
<p>Elated experiences are thus not just for fun. They are serious business too, also from the perspective of the consumer. He or she is faced with the challenge of finding authentic happiness in a world of mass produced and hence inauthentic commodities. The crux of the matter is of course why pleasure and not comfort has become the token of ‘the good life’. The simple answer to this question is that pleasure is derived from transgression and hence points towards a universe of eternal meaningfulness, intimacy and joy beyond the routines of quotidian life. A more complex answer is that pleasure as a transgressing force contributes to perpetual change. It is an effect of the dynamics of novelty and surprise and as such implies aesthetics as well as ethics. The aesthetics of pleasure is novelty for the sake of pleasure, which is found in new styles, new relations or new goods. The ethics of pleasure is novelty for the sake of self-actualization, which is found in the questioning of existing projects, relations or preoccupations by new ‘horizons’ of opportunities.</p>
<p>Such ethics are at the heart of the emotional regime of experiential consumption based on the ideology of self-actualization. Self-actualization is the perpetual development of identity by ongoing elaborations of taste, feelings and life projects, with the purpose of becoming the person ‘that you really are’. This regime is a modern version of Romanticism’s sensibility, which defined feelings as the locus of authenticity. Its roots are also to be found in the ethics of Protestantism, an ethics of asceticism. First, that regime developed a set of techniques for manipulating bodily sensations and controlling emotions that are highly efficient for developing appetites, increasing pleasure or arousing the senses, even though these goals may be quite the opposite of what 17th century Protestants were aiming at. Second, by stressing self-actualization as the legitimate end point of emotionality the modern ethics of pleasure makes redemption a matter of individual responsibility or obligation, just like Protestantism. Ultimately it is the hedonist’s own effort that determines whether the experience will be emotionally pleasing or not, and disappointment can be interpreted as a sign of failing personal competences. This kind of guilt is not unlike that of predestination in that the wrongful administration of material surplus may indicate some kind of deficit.</p>
<p>Modern hedonism is anything but (just) fun. It may have severe consequences on personal identity by confronting the individual with their own deficiencies and inabilities. Most western citizens can make pleasure an independent goal in their life, but this does not imply that all kinds of pleasure are valued equally. This is precisely the meaning of an emotional regime: certain ways of ‘doing emotions’ are preferable to others. ‘Doing pleasure’ by defying immediate satisfaction and by headstrong choosing of uncommon objects clearly distinguishes the ‘elite hedonist’ from more ‘coarse’ or traditional hedonists. Hedonism thus becomes a field of social comparison with trendsetters and early adapters as well as people who lag behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593112441565">Peterson and Kern, 1996</xref>). The importance of both what to choose and how to do pleasure presupposes a system of discourse directing and instructing individuals on preferable objects of pleasure as well as enabling them to express their experiences with such objects in clear and distinctive terms. Therapeutic discourses established more than 100 years ago and since then disseminated by mass media have served this function.</p>
