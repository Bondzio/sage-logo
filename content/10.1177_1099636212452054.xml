<abstract>
<p>The increasing use of composites in high performance structural applications subjected to dynamic loading drives the need for understanding basic material failure properties and structural response as a function of loading rate. Balsa core sandwich beams having woven carbon/vinylester composite facesheets were investigated in both shear and bending failure at quasi-static and dynamic loading speeds producing strain rates ranging from 10<sup>−5</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Short sandwich beam tests show weak rate dependency, with a slight decreasing trend in the balsa core shear failure strain for increased strain rate. Wide scatter in core shear failure strain was observed due to the highly variable nature of the balsa material, as well as its heterogeneous tiled construction within the sandwich panel. Excitation of facesheet compressive failure in sandwich beams with weak core of 50.8 mm thickness required the use of 2.43 m long sandwich beams subject to high speed loading (10 m/s) in order to achieve 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> strain rate. Facesheet compressive failure strain in the long beam specimens under dynamic loading was measured to be 10% higher than for quasi-static loading. Comparison of long sandwich beam bending results to shorter solid laminate bending strength measurements show a different trend in rate dependency, and thus it is recommended that full-depth sandwich beams (and panels) be used to characterize the failure of these types of sandwich structures.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1099636212452054" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sandwich core composites are finding increased use in the maritime defense industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099636212452054">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099636212452054">3</xref>]. Common construction materials include carbon or glass fiber reinforced composite facesheets and balsa wood, polymer foam and honeycomb (metallic and non-metallic) for the cores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212452054">4</xref>]. Together, these materials form a panel system that is lightweight, has high bending rigidity and strength and is corrosion resistant. The low density core provides flexural stiffness by enforcing separation of the facesheets which resist bending moments via in-plane stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212452054">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636212452054">6</xref>]. However, direct out-of-plane loading challenges the core material due to the core’s low transverse shear strength. Due to the importance of sandwich composites in industries such as marine and aerospace, the behavior of sandwich beams, panels, and shells has been examined in great detail under different loading conditions in order to better understand the complex interactions between the facesheet and core, and the various possible failure mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212452054">4</xref>]. Of particular interest to this project is dynamic failure of sandwich beams under high speed loading from sources such as explosive blast. Thus, this present investigation focuses on the behavior of sandwich beams constructed with carbon fiber composite facesheets and a balsa wood core subject to both quasi-static and intermediate speed strain rate, under three- and four-point loading.</p>
<p>For all testing, it is imperative to generate the desired failure modes of interest. The specific details of load application to specimens in three point bending, namely the use of round loading rollers contacting directly onto the beams, may induce stress concentrations that can initiate local damage in the facesheet and core. Schubel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099636212452054">7</xref>] tested simply supported panels having carbon/epoxy facesheets and PVC foam cores subjected to loading by a spherical indentor. They noted that large local strains in the facesheet around the indentation location could lead to early failure of the thin skin. They emphasized the necessity for an analytical indentation model to account for the complex relationship between the contact area, the loading, and the subsequent core yielding behavior. This topic was also discussed in part by Hoo Fatt and Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636212452054">6</xref>]. Mines et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099636212452054">8</xref>] stated that while the loading roller in a three point bend test may have negligible effects for the system they considered, the local contact stresses on a loaded facesheet were significant for flexible cores and thin skins. While it is understood that these roller-contact stress concentrations are important to account for, they also represent a deviation from aim of this investigation as they produce undesirable failure modes. Thus, it is desired to minimize the effects of loading/support roller-induced stress concentrations by modifying the traditional three and four point bend test to provide a more distributed loading at these load points.</p>
<p>Once the structure is properly loaded in a manner that minimizes contact stress concentrations, efforts must be taken to ensure one obtains the desired failure mode: either transverse shear or moment failure. In three-point bend tests, for example, the same beam system may exhibit up to four distinct failure modes with the operative mode being the first failure mode achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099636212452054">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212452054">9</xref>]. Exciting shear failure in the core is readily achieved for sandwich beams having high strength facesheets and low strength core. Mines et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099636212452054">8</xref>] indicated that shear stresses were significant with respect to bending stresses for their 185 mm long sandwich beams of woven/chopped strand mat over polyester foam core subjected to three-point bend tests. They also showed core shear failure to occur following the dominant compressive skin failure. Wu and Sun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099636212452054">10</xref>] demonstrated the presence of intra-matrix cracks on either side of the loading location at angles of 40° to 45° for their 101 mm long sandwich beams of graphite/epoxy over Rohacell foam core. Thus, exciting shear failure in bending tests can be achieved with relatively short beam spans.</p>
<p>Exciting moment failure in sandwich beams is more difficult. Schultheisz and Waas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212452054">9</xref>] summarized four-point bend tests using the ASTM D 3410 test standard, indicating that compressive facesheet failure of moderate-length beams (559 mm long) was possible when the samples were prepared with double thickness facesheets on the tensile side. This enabled the compressive strains to develop on the loading side facesheet. Daniel and Abot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212452054">4</xref>] reinforced the sections of the beam between the loading roller and outer supports (where shear was present) by filling the honeycomb cells in their 457 mm long sandwich beams with epoxy. They left the center span of the beam unmodified, i.e. the span between middle loading rollers for four-point bend test. This ensured bending-induced failure in the center section of their sandwich beam specimens by eliminating the core shear failure mode. While both papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212452054">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212452054">9</xref>] outline solutions for their respective specimen configurations, neither are particularly suited for use in testing a prefabricated sandwich panel with a solid balsa wood core where facesheets can neither be customized nor the core filled with resin.</p>
<p>Gibson and Ashby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099636212452054">11</xref>] showed that failure mechanisms of cellular materials were dependent upon geometry of the beam and the relative strength of the facesheets and core. A study by Mines and Jones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099636212452054">12</xref>] stated that large-span beams were susceptible to upper skin wrinkling and compression failure and lower skin tensile failure, whereas shorter-span beams were more likely to experience core shear. This indicates that bending failure can be achieved by selecting the right geometry (increasing length) of the sandwich beam specimens.</p>
<p>The behavior of sandwich beams has been found to exhibit strain rate sensitivity. Tagarielli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099636212452054">13</xref>] showed that the compressive strength increased with strain rate for PVC and balsa core sandwich beams. It is noted that the beams tested were 200 mm long, i.e. within a range of length which has been previously identified to induce shear failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099636212452054">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099636212452054">10</xref>]. Okoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099636212452054">14</xref>] found an increased flexural energy to failure in solid woven glass laminates, of 8.5% per order magnitude increase in strain rate. Strain rate effects for bending failure tests on sandwich beam, especially for specimens of larger dimensions, e.g. 2.0+ m, are not presently known and is thus one of the key subjects of interest in this article. A methodology is presented herein to experimentally investigate the shear and bending failure response of sandwich beams having high-strength carbon composite facesheets and end-grain balsa wood core, at both quasi-static (10<sup>−5</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and intermediate-speed dynamic (10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) strain rates. Note that the term ‘intermediate’ is used here to described this magnitude of strain rate, with ‘high’ rate (not tested herein) referring to rates greater than 10<sup>1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. For long beams, achieving intermediate and high strain rates requires a loading system capable of considerable speed and stroke, and issues of specimen dynamic interaction with the applied loading system must be carefully considered.</p>

<p>All specimens were obtained by cutting beams from a larger existing sandwich panel consisting of carbon fiber laminated facesheets and end-grain balsa wood core. The facesheets were made from an equal number of alternating woven carbon fiber (Toray T700) plies of 0°/90° and ±45° orientation (fiber areal density of 306 and 408 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively) infused with vinylester resin via the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. The balsa wood core was 50.8 mm thick with a nominal density of 152 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and the grain was oriented in the out-of-plane direction. It should be noted the balsa core was a highly non-homogeneous mosaic construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636212452054">Figure 2</xref>), and thus exhibited significant variation in stiffness as measured qualitatively by indenting the surface with a sharp tool. This tiled construction resulted in varied density and thus core properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099636212452054">15</xref>] along the sandwich beam length, thereby affecting the measured core shear strength.

<sec id="sec3-1099636212452054"><title>Short sandwich beam shear tests</title>
<p>The short beam shear sandwich specimens, referred to as SSQ and SSI in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099636212452054">Table 1</xref>, were cut to dimensions of 305 × 76 mm<sup>2</sup> and were comprised of two 3.18 mm thick carbon fiber facesheets and balsa core for a total thickness of 57.2 mm. The 267 mm outer roller span was selected to excite beam shear failure in three-point bending. The specimens were instrumented with one strain gauge (350 Ω model TML FLA-6-350-1L) at midspan on the facesheet opposite of the loaded face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212452054">Figure 3</xref>) to record bending strain. Two 45° rosette gauges (350 Ω model TML FRA-3-350-11-1L) were attached on the midplane at 62.5 mm distance away from either edge of the beam as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212452054">Figure 3</xref>. The three channel rosettes allowed for measurement of shear strains in the balsa core while the single gauge directly measured bending tension in the facesheet.
<fig id="fig3-1099636212452054" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Short beam specimen for quasi-static and intermediate speed tests; dimensions in mm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212452054-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The specimens were loaded using a servohydraulic 100 kN capacity MTS 810 material test system (uniaxial tension/compression test machine). A fixture was machined to create simply supported outer boundary conditions with 19 mm diameter steel rollers. The centered load point was achieved by a 76.2 mm diameter cylinder of hard rubber foam. The foam was specifically selected to impart a distributed pressure load at the center of the specimen as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636212452054">Figure 4</xref>, while being compliant enough to conform to the deformed beam surface. This modification of the true point/line load (typically applied via a roller) was done to avoid localized failure at the beam center due to high contact stresses.
<fig id="fig4-1099636212452054" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Short beam testing, (a) overview, (b) quasi-static setup with laser extensometer, and (c) intermediate speed setup with dynamic load cell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212452054-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Quasi-static tests were conducted at crosshead speeds of 8.33 × 10<sup>−5</sup> m/s while intermediate speed tests were conducted at 0.25 m/s. Encore Model 663 strain signal conditioners were used for strain gauge excitation and signal amplification and a laser extensometer recorded beam center displacement (for quasi-static speed only). For intermediate speed tests, the test machine’s built in load cell was unable to capture the dynamic loading history due to the high grip and fixture mass. Therefore, a 111 kN Dytran 1060V5 piezoelectric dynamic force sensor was used as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636212452054">Figure 4</xref>(c) to measure load as close to the specimen as possible. Still images extracted from videos of the tests are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636212452054">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636212452054">6</xref> for the quasi-static and intermediate speed tests, respectively. These photos show typical failure progression behavior observed in all short sandwich beam tests.

<p>Regardless of strain rate, core shear failure dominated for the short beam sandwich specimens. Also, failure initiation was not rate dependant, with shear failure of the balsa wood core occurring parallel to the wood grain first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636212452054">Figures 5</xref>(b) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636212452054">6</xref>(b)), followed by widespread core-facesheet separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636212452054">Figures 5</xref>(c) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636212452054">6</xref>(d)). Location of the initial failure was unpredictable, occurring anywhere between the midspan and the outer support rollers, on either side of the beam, and appearing as single or multiple shear cracks through the cross section of the balsa core along the grain of the wood.</p>
<p>Bending and shear strain histories (calculated from the rosette gauges) are plotted in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212452054">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212452054">8</xref> for the quasi-static and intermediate speeds, respectively. It is apparent that the shear strains between the left and right gauges are not identical. This can be attributed to the varied material properties of the balsa wood core which exists due to the tiled construction of the core, leading to variations in the core shear modulus. A higher modulus section of core leads to lower shear strain for the same loading level. Strains drop off suddenly following shear failure of the balsa wood core. Visible damage (observed via video and indicated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212452054">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212452054">8</xref>) occurs at or very soon after this drop off.

<fig id="fig8-1099636212452054" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Strain versus time for sandwich beam, shear test, intermediate speed loading.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212452054-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Using a manufacturer-supplied balsa wood shear modulus value of 215 MPa, as well as an assumed effective laminate interlaminar shear modulus for the carbon facesheets of 15.2 GPa, the expected shear strain was calculated from the measured applied load using beam shear analysis and plotted on the same graphs, labeled as ‘Calculated Shear’ in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212452054">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212452054">8</xref>. The calculated shear follows the measured strain versus time trends closely, with the main discrepancy being the magnitude which would scale based on knowing the actual (as opposed to assumed) balsa core shear modulus at each of the rosette gauge locations. This matchup shows that force data can be used to calculate core shear stress as long as the proper modulus is known.</p>
<p>From the many short sandwich beams tests, the peak shear strains (shown by the typical plots in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212452054">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212452054">8</xref>) are identified as the core shear failure strains. These are all summarized as a function of strain rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1099636212452054">Figure 9</xref>. Note the wide scatter in the data is related to the previously discussed balsa wood core material variability. Such variability of balsa core properties has been reported by da Silva and Kyriakides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099636212452054">15</xref>] as well. The shear failure strains are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099636212452054">Table 2</xref> together with the corresponding bending strains at the moment of core shear failure. Also plotted in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212452054">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212452054">8</xref> is the bending strain history. Notice that the bending strains are far below the strain levels associated with failure of the facesheet material (8000 to 10,000 µε). This is due to the fact that the facesheets do not fail during these tests, but rather, widespread core-facesheet debonding causes dramatic stiffness loss with large deformations. Thus, it is apparent that the short sandwich beams are limited by the shear failure of the weak balsa core since the carbon laminates are far from being stressed to their failure limit.

<sec id="sec4-1099636212452054"><title>Solid laminate bending tests</title>
<p>The short beam bending specimens, referred to as SBQ and SBI in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099636212452054">Table 1</xref>, were solid carbon laminated beams of dimensions 13.97 mm thickness, 305 mm length and 76 mm width. These were obtained by separating the thick facesheets off of balsa core sandwich panels leaving a roughly 13 mm thick layer of balsa wood attached to prevent facesheet damage during saw cutting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212452054">Figure 10</xref>, the balsa was carefully removed completely from the beam center area to allow strain gauge placement and near the edges to facilitate the simply-supported boundary condition rollers to directly contact the composite surface. The stiffness and strength of the balsa was negligible relative to the carbon fiber laminate and thus did not affect the bending test results. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212452054">Figure 10</xref>, two strain gauges were mounted to the backside (tension side) of the specimen, at the center and at 38.1 mm off-center. Loading and boundary conditions were the same arrangement shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636212452054">Figure 4</xref>, including the hard rubber central loading contact.

<p>Camera stills extracted from video are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212452054">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1099636212452054">12</xref> for typical examples of quasi-static and intermediate speed tests, respectively. The failure mechanism is found to be independent of loading rate: in-plane failure initiates on the compressive loading face of the beam, delamination and compressive failure then progress towards the midplane of the beam, and finally backside tensile fiber failure occurs. Strain data plotted versus time in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1099636212452054">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1099636212452054">14</xref> provide additional information regarding failure. For the quasi-static tests, initial delamination and cracks in the compressive surface plies form with no detectable indications in the strain curves since only the backside (tensile) strain is measured. Cracking and delamination propagate and, prior to complete failure, a pseudo plastic hinge begins to form. This plastic hinge-like behavior explains the observed strain trend, which remain relatively constant on the outer gauge but continues to increase at the same rate on the middle gauge. This is due to the outer gauge region un-straining (i.e. straightening) as the pseudo plastic hinge forms, as shown clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212452054">Figure 11</xref>(c). Once the hinge is fully formed and damage has propagated to the midplane of the beam, the specimen now exhibits backside tensile fiber failure shown by the middle gauge spiking and the strains on the outer gauge drops (unloads). It should be noted that the video images and strain plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212452054">Figures 11</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1099636212452054">15</xref> are representative examples of several tests repeating the same conditions.

</p>
<p>Since the center of the beam is subjected only to moment loading (no axial force), the bending strain is assumed to be equal and opposite at the top and bottom of the beam. Thus, the middle gauge measurement can be used to infer initiation of compressive failure at the top of the beam. The bending strains at compressive failure, measured by the middle gauge, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1099636212452054">Figure 15</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1099636212452054">Table 3</xref>. The final tensile failure strains are also listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1099636212452054">Table 3</xref>. Failure strains increased with strain rates, particularly the compressive strains which exhibited up to 67% higher values at the intermediate loading rate relative to quasi-static. Also, tensile strains were higher than compressive strains for both strain rates. This is expected since carbon fiber composite materials are known to exhibit significantly higher tensile strength than compressive strength.

<sec id="sec5-1099636212452054"><title>Long beam bending quasi-static tests</title>
<p>To investigate bending induced failure rather than the more easily excited balsa core shear failure, long beam specimens of 2.43 m length were necessary. This permitted a 2.134 m span between outer roller supports to develop higher moments for a given applied load, and thus avoid core shear failure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1099636212452054">Figure 16</xref>, the four-point bend test setup used two central loading rollers spaced 152 mm apart to develop a constant moment zone with no shear in the central gauge section region between the inner rollers. The support rollers were 38.1 mm diameter while the loading rollers were 19.05 mm diameter. Placed between each roller and the beam specimen surface were fiberglass spreader plates and silicone rubber contact pads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1099636212452054">Figures 17</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1099636212452054">18</xref>). The spreader plates were used to prevent stress concentrations due to the rollers contacting directly onto the facesheets, so as to avoid localized roller-adjacent failures.

<p>The beams for the quasi-static tests were cut to have a uniform and prismatic cross section throughout. For the dynamic tests, the zone between central rollers on the specimens was ‘dogbone’ cut to ensure bending failure.

<p>The quasi-static loading was conducted using a 2.67 MN capacity SAETEC uniaxial test machine operating in displacement control at a rate of 0.42 mm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1099636212452054">Figure 20</xref>). Specimens were loaded onto the test fixture and a 380 mm range string pot was attached directly to the beam midspan to measure center displacement. Strain gauges were applied midspan on both compression and tension side facesheets. Twin 222 kN load cells (visible in top portion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1099636212452054">Figure 20</xref>) measured the total force applied (summing both of their outputs). Although the loading rate was very slow, once the actuator reached about 125 mm displacement, the compressive side facesheets failed in compression and lost stiffness suddenly. The high energy-releasing event sent stress waves through the sandwich beam that subsequently sheared the balsa wood core. Backside tensile failure was not observed. The load versus displacement data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1099636212452054">Figure 21</xref> for all specimens, and the strain versus displacement data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1099636212452054">Figure 22</xref>. The peak compressive strains are identified as the compressive strength, and typical compressive failure in the facesheet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-1099636212452054">Figure 23</xref>, with all failures occurring in the zone between the two inner loading rollers.

</p>
<p>The load versus displacement plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1099636212452054">Figure 21</xref> indicates nearly identical stiffness and for the three test specimens. This is in contrast to the variable shear behavior that is governed by the balsa core. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1099636212452054">Figure 22</xref>, the longitudinal strains are linearly proportional to the transverse applied displacement. However, the strains exhibit slight variations between tests which are not observed in the load plots. This may be due in part to small variance in beam geometry or local stiffness variance in the outer ply carbon fiber facesheet material. In general, peak strains and forces are similar between the three recorded tests, and the tensile gauge recorded strains of identical magnitude to the compressive gauge. The intermediate signal drop for specimen LBQ2 is a temporary electrical interference in the data acquisition system appearing in both the load and strain data simultaneously.</p>
<p>For the quasi-static loaded long sandwich beams (LBQ series), the average compressive failure strain of 8890 µε is 57% greater than the compressive failure strain of the quasi-static loaded monolithic beam bending tests (SBQ series average is 5670 µε). Note that this is over three times greater than the compressive strains recorded at the time of core shear failure for the short beam sandwich tests (SSQ series). Thus, for quasi-static loading, it is clear that the excitation of bending-induced compressive failure of the facesheets in weak-core sandwich panels requires the use of full-depth sandwich beams of adequate length, sized to achieve suitable bending moments while keeping transverse shear stress low to avoid core shear failure. More economical short-span beams, sandwich or solid laminates (e.g. facesheets separated from the core) should not be used to measure compressive failure strain as these specimen configurations could lead to very different strain levels and failure modes.</p>

<p>Dynamic loading was applied to long beam specimens having the design shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1099636212452054">Figure 19</xref>, with actual specimen geometry given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1099636212452054">Table 6</xref>. Note that dynamic specimens LBI1 to LBI3 did not have the dogbone geometry. Also the same test fixture as the quasi-static tests was used, albeit mounted vertically to a concrete reaction wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1099636212452054">Figure 24</xref>) and with an additional set of rollers added to the outer supports, contacting the loaded-side facesheet, to prevent the specimen from lifting up off of the boundaries at these locations during the initial dynamic contact with the centered load-application system. High speed loading was applied at a rate of 5–10 m/s using the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) Blast Simulator system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099636212452054">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099636212452054">17</xref>]. The UCSD Blast Simulator is a unique system that is able to apply high rate dynamic loading to simulate blast events without the use of explosive materials. This is accomplished with an array of high velocity hydraulic actuators driven by a combined high pressure nitrogen/hydraulic energy source. In explosive field testing, video and data from instrumentation are often lost due to the destructive nature of the blast environment (fireball, shock/pressure pulse).

<p>For the long sandwich beams, a piezoelectric 111 kN dynamic load cell was mounted to a steel load spreader bar, which in turn, served to distribute the applied force to two loading rollers as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1099636212452054">Figure 24</xref>. A 25 mm cube of 160 kg/m<sup>3</sup> rigid urethane foam mounted in front of the load cell prevented the steel ram from impacting directly onto the hardened steel head of the force sensor, thereby avoiding high frequency ringing in the force data. This foam cube can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1099636212452054">Figure 24</xref> behind the adhesive tape straps which held the foam onto the force sensor face.</p>
<p>High speed hydraulic rams accelerated the metal pusher plate to a velocity of 5 m/s and 10 m/s as it impacted the specimen. These speeds were selected to give an intermediate strain rate of 10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (high-rate would be greater than 10<sup>1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). The specimen was instrumented with up to six strain gauges: two linear gauges front and back of midspan, and four 45° rosettes mounted at half and quarter span points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-1099636212452054">Figure 25</xref> for locations).

<p>The progression of dynamic failure was observed with high speed video. Still images from the video are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1099636212452054">Figure 26</xref>. The images show the loading of the beam until compressive failure initiates in the loaded-side carbon facesheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1099636212452054">Figure 26</xref>(b)), followed by increasing compression-induced damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1099636212452054">Figure 26</xref>(c)) and finally shear failure of the balsa wood core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1099636212452054">Figure 26</xref>(d)). The compressive failure in the facesheet, shown in more detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-1099636212452054">Figure 27</xref>, exhibited similar attributes as the quasi-static test specimens with no (obvious visual) failure to the tension-side facesheet. All specimens failed in the intended gauge section between rollers.

<p>For tests LBI1 to LBI5, the ram was allowed to accelerate to full velocity (5 m/s for LBI1 and LBI4, 10 m/s otherwise) before impacting onto the dynamic force cell which then pushes the beam specimen via the spreader bar. For tests LBI6 and LBI7, the ram was positioned within 6 mm of the load cell and accelerated while pushing the beam, creating a gradual force and strain buildup, rather than a sudden impact. Since the long beams required considerable deflection to develop before failure initiated, the desired strain rate was developed at the time of failure.</p>
<p>The force and strain time history plots for specimen LBI5 (impact loading) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-1099636212452054">Figures 28</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30-1099636212452054">30</xref>, and for specimen LBI7 (gradual loading) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31-1099636212452054">Figures 31</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33-1099636212452054">33</xref>. Data plotted for the other dynamically loaded long beam specimens were similar. For both modes of loading, the force measured by the load cell reached maximum value within a few milliseconds after first contact of the pusher plate with the foam block and load cell, corresponding to full crushing of the foam. Due to the dynamic nature of the loading and the mass of the steel spreader bar, these peak forces were out of phase with the peak displacements and strains of the beam specimens. LBI5 has a higher peak force than LBI7 due to the incoming full-speed 10 m/s impact of the ram onto the load cell. LBI7 had a much lower maximum force since the ram was still accelerating upon contact with the load cell. This helped to maintain contact between the pusher plate and load cell, as evidenced by the non-zero force between 2 and 27 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31-1099636212452054">Figure 31</xref>. In contrast, the zero force between 23 and 33.5 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-1099636212452054">Figure 28</xref> shows that contact between the load cell and pusher plate was lost (or very light) due to the high initial impact accelerations applied to specimen LBI5. Despite zero force being measured between the pusher plate and load cell, the combined mass of the load cell and steel spreader bar and inner loading rollers are applying some amount of contact force to the beam specimens as the spreader bar assembly and beam center move in concert with each other. Unfortunately, this quantity was not measurable since load cells were not placed between the rollers and the specimen surface.

<p>Strain gauges mounted at the center span on the impact side and backside of the specimen show an equal and opposite behavior indicating pure moment acting in the gauge section. For all specimens, the front and back strain gauges record a 3 to 4 ms duration initial ‘bump’ (approximately at time 21 ms for LBI4 and LBI5 and time 12 ms for LBI6 and LBI7). This corresponds to the initial loading pulse of the ram first contacting the load cell, load-spreading fixture, and subsequently the specimen. For this short time duration, the load fixture is accelerating faster than the ram. From the bending strain plots in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29-1099636212452054">29</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32-1099636212452054">32</xref>, failure is evident by the sudden drop in compressive strain magnitude, as measured by the impact-side gauge. Since compressive failure occurs on the impact side, only this gauge drops in magnitude, whereas the tensile side strain level remains almost constant as no backside tensile failure occurs. For the gradual loading case, the onset of failure (compressive strain drop in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32-1099636212452054">Figure 32</xref> at time 25.2 ms) aligns with a sudden drop in the contact force. This matchup of a drop in load and strain was not observed in the impact loading mode (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-1099636212452054">28</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29-1099636212452054">29</xref> at time 36 ms). In both cases, no more force was measured by the load cell after failure. Also, the mode of loading did not affect the peak compressive strain measured at the time of failure. However, the gradual mode is preferable so as to avoid high initial contact forces which can induce unwanted early localized failures.

<p>The core shear strain data measured by the rosette gauges are plotted in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30-1099636212452054">30</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33-1099636212452054">33</xref> for specimens LBI5 and LBI7, respectively. No clear trends in shear strain, at each of the four points along the beam, were observed. The gradually loaded beam (LBI7) did show a general rise in shear strain magnitudes up until the onset of failure at time 25.2 ms, whereas the impact loaded beam (LBI5) shear strains mostly oscillated around zero, until the approach of failure at time 36 ms. While the magnitudes of shear strain were within the range for which core shear failures were measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099636212452054">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1099636212452054">Figure 9</xref>), core shear failures were not observed (by high-speed video and post-test visual assessment) to occur in these long beam dynamic bend tests.</p>
<p>Displacement information is extracted from the high speed video, and the displacement time history for LBI7 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34-1099636212452054">Figure 34</xref> (displacement profiles for other tests are similar). It should be noted that displacement of LBI7 is negligible at time 12 ms, whereas force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31-1099636212452054">Figure 31</xref>) is at its maximum. This highlights the dynamic nature of this test, even for the gradual loading mode, where the peak force measured by the load cell is not in phase with the peak displacement of the beam as expected for quasi-static and slow-speed tests. Thus, force measurements should not be used to calculate stresses or strains at the time of failure for this class of dynamic tests, as is often done for quasi-static loading. Also, the displacement is nearly linear with time after 12 ms since its movement is defined by the ram moving at constant velocity. Aberrations to this linear trend are observed following the onset of failure at 25.2 ms.

<sec id="sec7-1099636212452054" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>A summary of the compressive failure strain versus strain rate data for all bending tests (long sandwich and short monolithic beams) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35-1099636212452054">Figure 35</xref>. Under quasi-static loading rate, the short solid beams (SBQ series) exhibit much lower compressive failure strain than the long beam sandwich beams (LBQ series). This specimen dimensional scaling effect has been observed by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099636212452054">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099636212452054">21</xref>], where thicker composite beams were found to exhibit considerably lower strength. This effect was accounted for by Bažant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099636212452054">22</xref>] via an energy-statistical size effect model which accounts for the energy release caused by stress redistribution due to the growth of fracture developing within a boundary layer zone.
<fig id="fig35-1099636212452054" position="float"><label>Figure 35.</label><caption><p>Compressive failure strain versus strain rate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212452054-fig35.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Increasing strain rate shows higher compressive failure strain for both specimen types, with a stronger increase exhibited by the solid beam bending specimens (SBI) loaded at intermediate speed. This rate-dependent effect is due to the increased stiffness of the visco-elastic matrix which is known to be a key property affecting the fiber micro-scale buckling that precipitates the macro-scale compressive failure of fiber-reinforced composites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099636212452054">23</xref>,24]. At the higher strain rate, comparison of the solid beam and long beam sandwich compressive failure strains shows no significant difference, i.e., no strong length scale effect for higher-speed loading. A possible explanation of this is that the specimens subjected to higher speed loading are not able to develop the full process zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099636212452054">22</xref>] and so the size effect diminishes (or is weaker) at higher speed loading rates.</p>
<p>The large difference in rate dependency between short solid and long sandwich beam specimens does point out that rate-dependent strength characterization of sandwich beams by bending test must be conducted with the full sandwich configuration intact, which dictates the use of long beams, rather than the more economical short beams comprised of non-sandwich laminates (such as a single facesheet extracted from the panel).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1099636212452054" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Dynamic test methods were developed for exciting core shear and facesheet compression failure modes in sandwich composite beams at strain rates up to 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. These methods were demonstrated for specimens having high-strength composite facesheets (woven Toray T700 carbon fiber/vinylester) mounted to core having low shear strength (end-grain balsa with nominal density 152 kg/m<sup>3</sup>). For the short sandwich beam shear tests, the initial failure mode was shear cracks forming along the balsa grain. Extensive debonding of the core from the facesheets originates from the locations of the initial cracks, resulting in a drastic stiffness reduction and a loss of load bearing capability. Shear failure strain, measured over a strain rate of 10<sup>−5</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, was found to be weakly dependent on strain rate, with a slight decreasing trend for increasing loading rates. Shear failure strains varied significantly from one side of the beam to the other due to the variability in the density (proportional to modulus) of the natural balsa wood material. Therefore, core shear failure strain is not reliably calculated (via beam shear analysis) from the applied load measurement and should be directly measured (e.g. via strain rosette gauges).</p>
<p>Short thick non-sandwich beam three-point bending was used to investigate bending failure. Strain rates ranging from 10<sup>−5</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> produced compressive failure and delamination originating at the compressive side of the beam. The compressive failure strains were found to increase strongly with strain rate for the thick beam specimens (67% increase over quasi-static), a phenomenon that could be explained, in part, by matrix stiffening induced by high strain rate which prevents the carbon fibers from micro-buckling (controls compressive failure onset) until higher strain levels were reached.</p>
<p>Sandwich beam bend tests required the use of long 2.43 m specimens in order to achieve facesheet compression failure, rather than core shear. Facesheet compressive failure strain of specimens under dynamic loading was measured to be 10% higher than for specimens under quasi-static loading. The difference in rate sensitivity for the full sandwich versus thick non-sandwich beam (made of facesheet material) highlights the requirement that bending strength characterization tests should use full-depth sandwich test specimens. Thus, for weak core sandwich beams with high strength facesheets, rate-dependent failure characterization needs to be conducted with beams of adequate length, sized to achieve suitable bending moments while keeping transverse shear stress low to avoid core shear failure. Such long specimens require large-sized test machines with adequate high speed capability (e.g. 10 m/s) in order to achieve strain rates of interest. The long-span beams exhibit large deflections prior to failure and thus the challenge to find adequate-speed testing machines are significant, in order to achieve even the intermediate strain rates investigated herein. More economical short-span beams, either sandwich or solid laminates (e.g. facesheets separated from the core), should not be used to measure compressive failure strain as these specimen configurations could lead to very different failure strain measurements, failure modes, and incorrect trends in strain rate-dependency.</p>
<p>Finally, dynamic tests require the use of dynamic load cells, measuring applied load as close to the specimen as possible. Even with accurately measured loading information, dynamic loading might be out of phase with peak deflections (i.e. peak strains) when failure occurs. Therefore, it is recommended that strain gauges be relied upon to directly measure local strain information related to failure modes of interest, since the relationship between applied load and failure strain (or stress) often cannot be simply calculated as is conventionally done in quasi-static bend tests.</p>
