<title>Background:</title>
<p>In 2008, immigrants constituted 14% of the population of Sweden, a high-risk area for multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated the largest Swedish immigrant populations for the prevalence of MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511433062">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Data on foreign-born MS patients were retrieved from Swedish national health and population registers. We calculated observed versus expected numbers of MS patients and gender- and age-specific prevalence ratios (PR) between immigrant populations and the general population of Sweden and, where possible, of the countries of birth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458511433062">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The 19 largest immigrant populations included 1327 MS patients. The global variation in MS prevalence was reflected in Sweden. The prevalence in immigrant populations who had moved to Sweden from countries with a lower MS risk was however higher than in their countries of birth. Notably, the MS prevalence in the population born in Iran was at least as high as in the general population of Sweden (men: PR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.81–1.46, <italic>p</italic> = 0.537, women: PR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.97–1.44, <italic>p</italic> = 0.855) and more than twice as high as in Isfahan, Iran (men: PR = 3.06 (95% CI 2.26–4.06), <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001, women: PR = 2.21 (95% CI 1.81–2.68), <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511433062">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The MS prevalence increased in migrants who moved to Sweden from countries with a lower MS risk. In the Iranian immigrant population the prevalence exceeded that in the general population of Sweden. This indicates that Iranians carry genetic factors that contribute to a higher MS risk when environmental–lifestyle MS risk factors change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sweden is a high-risk area for multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2008, the nationwide prevalence was 188.9/100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup> Increasing waves of immigrant labourers, refugees and asylum seekers have come to Sweden since the end of the Second World War (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511433062">Figure 1</xref>). The percentage of foreign-born Swedish residents in 2008 was approximately 14%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup> The uneven worldwide geographic distribution of MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433062">2</xref></sup> has raised questions about how genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the risk of MS. Studies of migration from low- to high-risk areas or vice versa have suggested that the migrant’s risk of MS is influenced by the country of birth and the country of destination, as well as the age at migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511433062">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511433062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511433062">6</xref></sup> In a previous study, we found a surprisingly high incidence of MS in immigrants from Iran, living in Gothenburg, Sweden. The risk of MS was at least as high as that of the general population of Gothenburg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433062">7</xref></sup> Our aim in the present study was to investigate the nationwide prevalence of MS in each of the largest immigrant populations of Sweden, in relation to the prevalence in the general population of Sweden and to the prevalence in the country of birth.</p>

<title>Area and population</title>
<p>Sweden lies between latitudes 55° and 69° north in Northern Europe. Despite its northern latitude, Sweden has a temperate climate. In 2008, the immigration rate was 11/1000 and the emigration rate was 5/1000. On the prevalence day 31 December 2008, 1,281,581 persons (13.8%) of the Swedish population of 9,256,347 had been born abroad: 21% in other Nordic countries, 36% in non-Nordic European countries and the remaining 43% in non-European countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scb.se">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1352458511433062">
<title>History of immigration to Sweden</title>
<p>Waves of immigration to Sweden followed after the Second World War. In broad outline, immigration from other Nordic countries has continuously been high. Immigrant labour, mainly from Finland and southern Europe, came to Sweden during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East and South America dominated immigration and during the 1990s, the largest immigration was from the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East. During the last decennium, the largest immigrant group came from Iraq. The adoption of children by Swedish parents has contributed to immigration since the 1970s, especially from Korea and India (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511433062">Figure 1</xref>). Each individual who moved to Sweden with the intention of remaining for at least one year, and thus had been assigned a personal identity number, was registered in the Total Population Register (TPR) and in most personal registers in Sweden, such as health data registers. Besides the 10-digit personal identity number which has been mandatory in Sweden since 1947, the TPR includes information about gender, date of birth, residence at birth, country of birth, changes in residency, dates of immigration and emigration and the date of death (when applicable) for each person who has been or is residing in Sweden.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458511433062">
<title>Immigrant populations and patients</title>
<p>We retrieved information about each of the 9,256,347 inhabitants of Sweden on the prevalence date 31 December 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup> The sources used were three Swedish national registries, described in detail in our previous prevalence study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup> <italic>The Swedish Multiple Sclerosis Registry (SMSreg)</italic> was searched for patients with MS according to the Poser criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511433062">8</xref></sup> or MS or Possible MS according to the McDonald criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511433062">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511433062">10</xref></sup> <italic>The Swedish National Patient Register (NPR)</italic> was searched for patients with MS according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10, 9 and 8 (G359, 340 and 340.99). We obtained information about the place of residence and country of birth from the TPR. The SMSreg, the NPR and the TPR were linked and the Swedish 10-digit personal identity number ensured that MS patients, who were registered in more than one register, were counted only once. The number of patients included in the 2008 prevalence was 17,485. These patients were registered with MS or Possible MS in the SMSreg and/or MS in the NPR before 2009 and were alive and resident in Sweden on the prevalence date. The proportion of Possible MS patients probably constituted only a few per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We focused on Swedish residents born outside Sweden. Individual data taken into account were gender, age (with one-year precision), whether a diagnosis of MS was present on the prevalence date and country of birth. The prevalence study design implied that no information about age at immigration, age at MS onset, or the number of years living in Sweden was included. We had obtained the information about the birth countries of all Swedish residents including MS patients, but not of their parents. We had no information about ethnicity. Therefore, an individual who had been born in Sweden was not counted as an immigrant, even if both parents had been born outside Sweden. Conversely, a Swedish resident who had been born in a foreign country was counted as an immigrant, even if both parents had been born in Sweden. Out of 91 countries of birth, we selected those representing immigrant populations of more than 15,000 in Sweden. We obtained age- and gender-specific population figures with one-year precision for each of the largest immigrant populations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scb.se">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>). For comparisons of the MS prevalence in Swedish immigrant populations and countries of birth, age- and gender-specific MS prevalence figures were retrieved from published reports. When such prevalence figures were not shown, we used graphs of published results for estimating the age-specific prevalence. Although some countries of birth included in this study had not reported the MS prevalence, we defined Norway, Denmark, Finland, the UK and the US as high-risk countries for MS; Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria as medium-risk countries for MS; and India, China, Thailand and Somalia as low-risk countries for MS, according to the worldwide MS prevalence geography, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433062">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511433062">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>When studying the risk of MS for different populations, we could either try to estimate the incidence of MS as a function of age during a period or the prevalence at a certain day. Since the latter mentioned type of estimation can be performed with greater accuracy, we chose to study the prevalence on the last day of 2008. Data were similarly obtained for the general population and the native born population of Sweden, as well as for each of the foreign-born populations of Sweden. For each one-year age group, both the number of MS patients and the population figure were obtained. The expected number of MS patients (foreign-born in a certain country and resident in Sweden) if the MS prevalence coincided with that in the general population of Sweden, was estimated as follows: for each gender and year of age (0 to ≥ 99 years), the population number of immigrants in Sweden was multiplied by the relative MS prevalence estimate for the population of Sweden and the products for each year of age were summed. The expected number of MS patients if the MS prevalence coincided with that in the country of birth was similarly estimated. The prevalence ratio (PR) was calculated as the number of observed MS patients divided by the expected number. Test and calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CI) were performed exactly by use of Poisson distributions. For comparison between two prevalence estimates we used Fisher’s exact test.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our previous study showed a prevalence of MS in the general population of Sweden of 188.9/100,000, based on 17,485 MS (or Possible MS) patients on the prevalence date 31 December 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup> Of these, 15,840 patients had been born in Sweden and 1645 in 91 other countries. Nineteen immigrant populations greater than 15,000, comprising a total of 940,357 persons (449,790 men and 490,567 women) were studied. A total of 1327 MS patients (407 men and 920 women) were identified in these populations, comprising 80.7% of the total number of foreign-born MS patients on the prevalence date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511433062">Figure 2</xref>). The prevalence of MS in the population born in Sweden was 198.6/100,000 (118.5 for men and 278.6 for women, female-to-male ratio 2.36). The overall MS prevalence in the Swedish resident population born abroad was significantly lower than that in the native born population of Sweden (128.36/100,000 versus 198.6/100,000, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001).</p>

<p>The native-born Swedish population had a significantly higher MS prevalence than the general population of Sweden. The observed versus expected numbers of MS patients born in Sweden were 4720 versus 4422.5 (PR = 1.067, 95% CI 1.04–1.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) for men and 11,120 versus 10,241.5 (PR = 1.086, 95% CI 1.07–1.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) for women. No immigrant population had significantly higher MS prevalence than the general population of Sweden. In general, the MS prevalence in immigrant populations from countries with high MS risk was insignificantly higher or similar to that in the general population of Sweden, whereas immigrant populations from low or medium risk areas for MS had significantly lower prevalence than that of the general population. The population from the high-risk area of Finland had, however, significantly lower MS prevalence than that for Sweden as a whole. Distinct from other Middle East immigrant populations, the Iranian population in Sweden had higher MS prevalence than that of Sweden as a whole (PR = 1.16, <italic>p =</italic> 0.0835). The immigrant population born in India had a relatively high prevalence in Sweden (PR = 0.63, <italic>p =</italic> 0.082), whereas other populations from Asian countries and from Africa had low MS prevalence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511433062">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511433062">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Because no nationwide age- and gender-specific prevalence figures were reported from any of the countries of birth under study, regional age- and gender-specific MS prevalence figures were retrieved from published reports from one or more regions of Norway, the UK, the US, Iran and China. Additional age- and gender-specific MS prevalence figures were estimated from graphs of published reports from regions of Norway, Finland, Iran and China. Age- but not gender-specific figures were retrieved from Norway, Romania, the US and India (online supplementary Table S1). The PR estimates between each of the immigrant populations in Sweden and the regions of the countries of birth are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511433062">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458511433062">Figure 4</xref>. The numbers of observed immigrant MS patients versus the range of expected numbers of patients, if MS prevalence coincided with reported prevalence in the regional populations of the country of birth, were higher for all immigrant populations except for the populations born in Finland, the UK and the US. For these populations, the numbers of observed MS patients fell within the range of expected numbers. The MS prevalence in the Iranian immigrant population was more than twice as high as in Isfahan, Iran (PR = 2.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) and Tehran, Iran (PR = 3.40 <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511433062">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458511433062">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, this is the largest number of immigrant populations simultaneously investigated for MS prevalence at a national level. The study is unique because it is based on linked register data including country of birth, age (with one-year precision), gender and whether there was a diagnosis of MS for each of the 9,256,347 inhabitants of Sweden, including 940,357 immigrants, on the prevalence date. In addition, age- and gender-specific population figures for each immigrant population in Sweden were obtained. In total, 1645 patients, registered as having MS in Sweden, had migrated from 91 countries of birth. In the 19 largest immigrant populations, selected for analyses, 1327 MS patients were identified. Overall, the MS prevalence among immigrants was lower than in the general population of Sweden and higher than in the countries of birth. Only the population born in Sweden had significantly higher MS prevalence than that in the general population of Sweden.</p>
<p>The most intriguing finding was the high prevalence of MS among Iranian-born Swedish residents. This finding confirmed the result at a national level of our previous regional study in Gothenburg, Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433062">7</xref></sup> The nationwide prevalence of MS in the immigrant population born in Iran was at least as high as in the general population of Sweden, more than twice as high as the recently updated age- and gender-specific MS prevalence in Isfahan, Iran in 2003–2010 (73.4/100,000)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511433062">12</xref></sup> and three times higher than the latest MS prevalence estimate in Tehran, Iran in 2009 (50.6/100,000).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511433062">13</xref></sup> Lower MS prevalence estimates at 5–13/100,000 were reported from northeast Iran in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511433062">14</xref></sup> Previous studies of the MS prevalence in migrants from Iran showed a prevalence of 79/100,000 in 2006, based on 16 patients with MS onset in British Colombia, Canada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511433062">15</xref></sup> and 85/100,000, based on 14 MS patients in a population from the Middle East, mainly Iran, in Oslo, Norway in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511433062">16</xref></sup> These prevalence figures were, however, not adjusted for age, making comparisons difficult.</p>
<p>The MS prevalence in the immigrant population born in Iran was four or five times higher than that in the immigrant populations from Iraq and Syria. Comparisons of the MS prevalence in the immigrant populations of Sweden and the Middle East countries of birth, other than Iran, were, however, impossible, as no age-specific MS prevalence figures were reported from these countries. A random sample in Istanbul, Turkey showed a relatively high overall MS prevalence of 101.4/100,000 in 2002–2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511433062">17</xref></sup> For Lebanon, we estimated the MS prevalence at approximately 30–40/100,000, based on the reported estimation of the national number of MS patients a few years after the establishment of the Lebanese MS registry (2005).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511433062">18</xref></sup> The MS prevalence in Middle East countries, which were not included in the present survey, was 38/100,000 in Irbid and 39/100,000 in Amman, Jordan in 2004–2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511433062">19</xref></sup> and 14.8/100,000 in Kuwait in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511433062">20</xref></sup> The difference in prevalence between the Iranian and the great Iraqi immigrant populations in Sweden was not readily explained by differences in the population size and the proportion of individuals aged 20–40 years (the maximum risk ages for MS onset) since 1980 (data not shown).</p>
<p>One objection against any comparisons of the MS prevalence in immigrant populations in high-risk Sweden and populations of birth countries is the risk of underestimation of the prevalence in countries where MS is rare. However, the recently reported MS prevalence of 73.4/100,000 in Isfahan, Iran, was the third estimation, which should ensure high precision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511433062">12</xref></sup> Thus, it is unlikely that the great difference between the MS prevalence in the Iranian population in Sweden and the prevalence reported from Iran was due to differences in case ascertainment methods. We used slightly different criteria, allowing also Possible MS patients. However, this category comprised only a few per cent of the total number of MS/CIS patients.</p>
<p>The observed national variation in MS prevalence in Sweden between different immigrant populations was more narrow than the wide global variation, but reflected the distribution of high prevalence exceeding 200/100,000 in North America and the North of Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433062">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511433062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511433062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511433062">24</xref></sup> and low prevalence, below 10/100,000, in Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511433062">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511433062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511433062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511433062">28</xref></sup> and in non-white populations of Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511433062">29</xref></sup> In Sweden, the prevalence of MS in the immigrant populations from countries with high MS risk, except Finland, was roughly similar to that in the general population of Sweden. The MS prevalence in the population born in Finland was significantly lower than that in the general population of Sweden, although unchanged in comparison with the reported prevalence from Finland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511433062">30</xref></sup> With the exception of the immigrant population born in Iran, which had as high a MS prevalence as the immigrant populations from high-risk countries, immigrant populations born in countries with low or medium risk for MS had significantly lower MS prevalence than the general population of Sweden. The population born in India showed a high MS prevalence in relation to that of Sweden as a whole. In fact, it was three times higher than that reported from India among Parsis (Zoroastrian Iranians) of Bombay in 1988.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511433062">31</xref></sup> Lower MS prevalence in India as a whole, below 5/100,000, was indicated by the recently estimated number of 35,000 MS patients in the 1.2 billion population of India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511433062">32</xref></sup> In contrast to the population from India in Sweden, other Asian populations as well as the population from Africa had low MS prevalence. However, due to the small numbers of Asian and African migrants to Sweden, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning these populations.</p>
<p>The present results might indicate that the population born in Iran and perhaps the population born in India, in contrast to other Middle East and Asian populations, harbour genetic factors, that in combination with environmental and lifestyle risk factors in Sweden, contribute to a higher susceptibility to MS. Interestingly, the Iranian and Indian populations seem to be ethnically close to European populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511433062">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511433062">33</xref></sup> In the white populations of Europe, and North America, 15–20% of those affected by MS reported a family history of MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511433062">34</xref></sup> as did 12–15% in Iran,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511433062">35</xref></sup> whereas in several Asian populations a family history was absent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511433062">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511433062">36</xref></sup> As in Western populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511433062">34</xref></sup> the HLA DRB1*1501 allele was associated with significantly higher MS risk in an Iranian population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511433062">37</xref></sup> and also in an Indian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511433062">38</xref></sup> In contrast, this disease susceptibility allele was less frequent in other Middle East and Asian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511433062">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Obviously, migration may increase the risk of MS by changing environmental–lifestyle factors. Low levels of vitamin D, low sunlight exposure and high latitude have been associated with the increased risk of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511433062">39</xref></sup> This was recently supported by an increase in MS prevalence of more than one per cent for each degree of north latitude in Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433062">1</xref></sup> A significant association between higher MS risk and lower sunlight exposure was observed in Iran.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511433062">40</xref></sup> Thus, migration to Nordic countries may increase the risk of MS further.</p>
<p>We used a prevalence study design. One great advantage was that we were able to include all cases, even those with no information on the date of MS onset. These results are based on the information about all Swedish residents, alive on the prevalence date, as to their country of birth, the age on the prevalence date and a diagnosis of MS. We considered data concerning the presence of an MS diagnosis reliable and more readily obtainable than the date when the diagnosis was registered for the first time, which would be the basis for an analysis of the incidence of MS and the estimation of the risk of developing MS. We had no information about the parents’ origin or ethnicity. Hence, a Swedish resident was counted as an immigrant if born in a foreign country, regardless of the parents’ origin. The reasons for moving to Sweden were mainly unknown and thus, a selection bias cannot be excluded. However, there were no indications that can explain the difference in MS prevalence between Iranian immigrants and other populations from the Middle East.</p>
<p>This is the largest nationwide immigrant study to date. In general, the prevalence of MS in Swedish immigrants was higher than in the country of birth and similar to or lower than that in Sweden as a whole. Notably, using two independently retrieved patient datasets from different sources, the present study and the previous regional study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433062">7</xref></sup> we now strengthen the evidence for an increased MS risk in migrants to Sweden from Iran. We confirm that the prevalence of MS in Iranian migrants to Sweden is at least as high as in Sweden and more than twice as high as in Iran. The population born in Iran may carry genetic factors that increase the MS risk when environmental–lifestyle risk factors are changed. This warrants further investigation.</p>
