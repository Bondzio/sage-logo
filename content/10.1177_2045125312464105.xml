<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic illness characterized by recurrent mood episodes resulting in profound negative effects on the interpersonal, social, family and vocational outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2045125312464105">Maj <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>].</p>
<p>The economic burden of bipolar disorder is substantial. On average the annual National Health Service (NHS) cost of managing BD has been estimated to be approximately £200 million, of which hospital admissions accounted for 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2045125312464105">Das Gupta and Guest, 2002</xref>]. The direct nonhealthcare cost was estimated to be approximately £90 million annually and the indirect societal cost was estimated to be in the region of £1800 million annually.</p>
<p>Medication is the cornerstone of the treatment for BD but is partially effective for most patients hence the need to evaluate new treatments. One potential treatment option is ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA). Frangou and colleagues conducted a 12-week double-blind trial to study the efficacy of ethyl-EPA as an adjunct treatment for bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2045125312464105">Frangou <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. The Markov model developed in this paper used the data from that study.</p>

<title>The clinical trial</title>
<p>In this double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial outpatients with bipolar depression were randomly assigned to adjunctive treatment to mood stabilizers with placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 26) or with 1 g/day (<italic>n</italic> = 24) or 2 g/day (<italic>n</italic> = 25) of ethyl-EPA. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2045125312464105">Table 1</xref>. The concomitant medication taken by the participants in each of the arms is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2045125312464105">Table 2</xref>. These characteristics did not differ significantly between groups, other than for the use of antipsychotic medication (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). The duration of the trial was 12 weeks and the primary outcome measure was changes in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312464105">Hamilton, 1960</xref>]. The key finding was the depressive psychopathology as measured by the HDRS was lower by 3.3 (standard error [SE] = 1.40) points for the ethyl-EPA groups as compared with the placebo group. This difference was statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.1 to -0.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). In addition, patients in the placebo arm experienced a mean of 3 days in hospital (due to two patients being admitted) compared with a mean of zero for the ethyl-EPA arm, and this was not statistically significant. The blinding of participants in the study was achieved: there were no group differences regarding participants’ ability to guess their group allocation and only 23% of the placebo group, and 21–24% of the ethyl-EPA groups guessed their allocation correctly. The aim of this study was to specify the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive ethyl-EPA compared with placebo based on the clinical trial data using a Markov model. The parameter values of relative risk (RR) and resource use were taken from the clinical trial. However, the model parameters regarding health state utilities, unit costs and baseline transition probabilities were not available in the clinical trial and were obtained from the published literature.</p>

<title>Model structure</title>
<p>The dynamic nature of the Markov model captures the long-term clinical aspect of BD. The model assumes a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients entering the model in a stable (euthymic) health state with fixed transition probabilities of moving to manic and depressive states. The length of the cycle is assumed to be 3 months, which is compatible with the NICE Bipolar Guideline CG38 which suggests average length for a manic episode of 9 weeks and 13 weeks for a depressive episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2045125312464105">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2006</xref>]. At the end of the cycle all of the patients experiencing acute episodes are assumed to transition back to the stable state before developing a subsequent acute episode. A gap of one cycle is assumed between the episodes; this conforms to the clinical aspects of BD. However, this assumption might appear as an oversimplification of reality particularly in the case of rapid cycling patients. The assumption implies that the time period between initiating two episodes is 6 months. The decision tree showing two cycles is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2045125312464105">Figure 1</xref> and the Markov schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2045125312464105">Figure 2</xref> shows the transition of patients between different states.</p>

<p>Transitional probability estimates are obtained from the published literature and supplemented with the data from the clinical trial. The estimates of transitional probabilities of three states used in the model for the control arm are taken from the work of Fajutrao and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2045125312464105">Fajutrao <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] after adjustment are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2045125312464105">Table 3</xref>.

<p>Calvert and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2045125312464105">Calvert <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>] estimated health-state utility values using a standard algorithm and the 36-item form supplemented with published literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2045125312464105">Tengs and Wallace, 2000</xref>]. Their analysis assumed 0.8, 0.7 and 0.4 utility values for (euthymic) stable, manic and depressive health states. Fajutrao and colleagues also used same health-state utility values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2045125312464105">Fajutrao <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on these studies we used 0.8 and 0.4 utility values for the stable and depressive state, respectively. The depressive episodes are frequent and longer in duration and hence have a greater impact on the quality of life. The estimate of manic state utility was adjusted to 0.65 in the model using data from Revicki and colleagues and Soares-Weiser and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2045125312464105">Revicki <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312464105">Soares-Weiser <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>].

<p>The clinical resources consumed were estimated using data from the Frangou and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2045125312464105">Frangou <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>] trial. The per unit costs are taken from the work of Netten and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2045125312464105">Netten <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>] and are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2045125312464105">Table 4</xref>. The costs are adjusted to 2008/09 prices using the Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) index. Patients participating in the Frangou and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2045125312464105">Frangou <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>] trial were only categorized into three health state groups (stable, manic and depressive) irrespective of treatment arm allocation. The average cost of patients in each health state during the 12-week trial gave the estimate of direct cost of one cycle for the patients receiving placebo: £847 for stable, £1439 for manic and £1220 for depressive cycle.

<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>A deterministic sensitivity analysis (one-way and two-way) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to take into account uncertainty associated with the parameter values used in the model. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis input parameters were varied by 25% in either direction and the results are presented as a tornado diagram. The two-way sensitivity analysis was conducted on the two main input drivers of the ICER estimate, i.e. the utility in the stable health state and the costs of three health states. The PSA attributed appropriate probability distributions to the input parameters.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The ICER estimated from the model was –£2782 at the end of 1 year, which means the use of ethyl-EPA as an adjunct therapy for BD is more effective than placebo and it reduces cost. The main factor contributing toward reduction in cost is the lower transitional probability to manic and depressive episodes for the patients taking ethyl-EPA. This means that fewer ethyl-EPA-treated patients experienced acute episodes as compared with the placebo group. Hence, service use (such as hospitalization) was lower in the ethyl-EPA group and consequently their treatment costs were lower. The additional drug cost of ethyl-EPA was small (£24) per cycle as compared with the reduction of service use elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the Frangou and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2045125312464105">Frangou <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>] trial no inpatient episode was recorded among the patients allocated to ethyl-EPA adjunct treatment as compared with, on average, 3 days of inpatient treatment (daily cost of an inpatient episode of £210) in the placebo arm. The number of inpatient episodes in the case of the placebo group is in line with the RR (0.6) of acute episodes estimated. Two patients in the placebo arm totalled 216 hours of day centre contacts (hourly cost of day centre of £9), while no patients in the ethyl-EPA arm had day centre contacts.</p>
<p>Lower scores of HRSD and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in the ethyl-EPA compared with placebo group at the week 12 assessment support better quality of life among patients receiving ethyl-EPA, which is estimated in the model as higher number of QALYs.</p>
<p>Greater effectiveness and reduced cost contributed toward negative estimate of the ICER, which implies use of ethyl-EPA as an adjunct treatment for BD is a dominant treatment, falling in the dominant quadrant (II) of the cost-effectiveness plane. Although, the data used from the clinical trial covered a very short time period, the model was extended to 5-year time period, using a discount rate of 3.5% for costs and outcomes, the estimate of 5-year ICER was very close to the 1-year ICER estimate.</p>

<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>The tornado diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2045125312464105">Figure 3</xref> shows how the change (25% increase and 25% decrease) in the value of inputs affect the estimate of ICER. The diagram shows that the main input drivers of the ICER estimate are the utility in the stable health state and the costs of three health states. The tornado diagram also shows that the ICER estimate is negative despite a 25% increase or decrease in the values of most of the inputs. The one-way sensitivity analysis shows that the estimate of ICER was robust. A 10% decrease in the stable health-state utility value improved the ICER estimate by 45% and a 10% change in the value of stable health-state cost, in either direction, changed the ICER estimate by 47%. The model used the estimate of RR (0.6), a 10% variation in RR (0.54–0.66) estimated the ICER in the range –£3431 to –£1923 which gives the robust result for the dominant strategy.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty associated with the estimates of inputs and the health related data. PSA takes into account uncertainty by assigning distributions to the input variables. The characteristics of cost data are represented by gamma distribution, transition probabilities and health-state utilities are represented by beta distributions. A total of 10,000 simulations of the model are run on MS Excel, the PSA findings are presented in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2045125312464105">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<p>The CEAC shows the percentage of simulations which are cost-effective at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) levels. As we are assuming NHS perspective which is the direct payer (although some of the informal care costs are also added), the lower NHS threshold of £20,000 has 94.67% probability for the ethyl-EPA as an adjunct treatment to be cost-effective. The high probability of cost-effectiveness was expected as the estimated ICER is also negative suggesting a dominant strategy. The mean ICER of 10,000 simulations is –£2421.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the model and sensitivity analysis present a strong case for the cost-effectiveness of ethyl-EPA as an adjunct treatment for BD. Ethyl-EPA was dominant in that it resulted in lower costs and better outcomes than the placebo. Other modelling studies have produced evidence of cost-effectiveness for haloperidol in the treatment of mania and to some extent olanzapine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2045125312464105">Bridle <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>], olanzapine maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2045125312464105">McKendrick <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>], and lamotrigine compared with olanzapine, lithium, and no treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2045125312464105">Calvert <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. To aid the development of clinical guidelines for bipolar disorder in the UK a Markov model was constructed to compare drug treatments and this found that valproate dominated olanzapine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2045125312464105">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2006</xref>]. A similar model was developed by Soares-Weiser and colleagues and this found valproate to be the least expensive nondominated treatment for patients who had recently experienced a depressive episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312464105">Soares-Weiser <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. For those who had had a manic episode, olanzapine dominated all other treatments except for lithium. None of these studies report on the cost-effectiveness of ethyl-EPA.</p>
<p>The results need to be interpreted in light of the limitations of the model. The small sample size and the missing values of resource use did not allow estimation of costs of the six health states individually. Instead the three health-states costs were estimated and the ethyl-EPA drug cost (£24) was added for the three health states of the treatment group. The health-state costs for the placebo and the treatment group may differ due to different resource use and adverse effects of the treatment. Different transitional probabilities for the patients receiving placebo and the patients receiving ethyl-EPA can capture this effect to a certain degree as different numbers of patients have manic and depressive episodes and consequently different level of resource use.</p>
<p>Assigning different utility values for inpatient and outpatient acute episodes and additional health states to reflect the severity of episodes can complicate the model but it can capture the complex nature of the disease. However, it is not possible with the limited data available. The model also assumes that the probability of an event is independent of the previous episode and constant over time. However, in reality a mood episode might be influenced by the previous episode or hospital admission. Soares-Weiser and colleagues showed that patients’ most recent episode is related to the type of their next episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312464105">Soares-Weiser <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]; the treatments aimed at preventing depression may be more cost-effective in patients with a recent history of depression compared with patients with a recent history of mania and vice versa for treatments aimed at preventing manic episode. In the 1-year model developed in this paper the average number of acute episodes per patient is less than one per patient therefore it is unlikely to have a substantial effect on the results.</p>
<p>Given the chronic nature of BD and the relatively early age of onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312464105">Soares-Weiser <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>], a 1-year time horizon could be considered too short to capture the lifetime costs and benefits of the treatment. A longer time period model is needed to reflect the actual course of BD and lifetime costs and benefits. Economic models frequently make extrapolations from short trials to longer time periods. Here we have made extrapolations to 1-year on the basis of data collected from a 12-week trial. In subsequent analyses we also extended the model to five years and clearly this is a limitation implying that we need to be cautious about the results from the extended model. In addition, adherence to the same treatment is expected to be low after an acute episode therefore the assumption of the same treatment has its own limitations. The cost perspective also needs to be broadened to include wider societal costs of BD.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The economic model estimated cost-effectiveness of ethyl-EPA as an adjunct treatment for BD patients over the time period of 1 year. The model found evidence of high likelihood for adjunct ethyl-EPA treatment to be cost-effective at a very low WTP threshold. The results of the present study are encouraging with regards to the cost-effectiveness of ethyl-EPA in the treatment of BD. However, the ultimate test of the cost-effectiveness of any intervention is how it performs in ordinary care. We could not test this directly as we do not have any observational datasets on the use of ethyl-EPA from routine clinical practice but this should be the next step in future studies.</p>
