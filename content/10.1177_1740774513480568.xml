<title>Background</title>
<p>We examined parents’ consent preferences and understanding of an opt-in or opt-out invitation to participate in data linkage for post-marketing safety surveillance of childhood vaccines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774513480568">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial: 1129 families of babies born at a South Australian hospital in 2009 were sent information at 6 weeks post-partum, explaining data linkage of childhood immunisation and hospital records for vaccine safety surveillance, with 4 weeks to opt in or opt out by reply form, telephone, or email. At 10 weeks post-partum, 1026 (91%) parents were followed up by telephone interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774513480568">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In both the opt-in (n = 564) and opt-out arms (n = 565), four-fifths of the parents recalled receiving the information (81% vs. 83%, P = 0.35), three-fifths reported reading it (63% vs. 67%, P = 0.11), but only two-fifths correctly identified the health records to be linked (43% vs. 39%, P = 0.21). Parents who actively consented (opted in) were more likely than those who passively consented (did not opt out) to recall the information (100% vs. 83%, P &lt; 0.001), report reading it (94% vs. 67%, P &lt; 0.001), and correctly identify the data sources (60% vs. 39%, P &lt; 0.001). Most parents supported data linkage for vaccine safety surveillance (94%) and trusted its privacy protections (84%). Most parents wished to have minimal or no direct involvement, preferring either opt-out consent (40%) or no consent (30%). A quarter (24%) of parents indicated opt-in consent should be sought; of these, 8% requested consent prior to every use, 5% preferred to give broad consent just once and 11% preferred periodic renewal. Three-fifths of the parents gave higher priority to rapid vaccine safety surveillance (61%) rather than first seeking parental consent (21%), and one in seven was undecided (15%). Although 91% of parents reported that their babies were fully immunised (76%) or under-immunised (15%), and trusted vaccines as safe (90%), three-fifths (62%) were very or somewhat concerned about serious reactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774513480568">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The context of data linkage is limited to vaccine safety surveillance. Only recall and understanding retained at 1 month post enrolment were measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774513480568">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This trial demonstrates that informed consent for a population-based surveillance programme cannot realistically be achieved using mail-based opt-in and opt-out approaches. While recall and understanding of the study’s purpose were better among parents who actively consented (opted in) compared with parents who passively consented (did not opt out), participation was substantially lower (21% vs. 96% respectively). Most parents appeared to have a poor understanding of data linkage for vaccine safety surveillance; nonetheless, they supported data linkage. They preferred a system utilising opt-out consent or no consent to one using opt-in consent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Linked electronic administrative healthcare databases are a valuable resource that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medicines and vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513480568">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774513480568">4</xref>]. In the last two decades, many countries have amended or passed laws to tighten the protection of individual privacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774513480568">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513480568">7</xref>], so that, generally, data can be accessed for research uses only when prior informed consent has been obtained, or when data are anonymised, so that there is no reasonable way of identifying the individuals involved, or when certain provisions for consent waivers are met and approved by a human research ethics committee (HREC) or institutional review board [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513480568">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774513480568">8</xref>]. For example, if an HREC assesses that a proposed data linkage project is ‘substantially in the public interest’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513480568">6</xref>], it can allow the disclosure of identifiable demographic information to an authorised data linkage unit, without individual consent, for the purpose of creating a master linkage key in accordance with the best practice protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774513480568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774513480568">9</xref>]. Individual privacy is preserved as researchers receive only files of pre-linked data with no personal identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513480568">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774513480568">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Some argue that legislative complexity and the vagaries of defining the sufficiency of the public interest needed to counter a requirement for informed consent have had a negative effect on public health research because HRECs and data custodians lack sufficient guidance as to when a consent waiver is appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774513480568">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513480568">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774513480568">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774513480568">15</xref>]. Lack of guidance can create an over-reliance on a requirement for opt-in consent for reassurance of the voluntariness of participation and to protect against litigation.</p>
<p>Surveys and focus groups conducted internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774513480568">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774513480568">20</xref>] and in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513480568">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774513480568">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774513480568">15</xref>] have shown the public to be supportive of research that improves quality of care and public health; however, most believe that some form of consent should be sought prior to use of their data for research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513480568">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774513480568">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513480568">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774513480568">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774513480568">27</xref>]. Opt-in consent, either verbally or in writing, is generally preferred over opt-out consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513480568">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774513480568">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774513480568">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774513480568">27</xref>].

Often missing from the investigations has been the provision of a contextual framework regarding the intended societal benefits and privacy safeguards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774513480568">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774513480568">30</xref>], and the costs of obtaining consent in relation to the finite budget for public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513480568">10</xref>], which enables people to weigh the societal benefits and potential harms in their decision-making. When this context is provided, the public has been more receptive to research without patient consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774513480568">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774513480568">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that informed consent is an ideal that is often difficult to attain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774513480568">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774513480568">37</xref>]. For example, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted with parents of 101 children undergoing an upper endoscopy procedure showed that informed consent assessed using a tailored survey instrument was achieved in only 10% of parents when form-based consent was administered along with physician discussion, and in 33% of parents, when the information was repeated in a 6th-grade level video module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774513480568">33</xref>].</p>
<p>In 2009, we conducted an RCT to examine the feasibility of obtaining parental consent from families of newborns for the linkage of data to evaluate childhood vaccine safety by comparing two approaches – opt in and opt out. Eligible families were sent information by mail 6 weeks after birth, with 4 weeks to opt in or opt out by reply form, telephone, or email. The participation rates at 10 weeks post-partum were compared in the primary analysis. Participation was significantly lower in the opt-in arm (21%, n = 120/564) compared with the opt-out arm (96%, n = 540/565), and selection bias was evident in the opt-in arm, as participants were more likely to be older, married or living with a partner, university educated, and of higher socio-economic status than non-participants, whereas participants in the opt-out arm were representative of the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774513480568">38</xref>]. In a subsequent follow-up interview, it was apparent from the reasons given by parents for participation and non-participation that opting in or opting out behaviour often did not match a parent’s stated underlying intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774513480568">38</xref>]. In this article, we report parental recall and understanding of the study invitation, consent preferences, trust in the protections of privacy in data linkage, opinions on vaccine safety and effectiveness, and the level of vaccination uptake for the newborn.</p>

<title>Setting and participants</title>
<p>The Vaccine Assessment using Linked Data (VALiD) trial was conducted at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia (SA), where approximately 25% of the state’s babies are delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774513480568">39</xref>]. We provide a brief description of the study protocol here; full details are provided elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774513480568">40</xref>]. The study was disclosed on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/">http://www.anzctr.org.au/</ext-link> and assigned the identifier ACTRN12610000332022. All eligible mothers aged 18 years and older who resided in SA when they gave birth at the hospital were included without their consent to avoid introducing selection bias in the study sample. The hospital HREC granted a waiver of the usual requirement for consent and allowed the limited disclosure to mothers of the true purpose of the trial (Children, Youth and Women’s Health Service (CYWHS) reference number: REC2087/7/11). Exclusion criteria were stillbirth, neonatal or maternal death, two weeks or longer spent in neonatal intensive care, home birth, inward transfer of a newborn from another hospital, and any identified maternal hardship, for example, incarceration, mental illness, or adoption of the baby or placement into foster care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1740774513480568">
<title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
<p>Mothers were allocated randomly at 6 weeks post-partum to the opt-in and opt-out arms in the ratio 1:1, using randomly permuted blocks of sizes 2, 4, 6, and 8, stratified by firstborn status (first live and surviving birth vs. subsequent births). Allocation was concealed by computer-automated merging of electronic data listings of eligible mothers with the randomisation schedule (created using the Stata program RALLOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774513480568">41</xref>]). The trial was single-blinded: parents were informed about the data linkage, but unaware that two consent approaches were being compared. The interviewers (J.B., J.C.) were aware of the randomised allocation and participation status of the parents at the follow-up interview at 10 weeks post-partum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1740774513480568">
<title>Interventions and follow-up</title>
<p>One to two weeks prior to the infant’s scheduled vaccinations at 2 months of age, the household received a cover letter (addressed to the mother), a 2-page information leaflet and a reply-paid form, with different formats according to randomised allocation to the opt-in or the opt-out arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774513480568">Figure 1</xref>). Parents were invited to be part of a ‘Vaccine Data Linkage Study’ and permission was sought to link infants’ 2-month vaccinations with any hospital visits occurring in the month afterwards to check for adverse events following immunisation. Parents were directed to a dedicated website for detailed information on the process of data linkage and how personal information is kept private (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://health.adelaide.edu.au/paediatrics/research/valid/">http://health.adelaide.edu.au/paediatrics/research/valid/</ext-link>). Parents in the opt-in arm were instructed to return a reply form, telephone, or email to signal willingness to participate in data linkage. Parents in the opt-out arm were informed they would be included unless they refused consent by the same means. All parents were given 4 weeks to respond. No follow-up reminder letters were sent. At 10 weeks post-partum, attempts were made to interview, by telephone, the parent (either mother or father) who had opted in or opted out. When this was not possible, the other parent, if available, was interviewed as a proxy. For households that did not opt in or opt out, the first parent to answer the telephone was invited to be interviewed.</p>

<title>Pilot study</title>
<p>Prior to commencement, the study invitation material and telephone survey were piloted on five academic staff and a convenience sample of 20 parents of young children in order to test the clarity, format, and sequence of questions, which were designed and administered according to recommended principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774513480568">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774513480568">43</xref>]. According to the Flesch readability ease score, a standard and validated readability measure on a scale of 0 to 100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774513480568">44</xref>], most adults are able to read a document scoring 65 or above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774513480568">45</xref>]. The letter scored 60 (standard/average) and the opt-in/opt-out forms scored 70 (fairly easy to read). The letter briefly explained the concept of data linkage for childhood vaccine safety surveillance and described the health records to be linked; these key points were repeated in the opt-in/opt-out forms. The 2-page leaflet scored 49 (difficult to read); it comprised lengthier explanations on the process and security measures used in data linkage, potential benefits and privacy risks, as well as HREC-prescribed legalese about patient confidentiality. According to the Flesch–Kincaid grade level (range: 0–12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774513480568">46</xref>], the academic grade a person would need to complete in order to read and comprehend these materials was 10 for the letter, 6 for the opt-in/opt-out form, and 12 for the leaflet.</p>

Parents were asked whether they had received and read the study invitation material and/or been exposed to other sources of information about data linkage, such as the VALiD study-specific website, other websites, newspapers, books, television, and radio. Parents were tested on their understanding of the study’s purpose by asking them to select the two sources of information about their baby’s health that were to be linked from six possibilities that were read out to them: vaccination records, medication records, birth records, visits of the baby to hospital, visits of the baby to a general practitioner, and visits of the baby to a Child and Youth Health clinic.</p>
<p>The interviewer asked each parent why they did or did not participate in the VALiD study, as indicated by their opting-in or opting-out behaviour (these results are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774513480568">38</xref>]). Subsequently, a programme of data linkage for childhood vaccine safety surveillance was described, and each parent’s consent preference was elicited using a 6-point scale adapted from Willison <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513480568">18</xref>]. Parents were then asked to choose between two priorities for Australian Government funding: performing rapid vaccine safety surveillance using data linkage without seeking consent or using some of this funding to seek parental consent first. The consent preference question was then re-asked, to see whether opinions had changed after the funding priorities scenario was presented. Subsequently, parents were asked to indicate their level of trust in the privacy protections used in data linkage. Further questions were asked about the vaccination status of each newborn in their care, enabling classification of the parent as having a baby or babies who were fully immunised, under-immunised, or unimmunised at 2 months of age according to the National Immunisation Program schedule. (For the exact wording of the telephone interview see online Appendix A.)</p>

<title>Sample size</title>
<p>A sample size of 544 in each randomised group was calculated to afford power of 90% to detect a difference of 0.1 in the proportions of binary responses to questions at interview using two-tailed tests at the 5% level of significance. In the absence of prior knowledge of response proportions, π = 0.5 was used for sample size estimation, as this yields the most conservative (largest) sample size. The reported P-values have not been adjusted for multiple testing.</p>

<sec id="section14-1740774513480568">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We used multiple imputation to create 50 datasets in which the missing values in the survey responses were replaced by imputed values by applying the fully conditional specification (FCS) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774513480568">48</xref>], as implemented using the mi ice add-on in Stata 11.2 software. Variables used in the imputation were the primary outcome (participation status) and mothers’ baseline characteristics, for which there were no missing data, and the secondary outcomes (interview responses), which were affected by missing data. Full details of the imputation procedure are supplied in online Appendix B. Statistical analyses consisted of tabulations of frequencies of responses to survey questions, with routines specifically designed to combine estimates from the imputed datasets to generate a single set of estimates with valid standard errors that incorporate uncertainty about the imputed values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1740774513480568">49</xref>]. Small discrepancies in some table frequencies and percentage totals occur due to the effect of averaging across imputed datasets.</p>
<p>We used Wald tests to identify significant associations by randomised allocation in the response to questions. Consent preferences before and after presentation of the funding priorities scenario were compared using a Stuart–Maxwell test for association between matched pairs. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between responses to questions regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in relation to (1) randomised allocation and (2) parents’ vaccination practices. Preliminary checks confirmed the proportional odds assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774513480568">50</xref>]. Statistical tests were two-tailed, with a significance level of 5%.</p>

<p>In the opt-in arm, parents who opted into data linkage (i.e. participants) were more likely than non-participants to recall and report that they had read the study invitation material, as well as correctly identify the health records to be linked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513480568">Table 2</xref>). In the opt-out arm, parents who opted out of the study (i.e., non-participants) were more likely to recall the material than participants, but they were no more likely to say they had read the information or to correctly identify the health records to be linked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513480568">Table 2</xref>). Parents who actively consented (opted in) were more likely than parents who passively consented (did not elect to opt out) to recall the material (100% vs. 83%, P &lt; 0.001), to say they had read it (94% vs. 67%, P &lt; 0.001), and to correctly identify the health records to be linked (60% vs. 39%, P &lt; 0.001).</p>

The majority (70%) preferred minimal or no direct involvement: 40% would be satisfied with notification with the option to opt out and 30% preferred that their child’s health information be linked without consent or notification. Among parents who favoured opt-out consent, 92% stated that the opportunity to opt out was either very or somewhat important. One-fourth (24%) of the parents indicated opt-in consent should be sought; of these, 8% requested consent prior to every use and the remainder preferred to give broad consent, that is, to consent just once (5%) or at periodic intervals of their choosing (11%), with yearly intervals most preferred. Consent preferences were similar in the opt-in and opt-out arms, except for more undecided parents in the latter group (1% vs. 4%).</p>

<title>Views on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines</title>
<p>Most parents (97%) supported childhood vaccination and agreed (90%) that the vaccines given to children in Australia are safe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1740774513480568">Table 5</xref>). However, almost every parent (99%) agreed that it is important to check the safety of childhood vaccines, and many were very or somewhat concerned that a vaccine might cause a serious reaction (62%) or might be ineffective in preventing the targeted disease (42%). Vaccine safety concerns were cited as more pressing for parents who had reservations about both vaccine safety and the privacy protections in data linkage. Opinions were similar in the opt-in and opt-out arms.</p>
<p>The majority of parents (91%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 89%–93%) reported that their babies had been vaccinated by 10 weeks of age, 6% (95% CI: 5%–8%) still intended to vaccinate, and 3% (95% CI: 2%–4%) intended not to. Three-quarters (76%, 95% CI: 73%–78%) of parents reported that their babies were fully immunised, 15% (95% CI: 13%–17%) were under-immunised, and 9% (95% CI: 7%–11%) were unimmunised. Compared with parents of fully immunised babies, parents of unimmunised babies were more likely to view vaccines as unsafe (odds ratio (OR) 4.6, 95% CI: 2.6–8.3) and have concerns about serious reactions (OR 2.9, 95% CI: 1.8–4.8) and vaccine effectiveness (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.04–2.5). For parents of under-immunised babies, the corresponding cumulative odds ratio was significant for concerns that vaccines were unsafe (OR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.04–2.2) but not for concerns regarding serious reactions (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.7–1.6) or vaccine effectiveness (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6–1.2).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Parental recall and understanding of the study’s purpose showed incremental improvement with progressively higher levels of educational attainment. Parents who actively consented (opted in) were more likely than those who passively consented (did not elect to opt out) to recall (100% vs. 83%) and have read the information (94% vs. 67%) and correctly identify which health records were to be linked (60% vs. 39%). Thus, parents who made an active decision to opt in were best placed to give truly informed consent. However, the drawback of using an opt-in consent system was a much lower participation rate than the opt-out approach (21% vs. 96%) and selection bias toward participants of higher education and socio-economic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774513480568">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Five previous RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1740774513480568">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774513480568"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1740774513480568"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774513480568">55</xref>] (reviewed in Berry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774513480568">40</xref>]) have also found that the opt-out approach yielded higher participation rates than the opt-in approach, but the extent of participation in these trials varied widely from 48% to 85% in the opt-in arm and from 59% to 100% in the opt-out arm. None of these trials were relevant to the context of data linkage; only two evaluated subject recall, understanding, and reasons for (not) consenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1740774513480568">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774513480568">55</xref>], and all but one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774513480568">53</xref>] had a small sample size and flawed methodology.</p>
<p>Data linkage for post-marketing surveillance of vaccines was widely supported by parents (94%). Most trusted (84%) that their privacy would be protected through the use of pre-linked anonymised data by researchers and informational security safeguards. The majority also preferred minimal or no direct involvement in controlling the use of their baby’s health information; opt-out consent (40%) and no consent (30%) were more popular than opt-in consent (24%). The proportion wanting some form of consent (either opt in or opt out) reduced to 21% when informed it would be at the expense of rapid and comprehensive vaccine safety surveillance, and twice as many (61%) gave precedence to the latter. However, most parents reverted back to their original preference when re-asked which consent option they preferred.</p>
<p>Immunisation compliance at 2 months of age (76%) appears on course to reach the national target of 90% fully immunised at 12 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1740774513480568">56</xref>]. Nevertheless, similar to survey findings in the United States (US) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774513480568">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1740774513480568">57</xref>], many parents expressed concerns about the likelihood of serious reactions and the effectiveness of vaccines. Such concerns were associated with suboptimal childhood vaccine uptake. These findings highlight the importance of improving vaccine safety surveillance for public reassurance, and data linkage is a recommended strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774513480568">4</xref>].</p>
<sec id="section21-1740774513480568">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This trial was limited to one context: parental consent to using data linkage for childhood vaccine safety surveillance. Parental understanding of the study purpose, consent preferences, and opt-in and opt-out participation rates may differ by subject area and also by population/patient group. The eligible population was selected from hospital listings of births, sent an invitation by mail, and instructed to respond by email, telephone, or post. We did not use reminders (e.g. repeat mailings or telephone calls) as they are impracticable for large population-level studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513480568">10</xref>], and the likely gain in the opt-in arm to about 30% participation is modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1740774513480568">58</xref>].</p>
<p>Some of the material required advanced reading skills. The level of informed consent may have been improved using strategies such as consumer consultation in document synthesis, incorporating discussion with immunisation providers, government media advertisements, and video presentations, but the gains do not appear to be substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774513480568">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774513480568">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774513480568">36</xref>]. We measured recall and understanding of the consent forms retained at 1 month post-trial enrolment and not at the time they were first received by parents. We did not evaluate the adequacy of informed consent using a standardised instrument, since those available are directed at the gaining of consent for therapeutic procedures such as surgical or pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774513480568">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774513480568">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774513480568">36</xref>], and are not relevant to low-risk data-linkage studies.</p>
<p>The participation rate may have been higher, mainly in the opt-in arm, if parents had been personally recruited by immunisation providers – for example, by integrating an opt-in or opt-out tick box for vaccine safety surveillance on Australia’s national publicly funded healthcare (Medicare) web-based immunisation records system. The feasibility of doing so should be examined, since clinicians may be reluctant to take on the additional task of obtaining consent for surveillance activities in addition to their primary care responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1740774513480568">59</xref>].</p>
<p>The cross-sectional and fixed response nature of the survey did not permit exploration of whether parental opinions would change if parents had been presented with more information and had the opportunity to ask questions. Furthermore, the interviews may have been subject to respondent bias, as parents may not have revealed true opinions in a telephone conversation with a stranger affiliated with the trial. Since the interviewers were not blinded, biases in outcome assessment may have ensued from differential probing or obtaining answers to support preconceived notions. We did not engage interpreter services due to resource constraints.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This trial found that neither the opt-in nor opt-out approach was effective in achieving informed consent when parents were invited by mail to participate in a proposed data linkage programme of childhood vaccine safety surveillance. Parents often did not receive, properly consider, or understand the information, as evidenced by fewer than half being able to identify correctly the health records to be linked. Moderate gains in participant understanding were achieved by using the opt-in rather than the opt-out approach. However, the gains were at the expense of the integrity of research, as parents who opted in comprised a much smaller group of individuals of higher education and socio-economic status. Even though many parents lacked a basic understanding of what data linkage for vaccine safety surveillance involved, the majority were supportive of the concept and trusted that their privacy would be protected. Parents were amenable to data linkage without informed consent when informed about the study’s societal benefits and the monetary and time costs of obtaining consent.</p>
