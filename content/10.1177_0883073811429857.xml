<abstract>
<p>This study evaluates the outcome of urgent neurologic referrals. This was a retrospective review of all referrals to the Floating Hospital for Children in 1 month. The total number of patients referred to our center was 223. Amongst those, 108 were new patients and 195 were follow-up visits; 30 patients were deemed urgent, yet 6 of them did not present to their visit. Urgent and routinely scheduled patients were compared based on the need for further evaluation or medication initiation following their visit. The frequency of visit outcomes was statistically similar between urgently and nonurgently referred patients. We did observe though, that diagnostic testing and medication were initiated more frequently for the patients urgently referred for seizure compared with those routinely scheduled patients for seizure evaluation. For this reason, we suggest that pediatric neurologists preferentially should hold clinic space open for urgent referrals for patients with new-onset seizure.</p>

<body>
<p>In recent years, referrals of children with neurologic disorders have increased. Disorders previously managed by pediatricians are now often seen by specialists in pediatric neurology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811429857">1</xref>
</sup> This creates an increased demand for child neurology services; however, approximately 79% of pediatricians indicate that there are few or too few pediatric neurologists in their area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811429857">2</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, 9 of every 10 pediatricians stated that there are too few pediatric neurologists in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811429857">2</xref>
</sup> Van Cleave et al showed that the establishment of a new pediatric neurology practice dramatically increases the volume of new pediatric neurology patients in their area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811429857">3</xref>
</sup> In our tertiary, academic pediatric neurology center, the average waiting time for routine referrals is approximately 3 months. Like other practices, we receive phone calls from general pediatricians for urgent referrals daily. These phone calls are typically answered by the on-call pediatric neurology fellow and triaged based on the pediatrician’s report of urgency. For that reason, our division expanded urgent referral appointments into our daily schedule. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of urgent neurologic referrals by pediatricians.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811429857" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective review of all referrals by general pediatricians to the outpatient clinic at Tufts University- Floating Hospital for Children, between March 1 and March 30th, 2011 was done. All the urgent appointments were made after a direct request from the pediatrician’s practice to the on-call fellow in our center. All individuals at the time of referral had a nonfocal examination per the pediatrician. For analysis purposes, the patients were placed in different groups depending on the intervention initiated at the time of the urgent visit.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The total number of patients referred to our center during the month was 223. Among those, 108 were new patients and 195 were follow-up visits. Of the 108 new patients, 30 were deemed urgent. All 30 patients were given an appointment within 2 weeks of the initial referral. Six of 30 patients (20%) did not present to the visit. Based on the above classification, 12 of 24 patients (50%) had no further evaluation (Group A), 4 of 24 patients (16%) had magnetic resonance imaging or an electroencephalogram (Group B), 5 of 24 (20%) patients were prescribed medication without further testing (Group C), 2 of 24 (10%) patients had further evaluation and were prescribed medication (Group D), and 1 of the 24 patients (4%) was admitted to our inpatient ward (Group E) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811429857">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The most common reason for urgent referral to our practice was clinical seizures (10 of 24 patients, 41%). Of those, 7 patients were referred for new-onset seizures (29%), and 3 patients had a history of seizure disorder with a follow-up breakthrough seizure. Three of these patients (30%) had diagnostic evaluation after the initial visit, and all of these patients belonged to the new-onset seizure subgroup. Among the patients with a seizure as a reason for referral, 3 of 10 were prescribed an antiepileptic medication after the investigation was completed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073811429857">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The second most common reason for urgent referral to our service was headache (7 of 24 patients, 29%). Three of these 7 patients (42%) had diagnostic testing after the initial visit.

<p>Furthermore, for the routinely scheduled urgent patient groups, the most common reason for referral was headache (26/78, 33%), followed closely by seizure (24/78, 30%).</p>
<p>The comparison between the urgent and routinely scheduled patients shows that the intent to initiate evaluation or treatment between the two groups is very similar and not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 1).</p>
<p>When comparing the subgroups of patients based on their diagnosis at the time of referral, it is evident that there is also no statistical difference between the patients referred for headache, in terms of either medication initiated (<italic>P</italic> = .7) or evaluation needed after the visit (<italic>P</italic> = 1).</p>
<p>In contrast, even though there is no statistically significant difference for the patients referred due to seizures, a trend is obvious for this group for initiation of medication (<italic>P</italic> = .4) and workup that was initiated after the visit (<italic>P</italic> = .3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Advances in neuroimaging, electroencephalography, electromyography, muscle histology, biochemistry, and neuropharmacology have improved considerably the ability to evaluate and treat children with neurologic disorders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811429857">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is a growing demand for pediatric neurology services, and wait times for routine appointments are long.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811429857">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811429857">2</xref>
</sup> As we have observed this trend within our own practice, we retrospectively reviewed our experience to evaluate the outcomes and need for urgent pediatric neurology visits.</p>
<p>The most common reason for urgent referral to our academic tertiary care center was clinical seizures. Seventy percent of these patients were referred for new-onset seizures; 42% of these patients had both diagnostic evaluations and new medication intervention, and 30% of these patients had a known seizure disorder with new breakthrough seizures. Medication changes were made for only 1 patient who presented because of breakthrough seizures.</p>
<p>The second most common reason for urgent referral was headache, which occurred in 29% of referred urgent patients. Medication intervention was initiated in 57% of the headache subgroup. Diagnostic evaluation was performed in 42% of these patients.</p>
<p>Results were different in the scheduled, new patient group. The most common reason for scheduled referrals was headache, followed closely by seizure. Patients who presented because of seizure more often required further evaluation. Patients with headache were more often prescribed medication.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations, including the duration of only 1 month, the relatively small volume of acute referrals, and the fact that we did not include any emergency room referrals from pediatricians to our hospital.</p>
<p>There is an increasing demand for pediatric neurology services. The input–output workforce projections predict that by the year 2020 there will be a shortage of child neurologists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811429857">5</xref>
</sup> In the 1990s, 70% of child neurology residency slots were filled. In 2001, only 55% of slots were filled, despite a relatively steady number of positions being offered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811429857">5</xref>
</sup> These statistics indicate that the relative lack of pediatric neurology services, because of the mismatch of increasing demand, versus the fairly constant number of trainees in child neurology will continue to exist.</p>
<p>In our patient population, it is evident that there is no statistical difference between the urgent and the scheduled patient groups, as the intent to evaluate and initiate treatment is similar (<italic>P</italic> = 1). It is of interest though to explore the reason of referral for these patients. Even though the initiation of treatment or the request for further evaluation was similar for patients referred for headache (<italic>P</italic> = .7, <italic>P</italic> = 1), it is worth noting that for the patients referred because of seizures their <italic>P</italic> value is significantly smaller and shows a trend that might be more clearly delineated with larger numbers of patients (<italic>P</italic> = .4, <italic>P</italic> = .3).</p>
<p>Because of the above results, in regard to seizure disorders we believe that there is a greater need for pediatric neurologists to incorporate urgent seizure clinic appointments in their schedule. This increase in the work volume and appointments for pediatric neurologists may be balanced by triaging the headache urgent appointments as it is clearly shown in our study that there was no statistical difference between the urgent and scheduled patients with headache.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind showing the need for an urgent seizure clinic by pediatric neurologists and the outcomes of urgent referrals of pediatricians to child neurologists.</p>
