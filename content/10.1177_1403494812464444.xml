<abstract>
<p><italic>Rationale</italic>: Health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSSs) are important sources for health planning and policy in many low and middle income countries. Almost all HDSSs are in rural settings. The article aims to present the experiences and some concrete results for the first three years of operation of an urban HDSS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and discuss advantages and disadvantages of conducting health studies in HDSSs. <italic>Design, population and sample size</italic>: The DodaLab urban HDSS was established in 2007 in three communes at different economic levels in Dong Da district, Hanoi, Vietnam. Demographic, social and economic information about 10,000 households and their 37,000 persons was obtained through household interviews. Quarterly follow-up was initiated to provide information about vital events, birth, death and migration. A new household survey was undertaken in 2009. The existing rural HDSS FilaBavi, started in 1999, with 12,000 households and 52,000 persons, was used as the blueprint. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: It was possible to establish and run an urban HDSS with experiences from the rural site. The urban and rural contexts are different and demographically, economically and socially complex, but the use of HDSSs can facilitate research beyond very simplified models for comparisons. General statements about external validity of results from the HDSS cannot be made. This issue has to be considered specifically in every situation as an integral part of the research so that the results can be made useful outside the researched HDSS and in performing relevant comparisons</bold>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In many countries the lack of useful routine demographic information for policy makers and health managers has led to the development of demographic surveillance systems (DSS), and later HDSS with “H” indicating health, as a way to monitor populations at household level. The first DSS was developed in MATLAB, Bangladesh 1966 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812464444">1</xref>]. The International Network of HDSSs (INDEPTH) currently have 42 members in 19 countries, mainly in Africa and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812464444">2</xref>], most often in rural areas. One or two are established in urban slum areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812464444">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The basic function of an HDSS is to create and maintain a population and household register for the site that can be used for planning purposes. Vital events, primarily birth, migration and deaths are registered continuously. The educational, social and economic characteristics are registered and updated at regular time intervals. HDSSs can be developed to provide information in the same way as registers in high income country contexts and provide an infrastructure for research and intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464444">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812464444">5</xref>].</p>
<p>As indicated by the name, activities in HDSSs are not limited to collecting demographic data such as births, deaths and migrations, but are also extended to information about health and health care. Pregnancy events are monitored in most HDSSs and self-reported illness and health-care seeking behaviors are collected for some sites. Registration of causes of death using verbal autopsy methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812464444">6</xref>] has recently become a core function in many sites, especially in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812464444">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812464444">8</xref>]. The causes of deaths are diagnosed either by physicians or using a software called InterVA and then translated into the <italic>International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems tenth revision</italic> (ICD-10) coding system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464444">9</xref>]. When deaths are not attended by medical staff and a medical autopsy can not be systematically done, verbal autopsy data from HDSSs is often considered a valuable source of information in low and middle income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812464444">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464444">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812464444">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Discussions about an urban HDSS in Hanoi started in 2006 between Hanoi Medical University (HMU), the Nordic School of Public Health and Hanoi Health Bureau. The Oxford University Clinical Research Unit has later joined the stakeholder group. Dong Da district was selected because it is economically and socially relatively typical for urban Hanoi and because a strong support from local health leaders and authorities for the project was found there. DodaLab started with a baseline survey in November 2007. The structure and operations of DodaLab were largely the same as in the rural HDSS FilaBavi that has been running since 1999.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to present experiences and some concrete results for the first three years of operation of an urban HDSS in central Hanoi, Vietnam. We will also contrast this urban site to the FilaBavi rural site that has been running since 1999 in the rural part of Hanoi. Finally, an aim is also to discuss advantages and disadvantages of conducting health studies using a framework of HDSSa.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494812464444">
<title>DodaLab, the urban HDSS</title>
<p>Dong Da is an old urban district with about 352,000 persons in 2007, 50.6% females. Almost all belong to the Kinh ethnic group. Adult literacy is 99.6%. As reported from official sources, the crude birth rate is 2.2% and children under five years of age comprise 7.2% of the overall population. The main occupation groups are civil servants and people in business and service.</p>
<p>The District Health Department is responsible for administrative management of health activities in the whole district, including commune health centers. The District Health Center with a clinic is responsible for curative care and the District Preventive Medicine Team is responsible for preventive health programs. There is a Commune Health Station in each commune, mostly with physicians, responsible for primary health care. There are also one general and three specialist central hospitals, as well as one provincial hospital and tens of private clinics in the district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812464444">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Three communes, Kim Lien, Quang Trung and Trung Phung were selected to represent high, middle and low economic levels. Lists for the baseline household surveys were collected from commune leaders and police.</p>
<p>A household and person survey was conducted in 2007 as baseline and repeated 2009 to collect information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of all households and household members within the HDSS. Follow up surveys every three months are used primarily to record vital events and to update demographic information.</p>
<p>As in FilaBavi, pregnancies were quarterly followed until birth in DodaLab and a comparative study using two cohorts of pregnant women has been done in parallel in the two sites. At the primary stage, owing to lack of human and financial resources, causes of death has not yet been conducted.</p>
<p>Sixty persons, familiar with the local people, almost all female, working part-time, have been recruited as field surveyors. Data collection is conducted under the supervision of eight field supervisors, who are health workers or members of the Women Union. Both field surveyors and supervisors are continuously trained. All information is obtained using structured questionnaires.</p>
<p>A multi-stage supervision procedure has been established to control the quality of the data collected. The supervisor observes the surveyor during some interviews and feedback is provided. Re-interviews are conducted on approximately 3% of the household visits. Discrepancies are discussed with the surveyor to identify problems. All questionnaires are checked by the field supervisors.</p>
<p>The DodaLab project was reviewed and supported by HMU, Hanoi Health Bureau and Dong Da district authorities. It was also approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of HMU, as well as the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. A steering board with the participation of HMU, Hanoi Health Bureau and Dong Da district authorities was established to manage the operation of DodaLab. All households approached were informed about the purpose of the studies and their right to decline participation or withdraw. It was also clarified that strict rules for confidentiality should be adhered to. Information was also given that all results will be continuously disseminated to communities and authorities as aggregated information. Verbal consent was obtained from most household representatives. About 3% of the households approached refused participation at different levels.</p>

<title>FilaBavi, the rural HDSS</title>
<p>A strong motive for setting up DodaLab was to create opportunities for parallel urban and rural studies. Emerging health issues, particularly related to non-communicable disease, migration and lifestyle changes, started the discussion of a HDSS in urban Hanoi with FilaBavi as a blueprint. This site is located in a rural district 60 km west of Hanoi in former Ha Tay, now Ha Noi rural province with 250,000 inhabitants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812464444">12</xref>]. Farming is the main occupation. Major household surveys were conducted in 1999 (baseline survey), and then repeatedly every two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812464444">12</xref>]. Routine data is obtained quarterly, including births, deaths, migrations, self-reported illness and health-care seeking behaviors, pregnancy monitoring and cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464444">13</xref>].</p>

<title>Empirical results</title>
<p>The aim of this section is to give some information about households and persons in the two sites as obtained in the household surveys 2007 and 2009 household surveys in DodaLab and FilaBavi. Some comments to the vital events registered in the two sites during 2008–2010 will also be given.</p>

Approximately 11,000 households were officially registered in 2007 and 2.3% declined to participate. Partial non-response rate was 0.7%. There are about 10% increases of households and persons from 2007 to 2009, mainly through new registration or household split.</p>

<p>There are two main occupation groups for adults in DodaLab: office staff (33.3%) and business activities (20.1%). Elderly and retired persons comprise 18.5%. FilaBavi has a quite different structure with more than 50% of all adults reported as farmers.</p>
<p>Vietnam has several health insurance systems. About three quarters of all persons in DodaLab have some health insurance. Results for health insurance in FilaBavi are not available. Almost 20% of all adults in DodaLab were smokers compared with 25.2% in FilaBavi. The percentage of smokers was lower in communes with a higher socioeconomic condition. The estimated percentages for smoking (ever smoking) are for the entire population. Since the percentages for women smoking are 1–2%, the percentages for male are almost double those in the table. More than 40% of adults in DodaLab reported having accessed the internet during the last year in the 2009 survey, more often in the communes with better socioeconomic conditions and much more frequently than in FilaBavi (9.6%). The reported percentages for this indicator were substantially lower in 2007.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812464444">Table III</xref> shows a summary of the reported household incomes and expenditures in DodaLab. The first quartile demarcates the lowest 25% of the income distribution and the third quartile cuts off the upper 25%. All estimates increase between the 2007 and the 2009 survey. The median increase is consistently about 50% for the three communes in DodaLab. The estimated median of reported income in FilaBavi is about one-third of that for DodaLab.</p>

<p>During the period 2008–2010, 1481 births and 588 deaths were recorded in DodaLab. It can be noted that all estimates of sex ratio at birth (SRB) are higher than the natural 105 (103–107) male live births per 100 female live births. The errors in these estimates, however, are rather large and the tendency for higher SRB in the urban areas as compared with the rural cannot yet be statistically confirmed.</p>
<p>The estimated crude mortality in DodaLab is about 5.1 per 1000 persons a year, moderately lower than that for FilaBavi (5.6), which to some extent can be explained by the younger urban population. The number of deaths reported in 2008–2010 is, however, rather small, so the difference in crude mortality is not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Urban areas in any country differ in many ways from rural areas. Living conditions are different. Access to higher level health care is easier. Cultural patterns might be different and societies can be developing economically at different paces. Education and occupation of inhabitants are different. The DodaLab and FilaBavi contexts are complex in the sense that many variables are required to describe the health and well-being of the populations as well as the differences between them. Still, urban and rural contexts are interlinked and dependent on one another.</p>
<p>The study of urbanization and its effects on health was a key issue behind the establishment of DodaLab. Urbanization that is, moving from rural to urban areas, is a global trend. In 2005, about 3.2 billion people, 49% of the global population, lived in urban areas. It is projected to increase to 4.9 billion persons by 2030, i.e. roughly by 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812464444">14</xref>]. It therefore becomes urgent to develop infrastructures for the study of effects of urbanization on health, health risk, risk behavior, health care utilization, etc. The health effects of moving from life in a rural environment to an urban one are of particular interest but have not been studied to any large extent in Vietnam. Some research has been conducted on the effects of migration from rural areas, but much less on migration seen from the receiving urban sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812464444">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Performing research in an HDSS means that the context can be well described and extensive baseline information can be obtained. Sampling frames are available both for random and strategic samples. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative information, information from health care institutions, etc., is facilitated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812464444">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464444"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812464444">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The most important advantage of HDSS research is that longitudinal studies of trends and changes in health and in the health system in their demographic, socioeconomic and cultural context can be conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812464444">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812464444">19</xref>]. Examples are follow-up of chronic and non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812464444">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812464444">21</xref>] as well as maternal and child health that have actually been focused during the first DodaLab years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812464444">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812464444">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Disease surveillance has often been specific or limited to communicable or non-communicable disease. A potentially interesting type of study can be on risk factors that are common for communicable and non-communicable disease. Using a HDSS will make it easier to get a picture of the total disease burden in a population, its size and composition and to follow changes in effects of risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812464444">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812464444">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812464444">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Setting up an HDSS in any context first requires discussion with local authorities about the need to have a new site, the prerequisites for the new site and to solicit the necessary support to do that. Some aspects of the location must be carefully considered, e.g. the demographic, social and economic conditions, as well as the logistic situation. To develop the sampling framework it is necessary to work closely with heads of communes and villages to collect lists of households and household information, available in administrative registration systems. Maps are normally of central interest.</p>
<p>Recruitment of field workers is another crucial issue that requires specific attention in any new site. Decision can only be taken after discussions with local authorities and interviews with candidates. The sex of field workers should be considered. Women might be prioritized because they can more easily access households and ask some types of questions, e.g. about pregnancy and birth. The choice of local interviewers or interviewers from the outside should be considered.</p>
<p>An extensive part of the preparations consists of development of questionnaires and operation manuals based on decisions about which information should be included, formulating clear definitions, testing in pilot studies and adaptation to local language. Training of field workers has to be careful and continuously repeated over time. Here the experiences from FilaBavi were very useful for the development of DodaLab.</p>
<p>Starting the urban site DodaLab can generally be compared with the establishment of a rural HDSS, FilaBavi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812464444">12</xref>]. In some senses the former is more complicated than the latter. It is more difficult to access households in the urban context. Interviewers must be more familiar with households, respected in the community and have a serious interest in conducting the interviews. There is a higher population density and it can, therefore, be more difficult to demarcate and map households. In the rural areas one household and one house most often coincides, while an urban house can accommodate several households.</p>
<p>There can be more stress and time limitations that restrict the opportunities for interviewing in the urban context. Many adult persons are office workers or in business. The rate of temporary migration between and within clusters is high, making it difficult to identify persons and record migration accurately. There are larger risks for drop out of interviewers and higher costs: salaries and other routine cost.</p>
<p>Household members in the urban HDSS also seem to have different attitudes towards being interviewed than in the rural. There is a stronger questioning of direct and indirect benefit for households resulting in more common refusal to participate. It is more difficult to explain the benefit for the community. Still, less than 3% of the approached households in DodaLab declined participation, fully or partially, in the project (about 1% in FilaBavi). Although the data management and quality control in DodaLab is well developed, much based on the experiences from FilaBavi, regular quality assessment will be needed to control that high standards are maintained over time.</p>
<p>Internal validity in empirical research means that observations and measurements correctly describe the true state of the studied reality. Statistical generalization from observations in a random sample to the entire population from which the sample was drawn is the only form of generalization where it is possible to quantify the uncertainty in probability terms, e.g. constructing confidence limits. Results from a HDSS cannot be generalized outside in this sense.</p>
<p>External validity of the HDSS research results is nevertheless necessary to claim that they can be useful outside the HDSS. A chain of external generalization, from DodaLab to Dong Da district as a whole, and from there to urban districts in Hanoi and possibly other cities, is required. The same arguments as for external generalization must be made to claim that formal comparisons, e.g. between urban and rural sites, are meaningful.</p>
<p>A conclusion that results from the researched context, generalized to another or to a wider context than that researched, must be based on similarity between the contexts. There can be no strict (quantitative) way to measure such similarity. Any decision must be openly subjective with well-declared assumptions and the target context for generalization must be specified.</p>
<p>The need for external validity and generalization will also be different in different situations. In public health there is usually an interest for policy formation and intervention planning. Simple estimates, e.g. infant mortality rate (IMR), are unique and generalization to a similar district is of little interest. More complex results, e.g. conclusions about factors influencing IMR should be more important for contexts outside the researched.</p>
<p>Smaling has described three approaches for generalization: inductive, communicative and analogical generalization. In the inductive form, the researcher most often assumes that induction is possible based on theoretical propositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812464444">25</xref>]. This is the theoretical or theory-borne generalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812464444">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Communicative generalization refers to a procedure where the researcher, the users of the results and possibly other actors, communicate to obtain a shared understanding of how generalization can or cannot be formulated.</p>
<p>The analogic form, as suggested by Smaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812464444">25</xref>], is the most formalized approach. Smaling formulates six criteria for generalization, from the context actually studied to given target setting, using similarities and dissimilarities. However, even this approach becomes quite subjective. Generalizing from one context to another, using any approach, requires that we have information about certain key characteristics in both. National surveys might be used to define rules for demographic, economic, social and other similarity between districts. Each generalization has to include a specific analysis.</p>
<p>Many low and middle income countries lack functioning health information systems. Routine information might be collected but is often of low quality. Using a HDSS can be a solution to obtain good information for planning health policy and action. High income countries with well-functioning demographic surveillance still use large, even national, cross-sectional surveys to obtain specific information. The validity of results from such surveys has gradually declined over the latest decades, mainly owing to low response rates. Systems of strategically located HDSSs, well representing a target area, can be useful as a study panel of informants also in high income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812464444">27</xref>].</p>
<p>After more than four years of operation we make the following conclusions related to DodaLab: (i) it was possible to establish and run an urban HDSS although there were more problems than doing so in the rural context, (ii) the urban and rural contexts, as described demographically, economically and socially, are quite different and complex but the use of a HDSS could facilitate research beyond very simplified models for comparisons and (iii) external validity has to be considered specifically in every situation as an integral part of the research to make the results widely useful.</p>
