To assess (1) if robberies and assaults are less likely to be reported when the victim is engaged in crime and if this relationship can be explained by characteristics of the incident, victim, or the victim’s neighborhood and (2) if neighborhood context moderates the effects of offending on reporting. Methods. The data include 832 victimizations reported in the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS). All data are self-reported except neighborhood disadvantage and crime rates, which were measured using census data and police records, respectively. Data are analyzed using random intercept models. Findings. Victimizations are less likely to be reported when the victim is more involved in crime and this relationship is not fully explained by characteristics of the victim, incident, or the victim’s neighborhood. The effect of offending on reporting is stronger for incidents in which the victim resided in a high-crime or disadvantaged neighborhood. Conclusions. Victims' offending is an important correlate of reporting; however, the assumption that criminals are unwilling or unable to use formal social control seems to apply mainly to those who reside in disadvantaged or high-crime neighborhoods. Future research should explore why offenders' willingness to report varies by neighborhood context.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>victimization</kwd><kwd>victim reporting</kwd><kwd>neighborhood context</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0022427811423107"><title>Introduction</title><p>An increasing amount of attention has been directed at understanding the nature of individuals' actions in the aftermath of being victimized. Some victims seek “personal justice” and retaliate against the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811423107">Topalli, Wright, and Fornango 2002</xref>), some avoid those who harmed them altogether, while others seek the assistance of the police. Although public officials have embarked on an effort to encourage victims of crime to take the latter course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811423107">Renzetti, Edelson, and Bergen 2001</xref>), a significant percentage of crimes are never brought to the attention of law enforcement officials. Estimates from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicate, for example, that in 2007 approximately 42 percent of violent crimes were not reported to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423107">Rand 2008</xref>).</p><p>Since the 1960s, researchers have sought to understand why a large percentage of victimizations go unreported (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811423107">Gottfredson and Hindelang 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811423107">Skogan 1984</xref>), yet limited attention has been paid to whether reporting is influenced by victims' own involvement in crime. There are several reasons to expect that offending will be a salient predictor of reporting. For example, people who are actively involved in illegal activities commonly express an antagonistic view of the law, rely on forms of violent self-help to resolve conflicts or rectify transgressions, and avoid interaction with legal authorities so not to expose their misdeeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811423107">Rosenfeld, Jacobs, and Wright 2003</xref>). When one considers the fact that offenders are disproportionately victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811423107">Lauritsen and Laub 2007</xref>), this suggests many crimes go unreported because the victims are involved in unlawful behavior.</p><p>Most of what little is known about the negative relationship between offending and police notification has emerged from qualitative studies of active offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>). While this research is important, it does not assess if other theoretically relevant factors confound the effect of offending on reporting. More importantly, because this work focuses almost exclusively on serious offenders residing in high-crime, impoverished areas, it is not known whether these findings can be generalized to other contexts. In fact, there are a number of reasons to expect that the effect of criminal behavior on reporting is context-specific.</p><p>The current article explores the relationship between offending and victimization reporting using data from the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS). We first assess the extent to which victims' offending predicts whether they contacted the police when robbed or assaulted. We then examine if characteristics of the victims, victimization incidents, or neighborhoods in which victims reside accounts for this relationship. Finally, we evaluate whether the effect of offending on reporting varies as a function of neighborhood conditions.</p><p>Examining these issues is important for several reasons. Citizen reporting is the primary mechanism through which crimes become known to law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811423107">Warner 1992</xref>:72) and therefore nonreporting will cause official agencies to underestimate crime rates. When certain subgroups of the population are less willing than others to report their victimizations, this may in turn hamper the effective deployment of police resources and bias empirical research that relies on official crime data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811423107">Baumer and Lauritsen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811423107">Skogan 1976</xref>). Moreover, if victims are unwilling to enlist the police to settle their disputes, it may enhance the possibility that they will deploy their own form of informal or personal justice.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0022427811423107"><title>Offending Reporting by Victims of Crime</title><p>Most research in the United States on victim reporting has been conducted using the National Crime Survey (NCS) and its contemporary the NCVS. Studies consistently have found that incident-specific characteristics are the strongest predictors of reporting, especially the seriousness of the victimization, followed by characteristics of the victim (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811423107">Avakame, Fyfe, and McCoy 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811423107">Baumer and Lauritsen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811423107">Gottfredson and Hindelang 1979</xref>). While a significant amount of attention has been paid to variation in reporting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright (2006</xref>:42) note that “the degree to which offenders mobilize formal authorities on any capacity has historically received little criminological attention.” Perhaps, the main reason for this omission is that few data sets contain information on victimization, offending, and police notification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811423107">Lauritsen and Laub 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811423107">1</xref></sup> As a result, much of what we know about this topic is based on interviews with active street offenders. Generally, this work has found that individuals involved in illicit activities are reluctant to report victimization to the police, often because they fear being implicated in a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811423107">Rosenfeld et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811423107">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811423107">2</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section3-0022427811423107"><title>Reexamining the Link between Offending and Reporting</title><p>Although qualitative research has provided important information about police reporting among active offenders, this work does not evaluate whether offenders' illicit activities per se make them reluctant to notify the police, or if their apparent reluctance stems from factors commonly associated with offending. Several key correlates of criminal behavior are also likely related to reporting, and these may explain why active offenders are reluctant to enlist police services. For example, offenders often associate with others involved in crime and may be less willing to report their victimizations out of concern that the police will become aware of their associates' illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811423107">Topalli et al. 2002</xref>). Moreover, individuals who engage in criminal behavior are also more likely to have unwanted contact with law enforcement, both as arrestees and suspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811423107">Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis 1981</xref>). Research has found that this experience is negatively related to reporting intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811423107">Davis and Henderson 2003</xref>) and this effect is enhanced if individuals feel that they were treated unfairly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811423107">Leiber, Nalla, and Farnworth 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427811423107">Sunshine and Tyler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427811423107">Tyler 2006</xref>). Finally, offenders may be reluctant to report victimizations because they hold a “punitive definition of justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>:30), whereby they prefer to rectify grievances through violent forms of self-help. This discussion implies that existing qualitative research is limited because it has not explored whether factors commonly correlated with criminal behavior account for the relationship between offending and reporting.</p><p>A second limitation of prior work stems from its narrow focus on offenders living in disadvantaged and high-crime neighborhoods. The use of homogenous samples may have caused qualitative research to <italic>overstate</italic> the association between criminal behavior and police notification for two reasons: (1) this association may be confounded by neighborhood characteristics or (2) neighborhood context may moderate the offending-reporting association such that it is stronger in disadvantaged, high-crime neighborhoods. We discuss each of these possibilities below.</p><p>Within distressed urban neighborhoods, it is quite likely that most residents—not only those involved in criminal behavior—are unlikely to elicit help from the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811423107">Anderson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811423107">Goudriaan, Wittebrood, and Nieuwbeerta 2006</xref>). The negative relationship between disadvantage and the willingness to report crime is also anticipated by a number of different theoretical perspectives. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811423107">Black’s (1976)</xref> theory of law predicts that in areas of lower socioeconomic status (SES), residents are less likely to use the formal legal system to manage conflicts. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811423107">Black (1976</xref>:17-18), wealth designates vertical status in social life, and people with lower vertical status theoretically “have less law.” Neighborhood poverty should affect reporting decisions because living in a poor neighborhood is a signal of having lower vertical status (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811423107">Baumer 2002</xref>:582). Drawing on this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811423107">Cooney (1998</xref>:122) conceives of contemporary impoverished urban environments as “stateless.” Here, the police and prosecutors are of higher social status than residents, especially offenders, and as a result, the formal law is rarely invoked to resolve conflict (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811423107">Anderson 1999</xref>). Moreover, contemporary social disorganization theory posits that socioeconomic disadvantage disrupts neighborhood cohesion, which ultimately hampers residents' ability to form effective partnerships with agencies external to the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811423107">Bursik and Grasmick 1993</xref>). In fact, some empirical research has observed a negative relationship between neighborhood poverty and police notification, with particularly low levels of reporting at very high levels of disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811423107">Goudriaan et al. 2006</xref>). Other studies have found curvilinear effects, whereby the overall effect of poverty on simple assault reporting is positive, but it becomes negative at very high levels of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811423107">Baumer 2002</xref>).</p><p>Similar to neighborhood disadvantage, local crime rates also influence the nature of neighborhood social life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811423107">Harding 2009</xref>) and therefore may confound the relationship between offending and victimization reporting. Where crime is more pervasive, victims may be reluctant to contact the authorities out of concerns about (1) retaliation and (2) bringing unwanted police attention or “heat” to the misdeeds of their neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>). Crime rates may also affect the nature of police work and by extension, police-citizen interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811423107">Klinger (1997)</xref>, for example, argues that in high-crime communities, police respond to deviance with less vigor, taking fewer reports and making fewer arrests than they would for comparable illegal behavior in lower crime areas (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427811423107">Smith 1986</xref>). At the same time, residents in these neighborhoods view the actions of the police as overly aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811423107">Brunson 2007</xref>). Combined, these practices may lead victims in high-crime communities to question the ability of the police to effectively fight crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811423107">Reisig and Parks 2000</xref>) and ultimately reduce the likelihood they will enlist police services. In short, prior research has not assessed the effects of offending on reporting independent of neighborhood context, and therefore findings from this research may inflate the extent to which reporting is influenced by criminal behavior.</p><p>As noted earlier, qualitative research may also overstate the association between offending and nonreporting if this relationship is stronger in impoverished, high-crime locations—where the bulk of research on this topic has been undertaken. In fact, relatively little is known about the extent to which offending affects reporting decisions within less distressed urban environments where the relationship may be much weaker. As outlined below, there are several reasons to expect that neighborhood context may <italic>moderate</italic> the relationship between offending and notification.</p><p>First, in disadvantaged, high-crime neighborhoods, illicit activity often occurs in public spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811423107">Berg and Rengifo 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427811423107">Sullivan 1989</xref>), as offenders are “pulled” to the street by the lure of making money and “pushed” by a lack of personal space and access to a household in which to conduct their illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811423107">Rosenfeld et al. 2003</xref>). Illicit activity occurring in public spaces is generally subjected to more formal law than if it occurs in private spaces (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811423107">Black 1976</xref>) and police officers in these neighborhoods often know offenders by sight, which minimizes the likelihood that those involved in crime will be viewed as deserving victims and their complaints will be taken seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811423107">Klinger 1997</xref>). As a result, offenders in these environments come to recognize that they “cannot really be ‘victims' in the eyes of the criminal justice system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811423107">Topalli et al. 2002</xref>:337). By contrast, offenders operating in more affluent communities may have access to resources to conduct their illicit activities behind closed doors. Under these circumstances, the police are relatively unacquainted with active offenders and therefore are more willing to treat their complaints legitimately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>). Moreover, offenders as well as their associates may hold more positive perceptions of law enforcement, making them more willing to enlist the police when victimized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811423107">3</xref></sup> Combined, these ideas suggest that neighborhood context may influence the nature of relations between the police and offenders, which culminates in neighborhood-based differences in offenders' willingness to report.</p><p>Second, the relationship between offending and reporting may differ across neighborhood contexts due to variation in the salience of oppositional conduct norms. Collectively these norms embody an honor culture and are often spatially concentrated in neighborhoods characterized by socioeconomic disadvantage and high crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811423107">Cooney 1998</xref>). An honor culture deems the formal law as irrelevant to the satisfactory resolution of day-to-day conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>:25), promotes a type of hypermasculinity, and sanctions interpersonal aggression as a mechanism to resolve disputes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811423107">Anderson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811423107">Horowitz 1983</xref>). Conventional modes of conflict resolution have little force within these social contexts, especially for active offenders who are more likely to abide by the unique set of conduct norms that such a culture dictates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811423107">Kubrin and Weitzer 2003</xref>). Crime reporting is likely to have serious ramifications for an offender’s reputation and personal safety because it threatens the very persona that most street offenders want to maintain—it sends the message that they are “incapable of handling their own business” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811423107">Lauritsen and Laub 2007</xref>:64; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811423107">Cooney 1998</xref>). But beyond this, criminals who interact with the police in any capacity are likely to be branded as “snitches” and excluded from opportunities in the underground marketplace.</p><p>Although not well studied, it is unlikely that these same normative constraints on reporting exist for offenders residing in low poverty, safer neighborhoods where mainstream conduct norms often dominate the social order (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811423107">Baumgartner 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811423107">Luckenbill and Doyle 1989</xref>). Retributive violence is unlikely to receive strong normative support, even among residents who are frequently involved in criminal behavior. Under these circumstances, offenders often handle interpersonal disputes peacefully and rarely retaliate against those who have exploited them (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811423107">Cooney 1998</xref>). It is also unlikely that offenders will be targeted for violent revenge if they enlist the services of the police. For these reasons, criminals operating in neighborhoods defined by lower levels of poverty and violent crime should be more willing to report their victimizations.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0022427811423107"><title>Current Study</title><p>To summarize, there are several reasons to expect that offenders are reluctant to report their victimizations to the police. While critically important, most research on this issue examines the reporting behavior of a relatively circumscribed group of offenders—chronic offenders residing in high crime, disadvantaged neighborhoods. Therefore, past work may confound the effects of offending on police reporting with the known correlates of criminal behavior, particularly neighborhood-level factors. Moreover, studies have yet to examine if the relationship between criminal behavior and reporting varies across neighborhood contexts.</p><p>The current study uses data from the PYS to address four primary research questions about reporting. First, we assess whether individuals who are engaged in crime are less willing to report their victimization to the police. Second, because offenders possess many of the characteristics that are related to nonreporting, we examine whether the relationship between offending and reporting is explained by the characteristics of the victimization incident and the victim. Third, we assess whether neighborhood disadvantage and crime rates confound the offending-reporting relationship. Finally, we examine whether the effect of offending on reporting varies according to these neighborhood characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0022427811423107" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="section6-0022427811423107"><title>Data</title><p>The data used in this study were gathered as part of the PYS, an ongoing longitudinal investigation into the causes and consequences of delinquency and mental health problems that began in 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811423107">Loeber et al., 1998</xref>). The sample was selected from boys enrolled in the first and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools and the two cohorts, each consisting of 500 boys, were constructed to include a group of high-risk and nonhigh-risk respondents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811423107">Loeber et al. 2008</xref> for more detail on the PYS). We only use waves in which both victimization and offending were assessed. These waves covered ages 15 to 26 for the oldest cohort and ages 10 to 19 for the youngest cohort.

These prevalence measures were then summed to generate a variety measure of self-reported offending that captures the number of different offense types that the respondent engaged in during the year he was victimized. Variety scores were used because they are generally considered more valid than other measures of delinquency, including frequency scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811423107">Hindelang et al. 1981</xref>).

We also include a binary measure, weapon, coded 1 if the attacker used a weapon in carrying out the crime and 0 if not. In addition, we control for whether the victimization was a robbery (coded as 1) or assault (coded as 0) because there may be variation in reporting by crime type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811423107">Baumer 2002</xref>).

This measure is a standardized scale of 3 items, with high scores reflecting the respondent believed that it was not wrong to engage in a variety of violent behaviors. Situational theories argue that the amount of time one spends socializing in certain settings increases their likelihood of involvement in criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811423107">Osgood et al. 1996</xref>) and may signal a stronger commitment to a deviant lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811423107">Fleisher 1997</xref>).

Victim’s race is captured with a binary variable, Black, with Blacks coded as 1 and Whites as 0. We also control for the victim’s age at the time of incident. Because past work has found that mobility is a correlate of reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811423107">Baumer 2002</xref>), we include a binary variable coded 1 if the respondent moved census tracts since the previous wave and 0 otherwise. Finally, youth whose parents have been arrested may be more reluctant to contact the police out of fear of implicating their parents in a crime or because they hold more antagonistic views toward the law; therefore, we include a binary measure, parent/guardian arrested, which captures if either of the respondent’s parents or guardians had ever been arrested.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section18-0022427811423107"><title>Analytic Strategy</title><p>To examine the relationship between offending, our other key variables, and reporting, we first estimate bivariate correlations among our measures. We then estimate the effect of offending on reporting, net of our control variables. Next, we add individual-, incident-, and neighborhood-level variables to the model to assess how they affect the relationship between offending and reporting. Finally, to determine if the relationship between offending and reporting varies based on neighborhood disadvantage and crime rates, we create multiplicative interaction terms between each of the neighborhood measures and offending. Because our dependent variable is dichotomous, we use logistic regression.</p><p>By design, the data set used here is comprised of multiple incidents of victimization nested within people. Therefore, victimizations are not independent from one another and the standard errors estimated in regression models may be invalid. To overcome this methodological challenge, a random intercept model is used to analyze the data. This model explicitly recognizes that victimizations experienced by the same person may be more similar to one another than victimizations experienced by a different person. This technique uses a respondent-specific intercept as a predictor in order to relax the assumption of conditional independence among the responses for the same individual given the covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811423107">Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2008</xref>).

Two general findings emerge. First, offending has the strongest negative correlation with victims' decisions to report violence to the police (<italic>r<sub>bp</sub></italic> = −.22). Second, several of the key explanatory variables—including acceptance of violence (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = −.16), involvement with criminal peers (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = −.10), time use (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = −.18), and neighborhood disadvantage and crime rates (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = −.13 and <italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = −.14, respectively)—are also significantly correlated with police notification in the expected directions. As hypothesized, these variables are also correlated with involvement in crime, which suggests that they may explain the relationship between offending and reporting. Although being arrested and having contact with the police are significantly and positively correlated with offending (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = .30 and <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> = .32, respectively), contrary to our expectations, these two measures are not significantly associated with reporting. This may be due to the fact that these variables fail to capture whether the respondent felt the interaction was positive or negative, which may influence the effect of police contact on reporting.</p><p>To assess these relationships in a multivariate context, we first examine the association between offending and the probability of reporting net of our control variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811423107">Table 2</xref>, model 1). We find that incidents in which the victim is involved in criminal activity are significantly less likely to be reported. Holding constant demographic factors and parental arrests, a one unit increase in the number of different types of criminal behaviors that the respondent participated in during the past year is associated with a 24-percent reduction in the odds of reporting to the police by victims {100 × [exp (−.267) −1]}.

Consistent with prior research, victims are more likely to notify the police if they are hurt during the incident or if a weapon is present. Moreover, they are less apt to report if they were robbed versus assaulted. The offending variable retains a strong negative relationship with reporting, suggesting that incident-level characteristics have a negligible influence on the effect of offending.</p><p>Next, to address whether the observed effect of offending on reporting can be accounted for by correlates of criminal activity, we add characteristics of the victim and their lifestyle to our model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811423107">Table 2</xref>, model 3). The results indicate that if the incident involved victims who spend a greater amount of time out at night or who harbor violent attitudes, it is less likely to be reported. Furthermore, consistent with the bivariate correlations, reporting is unrelated to whether victims were ever arrested or had contact with the police. Importantly, victims' criminal behavior retains a strong negative effect on reporting, but the magnitude of the coefficient is reduced by approximately 20 percent from model 2. This reduction suggests that the relationship between offending and reporting is partially accounted for by characteristics of the victim’s lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427811423107">8</xref></sup></p><p>In model 4, we add variables measuring neighborhood disadvantage and crime rates.

For victims living in high-crime neighborhoods (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean), the probability that an incident will be reported to the police declines sharply as the victim’s level of offending increases. In fact, the lowest probability of reporting is observed among victims who offend at a high rate and who live in a high-crime neighborhood. Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of criminal activity on reporting is especially strong for incidents in which the victim resides in a high crime, highly disadvantaged neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022427811423107">13</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2-0022427811423107" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effect of offending on the predicted probability of reporting to the police across levels of neighborhood crime rates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811423107-fig2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section20-0022427811423107"><title>Discussion</title><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811423107">Topalli et al. (2002</xref>:337), “One of criminology’s dirty little secrets is that much serious crime, perhaps most, takes place beyond the reach of criminal law because it is perpetrated against individuals who themselves are involved in law breaking.” Therefore, it is surprising that relatively little quantitative research has sought to explore how involvement in illicit behavior affects one’s willingness to seek out the formal law when victimized. The current study builds on past research to provide a more complete understanding of why incidents of assault and robbery go unreported to the police.</p><p>Several key findings emerge from our research. First, consistent with qualitative studies, we found that incidents in which the victim had engaged in a wider variety of crimes in the past year were less likely to be reported to the police. Although the effect of offending on reporting was reduced approximately 20 percent by the inclusion of variables that are associated with criminal behavior, offending still maintained a strong independent effect. Therefore, the relationship between offending and reporting <italic>cannot be fully explained</italic> by offenders' tendency to have more interaction with the police or to live in distressed neighborhoods, nor can it be explained by the company offenders keep, their tolerance for violence or the dynamics of their lifestyle. These findings verify ideas that emerge from qualitative research but extend them to a multivariate framework where we were able to control for factors related to both offending and reporting using a more diverse sample comprised of both offenders and nonoffenders who reside in a wide range of neighborhood contexts.</p><p>Although, our independent variables did not fully explain the relationship between offending and reporting, several of them were significantly associated with reporting behavior. Arguably, the most interesting of these variables is neighborhood crime rates. Victims living in high-crime areas are less likely to notify the police. While researchers increasingly have begun to explore the contextual determinants of reporting behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811423107">Baumer 2002</xref>), the effect of crime rates has gone virtually unexamined. Our results suggest that community crime rates are perhaps more important in shaping victims' decisions to report than structural disadvantage.</p><p>Combined, the findings indicate that many studies of reporting provide a somewhat incomplete explanation of why some victims choose not to enlist the services of the police because they omit measures of offending. While excluding key predictors can lead to omitted variable bias, our results do not negate the conclusions reached by previous research: Incident-level characteristics and certain demographic factors (e.g., age) significantly influence reporting decisions. As such, offending and related measures correlated with offending seem to meaningfully <italic>supplement,</italic> rather than <italic>supplant,</italic> prior explanations for nonreporting.</p><p>Still, the question remains, if characteristics of the victim, their neighborhood, and the victimization incident do not explain why offenders are reluctant to report, then what does? Existing research offers several plausible explanations. For example, offenders' reluctance to call the police may stem from concerns about implicating themselves in their own unlawful actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811423107">Rosenfeld et al. 2003</xref>) or fears that reporting will result in retaliation or damage to their reputation. Offenders may also be unwilling to report because they view the police negatively or feel that they were treated unfairly in the past when stopped or arrested. Our data do not allow us to capture these potential reasons for nonreporting; therefore, additional research is needed to assess the validity of these explanations.</p><p>Our second key finding is that while incidents in which victims were more involved in crime were less likely to be reported to the police, the magnitude of this effect was context-specific. We found that the negative effect of offending on reporting was most pronounced for incidents involving victims who resided in neighborhoods marked by high crime rates and elevated levels of structural disadvantage. By comparison, for incidents in which the victim lived in more affluent and safer neighborhoods, there was a weaker relationship between offending and reporting. While qualitative research generally concludes that criminals are unwilling or unable to use formal social control, this assumption seems to apply mainly to those who reside in distressed neighborhoods. Offenders are not entirely unwilling to access the legal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811423107">Topalli et al. 2002</xref>); rather, their decisions to report their victimizations to the police are shaped by neighborhood context.</p><p>As we noted above, there are a number of reasons to expect that the relationship between offending and reporting is exacerbated in disadvantaged, high-crime neighborhoods. Neighborhood differences in cultural or social organization or in the nature of police-offender interactions perhaps cause variation in the offending-reporting relationship. The normative constraints on reporting, which exist in impoverished neighborhoods may not apply to offenders living in middle-class places where individuals manage conflicts differently and where an ominous reputation is less important for one’s well-being. Unfortunately, we lack measures that would allow us to isolate these explanations. Exploring these alternative explanations should be a priority of future research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022427811423107">14</xref></sup></p><p>The findings from this study have implications for research on violence, victimization, and mobilization of the law. Data amassed from crimes known to the police are commonly used by government agencies to allocate policing services and by researchers to generate knowledge about the etiology and consequences of criminal activity across places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811423107">Gottfredson and Hindelang 1981</xref>). Our results suggest that official crime data are likely to underreport robbery and assaults committed against actors involved in a wide variety of illegal behavior, especially those who live in high crime, disadvantaged neighborhoods—a group that is particularly vulnerable to victimization. Therefore, studies using official data to explain the geographic patterning of crime cannot assume that the proportion of crimes reported to the police is stable across different areas (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811423107">Goudriaan et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>But beyond this, the reluctance of criminals in distressed communities to report their victimizations may also contribute to high crime rates in disadvantaged neighborhoods by promoting cycles of retaliatory violence. When victims are unable to turn to the formal law, they must employ other tactics to resolve their disputes, one of which is violent retaliation. To be clear, we cannot speak to the <italic>type</italic> of conflict management strategies offenders in disadvantaged, high-crime neighborhoods routinely employ; however, research indicates that when serious disputes arise within these contexts, they are more likely to prompt retaliatory violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811423107">Kubrin and Weitzer 2003</xref>). In contrast, in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, disputants often resolve their grievances using nonviolent forms of conflict management—for instance, they call upon the police to “prosecute violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811423107">Cooney 1998</xref>:114) or they avoid or tolerate conflict with others; disputes rarely erupt into ongoing “aggressive confrontation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811423107">Baumgartner 1988</xref>:82). To the extent that offenders in disadvantaged, high-crime neighborhoods use interpersonal violence to settle their conflicts, our results suggest that the relatively high rates of violent retaliation observed in these neighborhoods are partially due to offenders' unwillingness to enlist the services of the police when victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423107">Jacobs and Wright 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811423107">Loftin 1986</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results may also provide insight into the nature of the victim-offender overlap. One of the most persistent findings in criminological research is that offenders are victimized at a higher rate than nonoffenders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811423107">Lauritsen and Laub 2007</xref>). Some argue that criminals are especially attractive targets because they are perceived to have a low probability of reporting to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811423107">Sampson and Lauritsen 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811423107">Singer 1986</xref>). To the extent that this explanation is true, our findings imply that we should observe a weak relationship between criminal behavioral and victimization in neighborhoods defined by lower levels of serious crime and structural disadvantage—where offenders are more likely to notify the police when victimized—and a stronger relationship in impoverished, high-crime neighborhoods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811423107">Berg and Loeber, 2011</xref>). These ideas suggest a mechanism that may help to unpack the nature of the victim-offender overlap, and therefore warrant additional empirical attention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We wish to thank Janet Lauritsen and Richard Wright for their constructive comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn15-0022427811423107"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn16-0022427811423107"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a dissertation fellowship provided by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation to the first author, and by grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (2005-JK- FX-0011).</p></fn></fn-group><notes><fn-group><title>Notes</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0022427811423107"><label>1.</label><p>One study has examined the relationship between self-reported offending and victimization reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427811423107">Sparks, Genn, and Dodd 1977</xref>).

These estimates do not rely on the model being properly specified or the model residuals being independent of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811423107">Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2008</xref>). Our findings (available upon request) were substantively the same as those presented here. Second, the results could be subject to selection bias, which is more difficult to manage. Victims are not a random sample of the population; therefore, our models estimate the effects of our covariates on the probability of reporting for males who have been the victim of robbery or assault. Excluding nonvictims from the sample may lead to sample selection bias even though we are only interested in victims (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811423107">Berk 1983</xref>). Such bias will occur when the disturbances for the selection process (i.e., victimization) are correlated with the disturbances from the substantive process of interest (i.e., reporting). To adequately address this issue, we would require identifying a valid exclusion restriction (i.e., a variable that predicts victimization but not reporting; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811423107">Bushway, Johnson, and Slocum 2007</xref>). Moreover, the results from such a model would no longer be comparable to those in the research literature, which exclusively uses subsets of victims. While selection bias is an important issue, we do not have the data necessary to adequately address this issue here.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0022427811423107"><label>8.</label><p>Due to the low prevalence of certain offenses, we do not have sufficient power to examine if the findings varied according to offense type. Instead, we collapsed the 10 offenses into two variables: “violence” and “property/drug offenses,” which were constructed as offending variety scores. We estimated two sets of models that were identical to those noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811423107">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811423107">3</xref>; the offending variables were added separately because of their relatively high correlation. The results for each set of models—estimating direct and interaction effects—were similar to those generated here based on the overall offending variety score, but the effects of violence on reporting were slightly weaker relative to the effects of property/drug offenses. Furthermore, to gain a better sense of the role of drug dealing in shaping the relationship between offending and reporting, we created a binary term to assess whether the victim sold drugs in the past year. The drug dealing variable was then added to the main and interaction effects models. The results from both models showed that drug dealing had a negative effect on reporting, although it was not significant at α = .05. Moreover, the substantive results remained unchanged and offending retained a negative, significant relationship with reporting though the effect was somewhat attenuated. These results suggest the offending-reporting link is not explained by drug dealers' reluctance to call the police when victimized while dealing.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0022427811423107"><label>9.</label><p>Additional analysis indicated that neighborhood disadvantage had a significant negative relationship with reporting when crime rates were omitted from the model 4 (<italic>b</italic> = −1.39, <italic>p</italic> = .047).

Therefore, in a supplemental set of analyses, we added a squared term for disadvantage and neighborhood crime rates to examine if these effects are curvilinear. None of the squared terms were significant.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0022427811423107"><label>11.</label><p>The interaction terms were not jointly modeled because they were strongly correlated with one another; moreover, combining the terms in a single model did not improve fit based on likelihood ratio tests comparing a model with a single term and a model with both terms.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0022427811423107"><label>12.</label><p>Prior to estimating the models with the interaction terms, we mean centered all the model variables with the exception of the binary indicators.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-0022427811423107"><label>13.</label><p>Because individuals living in impoverished neighborhoods are likely to be poor, it is possible that the significant interaction we observe might be partially attributable to a significant interaction between SES and offending. To examine this possibility, we reestimated model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811423107">Table 3</xref>, substituting individual-level SES for neighborhood disadvantage in the interaction term. This interaction term was not significant, which suggests that it is neighborhood disadvantage, rather than individual-level poverty, that conditions the effect of offending on reporting. We also conducted additional checks to make sure the model was properly specified. We examined whether either of the neighborhood context variables moderated the effect of any of our key independent variables (police contact, peer delinquency, attitudes toward violence and lifestyle). None of these interactions were significant.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-0022427811423107"><label>14.</label><p>It should be noted that we cannot rule out the possibility that contextual variability in the offending-reporting relationship may be due to unmeasured differences across neighborhoods in either the nature of offenders' illegal behavior or their victimization incidents. For example, if offenders in high crime, disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely than offenders in other communities to be victimized while offending, they may be less likely to report their victimization to the police (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427811423107">Zavala 2010</xref>). Future work should explore this issue using more detailed offending and victimization data.</p></fn></fn-group></notes><app-group><app id="app1-0022427811423107"><title>Appendix Description of Scales</title><table-wrap id="table4-0022427811423107" position="float"><graphic alternate-form-of="table4-0022427811423107" xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811423107-table4.tif"/><table><tbody><tr><td>Variable Name and Item Statements</td></tr><tr><td>Acceptance of violence (mean score scale): How wrong do you think it is for someone to</td></tr><tr><td>(1) “hit someone with the idea of hurting that person?”<break/>(2) “attack someone with a weapon or with the idea of seriously hurting that person?”<break/>(3) “use a weapon, force, or strong-arm methods to get money or things from people?”</td></tr><tr><td>Responses:</td><td>Very wrong</td><td>Wrong</td><td>A little wrong</td><td>Not wrong</td><td/><td>α = .90</td></tr><tr><td>Peer Offending (mean score scale): During the past year how many of your friends have:</td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>“hit someone with the idea of hurting that person?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“attacked someone with a weapon or with the idea of seriously hurting that person?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“used a weapon, force, or strong-arm methods to get money or things from people?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“stolen something worth more than $100?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“sold hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine, or Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)?”</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td>Responses:</td><td>None of them</td><td>Half of them</td><td>Most of them</td><td>All of them</td><td/><td>α = .88</td></tr><tr><td>Offending (variety score scale): In that past year have you:</td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>“stolen or tried to steal something worth between $50 and $100?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“stolen or tried to steal something worth more than $100?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“gone joyriding, that is, taken a motor vehicle, such as a car or motorcycle, for a ride or drive without the owner’s permission?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“knowingly bought, sold or held stolen goods or tried to do any of these things?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“gone into or tried to go into a building to steal something?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“sold hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine, or LSD?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>”sold marijuana or hashish?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“used a weapon, force, or strong-arm methods to get money or things from people?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>”attacked someone with a weapon or with the idea of seriously hurting or killing them?”</p></list-item><list-item><p>“hit someone with the idea of hurting them”</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td>Responses:</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></app></app-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0022427811423107"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Elijah</given-names></name></person-group>. <year>1999</year>. <source>Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City</source>. <publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Norton</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0022427811423107"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avakame</surname><given-names>Edem F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fyfe</surname><given-names>James J.</given-names></name><name><surname>McCoy</surname><given-names>Candace</given-names></name></person-group>. <year>1999</year>. <article-title>“Did You Call the Police?
