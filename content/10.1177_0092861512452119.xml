            <p>Electronic data management is becoming important to reduce the overall cost and run-time of clinical trials with enhanced data quality. It is also imperative to meet regulated guidelines for the overall quality and safety of electronic clinical trials. The purpose of this paper is to develop an exploratory performance evaluation framework for e-clinical data management. This study performs a Delphi survey for 3 iterative rounds to develop an exploratory framework based on key informants’ knowledge. Four key metrics in the areas of infrastructure, intellectual preparation, study implementation, and study completion covering major aspects of clinical trial processes are proposed. Performance measures evaluate the extent of regulation compliance, data quality, cost, and efficiency of the electronic data management process. They also provide measurement indicators for each evaluation item. Based on the key metrics, the performance evaluation framework is developed in three major areas involved in clinical data management—clinical site, monitoring, and data coordinating center. From this initial attempt to evaluate the extent of electronic data management in clinical trials by a Delphi survey, further empirical studies are planned and recommended.</p>

         <title>1. Background and Purpose</title>
         <p>In the past decade, the clinical trials market has grown in practice of evidence-based medicine. Along with this, there is a trend toward increasing investment in clinical research and reinforcement of system development. As the scope of clinical trials extends to a global setting and more safety issues are required, more cost-effective approaches are necessary. The utilization of electronic data management systems is the reason for this. Research<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452119">1</xref>
            </sup> shows that electronically integrated data management can lead to high performance in the clinical trials industry along with its evolvement over time. Electronic data management systems play a particularly important role in their support by highly efficient and cost-effective data management with enhanced data quality.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512452119">2</xref>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>In reality, the Korean clinical trial market does not deeply recognize the important role of electronic data management. This is supported by the fact that there have been few academic studies related to electronic data management among studies on clinical trials while relatively low attention has been paid to data management in practical fields. Although the quality of clinical trials is considered to be critical to the successful achievement of trials, there has been little consideration of the influence of data management on the quality of clinical trials. Electronic data management is still considered as a mere tool to meet the target timeline of trials.</p>
         <p>E-clinical data management refers to the management of clinical data led by computerized systems in clinical trials, which are represented by electronic data capture (EDC) systems.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512452119">2</xref>
            </sup> Clinical sites are able to key in data while both data error checks and corrections can be simultaneously performed by data managers or monitors before completion of all data entry. This process nourishes and strengthens clinical trial processes and supports high performance in clinical data management. Electronic data management is becoming increasingly important to reduce the overall cost and run-time of clinical trials as well as to enhance data quality.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512452119">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452119">4</xref>
            </sup> It is also necessary to meet regulated guidelines for the overall quality and safety of electronic clinical trials.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512452119">5</xref>
            </sup> However, there are few rigorous standards that cover the “overall” clinical data management with EDC system utilization, although there are practical assessment tools in each pharmaceutical company basis or in the specific areas of evaluation concerns.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512452119">5</xref>

            </sup> Therefore, it is necessary to examine the intrinsic role of electronic data management by developing a performance evaluation framework.</p>
         <p>This study provides implications for an initial attempt to evaluate the extent of electronic data management in clinical trials. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a performance evaluation framework in electronic clinical trial data management based on a literature and expert review in the industry. As part of the framework, this study proposes a set of key metrics that cover the major aspects of electronic data management in clinical trial processes. The declaration of each measure with the evaluation framework reveals important values to pursue in clinical trials—efficiency, data quality, cost, and regulatory compliance. In this study, a comprehensive framework is suggested to evaluate major aspects of e-clinical data management performance with a holistic perspective. Performance measures as well as detailed measurement indicators of a performance evaluation framework for e-clinical data management are proposed.</p>

            <p>Three rounds of iterative surveys with 6 key informants were performed in August and September 2011; from August 25 through September 5; September 14 through 23; and September 26 through 30. Each question about performance categories, measures, and measurement indicators requires the levels of importance and current status score in a 5-point Likert scale. Open questions were asked for additional expert opinions. In completing each round, a content analysis was conducted through the rating scale method to apply to the next survey, integrating similar items and eliminating redundant content. Mean and standard deviation were calculated per each item in scoring the levels of importance and current status by an interval scale.</p>

            <title>3.1 Key Metrics</title>
            <p>Four key metrics are categorized according to the e-clinical data management process: infrastructure, intellectual preparation, study implementation, and study completion. A brief description of the e-clinical data management process is as follows. For a study start-up, the project team must ensure that planning, communication, and skills are in place and validation systems are suitable to the study purpose and scope. This leads to protocol development and e-CRF generation based on study protocols. Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) begin to enter data from the time that the first subject is enrolled in a clinical site. While CRCs continue entering data, queries are created by data managers or in relation to clinical research associates (CRAs) so that data modification is handled and resolved in real time. The database is locked with the data managers’ approval in order to ensure no manipulation of study data during the final analysis once all data management activities are completed. To build up the key metrics, measurable and quantifiable performance measures are developed. Measurement indicators are suggested for each measure for evaluation purposes, and in total consist of 4 metrics, 19 performance measures, and 45 measurement indicators. Key metrics developed in this study focus on the “data management” area in clinical trials. The basic format of this study’s metrics for the electronic clinical trial “data management” is based on that of Stanley et al,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512452119">19</xref>
               </sup> which describes the metrics for a clinical trial “study” itself.</p>
            <p>The infrastructure metric refers to the measurement for the groundwork in the e-clinical data management process to provide hardware, software, and human resources. Technology researchers point to both organizational and technological features that thwart adoption of innovations.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512452119">20</xref>
               </sup> The infrastructure metric is measured by a site’s ability in terms of DM skills given their phase, size, resources, and subject population. The infrastructure metrics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512452119">Table 2</xref> with Delphi results of each of three rounds. Every indicator shows a higher score than 3 as a mean, indicating “important” or “extremely important.” This is interpreted as a meaningful value according to the method of Marray et al<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512452119">21</xref>
               </sup> with a 75% positive response rate. The scores of the current status in the Korean industry are lower than those of the importance levels, however.</p>

            <p>The intellectual preparation metric implies the measurement for the preparation of intellectual applications such as clinical study concepts, protocols, e-CRF, and data cleaning ideas. Beyond the level of designing, it checks whether to meet the advanced level by simplifying and standardizing the intellectual preparation process. The issue of simplification and standardardization requires high-level criteria to measure the extent of data management and aims for a strategic viewpoint. As intellectual applications are arranged in a more simplified and standardized manner, an accordingly more efficient and error-free data environment can be achieved. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512452119">Table 3</xref> shows Delphi results of importance with a satisfactory correlation to the data, with lower scores of the current status compared to the levels of importance.</p>

            <p>The study implementation metric refers to the measurement for performance evaluation during clinical study implementation, starting from subject enrollment, data entry in each clinical site, and query management up to database lock. This metric particularly addresses the efficiency and data quality issue in implementing electronic data management. The extent of efficiency is measured in the overall implementation process by rapid enrollment, timeliness of data entry, response to query request, and database lock, due to the utilization of EDC systems. It also measures the level of data quality with the question of data discrepancy management between source data and CRF as well as protocol compliance between protocol and CRF. In this metric, regulatory compliance should also be of interest such as an audit trail and embedment of attributability controls and others. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512452119">Table 4</xref>, the value of “rapid enrollment” shows the largest gap between the levels of importance and the current status scores.</p>

The readiness of DM human resources should generally be checked at the time of groundwork in a clinical site.</p>
               <p>As for the human resources support in a clinical site, it is important to measure the extent of team participation, such as investigator understanding of the use of EDC systems and EDC experience of the investigator and CRC as well as the communication frequency among CRC, CRA, and DM. Furthermore, the level of training and education for CRC such as training depth and length influences the effects of e-clinical data management.<sup>

               <p>Two major managerial concerns during study implementation in a clinical site are efficiency and data quality. The goal toward efficiency can be measured and achieved through rapid enrollment, timely data entry, and timely manual query management. Timely data entry, timely manual query management, and timely database lock measure the extent of reduced time due to EDC systems.<sup>

            <p>In the clinical site performance evaluation framework, the intellectual preparation metric is not of interest. The intellectual application establishing in the intellectual preparation metric is mostly related to monitoring required by the sponsor of the study and data coordinating center. In the measure of protocol development simplification, the degree of verification between source data and e-CRF should be examined. For addressing regulatory compliance in the intellectual preparation metric, authorization also should be controlled for monitoring purposes, thus allowing regulators or sponsors to verify proper user access. Indicators are the degree of system-restricted user permission secured to each access, modification, and management of e-CRF and the extent of authority of electronic signature for electronic records’ accountability.</p>
            <p>The study implementation metric is related to data quality and the regulatory compliance issue in monitoring. While the study implementation metric of the clinical site examines the basic data flow, that of monitoring assesses the close investigation of the clinical site’s DM performance based on regulations. The level of data quality from monitoring activity is measured by data discrepancy management and protocol compliance. Regulation compliance such as audit trail and attributability is another important concern in monitoring.</p>

The intellectual preparation metric in this framework assesses not only the extent of generating functions, but also managerial capacity for more advanced functionality. That is, protocol development simplification examines how much to distinctively utilize reusable as well as unique portions in the format of protocol development.<sup>

         <title>5. Discussion and Conclusion</title>
         <p>The aim of this study is to provide a framework for effective data handling from initial setup to database lock in the clinical data management process to facilitate quality improvement efforts. While there is reasonable understanding of the distinct characteristics of each clinical trial based on its study phase, size, and phase, this study tries to propose a comprehensive framework for general use.</p>
         <p>Some academic and practical considerations regarding the evaluation framework are as follows. First, this study is one of the first attempts to establish a comprehensive performance evaluation framework covering all the major areas of managerial concerns that clinical data management is aimed at. This framework emphasizes specific managerial concerns such as efficiency, data quality, cost, and regulatory compliance to be improved through the overall data management process. For example, if the managerial concern regarding data quality needs to be improved, the e-CRF review in data discrepancy management needs to be concentrated on for improvement. By separately extracting each of 4 managerial concerns, more effective e-clinical data management is possible.</p>
         <p>Second, there are large differences in terms of delivering skills as well as the role and quality of clinical data managers. Therefore, the framework developed in this study can be used as a self-assessment tool for the general requirement skills for e-clinical data management.</p>
         <p>Third, this framework presents the accountability of each DM subprocess from infrastructure building to the study completion stage. For example, the standardized e-CRF generation is of interest to the intellectual preparation stage, not the study implementation stage. Additionally, it identifies the accountability of the DM area in charge. With this framework, data management relevant parties such as clinical site, data coordinating center, and monitoring would be more responsive to study deadlines, regulations, and timely data entry. For example, protocol development simplification is a performance measure under the responsibility of monitoring and the data coordinating center and recommends collaborative work between both centers with relevant responsibility.</p>
         <p>Fourth, we can derive some insights toward the strategic use of e-clinical data management in this framework. Other than a basic evaluation for the operational use of data management such as timely data entry, several performance measures provide strategic viewpoints for high performance. For example, audit-trail embedment in EDC or data discrepancy management addresses the operational level, while protocol development simplification or CDISC standards application in the intellectual preparation metric pertain to the strategic level of data management.</p>
         <p>Fifth, this framework can be utilized for DM strategy. Practical data accumulated from multiple sites will enable comparison of time-serial performance in a single clinical site or comparison of the performance of multiple centers, and thus efficiency and enhanced operation of data management can be anticipated. The accumulated data based on the framework would help establish industry standards to improve performance. Data managers also can selectively customize components of EDC systems depending on their level of electronic data management compared to the industry average.</p>
         <p>Lastly, the following are some recommendations for future studies. First, extension of the scope of data management is suggested. This study covers up to the stage of database lock, but further studies covering up to the stage of data transfer and reporting are necessary for the completion of data management. Second, this is an initial study based on an expert survey. It is recommended that the scope of the survey be broadened under a test of validation and reliability based on statistical verification with a larger population of data managers.</p>
