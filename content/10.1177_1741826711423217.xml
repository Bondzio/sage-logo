<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Ethnic variations in stroke require more European studies, especially as differences are reportedly large.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We created a retrospective cohort study of 4.65 million people in Scotland linking ethnicity from the census and stroke incidence and mortality from NHS databases. Rate ratios using direct age standardization and risk ratios were calculated, the latter to model the influence of educational qualification in a Poisson regression model.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Age-adjusted rate ratios varied little, compared to the White Scottish group (reference value 100) and the 95% CIs usually included 100, e.g. higher in Pakistani men (120.5, 95% CI 95.2–145.8) and in African men (137.9, 95% CI 91.5–184.4) but not in Pakistani or African women. Stroke rates were low in the Other White British (78.3, 95% CI 75.4−81.2 in men and 84.9, 95% CI 82.0−87.8 in women), Other White (89.8, 95% CI 81.5−98.1 in men and 88.8, 95% CI 80.9−96.7 in women) and Chinese men (70.3, 95% CI 45.7−94.8). Adjusting for highest educational qualification attenuated some and augmented other risk ratios, e.g. in Other White British men, the risk ratio changed from 71.4 to 80.2 (95% CI 74.2−86.6) and in African men from 124.2 to 138.8 (95% CI 107.7−178.8).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ethnic variations deserve further study, including in White European origin subgroups and the Chinese. Extremely high rates in South Asian and African origin were not corroborated in Scotland. Linkage methods are practical in Europe.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711423217" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing evidence of large differences in stroke incidence, mortality, and outcomes by indicators of ethnicity, e.g. country of birth, name analysis, and self-reported ethnic group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423217">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711423217">5</xref></sup> Interpretation of such differences requires longitudinal studies of a broader range of ethnic groups but such studies are sparse, particularly in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711423217">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711423217">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In England and Wales, variations in stroke by country of birth are large, e.g. stroke rates are high in African-born populations (typically more than twofold), which have comparatively high blood pressure, and also high in Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations (typically more than twofold in men) with comparatively low blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711423217">7</xref></sup> Inequalities in stroke mortality by country of birth in England and Wales rose between 1981 and 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711423217">8</xref></sup> In Scotland,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711423217">9</xref></sup> residents born in other parts of the UK (predominantly England and Wales) had lower stroke mortality, than those born in Scotland. Crucially, there was no marked excess in India or Pakistan born. Country of birth is an indirect indicator of ethnic group, mortality is an imprecise marker of disease burden, and there are no comprehensive data on stroke incidence by ethnic group in a UK setting. The South London Stroke Register has, however, demonstrated a high incidence of stroke in African Caribbean populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711423217">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>We developed a retrospective cohort study of 4.65 million people in Scotland to help overcome limitations of routine data systems. We illustrate the power of data linkage in studying ethnic variations in the combined incidence of major fatal (community or hospital death) and non-fatal (hospitalization) stroke. Our prior hypothesis was that there would be &gt;10% higher risk in the South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, and other South Asian-including Bangladeshis) and African/Caribbean groups combined (henceforth, African); and &gt;10% lower risk in Chinese. The ethnic group categories and terms are based on the Scottish Census and the concepts and definitions are similar to those in a recent published glossary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711423217">11</xref></sup> We also assessed whether such variations would be attenuated by adjusting using indicators of socioeconomic status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711423217" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Our methods have been published, including issues of ethics and data disclosure approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711423217">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711423217">13</xref></sup> In brief, using computerized matching of names, addresses, dates of birth, and, when available, community health index numbers, we linked the Census 2001 for Scotland (providing self-assigned ethnic group for each household member, i.e. not just country of birth) to the National Community Health Index (CHI), and then to the hospital discharge/deaths database (SMR01) from May 2001 to April 2008. Of the total events, 30.5% were stroke deaths; the remainder were hospitalizations without death. At census, one category is selected from a list of 14 in response to the question ‘What is your ethnic group?’ The category labels are mostly self-explanatory. There is no further guidance, including for the category mixed, where space is given for writing in a response. Because of small population sizes, we combined Bangladeshis with Any Other Asian, and the Caribbean, African, and Any Other Black groups as African origin (henceforth African).</p>
<p>We examined the relationship between eight indicators of socioeconomic position and all cardiovascular disease rates. There were insufficient outcomes to do this for specific outcomes such as stroke. The indicators were: (1) the postcode-based Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation; (2) car ownership; (3) highest qualification of the individual; (4) highest qualification in the household; (5) National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification at individual level; (6) National Statistics Socio-economic Classification at household level; (7) household tenure; and (8) economic activity in the previous week. The indicator that showed the most consistent associations with the outcome across all ethnic groups (10 of 11 ethnic groups for men and all 11 in women) was highest educational qualification of the individual so we used this to explore socioeconomic confounding (manuscript in preparation).</p>
<p>First stroke meant no previous hospital discharge record of stroke or stroke death discovered on a look-back within the last 10 years in the SMR01 database. We used ICD 10 codes I60‐I69 and ICD 9 codes 430–432, 434, and 436. We calculated directly age-standardized (to the Scottish White population structure) first stroke hospital discharge or death rates per year per 100,000 in the population 30 years of age and above, and also rate ratios. We also estimated risk ratios using Poisson regression with robust variance, adjusting for age and highest educational qualification. The Poisson regression models were chosen due to their suitability for analysing frequency data, and the independent variables were selected in advance in order to test our pre-specified hypotheses, i.e. to compare ethnic groups after adjusting for selected confounding factors. Highest educational qualification was only available up to the age of 74 so the latter analyses had less statistical power than the rate ratio analysis. The Disclosure Control Committee ruled that publishing the numerators by ethnic group for both analyses risked inadvertent disclosure of identity. The reduction in cases was less in non-White populations as they were younger. For example in White Scottish men, the number of cases was 24,867 (64.4% of ≥ 30 year olds) and in Pakistani men it was 95 (87.2% of ≥ 30 year olds). We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) around these measures. Ratios were multiplied by 100 for easier interpretation. No other covariates were entered into the model, and interactions were not studied (for lack of statistical power). We focus on results where the 95% CI excludes the reference value of 100, unless stated otherwise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711423217" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of 4.9 million census records, 95.5% were matched to community health index records providing data for 4.65 million people. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711423217">Table 1</xref> shows that ethnic variations in stroke hospitalization/mortality compared to the White Scottish group were modest and mostly the 95% CIs included 100, e.g. African men had a rate ratio of 137.9. Comparatively low age-adjusted rate ratios were seen in Other White British (78.3), Other White (89.8), and Chinese men (70.3). Ethnic variations in women were similar to men, e.g. Other White British, Other White, Indian, and Chinese women had comparatively low age-adjusted rate ratios, although the 95% CIs included 100 for the latter two groups. However, African women were no different to the standard population (98.7, 95% CI upper limit of 146.1).

<p>Linkage methods offer opportunities in stroke epidemiology wherever a database giving ethnic group is available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711423217">15</xref></sup> Ethnic variations were modest in Scotland, in line with our prior country of birth analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711423217">9</xref></sup> with no evidence in the age-adjusted analyses of doubling or more of risk in African, Indian, and Pakistani populations compared to the standard (the upper bands of the 95% confidence intervals of the rate ratio exclude this).

Of our prior hypotheses on ethnic variations, the only one clearly supported was ≥10% lower risk in Chinese, albeit only in men. Our hypothesis that ethnic variations in stroke might reflect differences in socioeconomic status was not supported ‐ after adjustment for education some differences were attenuated but not abolished, others augmented. A single indicator probably leaves residual confounding but our exploratory analysis develops methods and points to potential results once cross-ethnically valid socioeconomic confounders are developed. Currently, this is an area under development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423217">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711423217">19</xref></sup> although education is a promising candidate in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423217">20</xref></sup> including one linking to the census.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711423217">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study's strengths include its size, relatively novel and efficient methods, population coverage, use of ethnicity rather than country of birth, and data on both absolute and relative risks and on a broad range of ethnic groups. In Scotland, with a free NHS at the point of use and policies in favour of hospitalization of stroke, virtually all non-fatal cases are admitted. Diagnostic precision for cardiovascular outcomes is high, with 95% CI correct in an evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711423217">21</xref></sup> We acknowledge our study's limitations, e.g. the numbers of cases are small in most non-White minority groups but sufficient to show important patterns that can be interpreted using confidence intervals. In some groups such as African women, our findings of little difference may be lack of study power but the upper limit of the 95% CI helps interpretation. There may be undercounts of outcomes, we cannot differentiate ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, and we have no data on risk factors. Our assessment of first stroke is based on a 10-year ‘look-back’ from the index event within our database (SMR01). This does not include strokes prior to that, strokes outside Scotland, and strokes that were not hospitalized. We do not know whether look-back time was equivalent across ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The methods and results are of potential importance to public health strategy and surveillance and they call for replicate studies elsewhere.</p>
<p>Our findings draw attention to variations within the ethnic subgroups of the White population ‐often ignored, to the detriment of this ethnic group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711423217">22</xref></sup> Understanding why some populations resident in Scotland fare well (other UK born – predominantly in England and Wales, and the Chinese) may inform future stroke prevention strategies. Public health goals and interventions are aided by the availability of a standard to achieve, and also understanding among policy makers, health professionals, and the public that the standard is achievable. The standard, logically, should be the population with the lowest achievable rate of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711423217">23</xref></sup> The population providing this can also be compared with other populations to generate ideas (hypotheses) for both research and practical action. In this instance all populations, including the White Scottish majority, might seek to achieve the low rates of stroke seen in the Chinese and in Other White British, most probably through control of cardiovascular risk factors, which are known to be low in the Chinese in the UK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711423217">24</xref></sup> although few data are available in Scotland. In Glasgow, self-reported data were collected at interview with 350 Chinese people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711423217">25</xref></sup> Compared with the overall Glasgow population, Chinese smoked less (14% vs. 33%), fewer drank alcohol (37% vs. 70%), were more likely to eat the recommended level of fruit and vegetable (54% vs. 34%), and fewer were overweight (16% vs. 43%). However, Chinese were less likely to meet the target for physical activity (34% vs. 58%). These kind of observations can be utilized to underpin a prevention strategy suitable for a multiethnic population, yet beneficial to all. Ethnicity needs to be incorporated into the European equity lens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711423217">26</xref></sup></p>
