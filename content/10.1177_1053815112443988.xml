<abstract>
<p>Participation in home, school, and community activities is a primary outcome of early intervention services for children with disabilities and their families. The objectives of this study were to (a) describe participation of preschool-age children with cerebral palsy (CP); (b) determine effects of sex, age, and gross motor function on intensity of participation; and (c) identify child, family, and service determinants of intensity of participation. A convenience sample of 85 preschool-age children with CP and their parents participated. Parents completed self-report measures on children’s participation, adaptive behavior, physical function, family functioning, and services. Children’s Gross Motor Function Classification System levels (Palisano, Rosenbaum, Bartlett, &amp; Livingston, 2008) were determined by assessors. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the variance in intensity of participation explained by the determinants. Children with limited self-mobility had a lower intensity of participation than children with independent upright mobility. Adaptive behavior, transfers and basic mobility function, and upper extremity and physical function explained 46% of the variance of intensity of participation.</p>

<p>Participation in home, school, and community activities is a primary outcome of early intervention services for preschool-age children with disabilities and their families. Through participation, children learn skills, form friendships, attain mental and physical health, express creativity, and develop self-identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053815112443988">G. King, Law, King, Rosenbaum, et al., 2003</xref>). The Division for Early Childhood of the Council for Exceptional Children and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053815112443988">DEC/NAEYC, 2009</xref>) advocate for practices in early childhood services that promote inclusion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Early childhood inclusion embodies the values, policies, and practices that support the right of every infant and young child and his or her family, regardless of ability, to participate in a broad range of activities and contexts as full members of families, communities, and societies. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Early intervention for preschool-age children is intended to support children’s development, early learning, and engagement in daily life. To promote participation, interventions and supports are embedded within typically occurring activities, routines, and relationships with peers and adults.</p>
<p>Participation is a complex construct, broadly defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), as involvement in life situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053815112443988">World Health Organization, 2001</xref>). Research in early intervention has focused on identifying the various family and community activities in which young children participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053815112443988">Dunst, Bruder, Trivette, Raab, &amp; McLean, 2001</xref>). These activities include family routines (household chores and errands), caregiving routines (bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, bedtime), family rituals and celebrations (holidays, birthdays, religious events), outdoor activities (gardening, visits to park/zoo), social activities (visiting friends, play groups), play activities (physical play and play with toys), and learning activities (listening to stories, looking at books/pictures). For preschool-age children with motor disabilities, researchers in Project Participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053815112443988">Rosenberg, Clark, Filer, Hupp, &amp; Finkler, 1992</xref>) examined a decision-making process to support participation that accounted for children’s developmental abilities and recognized interventions focused on the child, task, or environment.</p>
<p>Young children with cerebral palsy (CP) are likely to be identified and referred for early intervention. CP is a complex condition characterized by wide variation in motor function. In addition to the disorder in development of posture and movement, children with CP often have limitations in sensation, perception, cognition, communication, behavior, and other health conditions that influence activity and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053815112443988">Rosenbaum, Paneth, Leviton, Goldstein, &amp; Bax, 2007</xref>). Young children with CP have been reported to receive the greatest number of individual services and to require more specialized interventions compared with other children being served in early intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053815112443988">National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053815112443988">Shonkoff, Hauser-Cram, &amp; DiPietro, 1993</xref>). An understanding of participation of preschool-age children with CP in home, school, and community activities would assist families and professionals to identify resources, supports, and strategies to optimize outcomes for participation in home and community life.</p>

<title>Participation of Preschool-Age Children With CP</title>
<p>For preschool-age children with physical disabilities, little is known about participation in home and community activities specifically related to recreation, socialization, and learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053815112443988">Ehrmann, Aeschleman, and Svanum (1995)</xref> reported that young children with disabilities participated in fewer community activities than children without disabilities, especially family leisure and recreational activities. The Pre-Elementary Education Longitudinal Study (PEELS; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053815112443988">Carlson, Bitterman, &amp; Daley, 2010</xref>) of children receiving preschool special education services found that 3% to 50% of the children participated in various extracurricular activities such as recreational programs, art classes, and music lessons.</p>
<p>The ICF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053815112443988">World Health Organization, 2001</xref>) provides a conceptual framework for understanding health and well-being of children with CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053815112443988">Palisano, Snider, &amp; Orlin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053815112443988">Rosenbaum &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>). Based on the ICF, <italic>participation</italic> (what a child actually does) is complex and multidimensional, influenced by activity (what a child is able to do, such as motor abilities), <italic>personal</italic> characteristics of the child (such as motivation), and <italic>environmental</italic> factors (such aspects of the family and community services).</p>
<p>Child age, sex, and functional abilities; family preferences and functioning; and environmental accessibility, supports, and social attitudes are likely to influence participation of children with CP and other physical disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053815112443988">Imms, Reilly, Carlin, &amp; Dodd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053815112443988">Shikako-Thomas, Majnemer, Law, &amp; Lach, 2008</xref>). For children receiving preschool special education services, family income, transportation, and perception of neighborhood safety have been related to amount of community participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053815112443988">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>). For school-age children with CP, gross motor function, cognition, communication, adaptive behavior, enjoyment from participation, age, family functioning, parent stress, family activity orientation, and involvement in rehabilitation services have been associated with participation in leisure and recreational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053815112443988">Majnemer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1053815112443988">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Early intervention providers are advised against generalizing the findings of studies on participation for school-age children with CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053815112443988">Majnemer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 2011</xref>) to preschool-age children with CP because the nature and context of participation may be different during this early and sensitive period in development. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to gain an understanding of the range of daily recreational, leisure, and learning activities in which preschool-age children from age 3 to 6 with CP participate. The specific research questions of this prospective cross-sectional study were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1053815112443988" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Research Question 1:</italic> What are the types and amount of recreational, leisure, and learning activities in which preschool-age children with CP participate?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Research Question 2:</italic> Does amount of participation in recreational, leisure, and learning activities of preschool-age children with CP differ by sex, age, and gross motor abilities?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Research Question 3:</italic> What aspects of the child, family, and services contribute to the amount of participation?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The results have implications for early intervention services to optimize home, school, and community participation of preschool-age children with CP.</p>

<title>Participant</title>
<p>A sample of convenience was recruited from six Shriners Hospitals for Children and one Children’s Rehabilitation Center. All hospital Institutional Review Boards approved the study and parents or guardians provided informed consent. All children with CP receiving services at one of the seven hospitals were eligible for the study if they did not have a concomitant illness or health condition that might affect participation. A total of 85 young children with CP, 50 boys and 35 girls, and their caregivers participated in this study. The children ranged in age from 3 to &lt;6 years (<italic>M</italic> = 4.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.8). Children varied in gross motor abilities based on the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 2008</xref>). Caregivers were primarily mothers (88%) and included fathers, grandparents, and guardians. Because 93% of caregivers were mothers and fathers, we refer to the participants as parents. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053815112443988">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053815112443988">2</xref> provide demographic information for the children and parents, respectively.</p>

<title>Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation</title>
<p>The research version of the Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053815112443988">Petrenchik et al. (2006)</xref> to measure participation in voluntary, day-to-day activities by children ages 2 years to 5 years 11 months. The Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation is conceptually similar to the Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053815112443988">G. King, Law, King, Hurley, et al., 2004</xref>), which is designed for completion by children 6 to 21 years old. The Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation is completed by parent report and includes 45 activities, categorized into play activities (9 items, e.g., “doing pretend or imaginary play”), skill development (15 items, e.g., “helping around the house”), active physical recreation (10 items, e.g., “riding a bicycle, tricycle, or scooter”), and social activities (11 items, e.g., “going to a party”). Activities appropriate for children less than 6 years old were taken directly or modified from the CAPE. Activities then were added to reflect the interests of young children between 2 and 5 years of age.</p>
<p>For each activity, a parent indicates whether the child did that activity during the previous 4 months. If the activity was done, how often the activity was done in the previous 4 months is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>1 time</italic>; 2 = <italic>2 times</italic>; 3 = <italic>1 time a month</italic>; 4 = <italic>2-3 times a month</italic>; 5 = <italic>1 time a week</italic>; 6 = <italic>2-3 times a week</italic>; 7 = <italic>1 time a day or more</italic>). Two dimensions of participation are scored: diversity and intensity. The diversity score is the number of activities performed during the previous 4 months. The intensity score reflects how often activities were done and is calculated by adding the “how often” scores for the activities performed and dividing by 45, the total number of activities. The total intensity score varies from 0 to 7.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053815112443988">Petrenchik et al. (2005)</xref> examined internal consistency of items and the percentage of parents who reported that their child performed each activity using a convenience sample of 54 children without developmental disabilities. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .87 for all items and varied from .60 to .71 for the four activity types, indicating acceptable internal consistency. Parents reported that five activities were done by 100% of the children (playing with toys, drawing or coloring, watching TV, listening to stories, and reading/looking at books). The five activities reported for the fewest number of children (6%-22%) were “participating in community organizations,” “doing team sports,” “taking music lessons,” “gardening,” and “doing gymnastics.” The overall mean diversity score was 33.5 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.0) and the mean intensity score was 4.1 (<italic>SD</italic> = .7). In our study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .88 for all items.</p>

<p>The GMFCS has evidence of content, construct, and discriminative validity, and interrater reliability. Content and construct validity were determined by nominal group and Delphi survey consensus methods involving an international sample of 48 professionals with expertise in CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 1997</xref>). Discriminant validity is supported by the creation of five distinct motor development curves for children with CP, one for each GMFCS level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053815112443988">Rosenbaum et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053815112443988">Palisano, Cameron, Rosenbaum, Walter, and Russell (2006)</xref> provided evidence of stability of the GMFCS. A total of 610 children with CP were assessed an average of 4.3 times at 6- or 12-month intervals. In all, 73% of the children remained in the same GMFCS level for all ratings. For children less than 6 years old, the weighted kappa coefficient between the first and last ratings was .84, indicating excellent chance-corrected agreement. A kappa coefficient of .75 among 55 therapists who independently classified children in pairs provided evidence of interrater reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to data collection for our study, all research assistants who collected data demonstrated interrater reliability using a criterion videotape. After instruction in the GMFCS, each research assistant classified a minimum of 11 children and demonstrated a percentage agreement of greater than 80% with the criterion levels. Percentage agreement with the reference levels varied from 82% to 100%.</p>

<title>Coping Inventory</title>
<p>The Coping Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053815112443988">Zeitlin, 1985</xref>) is a 48-item measure designed to assess adaptive behavior of children and youth from 3 to 16 years of age. This measure can be completed by parents, caregivers, teachers, and clinicians based on their familiarity and observation of the child. The items are grouped into two categories: Coping With Self (24 items), behaviors used for meeting personal needs; and Coping With Environment (24 items), behaviors used for interacting with the environment. Each category has three dimensions: (a) Productive: degree that behaviors achieve what a child wants; (b) Active: degree of initiation and persistence; and (c) Flexible: degree of adaptability. Sample items include “Child initiates actions to get needs met,” and “Child is aware of and reacts to cues and moods of other people.” Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>the behavior is not effective</italic>; 5 = <italic>the behavior is effective most of time</italic>). A summary score, the Adaptive Behavior Index, is the average of self-score and environment score. In this study, the full scale Adaptive Behavior Index was used, in which higher scores indicate more effective adaptive behavior.</p>
<p>The Coping Inventory was field-tested with more than 1,000 children, some of whom had typical development and some of whom had various developmental disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053815112443988">Zeitlin, 1985</xref>). Internal consistency ranged from .84 to .98 and interrater reliability ranged from .78 to .92. The measure shows evidence of discriminant validity, with children classified with various types of disabilities having lower Adaptive Behavior Index scores than children with typical development.</p>

<title>Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI)</title>
<p>The PODCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053815112443988">Daltroy, Liang, Fossel, &amp; Goldberg, 1998</xref>) is a measure of health and physical functioning for children 2 to 18 years of age. For children below 10 years of age, the measure is completed by parents. The PODCI has five scales: Upper Extremity and Physical Function, Transfers and Basic Mobility, Sports and Physical Functioning, Pain/Discomfort, and Happiness. A global score can be calculated from the mean of the first four scales. In our study, to measure physical activity, three scales were used: Upper Extremity and Physical Function (8 items: e.g., “Write with a pencil”), Transfers and Basic Mobility (11 items: e.g., “Get on and off a toilet or chair”), and Sports and Physical Functioning (12 items: e.g., “Run short distances”). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale related to how easy or hard it is for the child to do the activity. Total scores for each scale vary from 0 to 100. Internal consistency of the measure was higher than .80 for all parent-report scales and test–retest reliability ranged from .71 to .97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053815112443988">Daltroy et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Family Environment Scale (FES)</title>
<p>The FES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053815112443988">Moos &amp; Moos, 2002</xref>) is a 90-item self-rated measure of current family functioning in relationships, personal growth, and system maintenance. The FES includes 10 subscales: Cohesion, Expressiveness, Conflict, Independence, Achievement Orientation, Intellectual/Cultural Orientation, Active/Recreational Orientation, Moral/Religious Emphasis, Organization, and Control. Each item is presented as a statement that is rated as true or false as it pertains to the respondent’s family. In our study, the standard scores were analyzed for Cohesion (e.g., “Family members really help and support one another.”), Conflict (e.g., “We fight a lot in our family.”), Organization (e.g., “Activities in our family are pretty carefully planned.”), Intellectual/Cultural Orientation (e.g., “Learning about new and different things is very important in our family.”), and Active/Recreational Orientation (e.g., “Everyone in our family has a hobby or two.”). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053815112443988">Moos and Moos (2002)</xref> reported that the internal consistency of items for each subscale varied from .61 to .78 and test–retest reliability varied from .54 to .91.</p>

<title>Measures of processes of care (MPOC)</title>
<p>The MPOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053815112443988">S. King, King, &amp; Rosenbaum, 2004</xref>) is a self-report measure of parents’ perceptions of the care delivered by health care professionals over the past year. The short 20-item version of the MPOC was used. The measure includes five scales: Enabling and Partnership (3 items), Providing General Information (5 items), Providing Specific Information (3 items), Coordinated and Comprehensive Care (4 items), and Respectful and Supportive Care (5 items). The scales analyzed were Providing General Information (e.g., “Have information available about your child’s disability”) and Coordinated and Comprehensive Care (e.g., “People . . . plan together so they are all working in the same direction”). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale (7 = <italic>to a very great extent</italic>; 1 = <italic>not at all</italic>). Parents are instructed to provide a global rating for all the people who serve their children rather than rate a single person or organization. Test–retest reliability intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .81 to .86 and internal consistency of the measure was higher than .80 for the two scales used in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053815112443988">S. King, King, et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the Coordinated and Comprehensive Scale has been shown to differentiate the service delivery among programs for three different groups of children and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053815112443988">S. King, King, et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Service Delivery Questionnaire</title>
<p>We developed the Service Delivery Questionnaire to assess accessibility, responsiveness, and coordination of health care, educational, and community services. The question analyzed for this study was, “The degree that services meet the child’s needs related to participation in daily activities.” The question was rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = <italic>completely</italic>; 1 = <italic>not at all</italic>). Because the outcome of this study was the child’s participation, we believed that the most relevant service factor was the parent’s perception of whether services were meeting their needs in this regard. We have investigated the test–retest reliability of a similar score, “The degree services meet the child’s needs related to gross motor function and participation in self-care and play activities,” with 17 parents of young children with CP and found acceptable reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient of .61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053815112443988">Chang &amp; Chiarello, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>At each hospital, data were collected by one to three research assistants. The majority of the research assistants were health professionals experienced in serving children with CP and their families and all were selected to collect data based on their positive interpersonal and communication skills. Prior to data collection, the research assistants received a procedural manual and attended a 2-day training workshop. To ensure data fidelity, research assistants participated in teleconferences scheduled at 3-month intervals and attended a second workshop held at the midpoint of data collection. The research assistants determined the children’s GMFCS levels after observing the child’s mobility and confirming daily activity performance with the parent. Parents completed a family demographic form and six self-report measures: Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation, Coping Inventory, PODCI, FES, MPOC, and Service Delivery Questionnaire. The measures were completed using either a laptop computer that displayed each item and response option or using the paper form for each measure. Authors of the various measures gave us permission to display the measures on the laptop screen. The exact content of the items was retained. A research assistant was present to answer questions and provide assistance if needed. If a measure was not completed on-site, parents were given a copy of the measure and had the option to complete it at home and return by mail or to complete it by a telephone interview. All parents completed the Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation at the hospital during their child’s outpatient clinic appointment or inpatient hospital stay. Between 75% and 100% of parents completed each of the other measures on-site. The percentage of parents completing each measure varied from 91% to 100%. With the exception of family income, which some parents chose not to provide, some measures were not completed by up to 9% of the participants due to time constraints during their clinic appointment and inability to subsequently collect the data through the mail or a telephone interview.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for Windows software program, version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, United States). Descriptive statistics for diversity and intensity of participation and child, family, and service variables were computed. Because the intensity of participation scores was not normally distributed, the effects of age (3, 4, and 5 years) and GMFCS level (I, II/III, and IV/V) on intensity of participation were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA. Children classified in GMFCS Levels II and III and children classified in Levels IV and V were grouped, respectively, for statistical analysis based on findings that children in these levels demonstrated similar intensity of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053815112443988">Orlin et al., 2010</xref>). Examination of the effects of sex and post hoc multiple comparison tests were performed using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. An alpha level of .05 was used for primary analyses and .02 for post hoc analyses.</p>
<p>A sequential multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the variance in intensity of participation explained by the determinants. Based on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053815112443988">Bronfenbrenner, 1977</xref>), child variables were entered in the first model, subsequently followed by family variables in the second model, and service variables in the third model. Spearman or Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relations between child, family, and service variables and the relation between each predictor variable and intensity of participation. Variables selected for the regression analysis met the following criteria: (a) magnitude of correlation with intensity of participation ≥.20, and (b) magnitude of intercorrelation with other determinants &lt;.80. These criteria were selected to identify predictor variables with at least a small relation with intensity of participation and to minimize multicollinearity. The regression analysis included only the first model (child variables) because no family and service variables met the criteria for inclusion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Participation is a primary outcome of early intervention services; yet, little is known about participation in home, school, and community activities of preschool-age children with CP. The purpose of our study was to gain an understanding of the types of recreational, leisure, and learning activities that preschool-age children, 3 to 6 years old, with CP participate in and how often they do so. We also were interested in identifying aspects of the child, family, and services that contribute to the amount of participation. An understanding of the types and amount of participation done by young children with CP and the aspects of the child, family, and service that enable participation have important implications to guide early intervention service providers in how best to support participation in daily life.</p>
<p>Preschool-age children with CP participated in a variety of recreation, leisure, and learning activities. The activities done by almost all the children (e.g., playing with toys, listening to stories, drawing, or coloring) require minimal preparation by parents or children and involve materials that are readily accessible. Many of these activities, however, are sedentary and may not provide opportunities for movement experiences. The activities done by the smallest percentage of children (e.g., taking swimming lessons, doing gymnastics, playing team sports) may reflect that culturally many preschoolers are not yet participating in individual or group lessons. However, it is important also to consider that during the preschool years, families of children with CP may be consumed with medical and therapy services, leaving little time for community recreational activities. Families also may not be aware of the availability and accessibility of such programs for children with physical disabilities. Preschool-age children with CP, therefore, may be at a disadvantage for not having the learning opportunities, fitness, recreation, and social experiences afforded by participation in community activities.</p>
<p>Amount of participation in recreation, leisure, and learning activities was similar between girls and boys and among 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children. The finding that intensity of participation did not differ by age may reflect the fairly narrow age range of the children in our study as well as the relatively small sample size in each of the three age groups. Our expectation that children with CP between 5 and 6 years of age would have the highest intensity of participation was not supported. This suggests that, as they near school age, children with CP may not have expanded their participation in recreation and leisure activities possibly due to lack of accessibility, competing needs related to medical care and early intervention services, or both. Early intervention providers need to be aware that children with CP may not be benefiting from the developmental advantages afforded by inclusion in a diversity of play, family, and community activities.</p>
<p>The greater intensity of participation by preschool-age children with CP who are able to walk on their own most likely represents greater physical ability to self-engage in activities at home, perform activities outside and in the community, and to participate in physical recreational activities. The lower intensity of participation by children with CP with limited self-mobility (GMFCS Levels IV and V) may put them at a disadvantage for participating in the variety and quantity of play and social interactions that are typical of young childhood. Even though mobility and upper extremity function were not significant factors in the final multivariate model, their moderate association with participation warrants consideration. Children’s abilities to perform transfers and their basic mobility (i.e., sitting, standing, walking, and moving from place to place), enable them to explore their environments and engage fully in activities. Upper extremity function provides children the means to manipulate play materials and be creative. Parents of young children with physical disabilities reported that approximately half of their solutions to their children’s problems in daily activities and routines involved assistive technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053815112443988">Kling, Campbell, &amp; Wilcox, 2010</xref>). Powered mobility is one option for families and service providers to consider for children to enable those with limited self-mobility to keep up with peers and access environments to participate in activities. Children as young as 2 years can learn to use powered mobility, and its use has been associated with children’s ability to initiate movement and interactions on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053815112443988">Butler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053815112443988">Dietz, Swinth, &amp; White, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Two aspects of the child, adaptive behavior and physical ability, explained 46% of the variance in intensity of participation in recreation, leisure, and learning activities. Children’s adaptive behavior was the key determinant. Children develop and learn adaptive behaviors as they integrate their cognitive, communication, social/emotional, and motor abilities during real-life situations. Our finding for adaptive behavior is consistent with other reports for school-aged children with CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053815112443988">Majnemer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 2011</xref>) and supports the concept of person-environment interaction as critical for understanding children’s participation. More opportunities for participation may be available for children who, themselves, have more effective strategies to meet their personal needs and interact with their physical and social environments.</p>
<p>The aspects of the family examined in our study were not associated with intensity of participation. This finding is not consistent with that of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053815112443988">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053815112443988">Majnemer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053815112443988">Palisano et al., 2011</xref>). In the PEELS study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053815112443988">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>), community participation was higher in children of families with higher income, better transportation, and a higher perception of neighborhood safety. The participation measure used in our study includes more everyday home activities. Family income, transportation, and perception of neighborhood safety may not be determinants of participation in home-based activities. Although various aspects of family functioning and demographic characteristics were explored, measures more specific to parenting, such as family expectations and supports for their children, may elucidate associations between family ecology and children’s participation.</p>
<p>The degree that services were family centered and met family-perceived needs for their children was not associated with participation of young children with CP. This finding was surprising based on evidence that family-centered care is associated with improvements in children’s developmental skills and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053815112443988">Dunst, Trivette, &amp; Hamby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053815112443988">S. King, Teplicky, King, &amp; Rosenbaum, 2004</xref>). Although parents in our study generally perceived services to be comprehensive and meeting their children’s needs related to participation in daily life, the measures may not have captured the dimension of service essential to supporting children’s participation in recreation, leisure, and learning activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053815112443988">Campbell and Sawyer (2007)</xref> analyzed the content of early intervention sessions and found that the focus in a majority of sessions was on addressing needs related to the child’s disability and learning of skills, rather than optimizing learning through participation in activities or routines. Our current study did not explore types, intensity, and focus of services. Knowledge of these service factors may help to understand aspects of intervention that support children’s participation.</p>
<sec id="section17-1053815112443988">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Preschool-age children with CP may benefit from early intervention services and supports to enable their participation, especially those with limited self-mobility. In collaboration with families, early intervention providers are encouraged to provide opportunities and supports for activities that are more physical in nature to enable children to be active participants and to promote fitness and fun. Physical and occupational therapists and early childhood educators can share information on community recreational programs, offer consultation to dance and swim instructors, and provide services in these natural community environments. Our study supports the current practices in early intervention of ecological assessments and providing services in natural environments. Promoting adaptive behaviors, such as children’s self-awareness, motivation, problem solving, and advocacy, may enhance the ability of children with CP to interact with people and environments and, thus, optimize their function and participation in daily life.</p>
<p>Environmental and task adaptations and use of assistive technology to promote active participation for preschool children with physical disabilities are strategies that were recommended almost two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053815112443988">Rosenberg et al., 1992</xref>). A more recent publication offers a decision-making process for using adaptation interventions to promote participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053815112443988">Campbell, Milbourne, &amp; Wilcox, 2008</xref>). The extent that current early intervention services incorporate these perspectives is unclear. A survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053815112443988">Thomas and Rosenberg (2003)</xref> concluded that “Pediatric physical and occupational therapists may not be practicing at an optimal level in relation to their degree of awareness and consideration of the potential physical, social, and resource barriers that can hinder their pediatric clients’ participation in community” (p. 238). As a first step, we encourage early intervention providers to gain an understanding of family and school routines and to learn about and advocate for recreation and leisure opportunities in the community.</p>
<p>We recommend that services for young children with CP include interventions specifically focused on child and family goals for home, school, and community participation. These interventions are needed to complement interventions aimed at skill development as improvements in abilities may not translate directly to improvements in participation. Participation-focused interventions emphasize real-world experiences that build on child and family strengths and interests. Early intervention providers can collaborate with the child, family, and community agencies to build capacity to optimize children’s inclusion and participation in recreation, leisure, and learning activities.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Limitations of our study design warrant further research to confirm findings and to broaden understanding of participation of children with CP. Research is needed to examine other child, family, and service attributes that may contribute to participation, a complex and multidimensional construct. Given that many preschool activities include fine motor tasks and communication has been identified as a determinant of participation in school-aged children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053815112443988">Majnemer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053815112443988">Raghavendra, Virgo, Olsson, Connell, &amp; Lane, 2011</xref>), studies examining young children’s participation based on a child’s manual and communication abilities may be useful. Other dimensions of participation, such as quality of engagement and satisfaction, should be explored. We sought to explore in our study determinants of intensity of participation in play, family, and community activities. Findings contribute to our understanding that adaptive behavior and physical function are associated with amount of participation.</p>
<p>A recent report on the content analysis of participation for children with disabilities found that participation encompasses being
<disp-quote>
<p>involved in something or with someone, . . . a sense of inclusion, . . . a choice or control over what they are taking part in, . . . and working toward a goal or enhancing their quality of life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053815112443988">Hoogsteen &amp; Woodgate, 2010</xref>, p. 335)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A holistic understanding of participation, including identification of barriers, is needed to support engagement in activities that are meaningful to families and their children.</p>
