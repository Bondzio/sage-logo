<p>This article explores how the London Olympic Bid Committee (LOBC) sought to gain the popular support required for London’s bid for the 2012 Olympic Games by attempting to influence the journalists of the U.K. newspaper with the greatest readership to communicate their discourse to the host urban population. The research draws on Michel Foucault’s concept of discourse to investigate whether and, more importantly, <italic>how</italic> the journalists of <italic>the Sun</italic> articulated the key statements that the LOBC sought to convey to the U.K. public in their coverage of London’s bid for the 2012 Games in order to discover how collusion and tension between the discourses and practices of bid committees and those of journalists affect the statements articulated to the reader.</p>

<p>“Mega-events,” according to Roche, “are large-scale cultural (including commercial and sporting) events which have a dramatic character, mass popular appeal and international significance” (p. 1). This top tier of peripatetic events includes Expos, the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723512455922">Roche, 2000</xref>, p. 2). Since the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee reported that the 1984 Olympic Games generated an economic impact of US$3.9 billion for the state of California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193723512455922">Ziffren, Ueberroth, Usher, &amp; Perelman, 1985</xref>, p. 312), the Olympic Games have been “<italic>the</italic> urban mega-event” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193723512455922">Burbank, Andranovich, &amp; Heying, 2001</xref>, p. 7) for cities attempting to reposition their economic base in the face of deindustrialization, suburbanization, and globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512455922">Liao &amp; Pitts, 2006</xref>, pp. 1242-1243).</p>
<p>Held in a different location every 4 years, the desirability and scarcity of the Games has made Olympic bidding “as competitive as the event itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723512455922">Whitelegg, 2000</xref>, p. 801). This has led to substantial sums of money (London, for example, spent some £28 million on their successful bid for the 2012 Games) being spent on Olympic bids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193723512455922">Walmsley, 2008</xref>, p. 40). Since the 1996 Atlanta Games, which were criticized for their failure to benefit the city, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) no longer accepts bids for Games that are financed completely privately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723512455922">Whitelegg, 2000</xref>, p. 814). The host city’s national government is thus required to accept liability for the Olympic Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723512455922">Baade &amp; Matheson, 2002</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193723512455922">Walmsley (2008)</xref> suggests that bidders can secure the backing required from the government by gaining the support of the host urban population (p. 65). Public opinion is also one of the main criteria by which “candidate cities” are assessed by the IOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193723512455922">IOC, 2011</xref>, p. 97). The Olympics must therefore be legitimized to gain the support of the host urban population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723512455922">Hiller, 2000</xref>, p. 440). A communications campaign is thus used by the bid committee to shore up public backing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723512455922">Theodoraki, 2007</xref>, p. 115). Walmsley suggests that in addition bid committees must “attempt to influence the media coverage that has arguably a stronger influence on public opinion than any other force” (p. 70).</p>
<p>The media does not however simply carry messages passively without agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723512455922">Toohey &amp; Veal, 2007</xref>, p. 145). Yet it has been proposed that in Olympic cities such as Atlanta, Sydney, and Toronto, the media simply presented the statements of the bid committees without any critical scrutiny. As a result, it has been suggested that the domestic media were either co-opted by the bid committees or had their impartiality compromised to gain access and enjoy perks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723512455922">Lenskyj, 2000</xref>, pp. 175-186) or due to their involvement on media advisory committees or as “partners” of the bid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723512455922">Lenskyj, 1996</xref>, pp. 397-405).</p>
<p>This article thus seeks to add to the emerging body of knowledge relating to how collusion and tension between bid committees and the media affects the statements presented to the host urban population through the domestic media coverage of mega-event bids by exploring this issue in the context of London’s bid for the 2012 Olympic Games drawing on Michel Foucault’s concept of discourse.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193723512455922">
<title>Michel Foucault’s Concept of Discourse</title>
<p>The analysis offered below is broadly Foucauldian in nature. According to Foucault, statements—the basic units from which discourses are built—are defined and contextualized by the institution that gives them their “status” in comparison to other statements (p. 115). Yet one of the conditions characteristic of the statement is that of a vacant subject position that “may be filled in certain conditions by various individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault, 2002</xref>, p. 129). This allows the statement to be repetitively articulated by a variety of subjects—in this case Jackie Brock-Doyle, Head of PR and Media for the London Olympic Bid Committee (LOBC), journalists of <italic>the Sun</italic>, politicians, and so on—across numerous surfaces of emergence.</p>
<p>The status of a statement is however “never definite, but modifiable, relative, and susceptible of being questioned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault, 2002</xref>, p. 115). Statements are thus “produce[d], manipulate[d], use[d], transform[ed], exchange[d], combine[d], decompose[d], and recompose[d], and possibly destroyed” in pursuit of particular interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault, 2002</xref>, p. 118). For Foucault, the statement thus “participates in challenge and struggle, and becomes a theme of appropriation or rivalry” (p. 118).</p>
<p>Consequently, a process of institutionalized discursive warfare takes place in which the most dominant statements surrounding a particular topic form a discursive norm or discourse and become <italic>the</italic> way to think or talk about the topic in question. A discourse is therefore characterized by rarity as the limited number of statements that form a pattern and represent a discursive formation is only a small fraction of the numerous dispersion of statements that could have formed the discourse. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault (2002)</xref>, a discourse can thus “be defined as the group of statements that belong to a single system of formation” (p. 121).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0193723512455922" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A qualitative interview was conducted with Jackie Brock-Doyle to identify the discourse that she sought to communicate to the host urban population of the United Kingdom and to establish how she and her team sought to influence the domestic media to articulate that discourse to the U.K. public. To determine whether and, more importantly, <italic>how</italic> the domestic media carried the discourse of the LOBC to the host urban population the study also focused on the U.K. newspaper with the greatest readership—<italic>the Sun</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193723512455922">IPSOS-RSL, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193723512455922">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the electronic database <italic>News UK</italic>, the search <italic>London AND 2012 AND Olympic* AND bid* OR Games</italic> generated 66 articles relating to London’s bid for the 2012 Olympics printed by <italic>the Sun</italic> between May 15, 2003, when London’s decision to bid for the Games was announced, and November 15, 2004, when London’s Candidate City File was submitted to the IOC.</p>
<p>The method of discourse analysis was used to explore the text constructed during the interview with Brock-Doyle and <italic>the Sun</italic>’s coverage of London’s bid. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault (2002</xref>, pp. 119-141), the analysis involved describing the statements that were articulated by Brock-Doyle and <italic>the Sun</italic>, considering why the statements surrounding the bid emerged when they did rather than any of the many alternatives available, and looking for regularities within the statements that could be said to form the discourse of the LOBC and the discourse of <italic>the sun</italic> so that they could be compared to ascertain whether <italic>the Sun</italic> (re)presented, restructured, or challenged the discourse of the LOBC.</p>

<title>“Back the Bid”</title>
<p>During her interview, Jackie Brock-Doyle, Head of PR and Media for the LOBC (hereafter Brock-Doyle), stressed that “public support is vital” to satisfy the criteria of the IOC, who conduct two polls during the bidding period to assess the level of public backing for the Games in each of the countries with a city bidding to host the Olympics. According to Brock-Doyle, the LOBC believed that “some of the cities” bidding for the Games were likely to fare better than London in the IOC’s polls as “Britain is a very slow bird when it comes to supporting big things.” Rather than being “left to the vagaries of an international poll” conducted by the IOC, the LOBC wanted “to build up numbers of people who could physically say: I support this.”</p>
<p>The LOBC sought to gain such backing by instilling the host urban population with “a sense of pride,” she said. Comparing the bid to “a perfume brand,” Brock-Doyle, articulating the key statement that the LOBC sought to convey to the U.K. public, suggested that the Games would “make Britain proud”—if London won against the other major cities bidding for the Games. The domestic communications campaign was thus not only used to foster national pride but to emphasize the fact that London was “up against the rest of the world to win.”</p>
<p>Brock-Doyle explained that although a communications campaign aimed at winning a bid would normally “try to deliver a very singular message,” the LOBC also had “an international theme—“Sport at Heart,” which was about “inspiring the next generation, and inspiring young people to choose sport.” According to Brock-Doyle, this was also “a kind of core narrative” of the bid that “worked well” with the Make Britain Proud campaign that called for the host urban population to “Back the Bid.”</p>
<p>She explained that a range of initiatives were organized around this “call for action”: The LOBC “took a giant flag around the country for people to sign,” there were online campaigns “where people could sign the flag,” and a range of activities were organized in conjunction with partners such as EDF Energy who “did these leap counters that people could jump through to show their support.” The result was that the LOBC “were able to go to Singapore during the bid and say to everybody there that five million people in the UK had actually physically done something to show their support.”</p>
<p>According to Brock-Doyle, the mainstream media in the United Kingdom “played a big role” in helping to gain such support and were “terrific” during the bidding period. In particular, she drew attention to the “amazing support” provided by the BBC and the “strong support” provided by “the big news organizations” that, she said, the LOBC relied “quite heavily” on to take “the message out to people.” Brock-Doyle explained that to gain the backing of the media, it is important to “talk to them, spend time with them, [and] make sure they understand.” With this in mind, she stressed the importance of being “clear, consistent, and open, and honest.”</p>
<p>Brock-Doyle said she believes that it is also “very important to choose moments where you can get all of the media behind. A moment in time to get everybody excited because it does have an impact.” In her view, the LOBC thus “had a very detailed strategy that looked at the specific milestones along the bid journey and [they] set [their] comm[unication]s strategy to support them.” The key moments during the bidding process that were highlighted by Brock-Doyle were the submission of the applicant city questionnaire to the IOC in January 2004 and the submission of the Candidate City File and unveiling of the blueprint of the Games to the host urban population in November of the same year.</p>
<p>The saturation level of <italic>the Sun’</italic>s coverage did indeed increase when the bid reached these milestones. My research thus supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723512455922">Chen’s (1998)</xref> contention that newspaper coverage of Olympic bids increases in saturation at key moments throughout the bidding process (p. 306). The other key milestones in the bid journey indicated by <italic>the Sun</italic>’s increased saturation of coverage are the announcement of London’s decision to bid for the Games in May 2003 and the IOC’s revelation of the cities that had been chosen as “candidates” to host the Games in May 2004.</p>
<p>During these key moments in the bidding process, <italic>the Sun</italic> articulated the LOBC’s statement that the Games will make Britain proud in editorials stating that the Olympics “will be a fantastic opportunity to show the world our vision, enthusiasm, skills, industry, culture and love of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723512455922">“Go for It!” May 16, 2003</xref>, p. 8), or in other words—to the show “the world what a great country we are” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723512455922">“Going for Gold,” January 17, 2004</xref>, p. 6). In addition to the “institutional voice of the newspaper” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723512455922">Keeble, 2001</xref>, p. 96) articulating the LOBC’s statement that the Games will make Britain proud, <italic>the Sun</italic>’s journalists attempted to legitimate the statement by informing readers that “Ministers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512455922">Pascoe-Watson, May 16, 2003</xref>, p. 72) and Olympic medalist Jonathan Edwards shared the same view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723512455922">Orvice, May 16, 2003</xref>, p. 72). Lest such elite opinion fail to sway <italic>the Sun</italic>’s (mostly) working-class readers, journalist Wooding attempted to influence them to back the bid by showing that the same supportive subject position based on the pride associated with staging the Games was occupied by “Jack Dromey, a candidate to lead the giant Transport and General Workers Union,” who was quoted as saying that the Olympics are “a showcase for all that is best in our country and its capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193723512455922">Wooding, May 16, 2003</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>In addition to articulating and legitimating the LOBC’s statement that the U.K. public should Back the Bid because the Games will make Britain proud, <italic>the Sun</italic> presents a number of statements that appear to have been developed from this key statement. These can be listed as follows:</p>
<sec id="section4-0193723512455922">
<title>Back the bid so that “we” as a nation can beat “the French”</title>
<p>Although the Sun suggests that its readers should back the bid because the Games will make Britain proud journalist Pascoe-Watson manipulates the LOBC’s suggestion that the Games will make Britain proud if London wins against the other major cities bidding for the Olympics to construct the bid as a competition between Britain and “a rival French challenge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512455922">Pascoe-Watson, May 15, 2003</xref>, p. 11). Pascoe-Watson however suggests that Tony Blair is gambling “£300 million” on bidding for an event that Britain has little chance of winning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512455922">Pascoe-Watson, May 15, 2003</xref>, p. 11). Yet by constructing the Olympics as a “gift” that “critics” believe will be awarded “to France because of President Jacques Chirac’s opposition to the Iraq war” (given the emphasis on international peace inherent in Olympism) Pascoe-Watson’s article may nevertheless have helped to foster support for the bid by inflecting a spirit of nationalistic rivalry among readers reluctant to be beaten by their French opponents.</p>
<p>Such an approach was also taken by journalist Wooding who explicitly constructed the bid as a “race” between London and Paris, presenting his readers with bookmakers odds for the two cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193723512455922">Wooding, May 16, 2003</xref>, p. 8). The odds on this sporting competition between London and the “the French capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723512455922">Cecil, May 19, 2004</xref>, p. 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723512455922">Orvice, May 17, 2003</xref>, p. 58; the Sun, August 30, 2003, p. 14), or “Britain and France” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723512455922">Cecil, May 19, 2004</xref>, p. 6), were repetitively articulated by journalists Orvice, Parker, Cecil, and the Sun’s editorial team in August 2003, after Paris successfully staged the World Athletics Championships (the Sun, August 30, 2003, p. 14); in January 2004, when London’s bid was officially launched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723512455922">“Going for Gold,” January 17, 2004</xref>, p. 6; Orvice, January 16, 2004, p. 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723512455922">Parker, January 17, 2004</xref>, p. 2); and in May 2004, when the IOC announced that London and Paris were among the five cities chosen to be “candidates” to host the 2012 Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723512455922">Cecil, May 19, 2004</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>According to Brock-Doyle the “Paris versus London banter, France versus the U.K.” was one of the ideas that <italic>the Sun</italic> came up with on their own to support the bid. This is perhaps not surprising given that the headline “Up Yours Delors” which the Sun asked “all true blue Brits to face France and yell” during the 1990 debate over the European Currency Unit (ECU; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512455922">“Delors: Sun Was Right About Euro,” December 3, 2011</xref>) was one of <italic>the Sun</italic>’s “more celebrated” headlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723512455922">Golding, Deacon, McGuigan, Purdey, &amp; Rawson, 2005</xref>, p. 19). Given that such sentiment had proved popular with <italic>the Sun</italic>’s readers in the past, it seems that the London-versus-Paris-and-France-versus-the-United-Kingdom narrative thus served the dual purpose of allowing <italic>the Sun</italic> to mobilize a long-standing relationship with its “patriotic family of readers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512455922">“Delors: Sun Was Right About Euro,” December 3, 2011</xref>) to encourage them to back the bid at key moments in the bidding process while simultaneously appealing to the newspaper’s predominantly working-class readership through the popular leisure pursuit of gambling. If <italic>the Sun</italic>’s readers placed a bet on London winning the bid after reading the “expert” opinion of representatives from bookmakers such as “William Hill” and “Ladbrokes,” it follows that they would back the bid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723512455922">Cecil, May 19, 2004</xref>, p. 6).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193723512455922">
<title>Back the bid because the Games will enhance Britain’s prestige in the world</title>
<p>Given that Brock-Doyle suggested that the Games would make Britain proud if London won “against the rest of the world,” it is perhaps not surprising that <italic>the sun</italic> suggests that the Games will enhance Britain’s prestige in the world. Yet the statement first appears in <italic>the sun</italic> in a quote from the then prime minister Tony Blair who declared at the official launch of the bid in January 2004 that “staging a fantastic Games will send out a powerful message” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723512455922">Parker, January 17, 2004</xref>, p. 2). Blair, for his part, thus seems to have manipulated and transformed the LOBC’s statement of pride to suggest that the U.K. public should back the bid because the Games will enhance Britain’s prestige in the world.</p>
<p>Journalist Pascoe-Watson shows that the same subject position was filled by the then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell, who, claiming to speak on behalf of the nation in May 2004, said that the Olympics will result in “an improved image and reputation for our country” before going on to suggest that the nation will “emerge stronger and more modern” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723512455922">Pascoe-Watson, May 24, 2004</xref>, p. 2). Informing their readers that “nothing compares in size or prestige to landing the Olympics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723512455922">Pascoe-Watson, May 19, 2004</xref>, p. 8) which “will cement Britain’s standing in the world” (<italic>the sun</italic>, May 19, 2004, p. 8), journalist Pascoe-Watson and <italic>the Sun</italic>’s editorial team thus appear to be occupying the subject position created in this case, by the government.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193723512455922">
<title>Back the bid because a lack of support for the Games is unpatriotic</title>
<p>The LOBC’s statement that the Games will make Britain proud also seems to have been manipulated by the government to suggest that a lack of support for the Games is unpatriotic. In May 2004, when “a Sky News poll showed viewers were against the games,” which had also been criticized by “MPs” and other “newspapers,” journalist Pascoe-Watson informed readers that Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell had labelled critics of the bid as “whingers” (May 24, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723512455922">2004a</xref>, p. 2). Again claiming to speak on behalf of the nation, Jowell suggests that these critics “will weaken our nation will” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723512455922">Pascoe-Watson, May 24, 2004</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>In another article on page 8 of that day’s newspaper, Pascoe-Watson shows his support for Jowell, telling his readers that she “is right to call on the country to back the bid wholeheartedly,” before occupying the subject position created by Jowell to similarly brand critics of the bid as whinging, defeatist, “doom and gloom merchants” who are “afraid of winning” (May 24, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723512455922">2004</xref>, p. 8). In this article, Pascoe-Watson similarly occupies the subject position created by Jowell to ask his readers if they can “imagine the Aussies moping about their chances of landing the Sydney Games or the Americans giving up the ghost for Los Angeles in 1984?” (May 24, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723512455922">2004b</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Pascoe-Watson fails to mention however that the American public had little to fear over the possible failure of Los Angeles’ 1984 bid as it was not financed by the public purse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723512455922">Toohey &amp; Veal, 2007</xref>, p. 270), and that it is probably hard to imagine the Aussies moping about their chances of landing the Sydney Games since it is suggested that the state attempted to “straightjacket” Sydney’s media to minimize public dissent while critics were similarly labeled <italic>unpatriotic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723512455922">Lenskyj, 1996</xref>, p. 404; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193723512455922">Waitt, 2001</xref>, p. 256). Echoing his Australian counterparts, Pascoe-Watson uses the LOBC’s statement of pride to suggest that a lack of support for the bid is unpatriotic by suggesting that if London wins the bid “a sense of pride will be injected into every true Brit’s heart” (May 24, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723512455922">2004b</xref>, p. 8).</p>

<title>Back the bid because the Games will provide young people with a golden opportunity to make Britain proud</title>
<p>Although <italic>the Sun</italic> articulated, manipulated, used, and transformed the statement of pride that the LOBC sought to communicate to the host urban population of the United Kingdom to encourage them to back the bid, the newspaper paid little attention to the LOBC’s statement that the Olympics will inspire young people and the next generation to choose sport. Although this was a core narrative of the bid, in <italic>the Sun</italic>’s only reference to young people and the next generation its editorial team exchanged the LOBC’s statement of “inspiration” for a statement of “opportunity” before focusing on the pride associated with achieving “glory on the world’s greatest stage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723512455922">“Going for Gold,” January 17, 2004</xref>, p. 6). It thus seems that <italic>the Sun</italic>’s editorial team did not believe that its readers would accept the LOBC’s statement that the Games will inspire young people and the next generation to choose sport but felt that they would relate to the national pride associated with beating the world on behalf of Great Britain at the multisports event often referred to as “the greatest show on earth.”</p>

<title><italic>The Sun</italic>: Ardent Supporter of London’s Bid for the 2012 Games</title>
<p>As the previous discussion illustrates, <italic>the Sun</italic>’s coverage of London’s bid for the 2012 Olympics was predominantly supportive. This view was shared by Brock-Doyle who professed that <italic>the Sun</italic> was “terrific” and “hugely supportive of the bid.” Indeed, of the 66 articles relating to London’s bid that were published by <italic>the Sun</italic> between May 15, 2003, when it was announced that London would bid for the Games, and November 15, 2004, when London’s Candidate City File was submitted to the IOC, only one was completely critical of the bid and it was published after London had already been short-listed as a Candidate City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193723512455922">Littlejohn, August 17, 2004</xref>, p. 11). It therefore seems that <italic>the Sun</italic> may have been attempting to minimize dissent prior to the Candidate City selection by presenting a favorable view of the bid.</p>
<p>This idea seems to be buttressed by the fact that there were no articles documenting the work or views of the local activist group “NoLondon2012,” thus supporting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723512455922">Lenskyj’s (1999)</xref> contention that since the perspectives of such organizations are “incompatible with the interests of corporate and government elites” that the media seems to support, they are “managed and contained” to curtail opposition (p. 78). Given that such groups “heavily rely” on the mainstream media to “promote their causes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723512455922">Adi, 2010</xref>, para. 2), <italic>the Sun</italic>’s failure to do so suggests that it is hardly surprising that the NoLondon2012 campaign was unsuccessful as the readers of the U.K. newspaper with the greatest readership were not provided with a full view.</p>
<p><italic>The Sun</italic>’s lack of critical commentary is perhaps not surprising given that the institutional voice of the newspaper made <italic>the Sun</italic>’s allegiance explicit from the outset informing the newspaper’s readers that “the Sun has no hesitation in backing the Olympic bid” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723512455922">“Go for It!” May 16, 2003</xref>, p. 8). <italic>the Sun</italic> was at that time edited by “Rebekah Wade (now Rebekah Brooks)” and she was in Brock-Doyle’s words “a big supporter of [the LOBC] winning the Games.” According to Brock-Doyle, the LOBC and <italic>the Sun</italic> thus “did things together, [<italic>the Sun</italic>] did things on their own”—such as constructing the bid as a sporting competition between London and Paris or Britain and France as mentioned previously—and the LOBC “spent a lot of time with <italic>the Sun</italic>’s editorial team explaining what [they] were trying to do and why [they] were doing it.”</p>
<p><italic>The Sun</italic>’s support for the bid can therefore be attributed to the newspaper’s editorial control and collaboration with the LOBC. Given that the Olympics are a major source of content and revenue for the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193723512455922">Girginov &amp; Parry, 2009</xref>, p. 68), it is perhaps not surprising that Rebekah Brooks backed the bid. Yet, since the sun has always adopted a British-patriotic perspective that is typical of U.K. tabloid newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193723512455922">Conboy, 2006</xref>, p. 9), it seems that the LOBC’s statement of national pride also suited the sentiment of <italic>the sun</italic>, not least because it could be manipulated into a statement of nationalistic rivalry between Britain and France allowing <italic>the sun</italic> to mobilize a long-standing narrative that its readers enjoy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article clearly illustrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault’s (2002)</xref> contention that the statement is “produce[d], manipulate[d], use[d], transform[ed], exchange[d], combine[d], decompose[d], and recompose[d]” while the limited number of statements that can be said to belong to a discursive formation are repetitively articulated by a variety of subjects across numerous surfaces of emergence (pp. 118-129), of which the text constructed during my interview with Jackie-Brock Doyle and <italic>the Sun</italic> newspaper are here but two examples. The statements articulated by t<italic>he Sun</italic>’s journalists and editorial team show the newspaper to be an ardent supporter of London’s bid for the 2012 Games that attempted to influence its readers to “Back the Bid.”</p>
<p>As my analysis illuminates, the statements that <italic>the Sun</italic> conveyed to its readers in pursuit of this goal appear to have been developed around the core statement of pride that the LOBC sought to communicate to the host urban population to gain their support. This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that the LOBC and t<italic>he Sun</italic> worked closely with one another. However, as mentioned previously, the LOBC’s statement of pride also suited the sentiment of <italic>the Sun</italic>, not least because it could be manipulated and transformed into a statement of nationalistic rivalry allowing <italic>the Sun</italic> to mobilize a narrative that has proved popular with its readers in the past.</p>
<p>Consequently, it seems that the LOBC’s statement of pride was more likely to sell newspapers and was therefore better suited to <italic>the Sun</italic>’s financial interests than a statement of “inspiration” that the tabloid’s predominantly working-class readers were unlikely to accept. By illustrating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512455922">Foucault’s (2002)</xref> contention that the statement “serves or resists various interests” (p. 118), this study adds to the emerging body of knowledge, or discourse, which suggests that collusion and tension between the discourses and practices of bid committees and those of journalists affects the statements presented to the host urban population through the domestic media coverage of mega-event bids.</p>
<p>Given that the Sun was ideologically aligned with the Labour Party –who are traditionally supportive of the field of leisure to which events such as the Olympics belong—during the period of time that was analyzed, it would have been interesting to compare <italic>the sun</italic>’s coverage of the bid with the coverage in a traditionally right-wing newspaper. Moreover, given that t<italic>he sun</italic> is a national tabloid newspaper it would have been illuminating to have included a local newspaper and a broadsheet newspaper in the analysis. Similarly, it would have been valuable to analyze the <italic>Metro</italic>, the free newspaper with the highest number of U.K. readers, to consider the statements articulated to the members of the host urban population who do not buy a newspaper.</p>
<p>It would also have been prudent to interview the editor of <italic>the Sun</italic> newspaper in order to present her view on the journalistic practice surrounding the coverage of London’s bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. Furthermore, since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723512455922">Lenskyj (1999)</xref> suggests that the mainstream media reflect the interests of political and corporate elites and manage and contain views that are opposed to such interests to minimize dissent (p. 78), it would be worthwhile exploring the more democratic new media’s construction of London’s bid for the 2012 Olympics and comparing the analysis with that of the mainstream media. Such research was out with the scope of this study and can be seen as recommendations for further research.</p>
