<abstract>
<p>Lightweight design is urgently required in many fields, especially in aeronautics and astronautics, but conventional design methods cannot always meet the requirement. However, natural organisms have developed many types of structures with excellent properties, and they can provide many new design ideas. To improve the design of an aircraft reinforcing frame, structural characteristics of peltate venation and root architecture were investigated first, and several distribution rules were obtained. Then, relevant models for design of the frame were developed and analyzed in order to extract mechanical rules for their application in the design. Finally, based on these mechanical rules, lightweight design for the frame was accomplished. Comparison between the bionic and conventional frames shows that the total weight is reduced by about 6.0%, under the same requirement of stiffness and strength in both two load conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410012455581" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lightweight design is an onward trend of engineering design,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410012455581">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410012455581">2</xref></sup> and it is urgently required in many fields, especially in the field of aeronautics and astronautics. For aircraft, reducing weight is one of the major ways to improve the performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410012455581">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410012455581">3</xref></sup> Besides, the energy crisis also promotes the lightweight research on aircraft structure. Actually, there are two main and important aspects of design to reduce the weight. One is based on the material,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410012455581">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410012455581">4</xref></sup> which means finding or designing new materials with higher specific strength and stiffness. For example, titanium-based alloys are a group of lightweight materials, and they can be used to increase the ratio of strength to weight and provide heat resistance with weight savings in engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410012455581">1</xref></sup> Composite materials are another group of lightweight materials. Composite material can usually be designed with lighter weight than single material, so it is widely applied. Fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP), which can possibly reduce aircraft structural weight significantly, are gradually replacing metals as the material for highly stressed structures with well-defined loads.</p>
<p>The other aspect is structure design, which means structure improvement or optimization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410012455581">5</xref></sup> In this aspect, the main way is not to change the material itself but to change the material distribution, which means optimizing the size, shape and topology. Among the three, topology optimization is the most important one. There are four main methods of topology optimization including homogenization method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410012455581">6</xref></sup> variable density method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410012455581">7</xref></sup> evolutionary structural optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410012455581">8</xref></sup> and level-set method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410012455581">9</xref></sup> In applications, topology optimization on components of Airbus A380<sup>10</sup> is a successful case, including main wing box ribs, leading edge ribs, etc.</p>
<p>Through billions of years of evolution, natural organisms have developed many types of structures with excellent mechanical properties, which artificial designs can not always match up to. For example, nacre, the inner lustrous layer of many mollusk seashells, exhibits outstanding mechanical properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410012455581">11</xref></sup> and its hierarchical alignment can be used as a guide to design material or structure with high strength and light weight. Besides, wood, bone and bamboo all exhibit very good mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410012455581">12</xref></sup> Some efforts have been made on applying those advantages into aircraft structures including small wing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410012455581">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410012455581">14</xref></sup> and reinforcing frame.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410012455581">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410012455581">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, Emmelmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410012455581">5</xref></sup> employed bionics and proposed a bionic lightweight design method for aircraft industry.</p>
<p>In this article, lightweight design of a reinforcing frame of fuselage and wing joint is investigated. As load on reinforcing frame is relatively large, its weight is large accordingly. Hence, reinforcing frame is an important part of fuselage in weight, and weight saving in reinforcing frame is significant for reducing the total weight. Cen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410012455581">15</xref></sup> and Ma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410012455581">16</xref></sup> improved the structure of a reinforcing frame based on bionics, respectively. However, there are two aspects of issues, which were not carefully considered. The first one is that structural characteristics of biological prototypes were not studied in depth. The second is parameter values of bionic structures were not assigned based on scientific basis. Here, through mechanical analysis on peltate venation and root architecture, we introduce a bionic reinforcing frame based on structural optimization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410012455581"><title>Structural characteristics of peltate venation and root architecture</title>
<p>In this section, investigation on structural characteristics of peltate venation and root architecture is presented. Two aspects of work have been done: peltate venation and root architecture were investigated; relevant models were developed and analyzed to extract the mechanical rules for lightweight design.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954410012455581"><title>Structural characteristics of peltate venation</title>
<sec id="sec4-0954410012455581"><title>Regulation of peltate venation</title>
<p>Leaf venation usually forms complex patterns, and it varies among different species. In the most basic method of classification, leaf venation falls into two general types, pinnate and palmate venations. Peltate venation, which is included in palmate venation, is a special kind. Unlike pinnate venation or other kinds of palmate venations which connect themselves to the petiole on the edge, the connecting point of peltate venation is in the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410012455581">Figure 1</xref>). Veins in peltate venation are radial. Typical plants with peltate venation are Nasturtium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410012455581">Figure 1</xref>), <italic>Begonia peltatifolia</italic>, giant waterlily, etc.
<fig id="fig1-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Peltate venation of Nasturtium.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Through observing venations of Nasturtium and <italic>Begonia peltatifolia</italic>, three distribution rules of their veins can be concluded, expressed as follows.
<list id="list1-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Distribution of main veins is radialized.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Angles between two adjacent main veins in the same leaf are almost the same.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Secondary and higher order veins are relatively small, and usually can be neglected.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Compared with Nasturtium and <italic>Begonia peltatifolia</italic>, giant waterlily is much larger. Some species can grow as large as 2 m in diameter. Its regulation of venation is a little different from the former two. Secondary veins are obvious, and connect two adjacent main veins to form a regular network system. This indicates the existence of secondary veins is related to the size of the leaf.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954410012455581"><title>Mechanical rules of peltate venation</title>
<p>Radial pattern is widely applied. Possibly the most common application is spokes of bicycle. This does a great help in reducing the total weight of a bicycle. For the circular boundary, radial and uniform pattern is reasonable just like peltate venation does. However, in design of aircraft structures, boundary shape is usually complex, and radial and uniform pattern does not necessarily make sense. Hence, application rules of peltate venation are needed to be investigated.</p>
<p>In order to extract mechanical rules for design of reinforcing frame, we developed a model, named model I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410012455581">Figure 2(a)</xref>). In model I, the boundary shape was square with each side being 400 mm, and all degrees of its freedom were constrained. Circular shape in the center was where a random radial force was applied. Outer radius and inner radius are 98 and 88 mm, respectively. In order to control displacement of the circular ring, four ribs were needed to form connecting points 1, 2, 3 and 4 (these four points were the only points allowed to be connected in this model) to the square boundary. Circular ring and four ribs were all with a thickness of 20 mm.
<fig id="fig2-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Model I and its possible solutions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Ribs connecting a point of circular ring to the square boundary usually have two choices. One is vertical to the boundary, and the other is along the radial direction. Considering the symmetry, five possible solutions were found, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410012455581">Figure 2(b) to (f)</xref>. To compare the difference between these solutions, a radial force 1414 N was applied to the four points, respectively, and finite element analysis was carried out correspondingly. During the analysis, material properties of 7075 aluminum alloy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410012455581">Table 1</xref>) were used, and they were also used in the following analysis. One thing to be mentioned is that volume of different solutions was kept the same, so weights of those solutions were the same.

<p>Results of model I with different solutions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410012455581">Table 2</xref>. Both maximum displacement <italic>d</italic><sub>max</sub> and maximum stress <italic>s</italic><sub>max</sub> are calculated. From the results, it can be observed that differences between those five solutions are obvious. For both <italic>d</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>max</sub>, the value of solution b is the smallest. It can be found that <italic>d</italic><sub>max</sub> of solution b is less than 1/10 of the other solutions and <italic>s</italic><sub>max</sub> of solution b is about 1/4. The biggest difference between solution b and the others is that ribs in solution b are along radial direction while ribs of the others are not. This indicates the following.
<list id="list2-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Under a random radial force in model I, radial arrangement of ribs is the best choice. Except for solution b, the other four solutions are different. For both <italic>d</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>max</sub>, the value of solution c is the smallest and the value of solution d is the largest. Considering uniformity of rib arrangement, it is obvious that solution c is the best, and solution d is the worst, because only two sides of the square boundary are connected by ribs. Uniformity of solutions e and f are between solutions c and d. Hence, a conclusion can be expressed as follows.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Under a random radial force in model I, uniform arrangement of ribs is better than uneven ones.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec7-0954410012455581"><title>Regulation of root architecture</title>
<p>Root architecture is the foundation structure of a tree, because it provides the anchorage of the tree to the ground. Generally, there are two types of roots including taproot and adventitious root systems. In taproot system, a main root growing downwards in vertical direction exists, and many secondary roots grow from this main root. While in adventitious root system, there is no such kind of main root and every root grows from the base of trunk. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410012455581">Figure 3</xref> shows the root system of a tree, which is an adventitious root system.
<fig id="fig3-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Root architecture of a tree.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Wind is the most significant factor affecting the growth of trees. Wind force on trees will cause a moment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410012455581">17</xref></sup> and a shear force in the base of the trunk, and these two loads affect the growing of root system. Similar load condition causes similar root structure and two common distribution rules can be summarized as follows.
<list id="list3-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Symmetry</italic>. Either in taproot or adventitious root system, roots distribute symmetrically around the axis of the trunk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410012455581">18</xref></sup> if the wind comes from every direction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adaptive growth</italic>. As a tree sways in the wind, leeward and especially windward lateral roots are under the largest stress. Larger roots or a greater branching density in these areas will help reduce the stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410012455581">19</xref></sup> Hence, it is a common phenomenon that roots of a tree in some certain directions are larger.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954410012455581"><title>Mechanical rules of root architecture</title>
<p>As it is described in the previous section, root structure is a typical example that loads are applied on a point and stiffening ribs are arranged in a certain space. Considering the symmetry, root system can be simplified into a flat structure with a point loaded and several ribs arranged in a plane, just like what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410012455581">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>We developed a simple model, named model II, to extract mechanical rules of root architecture. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410012455581">Figure 4</xref>, model II consists of two ribs. One end of the ribs is constrained and they connect to each other at the other end to bear a force <italic>F</italic>. Thickness of ribs is 10 mm, and the total volume is invariant and assigned 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>. During the analysis, the angle <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410012455581">Figure 4</xref>) was changed from 10° to 75°, and maximum displacement and maximum stress were calculated correspondingly.
<fig id="fig4-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Structure of model II.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Since the total volume was kept the same during the analysis, the results can represent the structure efficiency with different angles. For maximum displacement, the value is almost the same from 20° to 60° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410012455581">Figure 5</xref>). For maximum stress, the value is relatively smaller in areas [20°, 35°] and [45°, 60°]. Considering two kinds of values, two conclusions can be made.
<list id="list4-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>When the angle is smaller than 15° or larger than 60°, both maximum displacement and stress grow fast.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The angle in model II should be assigned in areas [20°, 35°] and [45°, 60°].</p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig5-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Analysis results on model II.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In addition, width of ribs should not be too small, because the structure would be easier to buckle. Hence, buckling problem should be considered when the angle <italic>θ</italic> is assigned a relatively large value.</p>

<p>Reinforcing frame is a typical flat structure in aircraft. It provides elastic support for the fuselage. Hence, stiffness design is quite necessary. Basically, reinforcing frame bears forces within its plane, and transfers them to the fuselage skin in the form of shear. Stress value in the plot where a force is loaded is usually a local maximum and is much larger, so maximum stress should be controlled.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410012455581">Figure 6</xref> is only a half of a reinforcing frame of fuselage and wing joint. Because of its symmetry, only the left half is discussed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410012455581">Figure 6</xref>). Generally, there are two types of load conditions including pure shear and combination of shear and bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410012455581">Figure 6</xref>). To understand the effect of these load conditions, the frame is analyzed with all its ribs absent. Under pure shear, four local maximum stress points on the left edge can be observed. Under shear and bending, two local maximum stress points can be observed. Hence, stress distribution under pure shear has more stress extreme points, and is relatively worse from the viewpoint of stress change.
<fig id="fig6-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Reinforcing frame without any ribs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The ring in the center is where a circular structure is assembled. It should be designed with enough stiffness relative to the edge of the frame.</p>
<p>In summary, ribs in the frame have two functions. One is to reduce maximum displacement and stress, and the other is to ensure the stiffness of the ring relative to the edge. According to these two functions, structure of reinforcing frame is decomposed into two units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410012455581">Figure 7</xref>). In unit 1, ring structure is seen as a constrained edge, and its design target is to reduce maximum displacement and stress. In unit 2, all outer edges are seen as constrained edges, and to ensure the stiffness of the ring relative to the edge is the target.

<sec id="sec12-0954410012455581"><title>Structural bionic design for unit 1</title>
<p>According to section ‘Decomposition of reinforcing frame’, stress distribution under pure shear is more complicated, so four key points with local maximum stress are considered. Through similarity analysis, three aspects of similarity between unit 1 and root architecture can be found.
<list id="list6-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Similarity of function</italic>. Both unit 1 and root architecture are aiming at avoiding large local stress concentration and enhancing the structural stiffness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Similarity of structure</italic>. Simplified root architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410012455581">Figure 3</xref>) is a flat structure, and unit 1 is also a flat structure. Two structures are both stiffened by ribs or roots.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Similarity of load</italic>. Both simplified root architecture and unit 1 bear loads within their plane, including shear and bending.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Since a mechanical problem can be mainly described by these three aspects, similarity in these three aspects suggests simplified root architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410012455581">Figure 3</xref>) is a suitable biological prototype for unit 1.</p>
<p>According to the results of mechanical analysis in section ‘Structural characteristics of root architecture’, two ribs for each key point should be formed. Each rib should connect the key point directly to constrained edge. Corresponding angles are suggested to be assigned with the value in areas [20°, 35°] and [45°, 60°].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954410012455581"><title>Structural bionic design for unit 2</title>
<p>From aspects of function, structure and load, similarity analysis is carried out between unit 2 and peltate venation.
<list id="list7-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Similarity of function</italic>. Target of unit 2 is to ensure the stiffness of the ring relative to the edge. Peltate venation should enhance stiffness of leaf edges to avoid damage by wind. Essentially, they are similar to each other.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Similarity of structure</italic>. They are both flat structured stiffened by either ribs or veins.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Similarity of load</italic>. Unit 2 bears a radial force within its plane. Usually peltate venation bears a pressure vertical to its plane, and it sometimes bears a force within its plane caused by wind.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Similarity analysis shows similarity degree of unit 2 and peltate venation is high in function and structure. But they are not highly similar to each other in aspect of load. This suggests that peltate venation may be helpful for design of unit 2.</p>
<p>Rib arrangement in unit 2 is suggested to be radial and uniform. Each rib connects the ring to edges of reinforcing frame.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0954410012455581"><title>Lightweight design for the frame</title>
<p>For each unit, a structural bionic design is proposed in section ‘Structural bionic design of the two units.’ However, these two designs can not be finished separately. This is because the two units are not independent, and they affect each other. In order to solve the problem, two guidelines are proposed, expressed as follows.
<list id="list8-0954410012455581" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Coordination</italic>. Ribs affecting each other should change their positions in order to perform the best. Ribs should be arranged according to their importance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Multifunction</italic>. Ribs should be arranged with as many functions as possible. In other words, ribs are encouraged to be arranged with functions in as many units as possible.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Following these two guidelines, structural bionic design for reinforcing frame is finished, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410012455581">Figure 8</xref>. Bionic arrangement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410012455581">Figure 8</xref> is symmetric, so only a half of it is discussed here. Ribs 1, 2, 4 and 5 are formed for unit 1. Ribs 2, 3, 7 and 8 are radial, and they are formed for unit 2. Angles in unit 1 are not assigned with suggested value. Rib 1 makes a balance between unit 1 and unit 2, and it is designed with support function in unit 2 and a joint generated for ribs 3 and 4. Adjustment of rib 2 is aiming at multifunction. Obviously, rib 2 acts with function both in unit 1 and unit 2. According to rib 1, ribs 3, 4, 5 and 8 are formed. Rib 7 is not affected by other ribs, and it is arranged in order to form a uniform arrangement for unit 2. Ribs 6 and 9 are two ribs enhancing the structure.
<fig id="fig8-0954410012455581" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Bionic arrangement of reinforcing frame.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012455581-fig8.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>After adjustment of ribs from two units, there are less structural parameters. Angles in unit 1 are fixed, and number of ribs in unit 2 is determined. The only parameter left is the width of these ribs. Hence, an optimization problem can be expressed as

where <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> is width of rib number <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>m</italic> the total weight.</p>
<p>Parametric model is established in ANSYS by its APDL, and optimal calculation is carried out. During the optimization, load condition is selected to be shear and bending moment, because this load condition is relatively larger. Under this load condition, the conventional reinforcing frame is calculated to be with 1.257 mm for maximum displacement and 239.4 MPa for maximum stress.</p>
<p>Through the optimization, all design variables fell in the lower limit, which is suggested by the width of ribs in the conventional frame. Comparison between bionic and conventional reinforcing frames was carried out, and results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410012455581">Table 3</xref>. From the comparison, it can be observed that the total weight can be reduced by about 6.0%, and the weight of ribs is reduced by 35.1%. Meanwhile, maximum displacement and stress of bionic frame under shear and bending moment are still smaller than those of conventional one. Under pure shear, maximum stress of bionic frame is a little larger, but the value is only about 1/1000, which can be neglected. However, maximum displacement is reduced by as much as 8.6%.

<p>Stress maps of bionic and conventional reinforcing frames are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410012455581">Figure 9</xref>. Under the two load conditions, rough distribution of stress in both bionic and conventional frames is almost the same. This indicates that bionic arrangement is reasonable, and it achieves the same target with less material. Meanwhile, it can be observed that boundary between different values of stress in bionic frame is a little simpler, and this means stress changes more gently in local areas.

<p>Based on the understanding of peltate venation and root architecture, structural bionic design for reinforcing frame is achieved. Comparison in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410012455581">Table 3</xref> shows that bionic arrangement is reasonable and it can effectively reduce the total weight. This indicates structural bionics may bring a revolution for lightweight design of aircraft structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410012455581">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410012455581">20</xref></sup> However, selecting a suitable biological prototype is a barrier. In order to solve the problem, similarity analysis between mechanical structures and organism is introduced by Cen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410012455581">15</xref></sup> In this article, similarity analysis is also employed to evaluate the similarity. Results in section ‘Lightweight design for the frame’ suggest that similarity analysis is an effective way to select suitable biological prototypes, and it may be a good solution to that problem.</p>
<p>Reinforcing frame is usually under two types of load conditions. This may cause a great complexity in structure design, because optimal designs of different load conditions may be quite different. Furthermore, the optimization design process may not converge. Complex conditions are suggested to be considered first. In bionic arrangement of ribs, worse stress distribution from the viewpoint of stress change is considered, and complex load condition is taken in the optimization in section ‘Lightweight design for the frame.’ Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410012455581">Table 3</xref> show that this treatment has certain reasonableness, and the lightweight design has been successfully accomplished. However, the maximum stress of the bionic frame under pure shear is relatively large. The possible reason is that load condition of pure shear was not employed in the optimization. Besides, stress maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410012455581">Figure 6</xref> suggest that effect of the two load condition is near to each other. Hence, the optimization result is suggested to be verified by the load condition which is not employed.</p>
<p>It is found that there is a contradiction between maximum displacement and stress in the iterative process of optimization. When total volume does not change too much, it is a certainty that maximum displacement decreases with an increase in maximum stress. This shows that it is necessary to design stiffness and strength of the reinforcing frame at the same time. If stiffness and strength are designed sequentially, the global optimal solution may be lost.</p>
