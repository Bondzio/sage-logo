<abstract>
<p>Moral courage is characterized as a bystander intervention against the norm violations of a perpetrator despite the potential for negative consequences for oneself. We tested a comprehensive set of potential personality determinants of moral courage derived from a model of helping. In Study 1, we used a vignette to assess the self-reported willingness to intervene against a theft. In Study 2, the theft was put into effect, and behavioral reactions were observed. The results of Study 1 showed that moral disengagement, self-efficacy, and social anxiety, which are traits that are known to predict helping, were also related to moral courage intentions. Differently, in Study 2, real moral courage was predicted only by beneficiary sensitivity, a disposition that captures perceptual readiness and affective reactivity to perceived injustice. Our results provide insights into the processes involved in moral courage in a realistic situation and stress the importance of behavioral observations.</p>

<p>On October 20, 2009, in Duesseldorf, Germany, a group of three men and one woman tried to steal an old lady’s purse on an open street. This was prevented by the intervention of a 21-year-old woman who followed the thieves and called other bystanders for help. Together with other pedestrians, the young woman stopped the thieves and retrieved the purse. Before the thieves could be arrested, they escaped after beating the courageous woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213490032">Moral Courage, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This example shows that intervening against norm violations is highly desirable but difficult and potentially costly. The kind of behavior shown by the young woman has been termed <italic>moral courage</italic> in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167213490032">Skitka, 2011</xref>), <italic>Zivilcourage</italic> in German (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167213490032">von Keudell, 1901</xref>), and <italic>courage civique</italic> in French (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213490032">Le Gall, 1889/2010</xref>). Despite its significance for the functioning of human societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213490032">Kennedy, 1955</xref>), scientific knowledge about its determinants is relatively scarce. In the present research, drawing on a prominent model of helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané &amp; Darley, 1970</xref>), we investigated personality determinants of courageous bystander interventions against a norm violation and compared the self-reported moral courage as a reaction to a vignette with actual behavior when the described situation was put into effect. This comparison seems important because studies have suggested that self-reported and real moral courage reflect different psychological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167213490032">
<title>Subtypes of Prosocial Behavior: Moral Courage and Helping</title>
<p>To understand and foster moral courage, most scientists and practitioners have relied on models of helping behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané &amp; Darley, 1970</xref>). However, helping and moral courage are distinct subtypes of prosocial behavior. Whereas helping is defined as intentional behavior aimed at abating the needs of a victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213490032">Batson, 1998</xref>), moral courage is directed at stopping a perpetrator from violating an important social norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213490032">Jonas &amp; Brandstätter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>). The latter kind of behavior is courageous because of the negative social consequences it might have for one’s own person, such as vengeful acts committed by the perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer, Fischer, Kastenmüller, &amp; Frey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213490032">Kidder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213490032">Meyer &amp; Hermann, 2000</xref>). Importantly, empirical research has suggested that distinct psychological processes may be involved in both kinds of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213490032">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser, Greitemeyer, Fischer, &amp; Frey, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For <italic>helping</italic> to occur, the seminal model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané and Darley (1970)</xref> proposes that five stages of psychological processes are crucial: (a) An incident has to be witnessed, (b) the incident has to be interpreted as an emergency, (c) the witness has to assume personal responsibility, (d) the witness has to feel competent to help, and (e) the final decision depends on a subjective cost–benefit analysis. At each stage, situational factors and functionally equivalent personality dispositions inhibit or promote helping. Attentional and interpretive processes may depend on a dispositional sensitivity to emergency signals. Pluralistic ignorance can occur when the inaction of other bystanders is used as information that speaks against viewing the incident as an emergency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167213490032">Latané &amp; Nida, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213490032">Thornberg, 2007</xref>). Personal responsibility may be denied if dispositional tendencies in moral disengagement are strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213490032">Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, &amp; Pastorelli, 1996</xref>) and if the number of bystanders allows for the diffusion of responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213490032">Blair, Thompson, &amp; Wuensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167213490032">Solomon, Solomon, &amp; Stone, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213490032">Thornberg, 2007</xref>). By contrast, if norms of responsibility are situationally emphasized, for example, by common group membership among the bystanders, a bystander effect that is typically observed to reduce helping can be reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213490032">Levine &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213490032">Rutkowski, Gruder, &amp; Romer, 1983</xref>). Furthermore, subjective feelings of competence depend on general self-efficacy beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213490032">Bandura, 1997</xref>) and the type of behavior that is required. Finally, the anticipated costs and benefits of helping are shaped, on one hand, by feelings of empathy with the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213490032">Batson, 1998</xref>) because empathy stresses the costs of nonintervention. Accordingly, helping has been shown to be more likely among persons high in dispositional empathy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213490032">Pavey, Greitemeyer, &amp; Sparks, 2012</xref>), and when empathic feelings are situationally facilitated by stressing similarities with the victim (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167213490032">Stürmer, Snyder, Kropp, &amp; Siem, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, feelings of social threat may inhibit or facilitate helping depending on whether the costs of intervention or of nonintervention are more salient. Dispositional anxiety has been found to inhibit helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213490032">Karakashian, Walter, Christopher, &amp; Lucas, 2006</xref>) in situations of social threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167213490032">McGovern, 1976</xref>) but to promote helping in situations that contain cues that indicate that nonintervention might be scrutinized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213490032">Garcia, Weaver, Darley, &amp; Spence, 2009</xref>). Similarly, situational cues that raise concerns about one’s reputation have also been found to promote helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167213490032">van Bommel, van Prooijen, Elffers, &amp; van Lange, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Can the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané and Darley (1970)</xref> model also be applied to <italic>moral courage</italic>? Speaking in favor of the applicability of this model, some studies have revealed that determinants of helping as derived from this model are also useful for predicting moral courage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213490032">Chaurand and Brauer (2008)</xref> showed that assumed personal responsibility predicted intentions to exert social control in the face of norm violations by a perpetrator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213490032">Kuhl (1986)</xref> found that self-assuredness, a trait that overlaps with self-efficacy, was related to the willingness to intervene against a norm violation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213490032">Labuhn, Wagner, van Dick, and Christ (2004)</xref> identified empathic feelings as a predictor of intentions to show moral courage. However, when directly comparing retrospective self-reports of behavior in critical situations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al. (2006)</xref> found that the decision to help depended substantially more on perceived responsibility and empathic feelings toward the victim than did the decision to show moral courage.</p>
<p>Research that has assessed actual interventions against norm violations has revealed additional differences in the psychological processes involved in moral courage and helping. For example, courageous engagement to defend moral norms was found to be independent of positive and negative mood states, in contrast to helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, bystander effects that typically reduce helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167213490032">Latané &amp; Nida, 1981</xref>) do not seem to affect moral courage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213490032">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213490032">Harari, Harari, &amp; White, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213490032">Schwartz &amp; Gottlieb, 1976</xref>). Thus, it seems possible that at least part of the processes that were assumed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané and Darley (1970)</xref> may be irrelevant or less relevant for moral courage compared with helping.</p>

<sec id="section2-0146167213490032">
<title>Dispositional Predictors of Moral Courage</title>
<p>Beyond the reported findings on situational determinants of moral courage, relevant personality factors are largely unknown. Given the substantial individual differences in reactions to situations requiring moral courage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213490032">Bickman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213490032">Hawkins, Pepler, &amp; Craig, 2001</xref>), we aimed to contribute to the understanding of this type of prosocial behavior by systematically investigating the impact of stable dispositions on self-reported and real moral courage. To facilitate a comparison with prior research on helping, we used the process model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané and Darley (1970)</xref> to identify potential personality determinants of moral courage. As described above, at each stage of the model, personality dispositions can be assumed to shape relevant psychological processes, thus promoting or inhibiting helping. In the following paragraphs, we discuss whether the personality dispositions that shape helping behavior at each stage can also be expected to shape moral courage. Importantly, identifying dispositional determinants of moral courage can be conceptualized as complementary to approaches that focus on situational determinants if both types of variables are functionally equivalent in shaping the same psychological processes. In other words, a dispositional approach like the one we take in the present article and a social psychological approach like the ones taken in most prior research can be seen as two sides of the same coin.</p>
<sec id="section3-0146167213490032">
<title>Stages 1 and 2 (Detection and Interpretation)</title>
<p>Moral courage is distinct from helping because an intervention against a norm violation is central for the former but not for the latter. Accordingly, the first and second stages of a process model of moral courage should refer specifically to the detection and interpretation of a <italic>norm violation</italic> rather than of an <italic>emergency</italic>. Justice sensitivity as a trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213490032">Schmitt, Baumert, Gollwitzer, &amp; Maes, 2010</xref>) has been found to enhance perceptual readiness for the violation of justice norms as well as the interpretation of ambiguous situations as unjust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert, Gollwitzer, Staubach, &amp; Schmitt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213490032">Baumert, Otto, Thomas, Bobocel, &amp; Schmitt, 2012</xref>). Therefore, justice sensitivity can be expected to be a specific personality determinant of moral courage.</p>
<p>Importantly, a norm violation can be witnessed from different perspectives that lead to different affective responses and to different behavioral consequences in turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213490032">Mikula, 1980</xref>). Corresponding to these perspectives, justice sensitivity has been differentiated into observer sensitivity, victim sensitivity, beneficiary sensitivity, and perpetrator sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213490032">Schmitt et al., 2010</xref>). Witnesses of a norm violation will most likely adopt the perspective of a neutral observer. Persons high in observer sensitivity automatically direct their attention toward injustices that do not affect them personally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2011</xref>) and react with strong moral outrage. Thus, observer sensitivity should promote moral courage.</p>
<p>Witnesses of a norm violation may also assume the perspective of a potential victim of the perpetrator, as persons high in victim sensitivity should readily do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213490032">Gollwitzer, Schmitt, Schalke, Maes, &amp; Baer, 2005</xref>). Victim-sensitive persons have been found to spontaneously interpret social interactions in terms of their own disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2012</xref>) and can, hence, be expected to tend to withdraw from situations in which they have witnessed norm violations. Consistent with this prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al. (2010)</xref> found that persons high (compared to low) in victim sensitivity were less willing to sign a petition against a right-wing extremist political party.</p>
<p>Beneficiary-sensitive individuals react with guilt and the motivation to undo injustice whenever they feel unfairly advantaged. At first sight, this disposition seems irrelevant in a situation requiring moral courage because a bystander usually does not benefit from the observed norm violation. However, beneficiary-sensitive persons readily perceive themselves as privileged compared with less fortunate people even if there is no direct causality between their own situation and other’s disadvantages. As a consequence, beneficiary-sensitive persons tend to experience feelings of existential guilt and display increased solidarity toward disadvantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213490032">Gollwitzer et al., 2005</xref>). In an experimental game setting, beneficiary-sensitive persons have been found to invest their own money to compensate victims of other’s unfairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213490032">Lotz, Baumert, Schlösser, Gresser, &amp; Fetchenhauer, 2011</xref>). As bystanders, beneficiary-sensitive persons may spontaneously interpret the situation as one in which they are privileged in comparison with a potential victim (even if the victim is not present), and as a consequence, act to prevent or redress the norm violation.</p>
<p>Finally, the witness of a norm violation may focus on the possibility that he or she will violate a norm, a focus readily adopted by persons high in perpetrator sensitivity. Such a perpetrator perspective may involve conflicting behavioral tendencies with regard to moral courage. On one hand, nonintervention represents immoral behavior; on the other hand, intervening to stop a norm violation may imply disregarding other social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167213490032">Nugier, Niedenthal, Brauer, &amp; Chekroun, 2007</xref>). Due to these conflicting tendencies, perpetrator sensitivity can be expected to be unrelated to bystander intervention at the level of bivariate correlations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146167213490032">
<title>Stage 3 (Attribution of One’s Own Responsibility)</title>
<p>Research has indicated that perceiving oneself as personally responsible may not be as important for moral courage as it is for helping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al., 2006</xref>). As this finding is based on retrospective self-reports of behavior, it seems necessary to test the effect of dispositional moral disengagement on self-reported and real moral courage. This variable captures individual differences in the tendency to disengage from one’s own moral standards, for example, by attributing responsibility to social pressure or to a potential victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213490032">Bandura et al., 1996</xref>). The common psychological function of these strategies is to avoid self-censure, such as feelings of guilt. Therefore, persons high in moral disengagement can be expected to be less inclined to act in accordance with moral norms and thus less inclined to help or to show moral courage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0146167213490032">
<title>Stage 4 (Subjective Intervention Skills)</title>
<p>Generalized self-efficacy beliefs reflect the degree to which people see themselves as capable of coping effectively with challenges in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213490032">Bandura, 1997</xref>). People have been found to report that they lack the skills that are necessary for moral courage but not for helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al., 2006</xref>). Moral courage trainings commonly focus on providing such skills and fostering feelings of self-assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213490032">Pfetsch, Steffgen, Gollwitzer, &amp; Ittel, 2011</xref>). However, no previous study has tested whether individual differences in self-efficacy contribute to the understanding of moral courage in situations of actual norm violations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167213490032">
<title>Stage 5 (Cost–Benefit Analysis)</title>
<p>Dispositional empathy, a person variable that stresses the potential costs of nonintervention, has been shown to promote helping behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213490032">Pavey et al., 2012</xref>). With regard to moral courage, this disposition might be less relevant because in situations in which norms are violated, a victim does not have to be present or be identifiable as a concrete individual (e.g., in the case of someone shouting discriminating slogans). Previous results on the effects of empathy have been mixed. In a vignette study, situational empathy was found to enhance self-reported moral courage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213490032">Labuhn et al., 2004</xref>). When actual behavior was observed, dispositional empathy predicted only helping but not moral courage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, at the fifth stage of the process model, trait social anxiety should increase concerns about negative social consequences of moral courage such as vengeful reactions of the perpetrator, thus inhibiting moral courage. However, research on helping has revealed that social anxiety might also stress the negative consequences of nonintervention if the situation contains cues that trigger reputational concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167213490032">van Bommel et al., 2012</xref>). Depending on the precise situation, social anxiety might be only weakly negatively related to moral courage at the level of bivariate correlations.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0146167213490032">
<title>Investigating Self-Reported Versus Actual Moral Courage</title>
<p>Previous research on moral courage has predominantly relied on self-reported intentions in fictitious situations or on retrospective reports of a person’s own behavior. The main reason for this methodological limitation consists of the ethical and economic difficulties involved in implementing a norm violation in a realistic situation. Proposing the validity of research on self-reported moral courage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al. (2006)</xref> argued that people’s implicit theories can be expected to guide reflective prosocial behavior. However, in more general terms, some researchers have questioned whether results based on self-reported behavior can be generalized to actual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167213490032">Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Funder, 2007</xref>). Socially desirable responding and the limits of introspection may undermine the correspondence between self-reports and actual behavior. Specifically, research on moral courage has revealed that people are unable to correctly anticipate what they would actually do if faced with a real situation that required moral courage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213490032">Bickman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer (2008)</xref> showed that the proportion of people who reported intentions to help in a described situation corresponded to the proportion of people who actually helped when the situation was put into effect, but the respective proportions were surprisingly different for moral courage. Thus, it seems plausible that the relevant psychological processes that determine moral courage may not be (fully) introspectively accessible. Compared with helping situations, real situations requiring moral courage may be less common in everyday life. Therefore, there may be little opportunity for individuals to learn about what their responses would actually be in a real situation that called for moral courage.</p>
<p>Most importantly, in contrast to vignettes, witnessing norm violations in the real world triggers strong negative affect and high arousal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213490032">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al., 2010</xref>) that may boost experiential processing and diminish the impact of reflective processes on behavioral decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167213490032">Skarlicki &amp; Rupp, 2010</xref>). As dual process theories of human behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213490032">Chaiken &amp; Trope, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213490032">Epstein, Lipson, Holstein, &amp; Huh, 1992</xref>) propose, behavior can be shaped via two routes of information processing—one that is fast, effortless, and rather uncontrolled, thus preparing the individual for immediate reactions (termed experiential processing by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213490032">Epstein et al., 1992</xref>); and another that is slower, more effortful, and deliberate (termed rational processing). Affective and physiological arousal can be assumed to be factors that have the potential to impede conscious reflection and strengthen the automatic route. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167213490032">Nordgren and Chou (2011)</xref> showed that being in a “hot” visceral state, such as sexual arousal, diminished self-control in the face of temptation and thus triggered impulsive reactions. With regard to aversive events, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213490032">Epstein et al. (1992)</xref> found that the intensity of a negative outcome increased the impact of experiential processing on human judgment.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in contrast to responses to vignettes, courageous bystander interventions in situations of real norm violations may be predominantly shaped by automatic experiential processes. If this is the case, the stages of the process model discussed above that involve highly reflective processes may be relevant for self-reported intentions but less relevant for actual moral courage. In particular, whereas the detection and interpretation of social situations (Stages 1 and 2) can be expected to function quickly and effortlessly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167213490032">Luo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213490032">Stefanics, Csukly, Komlosi, Czobor, &amp; Czigler, 2012</xref>), the latter stages of assuming responsibility, assessing one’s intervention skills, and subjective cost–benefit analyses seem to refer to reflective processes, which require time and cognitive capacity. Thus, situational factors and personality dispositions that determine these latter processes—such as moral disengagement, self-efficacy beliefs, and social anxiety—may predict self-reported moral courage only in reaction to vignettes, but may be irrelevant with regard to actual moral courage. We tested these assumptions in two studies by comparing the personality determinants of moral courage when assessed by means of a vignette (Study 1) and by means of behavioral observations in a situation involving a real norm violation (Study 2).</p>
<sec id="section8-0146167213490032">
<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>As explained above, we adapted a seminal process model of helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané &amp; Darley, 1970</xref>) to derive potential determinants of moral courage. We did so to test whether the psychological processes that are involved in moral courage are comparable with those identified for helping. Specifically, we investigated the impact of the following personality variables on moral courage: observer sensitivity, victim sensitivity, beneficiary sensitivity, and perpetrator sensitivity, as dispositions known to shape the spontaneous detection and interpretation of norm violations (Stages 1 and 2); moral disengagement as a disposition that shapes perceptions of one’s own responsibility (Stage 3); self-efficacy as a personality variable that determines subjective intervention skills (Stage 4); and dispositional empathic concern and social anxiety as dispositions that guide the focus of a cost–benefit analyses with regard to the decision about intervening (Stage 5).</p>
<p>We also aimed to explore the impact of broad personality factors as well as of social desirability. Controlling for these variables when testing the impact of each of the specific dispositions allowed us to identify the unique contribution of each variable. Therefore, we additionally assessed the Big Five factors extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213490032">Rammstedt &amp; John, 2007</xref>), and we used a measure of social desirability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213490032">Paulhus, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested whether these variables are relevant predictors of the probability of intervening against a theft witnessed in the laboratory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213490032">Moriarty, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213490032">Schwartz &amp; Gottlieb, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>). A theft situation seems adequate for investigating determinants of moral courage because it meets the core criteria for this kind of prosocial behavior (norm violation by a perpetrator; insecurity regarding the potential negative social consequences of intervening). Importantly, prior research has revealed substantial variance in people’s reactions to this kind of situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>). In Study 1, participants read the description of the theft and indicated how they would react to this situation. We predicted that, because self-reported moral courage should involve highly reflective processes, personality variables that are relevant at all five stages of the process model adapted from the helping context would determine self-reported moral courage intentions.</p>
<p>In Study 2, the theft was actually realized in the laboratory, and the behavioral reactions of our participants were rated by a trained observer. In contrast to Study 1, we assumed that reflective processes would be less relevant in this highly arousing situation; consequently, we predicted that justice sensitivity would determine moral courage, whereas moral disengagement, self-efficacy, dispositional empathic concern, and social anxiety would be less relevant.</p>

<title>Personality assessment</title>
<p>The first questionnaire contained personality scales in the following order. If not reported otherwise, response options ranged from 0 (<italic>totally disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>totally agree</italic>).</p>
<p>First, the questionnaire contained the Justice Sensitivity Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213490032">Schmitt et al., 2010</xref>), which consists of four scales with 10 items each to measure victim sensitivity (e.g., “It bothers me when others get something that ought to be mine”; α = .84), observer sensitivity (e.g., “It bothers me when someone gets something they don’t deserve”; α = .88), beneficiary sensitivity (e.g., “It disturbs me when I receive something that others ought to have”; α = .87), and perpetrator sensitivity (e.g., “It bothers me when I get something I don’t deserve”; α = .83). Second, moral disengagement was measured with 24 items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213490032">Bandura et al. (1996</xref>; e.g., “Slapping and shoving someone is just a way of joking”; α = .84). Third, empathic concern (e.g., “I would describe myself as a pretty soft-hearted person”; α = .87) was assessed with a 9-item scale adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167213490032">Davis (1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213490032">Maes, Schmitt, &amp; Schmal, 1995</xref>). Fourth, the German 10-Item Big Five Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213490032">Rammstedt &amp; John, 2007</xref>) served to measure extraversion (α = .83), agreeableness (α = .22), conscientiousness (α = .61), neuroticism (α = .67), and openness (α = .57) with two items each. Response options of the Big Five Inventory ranged from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Finally, a German version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167213490032">Musch, Brockhaus, &amp; Bröder, 2002</xref>) of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213490032">Paulhus, 1998</xref>) was used to measure two facets of social desirability, namely, self-deception (10 items, e.g., “My first impression always turns out to be right”; α = .72) and other-deception (10 items, e.g., “I have never dropped litter on the street”; α = .72). Response options for these items ranged from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 6 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The second questionnaire contained a scale to assess self-efficacy beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167213490032">Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1999</xref>; 10 items, e.g., “In unexpected situations, I always know how to behave”; α = .89) and a 26-item scale to assess social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213490032">Lück, 1975</xref>; e.g., “Usually, I am nervous when I have to speak to important people”; α = .91).</p>

<title>Theft vignette</title>
<p>Participants were asked to imagine the following situation:<disp-quote>
<p>You are participating in a psychological study. You are waiting for a second participant to arrive in the laboratory when a mobile phone suddenly starts to ring. The research assistant answers the call and it turns out that an earlier participant had forgotten the phone in the lab. They agree that the person will pick the phone up in the evening. The research assistant turns the phone off and puts it back on the desk next to you. The second participant, a female student, arrives, and the tasks are explained. You have to memorize three texts and work on a concentration task on the computer. When the tasks begin, the research assistant leaves the lab. You are reading the texts when the other participant asks you whether the mobile phone on the desk belongs to you. You answer “No,” and the other participant puts the phone in her bag. Then she continues to work on the tasks.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Our paradigm check indicated that the theft situation was perceived as a clear norm violation (<italic>M</italic> = 4.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.62). However, the subjective difficulty of the situation was rather low (<italic>M</italic> = 1.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.30). Means, standard deviations, and correlations between personality variables and the willingness to intervene are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167213490032">Table 1</xref>. On average, participants reported being highly willing to intervene against the theft (<italic>M</italic> = 4.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71). No participant indicated that he or she was not willing to get involved in this situation (minimum = 2.33, maximum = 5.00). As expected, the willingness to show moral courage was significantly negatively correlated with moral disengagement (<italic>r</italic> = −.30, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and social anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = −.29, <italic>p</italic> = .02), and positively correlated with self-efficacy (<italic>r</italic> = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Different from our expectations, the perspectives of justice sensitivity were not significantly correlated with the willingness to show moral courage (victim: <italic>r</italic> = −.19; observer: <italic>r</italic> = .10; beneficiary: <italic>r</italic> = −.06; perpetrator: <italic>r</italic> = .12; all <italic>ns</italic>). There was no significant correlation between empathic concern and the willingness to show moral courage (<italic>r</italic> = .10, <italic>ns</italic>). Among the Big Five, openness was significantly positively related to self-reported moral courage (<italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> = .04). In addition, we found a marginally significant relation of other-deception (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> = .06) and a significant positive relation of self-deception (<italic>r</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> = .02) with the willingness to show moral courage.</p>

<p>Taken together, for moral courage assessed by means of a vignette, we found correlational evidence for personality determinants that shape the process stages of assuming responsibility (Stage 3), assessing one’s own intervention skills (Stage 4), and engaging in a cost–benefit analysis (Stage 5). As justice sensitivity was not correlated with the willingness to intervene, we did not find evidence for personality determinants that shape psychological processes at the stage of detection and interpretation of norm violations (Stages 1 and 2). In accordance with the notion that moral courage is directed at a perpetrator rather than at a victim, empathy was not significantly correlated with the willingness to stop the theft. This result is consistent with prior studies that have shown that empathy is less relevant for moral courage than it is for helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the unique predictive value of each variable, three multiple regression models were calculated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167213490032">Table 2</xref>). First, when the justice sensitivity perspectives, moral disengagement, self-efficacy, empathy, and social anxiety were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression model (Model 1), only self-efficacy retained a marginally significant effect on the willingness to intervene, β = .28, <italic>t</italic> = 1.80, <italic>p</italic> = .08. Apparently, the predictors partially overlapped in their relation to moral courage intentions. Second, this pattern of results remained the same when the social desirability facets were entered into the model (Model 2; self-efficacy: β = .28, <italic>t</italic> = 1.75, <italic>p</italic> = .09). Thus, the unique effect of self-efficacy on moral courage intentions could not be explained by social desirability. However, third, when the Big Five factors were added into the model (Model 3), no single predictor was significant. This pattern of results might be due to a lack of power in the full regression model.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Whereas in Study 1, we tested personality predictors of self-reported moral courage in response to a theft vignette, in Study 2, we complemented this study by actually enacting a theft in the laboratory and observing the behavioral reactions of the participants. As explained in the introduction, we assumed that the experiential characteristics of this situation should boost automatic instead of reflective responses. Accordingly, we expected that justice sensitivity—a personality variable that determines automatic attention for and the interpretation of norm violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213490032">2012</xref>)—should shape moral courage. By contrast, moral disengagement, self-efficacy, dispositional empathic concern, and social anxiety—variables that rather affect the reflective processes of assuming responsibility, assessing personal intervention skills, and weighing the costs and benefits of intervening—should be less relevant.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section21-0146167213490032">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>In return for 5 Euro, 80 undergraduate students enrolled in educational or social sciences (74% female) participated in a study that was ostensibly about learning and emotions. Ages ranged from 18 to 33 years (<italic>M</italic> = 21.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.47). All but two participants indicated German as their native language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0146167213490032">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited on campus. They were asked to fill out a personality questionnaire at home. For the laboratory sessions, one participant was scheduled at a time. However, on the recruitment lists, two people ostensibly took part in each session (the second person being a confederate, see below).</p>
<p>One week later, the procedure described by the vignette in Study 1 was put into effect. Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants were welcomed by a female experimenter and seated at a workstation. After reading the instructions, participants waited for an alleged other participant (the confederate). They were told that the study should begin at the same time for both participants to avoid distractions during the following learning task. During the waiting time, a mobile phone that was placed on the table right next to the participant rang. The experimenter asked the participant whether it was his/her phone and then answered the call. The experimenter pretended that the caller was the owner of the phone (another student) who had attended the experiment before and had forgotten the phone. The experimenter told this ostensible person to pick the phone up in the evening. After finishing the call, the experimenter again placed the phone on the table right next to the workstation of the participant. Note that by scheduling the phone call during participants’ waiting time, we aimed to maximize the standardization of the initial situation. Next, a female confederate arrived and was seated at the workstation next to the participant. Hence, the phone was situated between the participant and the confederate and was clearly visible to both of them. The confederate read the instructions, and the experiment began on both computers at the same time. For 5 min, participants worked on a learning task that consisted of three pages of text and images (about alcohol, biogas, and calcium carbonate). They were instructed to memorize the contents. Directly after the task began, the experimenter left the room.</p>
<p>After working on the memory task for 4 min, the confederate addressed the participant and asked whether the mobile phone belonged to him/her. Then the confederate put the mobile phone into her own bag. If the participant did not intervene at this point, the second part of the experimental task began automatically on the computer. For some minutes, they worked on a categorization task followed by a rating task. After these tasks, a 1-min break was implemented during which time the participants waited for the experimenter. Then the experimenter entered the room, asked whether everything was all right, and started the next part of the experiment on the computers. In the final phase of the study, participants answered questions about the memorized contents for 5 min. Finally, there was a control question that asked participants what they thought the study was about.</p>
<p>If a participant did not intervene by the end of the study, he/she was debriefed. Importantly, the experimenter ensured that potential questions of the participants were answered and that they felt good. If a participant intervened at an earlier point, he/she was immediately debriefed.</p>
<p>Before participants were dismissed, they filled out another questionnaire regarding whether they had already known the experimenter and/or the confederate before the study. For a subsample (<italic>n</italic> = 19), the same questions that were used in Study 1 as a paradigm check about participants’ perceptions of the theft situation were used (<italic>difficult</italic>: α = .69; <italic>immoral</italic>: α = .90).</p>

<title>Personality assessment</title>
<p>The questionnaire that participants filled out before the laboratory session contained the same personality measures as in Study 1 in a slightly different order. First, self-deception and other-deception were assessed as facets of social desirability. Second, victim sensitivity (α = .84), observer sensitivity (α = .83), beneficiary sensitivity (α = .84), and perpetrator sensitivity (α = .87) were assessed. Third, empathic concern (α = .66) was assessed. Fourth, extraversion (α = .67), agreeableness (α = −.09), conscientiousness (α = .47), neuroticism (α = .56), and openness (α = .44) were measured. Fifth, the scales for social anxiety (α = .85), sixth, for self-efficacy (α = .82), and seventh, for moral disengagement (α = .84) were used. Response options were the same as in Study 1, with the exception of self-efficacy, which had response options that ranged from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 3 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0146167213490032">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>After debriefing a participant, the confederate rated how strongly this person had intervened against the theft immediately after it occurred (<italic>immediate intervention</italic>: “How strongly did the participant protest, interrogate, or verbally attack you immediately after you pocketed the mobile phone?”) and during the following computer tasks until the 1-min break during which participant and confederate had to wait for the experimenter (<italic>later intervention</italic>: “How strongly did the participant protest, interrogate, or verbally attack you when you continued working on the computer tasks?”). Ratings were provided on 6-point rating scales from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very strongly</italic>). Due to high skewness (immediate intervention: 1.98; later intervention: 2.29), both dependent variables were dichotomized (0 = <italic>no intervention</italic>; 1 to 5 = <italic>intervention</italic>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>

<sec id="section26-0146167213490032">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The data of five participants had to be excluded from further analyses because of problems in the procedure (e.g., the phone did not ring). During the laboratory session, six participants reported suspicions about the cover story. Their data were also excluded. No participants indicated that they had known the confederate before. One participant indicated being acquainted with the experimenter. This person’s data were also excluded.</p>
<p>Among the remaining participants (<italic>N</italic> = 68), 18 persons (26.9%) protested immediately against the theft at least to some degree. Due to the intervention of two persons, the session could not continue and they were debriefed right away. Ten persons continued to protest, and two other persons began protesting during the following computer task (18.5%). Clearly, the percentage of intervention was low compared with the high degree of willingness to intervene reported in Study 1. Replicating the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer (2008)</xref>, participants appear to overestimate their moral courage when responding to vignettes. However, the intervention rate in our study is similar to that found in earlier studies involving a real theft situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213490032">Bickman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of the paradigm check on participants’ perceptions of the theft (<italic>n</italic> = 19) showed that they perceived it to be a strong norm violation (<italic>M</italic> = 4.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.72) and moderately difficult (<italic>M</italic> = 2.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.39).</p>
<p>Means and standard deviations for the personality variables, and zero-order correlations among these variables and the strengths of the immediate and later interventions are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167213490032">Table 3</xref>. Beneficiary sensitivity was significantly positively correlated with immediate intervention (<italic>r</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and later intervention (<italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> = .03). In addition, we found a significant positive correlation between other-deception and later intervention (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> = .047), but not with immediate intervention (<italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>ns</italic>). Unexpectedly, correlations of victim sensitivity (immediate: <italic>r</italic> = .08, <italic>ns</italic>; later: <italic>r</italic> = −.09, <italic>ns</italic>) and of observer sensitivity with the interventions (immediate: <italic>r</italic> = −.01, <italic>ns</italic>; later: <italic>r</italic> = −.05, <italic>ns</italic>) were not significant and close to zero. For perpetrator sensitivity, there was a positive but nonsignificant correlation with immediate intervention (<italic>r</italic> = .14, <italic>ns</italic>) and later intervention (<italic>r</italic> = .16, <italic>ns</italic>). Of the remaining personality variables, only moral disengagement had a noticeable but nonsignificant correlation with immediate intervention (<italic>r</italic> = −.19, <italic>ns</italic>) and later intervention (<italic>r</italic> = −.20, <italic>ns</italic>).</p>

No other effect was significant. In sum, even when controlling for other personality variables, beneficiary sensitivity uniquely predicted the probability of immediate intervention and showed a tendency toward predicting later intervention.</p>
<p>Besides this robust effect of beneficiary sensitivity, only conscientiousness had a significant negative impact on immediate intervention in the context of the other personality variables. It is possible that more conscientious people were reluctant to stop working on the learning task to protest against the theft in comparison with less conscientious people.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Moral courage is a kind of prosocial behavior that the healthy functioning of democratic societies depends on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213490032">Kennedy, 1955</xref>). The present research was aimed at contributing to the scientific knowledge about its psychological determinants. We selected candidates for personality predictors based on a seminal process model of helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané &amp; Darley, 1970</xref>). Prior research has indicated that psychological mechanisms of moral courage may differ substantially from those of helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213490032">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213490032">Greitemeyer et al., 2006</xref>). By identifying the personality variables that are relevant at each stage in the psychological process of helping, we systematically tested whether psychological processes at these stages are also involved in moral courage. To our knowledge, our studies are the first to test a comprehensive set of dispositional variables as potential determinants of moral courage, including for exploratory purposes social desirability and the Big Five factors. Importantly, we argue that our approach complements attempts to investigate situational factors of moral courage because the two kinds of factors are assumed to shape the same kind of psychological processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, our studies allowed us to compare determinants of the self-reported willingness to show moral courage in reaction to a vignette (Study 1) with the determinants of an actual intervention against a realistic norm violation (Study 2). We argued that situations of real norm violations are highly emotional and arousing such that it seems likely that a rather spontaneous and uncontrolled experiential mode of processing may become dominant in these situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213490032">Epstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167213490032">Skarlicki &amp; Rupp, 2010</xref>). In Study 2, we assessed immediate and later interventions against a theft. Whereas immediate intervention required the interruption of the learning task that participants were instructed to work on while the experimenter had left the room, later intervention occurred during the few minutes that followed the learning task when participants were occupied with categorization and rating tasks. We argue that in both phases of the study, a reflective mode of processing was unlikely because participants were engaged in secondary tasks (memorizing academic texts, categorization, ratings). Accordingly, we predicted that the stages of the adapted helping model that involve highly reflective processes, such as assuming responsibility (Stage 3), assessing one’s own intervention skills (Stage 4), or subjective cost–benefit analysis (Stage 5), should be less relevant for actual moral courage compared with the stages of detecting and interpreting a norm violation (Stages 1 and 2), which can be expected to happen quickly and effortlessly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213490032">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167213490032">Luo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213490032">Stefanics et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, it seems plausible that the relevant processes may not be introspectively accessible. In contrast to a real moral courage situation, the self-reported willingness to intervene against a norm violation described in a vignette should rather depend on reflective processes.</p>
<p>Consistent with these predictions, moral disengagement, self-efficacy beliefs, and social anxiety were significantly correlated with self-reported moral courage intentions (Study 1) but not with actual moral courage (Study 2). In Study 1, people high in dispositional moral disengagement who tend to use cognitive strategies to deny their own responsibility (Stage 3) indicated being less willing to intervene against the described theft than people low in moral disengagement. People with strong generalized self-efficacy beliefs who saw themselves as capable of coping effectively with challenges in everyday life (Stage 4) were more willing to intervene than people who scored low in self-efficacy. People high in social anxiety who tend to focus on the negative consequences of an intervention (Stage 5) reported less willingness to intervene than people low in social anxiety. As the theft was described to happen without further bystanders or cues raising reputational concerns (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213490032">Garcia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167213490032">van Bommel et al., 2012</xref>), this negative effect of social anxiety is in line with recent findings on bystander intervention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213490032">Karakashian et al., 2006</xref>). In accordance with practical approaches to foster moral courage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213490032">Jonas &amp; Brandstätter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213490032">Pfetsch et al., 2011</xref>), in a multiple regression model controlling for social desirability (Model 2), self-efficacy was the most important predictor with a unique effect on moral courage intentions.</p>
<p>By contrast, when implementing a realistic norm violation in the laboratory (Study 2), only justice sensitivity from the beneficiary perspective was a significant correlate of actual moral courage. More specifically, beneficiary sensitivity predicted the probability of immediate intervention and a tendency toward later intervention even when other personality variables were controlled for. Justice sensitivity has been shown to shape rather fast processes of attention and interpretation in relation to justice norm violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213490032">2012</xref>). Thus, persons high in beneficiary sensitivity can be assumed to be quick to detect a norm violation (e.g., a theft) and interpret the situation in this regard (Stages 1 and 2). These rapid processes located at the first two stages in the process model adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213490032">Latané and Darley (1970)</xref> appear to be the most relevant for determining whether a person will actually stop a norm violation from happening.</p>
<p>By separately assessing observer sensitivity, victim sensitivity, beneficiary sensitivity, and perpetrator sensitivity and testing their impact on moral courage, we acknowledged the different perspectives that witnesses of a norm violation can adopt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213490032">Mikula, 1980</xref>). Different from our expectations, observer sensitivity did not determine moral courage. As we argued in the introduction, observing an injustice should trigger moral outrage, thus motivating a person to intervene. However, the perspective of a neutral observer might be difficult to maintain as witnesses easily become involved as agents in a situation that requires bystander intervention.</p>
<p>In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al.’s (2010)</xref> findings, victim sensitivity did not predict intervention. We had expected that a high readiness to adopt a victim perspective would inhibit intervention. However, victim-sensitive persons appeared to experience contradicting motivational tendencies: A strong personal concern for justice may have competed with the concern to prevent one’s own victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213490032">Gollwitzer et al., 2005</xref>). In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al. (2010)</xref>, such a motivational conflict could have been less pronounced because there was no acute norm violation that the intervention (signing a petition against a right-wing extremist political party) was directed against. Thus, a strong justice concern may have been less relevant than in the present theft context.</p>
<p>Our results show that the degree to which a person spontaneously perceives him- or herself as passively involved in a norm violation (beneficiary sensitivity) determines whether this person will intervene. This finding is surprising because theoretically, a beneficiary perspective may appear irrelevant when a bystander witnesses a norm violation as he or she has no direct benefit from it. However, previous research has indicated that beneficiary-sensitive persons tend to focus on their relative advantages compared with disadvantaged persons or groups even if their own situation is not causally linked to others’ misfortunes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213490032">Gollwitzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213490032">Lotz et al., 2011</xref>). For example, persons with higher beneficiary sensitivity were found to feel guiltier about physically unattractive people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213490032">Gollwitzer et al., 2005</xref>). In our theft situation, beneficiary-sensitive persons may have readily compared their own situation with the alleged victim’s situation, and this comparison may have motivated the intervention to stand in solidarity with the victim. Importantly, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213490032">Baumert et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213490032">2012</xref>), beneficiary sensitivity appears to involve these interpretational patterns in a rather automatized form so that they shape behavior in highly arousing situations that require spontaneous action. Our finding that beneficiary sensitivity was most clearly associated with immediate intervention and only marginally with later intervention lends further support to this interpretation.</p>
<p>Finally, perpetrator sensitivity was not correlated with moral courage in our studies. As we argued, the individual readiness to anticipate one’s own norm violations may involve a motivational conflict because nonintervention and intervention imply one’s own transgressions that perpetrator-sensitive persons aim to avoid.</p>
<sec id="section28-0146167213490032">
<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Clearly, there is a need to directly address our speculations regarding the dominance of experiential processing in real situations that require moral courage in contrast to the reflective processes that guide responses to moral courage vignettes. The notion that automatic processes of detection and interpretation become dominant in situations requiring moral courage because of high arousal could be tested by using physiological measures to assess inter- and intraindividual variation in arousal as a reaction to a moral courage vignette compared with a real norm violation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the assumed motivational and emotional tendencies involved in the different perspectives of justice sensitivity call for systematic research on the mediating processes that drive moral courage. The most interesting challenge in this direction of research will be the unobtrusive assessment of immediate reactions to an observed norm violation. Emotional reactions have played only a minor role in previous research on moral courage. Besides anger and outrage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213490032">Niesta Kayser et al., 2010</xref>), we expect that self-focused moral emotions such as guilt might also enhance moral courage in response to real norm violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213490032">Nelissen &amp; Zeelenberg, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This kind of research on mediating processes could complement the present studies by further investigating the impact of different perspectives adopted by a witness of a norm violation. In the present research, we took a first step in this direction by using the different perspectives of justice sensitivity as personality predictors of moral courage. A future study may incorporate personality predictors and situational manipulations of the perspective taken. It would be very interesting to see whether the experimental induction of a beneficiary perspective triggers the same effects as those observed here for dispositional beneficiary sensitivity. This way, the limitations inherent in correlational research, as in the present studies, can be overcome and causal assumptions can be tested. Combining research on situational and dispositional determinants of psychological processes involved in moral courage can even tap the full potential of complementing personality and social psychological approaches by revealing not only main effects but also synergistic interaction effects of functionally equivalent person and situation variables (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213490032">Garcia et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>From a personality perspective, our approach might be improved in future studies by not only relying on short measures of the Big Five personality factors, but instead investigating the relevance of more comprehensive models, such as the HEXACO personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167213490032">Ashton &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the HEXACO model includes honesty/humility as a sixth factor that captures, among others, individual inclinations toward fairness, which might be of particular relevance in the context of moral courage.</p>
<p>To develop a valid process model of moral courage, our results must be shown to generalize to different situations and forms of moral courage. Theoretically, relevant situations encompass a broad range of types of norm violations and levels of potential negative consequences. As our paradigm checks in both studies showed, the theft situation was perceived as highly immoral, but only as moderately difficult. Research on moral courage in more difficult and risky situations is thus highly desirable and of practical importance. A further relevant characteristic by which situations requiring moral courage may differ is the necessity of reacting immediately or disrupting secondary tasks (such as talking on the phone), and thus the degree to which the situation allows for the impact of reflective processes. It could be assumed that reporting fraudulent processes within an organization (whistle-blowing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213490032">Keenan, 2002</xref>) or reporting to the police as a witness of a transgression occur in settings that allow the agent to deliberate about the best reaction. By contrast, stopping a thief or reprimanding someone who is shouting discriminating slogans imply spontaneous reactions without the option of undisturbed reflection. Based on the findings of Study 2, behavior in the latter situations can be expected to be determined by rather quick and effortless processes of attention and interpretation. However, in the former situations that allow for courageous reactions after a phase of deliberation, cognitively demanding processes like subjective cost–benefit analyses may gain more importance. Future research could adopt the present approach to test a broader range of norm violations and directly compare intervention intentions as reactions to vignettes with actual moral courage in real situations.</p>
<p>Finally, the generalizability of our findings might be limited in several ways due to the fact that our participants were German. In different cultures, the social phenomenon of uninvolved bystanders who intervene to stop the norm violation of another person might be labeled quite differently (e.g., <italic>Zivilcourage, moral courage, courage civique</italic>), or perhaps no particular term might even exist in a language. Such linguistic differences are psychologically relevant if they reflect a differential salience of the phenomenon across cultures. So far, little is known about cross-cultural differences in the occurrence of what we define as moral courage in the present article. Linguistic differences are also relevant for psychological research because the exact definitions of the social phenomenon may vary. Whereas in general, <italic>moral courage</italic> as well as <italic>Zivilcourage</italic> are confined to the defense of basic human and democratic values, an argument remains with regard to whether behavioral means that in turn violate such values (e.g., murder) should be excluded from the definition or not (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213490032">Jonas &amp; Brandstätter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167213490032">Skitka, 2011</xref>). Diverging definitions may result in the psychological investigation of systematically different instances of social behavior. Similarly, cross-cultural differences in the endorsement of social norms will necessarily affect what is perceived as moral courage and what is not. Nevertheless, independent of what is seen as moral within a culture, justice sensitivity might affect the support of social norms in a similar way. Thus, the cultural invariance of psychological processes that shape courageous bystander interventions against norm violations has to be directly tested. Specifically, cross-cultural research can establish whether determinants of quick and effortless detection and interpretation of norm violations shape moral courage in different cultural contexts as they did in the present studies. In this way, a valid and cross-culturally generalizable process model of moral courage can be developed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In light of our findings, it seems highly desirable that research on moral courage makes the effort to investigate behavior in realistic situations that require bystander intervention. As has been indicated by prior research on moral courage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213490032">Voigtländer, 2008</xref>), findings on self-reported intentions in fictitious situations cannot easily be generalized to actual behavior. Our results show that the processes involved in reactions to moral courage vignettes differ substantially from the processes involved in actual behavior. Particularly for moral courage, relevant situations can be assumed to be experienced rather infrequently and to be characterized by high arousal so that relevant processes may not be introspectively accessible.</p>
<p>Despite the economic and ethical difficulties of realizing norm violations in the laboratory, this kind of research on the psychological determinants and barriers of moral courage is important. Our studies provide the first evidence for specific personality determinants of real intervention against a theft in the laboratory. The pattern of results suggests that the automatic processes involved in the detection and interpretation of norm violations may be highly relevant, whereas reflective processes, such as assessing one’s own competence to intervene, may not determine the probability of intervention. These findings have important implications for the design of training programs aimed at fostering moral courage. Such trainings will be most effective if they address these automatic processes, for example, by requiring students to practice moral courage in realistic situations.</p>
<p>In summary, we revealed robust effects of justice sensitivity from the beneficiary perspective on moral courage assessed in a standardized situation involving a real norm violation. Personality variables that were previously found to determine helping appeared to be irrelevant for actual moral courage. By contrast, moral disengagement, social anxiety, and particularly self-efficacy were predictors of highly reflective self-reported moral courage intentions. We hope to motivate further research in this area to develop a full-blown process model of moral courage.</p>

<p>In total, the questionnaire contained eight descriptions of different situations in which a social norm was violated, for example, people cutting in line in front of a child in a supermarket. Results for these vignettes are not reported because we could not provide direct comparisons with behavioral observations in which the respective situations could actually take place. By contrast, the theft vignette was specifically designed to match the standardized situation used in the laboratory. Descriptions and data for the remaining vignettes can be obtained from the authors upon request.</p>
