<title>Background</title>
<p>Recruitment is the most common failure point for clinical studies, with recruitment failure adversely affecting science, dollar costs, human capital, and the ethical risk–benefit trade-off to study participants. Added problems attend recruitment of special and/or challenging candidate populations, particularly in settings of sparse recruitment resources. Obstacles to study recruitment and participation of ill Gulf War veterans (GWVs) include health barriers, work and family obligations, mistrust of the medical/scientific community, and challenges to identifying/reaching potential participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512470040">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>We sought to identify and implement a minimal-cost multipronged recruitment approach for a small single-site (&lt;50 participants) study of a special group, ill GWVs, with approaches substantially applicable to other recruitment settings and larger multisite studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512470040">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Categories of recruitment approach included directed as well as general media, collaborations with support groups/interest groups, local free advertising resources (Craigslist and Backpage), physician outreach, Internet-based approaches, and referrals from study participants and screenees. We describe the subcategories and yield of each approach within each approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512470040">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Each approach contributed candidates to the final recruitment tally, with the largest fractional contribution by directed media (52%). Among the remainder, no other individual approach was clearly dominant (largest contribution: 13%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512470040">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Special population subsamples present special challenges; all approaches cited may not be useful in all settings and subpopulations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512470040">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A multipronged suite of minimal-cost approaches led to successful recruitment to target for this single-site clinical trial for a special population with significant recruitment challenges. It additionally yielded a nation-wide corpus of several hundred individuals interested in participation in future studies of GWVs. While certain approaches produced disproportionate yield, it was not possible to predict these a priori. We suggest that this model, which incorporates a suite of approaches, and delineates backup approaches in the event of recruitment shortfall, may provide a template applicable to recruitment of other special samples in settings of limited resources and also is germane to cost-effective recruitment in studies more generally.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Recruitment is perhaps the most common failure point of clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512470040">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512470040">2</xref>]. When studies fail, it is not only the case that the significant resources devoted to the study have been squandered. Additionally, any risks imposed on participants have ceased to be balanced by potential benefits, adversely affecting the ethical trade-off of study participation. Many studies underestimate recruitment challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512470040">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512470040"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512470040">5</xref>], extend recruitment periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512470040">6</xref>], or incur higher than anticipated study costs to achieve recruitment targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512470040">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512470040">8</xref>]. Some studies are forced to broaden inclusion criteria to facilitate recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512470040">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512470040">10</xref>] or reduce the size of the overall sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512470040">11</xref>], affecting intended study design and power. There has, in consequence, been a call for researchers to ‘report detailed recruitment strategies’ and costs so that other researchers may benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512470040">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Recruitment challenges may be amplified for special populations. Minorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512470040">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512470040">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512470040">14</xref>], military veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512470040">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512470040">16</xref>], and persons with uncommon health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512470040">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512470040">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512470040">18</xref>] represent examples. The particular barriers to recruitment vary with the population, but can include health limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512470040">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512470040">20</xref>], workplace and family obligations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512470040">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512470040">21</xref>], inconvenience associated with study time and transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512470040">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512470040">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512470040">22</xref>], in addition to fear and/or mistrust of research and researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512470040">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774512470040">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512470040">24</xref>]. For candidate participants who are aware of a study, each of these obstacles may limit enthusiasm for participating. However, prior to making that decision, the prospective participant first must become aware of the opportunity to participate in research. There are obstacles to reaching and accessing special populations to alert them to the study opportunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774512470040">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512470040">26</xref>]. Sparse resources also amplify recruitment challenges; study investigators have cited per enrollee recruitment costs ranging from US$143 to US$1500 depending on the sample and the approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512470040">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512470040">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Gulf War veterans (GWVs) represent a group for which study participation may be difficult and who face some of the challenges cited earlier. Most GWVs are men of working age with families to support and thus typically are expected to generate income for the household. In addition, those experiencing the chronic multisymptom health problems that have been designated as Gulf War illness (GWI) often must cope with episodic exacerbations of their ongoing health issues, which may pose direct impediments to research participation. Veterans also may be reluctant to jeopardize jobs in a difficult economy by additional missed work time for research participation, particularly when exacerbations of their health condition already lead to instances of missed work. Because of the multisymptom nature of their illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512470040">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512470040">30</xref>], there is no single medical specialty whose practitioners these individuals typically see, limiting utility of health-care specialists as recruitment enablers.</p>
<p>Minimal-cost approaches are important for research in an increasingly cost-conscious fiscal environment. We sought to identify and implement a multipronged recruitment approach to achieve recruitment goals for a modest-size clinical study of a special sample in a setting of severely restricted recruitment resources. Although we previously recruited to target (and beyond) for a single-site study of 1000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512470040">31</xref>], the present recruitment target of 40 GWVs who meet the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Kansas inclusion criteria for GWI bore different <italic>but not clearly lesser</italic> challenges, due to the special group of participants who were sought, and constraints on our recruitment resources. We report on our strategy, which we believe is portable (in approach if not detail) to other research settings in which special participant populations are targeted under limited resources, and which may complement costlier approaches to enhance yield and cost-effective recruitment for studies entailing less restrictive eligibility criteria, and/or under fewer resource restrictions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We sought to examine the effects of supplementation with Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) on the symptoms of GWI via a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. The study involved a 2-week placebo run-in (enabling prospective participants to better understand what participation entailed), at which point those who remained interested were randomized. This was followed by four (3.5 ± 0.5) month treatment periods with total time commitment of 12.5–16.5 months. We sought men and women who were veterans of the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War and met both CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512470040">29</xref>] and the Kansas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512470040">30</xref>] criteria for GWI. Inclusion was thus restrictive, necessitating deployment to the Persian Gulf between August 1990 and July 1991; chronic symptoms commencing during or after Gulf participation of at least moderate severity and/or multiple symptoms within the category, for at least three of the six categories of pain, neurological, fatigue–sleep, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and dermatological (Kansas criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512470040">30</xref>]; chronic symptoms (at least 6 months) in at least two of the three domains of fatigue, mood–cognition, and musculoskeletal (CDC criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512470040">29</xref>]; and no exclusionary condition (e.g., other diagnoses like lupus or multiple sclerosis that could be responsible for similar multisymptom problems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512470040">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Study participants would need to make six study visits during their participation; to minimize the burden of participation, geographic proximity was considered when assessing eligibility. Each participant was allocated Q10 100 mg, Q10 300 mg, or identical placebo, with all participants taking one pill three times a day, for periods of 3.5 months for four treatment periods, one on each dose of Q10 and two on placebo, in a balanced randomized crossover design. The recruitment period lasted from May 2008 to August 2009. The first run-in visit was on 31 July 2008, and the last run-in visit was 6 August 2009, at which time recruitment ended. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1740774512470040">Appendix A</xref> outlines the elements of study visits.</p>
<p>Our initial recruitment target was 40 GWVs residing in the general San Diego area who met inclusion criteria for GWI, but not exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512470040">Table 1</xref>), and were willing to take part in a year-long crossover treatment trial. The study and all study materials were approved by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Institutional Review Board (IRB) as well as the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Office of Research Protection. All participants gave written informed consent. Specifics of recruitment approaches and the time frames in which they were implemented are described below.</p>

<p>Study personnel functioned in multiple roles. The study coordinator and research assistant worked with the principal investigator (PI) to develop recruitment approaches, assisted with IRB submissions, managed recruitment, screened all candidates, managed scheduling, conducted all study visits with participants, created the database, and oversaw data entry; they devoted 80% and 100% full-time effort, respectively, to the trial.</p>
<sec id="section9-1740774512470040">
<title>Approaches to reaching potentially interested and eligible individuals</title>
<p>We sought to identify and implement a suite of minimal-cost approaches that, in aggregate, would achieve our recruitment goals; we recognized that any individual approach might yield few or no candidates. We focused on low-cost approaches because available study funds were anticipated to be required for other study resources, including personnel time to implement recruitment approaches. The recruitment approaches we targeted were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1740774512470040" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Special interest/support groups (i.e., veterans groups).</italic> We identified and communicated with local and regional veterans groups, attended meetings, introduced information about the study, and met with veterans. We also identified national veterans groups, including but not limited to groups focused on GWVs, reasoning that by reaching a national audience we would reach the regional audience. Additionally, we contacted and elicited advice from GWV patient advocates. This recruitment approach was maintained for the duration of the recruitment period, though some specific recruitment events occurred on a one-time basis. Each meeting (on the order of one every 1–2 months) required 2–4 h of personnel time.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Local media with a nontargeted audience</italic>. We identified local media outlets (media targeting the San Diego region or focused on local communities within San Diego), for example, print, radio, television, and so on, seeking to capitalize on media stories about the study to reach veterans as part of reaching the broader community. We did not seek national press attention, via nontargeted media, for this single-site study. We worked with UCSD Health Sciences Communications department to generate an IRB-approved press release regarding the study. In addition to the possibility that some veterans would be reached by this approach directly, other persons hearing of the study might pass study information along to veterans and thereby increase awareness of the study. Media attention as an approach lasted throughout the recruitment period, though articles and radio interviews were one-time events. This approach required little personnel time, primarily for interviews with the PI.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>National media with a targeted audience.</italic> We identified specific publications targeting veterans, veterans with health problems, and GWVs. We contacted each regarding publication of information about the study. Our first recruitment approach, consultations with veterans groups and GWV patient advocates, as well as Internet searches, were important tools to identify these targeted media. An advertisement about this study was run at no cost, in the November/December 2008 issue of <italic>DAV Magazine</italic> (‘The official voice of the Disabled American Veterans and DAV Auxiliary’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dav.org/news/Magazine.aspx">http://www.dav.org/news/Magazine.aspx</ext-link>)). Calls from interested veterans came in over the following 3 months. Candidates related that this magazine is sometimes found in Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center waiting rooms; thus, this story resulted in a small number of calls following the initial 3-month period.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Local free advertising resources.</italic> We identified and used free local posting resources such as Craigslist and Backpage to post weekly IRB-approved informative flyers about the study. We also identified venues that would permit free hardcopy posting of flyers including local community colleges, UCSD-affiliated hospitals, and UCSD clinical research centers. Craigslist and Backpage listings were updated on a weekly basis for the duration of recruitment. Flyers were posted at the beginning of the study and remained posted. Flyers and web postings required only minimal personnel cost to draft and upload.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Local physician outreach.</italic> We sought to inform UCSD primary care physicians, who may also see veterans in a VA primary care setting, about our study and its recruitment needs. This approach included a presentation describing the study design and rationale. We encouraged physicians to alert their patients to the opportunity to participate. Additionally, we provided potentially interested physicians with IRB-approved study brochures and flyers to pass to their patients. This presentation to UCSD/VA primary care physicians was a one-time occurrence early in the study but occasional referrals based on it occurred later. This approach required approximately 5 h of preparation and presentation time.</p>

<italic>Creation of study-specific Internet sites.</italic> In efforts to make our study accessible to the public and increase awareness, posts to GW-specific websites and blogs were also made on a one-time basis. In addition to seeking postings on others’ sites (item 3), we created an IRB-approved study website as well as IRB-approved study Facebook and MySpace pages, so that veterans ‘googling’ GWI might come across our study. (We did not incorporate Twitter and Google Buzz for this study, but would consider doing so if a similar study were commencing now.) In addition, IRB-approved postings were placed on GWV-specific websites including National Gulf War Resource website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gulfwar.org">www.gulfwar.org</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil">www.gulflink.osd.mil</ext-link>. These postings were kept technically simple for reasons of personnel time and computer experience. Study-specific websites were created and maintained throughout the recruitment period by a work–study student at minimal cost to the study.</p>

<p>
<italic>Referrals.</italic> At each run-in and study visit, we encouraged candidates and participants to alert other GWVs who might be interested to the study. We also collaborated with another study of veterans by providing access to IRB-approved materials to personnel of the other study and by referring screenees not qualified for our study. Potential participants who contacted us were sent IRB-approved materials. Little staff time was required for aspects of this approach.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Utilization of a prior study database.</italic> Emails and informative letters were sent to participants in a prior study (that did not target veterans) who (1) had indicated willingness to be recontacted for other studies conducted by our group, (2) had indicated they were veterans (deployment status or term not specified), and (3) were of an age suggesting possible compatibility with Gulf War participation. This approach was implemented early in the study and was a one-time occurrence. Approximately 2 days were spent by two study team members to identify candidates and prepare mailings.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>During a screening call, each screenee was asked how he or she heard about the study; the method was confirmed via a checklist of approaches with a write-in option at the run-in visit of the candidate. This information was compiled to yield the data for enrollment method success.</p>

<title>Other recruitment and retention considerations</title>
<p>The recruitment process does not end when candidates have heard about the study and made contact with the study group. It is still necessary that they are deemed eligible, and that they then elect to participate. Positive interactions with staff are paramount. Attitudes by study staff that embody respect for subjects and their contributions are aligned with humanistic values, and also represent good research practice, helping sustain participants’ enthusiasm for research participation in the event they may be candidates for future studies. Because veterans comprise a working population in a tight economy, candidates are, reasonably, concerned about the impact of participation on their jobs. We advised eligible candidates that we would strive to be flexible in scheduling and would permit rescheduling to accommodate workplace and family obligations, as well as unpredictable health problems. This assurance was perceived by study staff to have been important for many enrollees. Maintaining such flexibility, including last minute rescheduling, imposes a significant staff time burden, due to the many facets of preparation that go into each visit, including, for this study, amending the scheduling for UCSD’s General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). The flexibility shown by the UCSD National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded GCRC and their exceptional staff, who worked hard to accommodate participant rescheduling requests, was crucial to this process. However, the relative impact of these factors is difficult to quantify. Therefore, our results focus on the number screened and enrolled by each information source. The vast majority of those who were screened via telephone but not enrolled either lived too far away to participate or did not meet eligibility criteria.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We closed recruitment after enrolling and randomizing 46 ill GWVs at our single site (15% beyond our original target). Participants officially were enrolled and randomized following their ‘baseline’ (second) visit. Some screened and eligible candidates did not return for the baseline visit. Randomized GWVs at the time of enrollment were 36–63 years of age, with 85% male, 60% Caucasian, and 63% employed; 91% had at least some college education.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512470040">Table 1</xref> shows specific tools implemented within each recruitment approach and, by approach category, the number who were screened, who completed a run-in visit, and who enrolled in the study. One <italic>Directed Media</italic> approach, involving an item in the <italic>DAV Magazine</italic>, provided a clear plurality of candidates, with 348 potential participants screened for eligibility, and contributed 24 enrollees (52%). This high-yield approach was implemented at no cost beyond limited staff time. The ratio of prospects screened to enrollees was high, because the item ran nationally but study recruitment was confined to local and regional residents. This approach provided a roster of interested and eligible veterans in the event that a nation-wide approach was required. All candidates were asked whether they wished to be notified of future studies of GWVs. For our research group that hopes to conduct future studies in persons with GWI, securing contact information for prospective participants can produce a highly cost-effective recruitment resource to serve the accrual needs for a long-term research agenda. An existing pool of research candidates may reflect favorably on funding applications and benefit the research study, once funded, by providing a head start on recruitment. Although other military and veterans’ periodicals were identified, we were unsuccessful in efforts to establish contact with several of those identified.</p>
<p>The <italic>Local Physician Outreach</italic> and <italic>Referrals</italic> approaches were responsible for the next largest number of interested candidates, leading to 11% and 13% of the enrollees, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512470040">Table 1</xref>, some individual approaches had small yields in recruitment. However, the multiple approaches, although individually of low yield, were implemented with the expectation that each would increase awareness of the study and result in contacts with some candidates. Multiple approaches in aggregate were required to achieve the enrollment goal.</p>
<p>
<italic>Added</italic> costs of these recruitment approaches are difficult to estimate, but were small because time requirements were flexible and could be intercalated between scheduled activities. We estimated overall staff effort requirements, taking into account that there would be high demands on study personnel time during certain study periods, for example, preparation of IRB submissions, start-up activities, and database development early in the study, and that less time-critical activities could be deferred to less busy periods. During participant treatment and follow-up, reschedulings and cancellations were a reality, requiring that staff be available beyond times when participant-related activities were underway. Except for participation in veterans group meetings, which were at designated times, all of our approaches permitted implementation around other obligations, as staff were available. Regarding direct recruitment expenditures, Internet costs were budgeted at US$55 per month for 36 months for a total cost of US$1980; a total of 339 recruitment mailers were sent at US$0.60 (accounts for printing cost, envelope, and stamp), totaling US$203.40. Imprint costs for flyers and pamphlets given to candidates, at US$0.10 per copy, totaled &lt;US$100.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A recruitment plan entailing a suite of individually low-cost recruitment approaches was successful in recruiting to target (46 recruited of an initial target of 40 participants) for a special population in a single-site study at minimal cost, enabling available resources to be directed primarily to other aspects of the study. The approach categories included generation of Internet sites (e.g., study-specific website, Facebook, and MySpace), use of free advertising resources (e.g., Craigslist and BackPage), use of local ‘general’ media and national ‘directed’ (e.g., veteran-oriented) media, and collaborations with physicians and patient interest/advocacy groups. (By ‘local general media’, we refer to region-specific media that do not selectively target the group of interest, such as a TV interview with a local station KUSI.) These approaches are, in broad outline, substantially portable to other recruitment settings, provided the venues <italic>within</italic> categories are tailored to the specific specialized sample (e.g., the patient support/advocacy organizations and the media directed to the specialized population).</p>
<p>There exist potential sources of recruitment that would be more highly specific to our intended sample of GWV, such as recruitment at the VA Healthcare Center and use of military databases, but we did not make use of these resources, providing approaches that may be relatively generalizable. (We did develop a contingency plan in the event of inadequacy of our multipronged minimal-cost approach by identifying three backup approaches that included the following: recruitment through VA San Diego Healthcare Center; application to use data from the Defense Manpower Data Center to provide discharge addresses for Gulf War service persons; and expansion of the study to a nation-wide study, allowing remote participation (with mailing of study medication and so on). For each, the required reallocation of resources would have affected other elements of the study. These approaches were not implemented but are mentioned to emphasize that recruitment backup plans were in place and were part of recruitment planning.)</p>
<p>While an example of one recruitment approach (a notice in a specific veterans’ journal) proved particularly successful, approximately half of the total recruitment came from other sources. It was the aggregated yield of multiple complementary approaches that enabled recruitment targets to be met and surpassed. For instance, the <italic>DAV Magazine</italic> was identified – serendipitously – as a consequence of the broader recruitment approach by the suggestion of the journal by a GWV advocate. (We did not have prior knowledge that it would disproportionately contribute to recruitment.)</p>
<p>Of these approaches, meetings with veteran interest groups entailed time from staff and required costs for gas and weekend time of staff (these meetings were distant from our study site). Additionally, GWVs proved to be sparsely represented at veterans’ group meetings (potentially influenced by their age, working/family status, and health compromise, factors that figured into study participation as well), which resulted in low direct recruitment from this approach. However, contacts made at those meetings with dedicated veteran advocates were essential and contributed to the identification of media resources (e.g., leading to the <italic>DAV Magazine</italic> posting). Moreover, contacts with people who would become valued participants and others did occur.</p>
<p>Current publications on recruitment of specialized populations often focus on the need for study personnel to integrate into the population of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774512470040">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774512470040">33</xref>], and to forge and sustain relationships with its leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512470040">12</xref>]. This can be an effective approach, but also personnel-time intensive and therefore costly, an obstacle when resources are limited and cost-efficiency is at a premium. Moreover, it requires that there exists, in a meaningful form, a community of the group in question into which one may integrate, which may not always be the case.</p>
<p>Our findings seek to address the call that researchers ‘report detailed recruitment strategies’ and costs so that other researchers may benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512470040">12</xref>], particularly for difficult-to-recruit specialized populations. Interest in this study from veterans around the nation suggests that the approaches used could likely have been broadened to a multisite trial. Paralleling findings from some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774512470040">34</xref>], media recruitment, specifically targeted media, was an important and cost-effective tool, with 56% of our participants recruited through targeted and general media. Referrals and physician outreach contributed 24% of our enrolled participants; other studies have also reported success with these strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512470040">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512470040">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512470040">36</xref>].</p>
<p>The yield of Internet approaches was modest; however, the low cost of this approach remains a strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774512470040">37</xref>], and success with Internet-based recruitment approaches has been reported in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774512470040">38</xref>]. The success of Internet recruitment strategies may depend on age and generation of recruitment population of interest (again, our veterans were 36–63 years of age), as well as other features of the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774512470040">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Higher cost approaches were not an option for the present study, though we recognize that they may be an important tool in some settings. In one study, the most cost-effective approach was direct mailing, at a cost of US$143 per participant, while the highest cost approach, television advertising, exceeded US$1500 per participant enrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512470040">27</xref>]. Another study included Internet ads, ads in mass-transit vehicles, and movie theater previews as well as radio and television ads, with per-recruit costs of up to US$584 per participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512470040">28</xref>]. In that study, the most efficient approaches, with the highest ‘efficacy index’, were physician referrals and flyers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512470040">28</xref>], which were included in the present study, but were exceeded in yield and cost-effectiveness by media approaches. One study suggests the use of volunteer staff to assist in the recruitment effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774512470040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. Each specialized sample has its own characteristics and challenges, thus findings from this sample need not generalize in detail, and elements of the approach outlined here might not apply in all settings. However, we deferred implementing the recruitment approaches that are relatively specific to this group (retaining them as backup approaches), enhancing relative generalizability of the approach portrayed. In general, the concepts reported are broadly applicable. Concepts represented include (1) combining general and specific outreach (Craigslist vs veterans’ publications); (2) combining local and national outreach; (3) striving to reach patients via a range of relevant interest groups − for example, patients directly, advocates, media, friends/family, and physicians; and (4) using media and Internet to complement more traditional approaches.</p>
<p>Recruitment strategies with a direct dollar cost such as mass mailings and advertising (e.g., radio, television, paid Internet ads, mass transit, and movie theater previews) were not included and may be possible (and necessary) for some studies. Information on these approaches can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512470040">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512470040">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512470040">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512470040">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774512470040">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512470040"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512470040">43</xref>]. Moreover, the low-cost approaches focused upon here can complement higher cost approaches, extending recruitment yield for studies with a greater recruitment target and more generous recruitment budget.</p>
<p>This study involved a comparatively modest recruitment target, but recruitment remained challenging due to the specialized population, the single-site nature of the study, and restricted recruitment resources. Results might not generalize to multisite studies or those seeking larger samples. However, the sizeable response of interested prospective participants from outside our region suggests that nationalizing such an approach, and expanding the sample, would be feasible.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Aggressive implementation of a multipronged recruitment approach, capitalizing on a range of distinct efforts encompassing general and directed media (regional and national), meetings with (and presentations to) physicians and target-population special interest groups, use of Internet resources, and free advertisement sites provided a minimal-cost approach to meet participant recruitment targets for our clinical trial. This approach may provide a useful template to enhance cost-efficient recruitment for many studies, particularly those targeting special populations.</p>

<title>Study visits</title>
<p>Participants were seen six times throughout the study. They were first screened via telephone call and, if deemed eligible, then asked to come to the study site for a run-in visit. During the run-in visit, consent for phase 1 (detailed screening) was obtained, eligibility and interest in participating were reassessed, phase 2 consent was obtained for those eligible and interested, and eligible candidates were asked to sign a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver. Participants completed intake surveys (demographics, health history, habits, medications, family history, and exposures). At this and all visits, participants completed a symptom survey, General Self-Rated Health item, physical function testing via Summary Performance Score and 6-min walk, cognitive testing, and assessment instruments for pain, sleep, and fatigue. At all visits, physiological measures were procured (height, weight, waist, and blood pressure), and participants underwent phlebotomy and gave a urine sample. At all visits, a US$25 scrip (similar to money) was issued for their participation. At the run-in visit only, eligible candidates were given dietary instructions and a questionnaire, run-in and study drug instructions, a pedometer, and all received placebo pills. The baseline visit was otherwise equivalent to the run-in visit except that the completed diet questionnaire was collected, and participants officially entered the study (received study ID number and first randomized pill allocation). For the baseline and subsequent visits, the old pill receptacle was returned (and pill count performed) and a new one was given (except at the final visit), new medication changes and adverse events were recorded and a comment form given, and pedometer readings were procured.</p>
