<abstract>
<p>Seeking to assess the analytical rigor of empirical research in management education, this article reviews the use of multivariate statistical techniques in 85 studies of online and blended management education over the past decade and compares them with prescriptions offered by both the organization studies and educational research communities. Although there is variation in the degree to which the techniques have been appropriately used, they appear to have been adopted more quickly than is typically the case in organizational studies research. Recommendations that emerge from the review include greater consideration of moderating effects, particularly those that have been considered historically to be “control” variables, and reduced dependence on exploratory factor analysis techniques for data reduction except when examining conceptual frameworks composed of constructs borrowed from disparate fields. It is the authors’ hope that this review motivates further consideration of appropriate uses of these techniques in other areas of management education research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The emergence and now near-ubiquity of delivery of management education via the Internet has spawned an accompanying explosion of research literature on the topic over the past decade. There is now a body of literature that is extensive enough to warrant reviews of research in this area, especially within the business education realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912453919">Arbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562912453919">Grandzol &amp; Grandzol, 2006</xref>), and particularly, the management discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, Desai, Rau, &amp; Sridhar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1052562912453919">Ivancevich, Gilbert, &amp; Konopaske, 2009</xref>). However, although we now are compiling literature reviews that are specific to business and management education, the conclusions drawn from such reviews are only as good as the analytical rigor of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562912453919">Corner, 2002</xref>). As online courses and degree programs in business schools have evolved from a novelty to increasing acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1052562912453919">Redpath, 2012</xref>), research studies also have evolved from narrative accounts of initial experiences with online teaching to larger empirical studies involving multiple course sections and academic disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912453919">Arbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1052562912453919">Peltier, Schibrowsky, &amp; Drago, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1052562912453919">Wan, Wang, &amp; Haggerty, 2008</xref>). These burgeoning samples have facilitated the development of models with multiple predictors of online teaching effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562912453919">Eom, Wen, &amp; Ashill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1052562912453919">Gorsky &amp; Caspi, 2005</xref>), which, in turn, has necessitated the increased use of multivariate statistical techniques.</p>
<p>In spite of these analytical advances, the extent to which such techniques are used appropriately in online management education research has not been subject to review and critique. Granted, this particular educational research stream is far from alone in lacking such reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1052562912453919">Henson, Hull, &amp; Williams, 2010</xref>). However, given recent calls for management educators to increase their reliance on conclusions from learning and education research to influence their teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1052562912453919">Dehler, Beatty, &amp; Leigh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1052562912453919">Rynes &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>), it behooves us as management education researchers to provide management educators evidence that is created through the use of rigorous method and appropriate analysis. In short, if we seek to have the management education literature positively influence management education practice, then we ignore scrutiny of our methods to our peril.</p>
<p>Therefore, our interest in reviewing the use of multivariate techniques in online and blended business education is twofold. First, we seek to assess the quality and appropriateness of research methods techniques that were used in online and blended management education research. Second, by conducting such a review within the larger management education arena, we hope to inspire other researchers to conduct similar reviews of research methods that were employed in other areas of management education with the aim of increasing the field’s overall empirical analytical rigor. In our review, we will examine two perspectives of interest to management educators: first is common research practice in this area, and second is expected standards from both the educational research community and the management research discipline. To consider perspectives from educational research, we use the American Education Research Association’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912453919">AERA, 2006</xref>) recently published guidelines for reporting empirical research. To capture the perspectives of the management research community, we draw from literature published in <italic>Organizational Research Methods</italic> (<italic>ORM</italic>). Since its initial publication in 1998, <italic>ORM</italic> has achieved increasing influence in management research, attaining a 2010 Thomson Reuters/ISI impact factor of 4.423, ranking it seventh among management journals.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is presented in three sections. First, we present a discussion of the protocol used for our review. Second, following a brief overview of general empirical reporting standards based on AERA guidelines, we provide more specific descriptions of exemplary analytical approaches in the research field, and then examine these approaches for their actual usage in online and blended management education. Examples of approaches examined in this article include multiple regression analysis, exploratory factory analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), with a brief discussion of less used multivariate techniques. The article concludes by discussing primary themes that emerge from the review and recommendations for future online management education researchers.</p>

<title>Literature Review Protocol</title>
<p>This article is developed from a subset of articles in business education that have examined virtual learning environments, including both full and partial online learning processes. A comprehensive search for peer-reviewed articles pertaining to online teaching and learning in business courses that were published after January 1, 2000 was conducted between September 2006 and December 2010. Databases examined in the review included ABI/Inform, Business Full Text, Business Source Elite, and Lexis/Nexis Business. To supplement this review, the primary journals for each business discipline dating back to 2000, as identified in the journals database recently published in <italic>Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education</italic> (<italic>AMLE</italic>), were included in the review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1052562912453919">Whetten, 2008</xref>). Using this approach, we identified 271 peer-reviewed articles that examined online and/or blended learning in business and management education from the years 2000 through 2010. After screening for the nature of these articles, that is, whether the articles used quantitative or qualitative research methods or were purely conceptual articles, we narrowed this pool to 157 quantitative methods articles. For these articles, we organized a coding scheme to capture the research design, statistical techniques used, sample size, sample response rate (for survey-based studies), type of criterion, type of predictor(s), checks for factors such as nonresponse bias and common method variance, the number of courses studied, sources of data used in the study, medium of instruction (online vs. traditional classroom-based courses), academic disciplines included in the study, and any other traditional control variables unique to an individual study.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we examined the statistical techniques used in each article, paying particular attention to common multivariate techniques such as multiple regression analysis, EFA, CFA, and SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912453919">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1052562912453919">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1052562912453919">R. A. Johnson &amp; Wichern, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1052562912453919">Stevens, 2002</xref>). We found 85 articles that used at least one of these multivariate techniques, from which we developed our review. The distribution of articles by statistical technique is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562912453919">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>A comparison between the number of articles used in this review and that from a recent methods reviews of the strategy literature showed the number of articles from this review (85 in all) was somewhat lower than the average number of articles covered in the strategy area (127.58). This review also covered a slightly shorter time frame (11 years in management education vs. 11.37 years in strategy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen, Boyd, &amp; Bergh, 2008</xref>). However, considering that this current review is a review of certain analytical methods within a particular stream of the management education literature (online and hybrid/blended education) rather than the entire field, the number of articles included in the review appears reasonable.</p>

<title>AERA Guidelines for Data Presentation and Reporting</title>
<p>Perceptions of methodological inferiority and lack of analytical rigor have long been raised about educational research across disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1052562912453919">Henson et al., 2010</xref>). In part to mitigate such perceptions, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912453919">AERA (2006)</xref> developed standards for reporting empirical social science research. This approach should increase the transparency of findings and consequent acceptance of educational research by the research community. These standards seek to address both the description and the content of empirical analysis. For example, regarding the description of methods, the standard advocates that
<disp-quote>
<p>The relevance of the analysis procedures to the problem formulation should be made clear. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912453919">AERA, 2006</xref>, p. 37)</p>
<p>If the data were reduced or scales, scores, or measures were developed through data reduction techniques or statistical methods, the data reduction procedures should be fully described. Evidence of appropriate use, dependability, or valid interpretation of measures (particularly key measures) should be provided in circumstances where a knowledgeable scholar might reasonably have questions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912453919">AERA, 2006</xref>, p. 36).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although there may be varying interpretations of what constitutes a technique’s procedures being “fully described,” the fact that this standard was developed in the first place suggests the need for better disclosure and description of techniques, which AERA deems is necessary in the field. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912453919">Table 2</xref> shows the AERA reporting guidelines and the number of articles in our review complying with those guidelines. Relative to work published in educational research journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1052562912453919">Zientek, Capraro, &amp; Capraro, 2008</xref>), our review articles score relatively well.</p>

<p>Of the 30 studies that did not address measurement reliability through the use of Cronbach’s alpha and/or SEM fit indices, half used only measures with single-item behavioral indicators such as student demographics, course delivery medium, system usage, and/or test scores that are less subject to perception and reporting biases. However, of the 25 studies in the review that used examination scores as a variable, only one reported measurement reliability for the exam. Twelve of the 16 studies that did not report test statistics also provided no hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912453919">Table 2</xref>, two areas of concern for online management education research are with reporting measurement uncertainty and providing supporting rationale for using analytical techniques. Less than half the articles (39) included at least some mention of rationale for use of adopted analytical techniques in the study. Although only 11 articles reported standard errors or confidence intervals, several articles that did not report them used SEM techniques where the large number of item–construct relationships and construct–construct relationships in most models created through SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1052562912453919">Mueller &amp; Hancock, 2008</xref>) make it impractical to report standard errors. In fact, only two of the articles using SEM techniques in this review reported standard errors, and that only for key tested relationships rather than for all the item–construct and construct–construct relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562912453919">Hornik &amp; Tupchiy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1052562912453919">Peltier et al., 2007</xref>). However, all of them did indicate the significance, or lack thereof, of tested relationships. With this overview of practice in reporting measurement reliability and confidence levels in the online and blended education research area, we have some assurance that, at minimum, quantitative research in this area includes practices that are consistent with AERA guidelines on good research and reporting practice. We now will examine the employment and reporting of specific analytical techniques in the field in greater detail.</p>

<title>Multiple Regression Analysis</title>
<p>Since its introduction around 1900, multiple regression analysis has become a widely used multivariate statistical technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912453919">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). In the organizational sciences, major works such as the introduction of Michael Porter’s conceptual frameworks and the need to test them accelerated the technique’s use in the strategy field during the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen et al., 2008</xref>). Multiple regression analysis continues to be a mainstay in the organizational sciences, with 66% of articles published in the <italic>Strategic Management Journal</italic> (<italic>SMJ</italic>) between 2000 and 2002 using the technique, and the topic being the focus of 17% of the articles published in <italic>ORM</italic> from 1998 to 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912453919">Aguinis, Pierce, Bosco, &amp; Muslin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple regression analysis is by far the most commonly used statistical technique in our review, with 52 articles using the technique. Ordinary least squares regression was the dominant form in studies of management courses, with variations such as probit, logit, and switching models more commonly used in studies of economics or finance courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562912453919">Bertus, Gropper, &amp; Hinkelmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562912453919">Cao, Griffin, &amp; Bai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562912453919">Coates, Humphreys, Kane, &amp; Vachris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912453919">Gratton-Lavoie &amp; Stanley, 2009</xref>).

Also, although only 30 of the studies entered control variables first in their regression models, they represent 88.2% (30 of 34) of the studies using regression analysis that incorporated control variables in their research design. However, none of the studies reported controlling for outliers, and only five of the studies reported testing for the potential of multicollinearity through reporting variance inflation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912453919">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912453919">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562912453919">Arbaugh &amp; Rau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1052562912453919">Nemanich, Banks, &amp; Vera, 2009</xref>).

<title>Exploratory Factor Analysis</title>
<p>With developmental roots early in the 20th century as part of efforts to define and measure intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1052562912453919">R. A. Johnson &amp; Wichern, 1988</xref>), EFA in its various forms has long been a popular data reduction technique.

This practice happened in conjunction with greater adoption of both factor and cluster analyses in that field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen et al., 2008</xref>). However, the introduction of established theory and confirmatory factor techniques in the past 40 years has led to its increasing adoption in management research with a related decline in use of EFA. For example, EFA was used in just 9% of studies published in <italic>JAP</italic> in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562912453919">Austin, Scherbaum, &amp; Mahlman, 2002</xref>), and only 5.86% of articles published in <italic>ORM</italic> from 1998 to 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912453919">Aguinis et al., 2009</xref>). However, EFA still is widely used in educational research, and it appears that there continue to be appropriate uses for EFA in examining online teaching and learning. The need to continue using EFA is perhaps a result of the eclectic approach in adopting concepts and constructs from older disciplines to help explain the still relatively new online learning phenomenon. For example, online management education research has adopted varying constructs from fields such as education, communication, information systems, and management—a practice that is less common in the research approach of other disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912453919">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912453919">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912453919">Arbaugh &amp; Benbunan-Fich, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912453919">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562912453919">Hornik &amp; Tupchiy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1052562912453919">Hwang &amp; Francesco, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1052562912453919">Nemanich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1052562912453919">Peltier et al., 2007</xref>). Even now, emerging theoretical constructs in online teaching and learning such as the elements of the Community of Inquiry framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912453919">Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer, 2000</xref>) are being examined and refined for operationalization in the online and hybrid/blended learning areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912453919">Arbaugh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1052562912453919">Ke, 2010</xref>). As a result of borrowing from different disciplines, online teaching learning researchers have a need to examine newly adopted constructs and measurements for overlapping variance of measurement items in order to further refine these items. This need is best met through EFA.</p>
<p>With 25 articles in this review reporting use of the technique for data reduction purposes, EFA continues to be popular in online management education research. Along with guidance from statistics textbooks, best practices regarding the use of EFA in both the management and education literatures has been the subject of recent reviews. These reviews concluded that when conducting EFA, researchers should use multiple criteria and reasoned judgment, explicitly informing readers of the strategies they chose to pursue for selecting numbers of factors, rotation approaches, and their interpretation. Contending that factor retention is the most critical decision in applying EFA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562912453919">Hayton, Allen, and Scarpello (2004)</xref> argued that determining the number of factors by mineigen (<italic>eigen value greater than 1</italic>) and scree tests either tend to overstate the number of factors or are difficult to interpret. Therefore, they advocated that parallel analysis should be the factor retention method of choice for the management discipline. In parallel analysis, the researcher generates random data sets with the number of observations and variables as those in the actual data sets, and then conducts a series of EFAs on each. The retention decision is made by determining the number of factors whose eigenvalues exceed the average eigenvalue of the corresponding factors that were produced in EFAs of the generated random data sets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1052562912453919">Henson and Roberts (2006)</xref> provided a more comprehensive review of EFA use in educational research, and found widely varying degrees in adherence to guidelines for appropriate use of this technique. In the 60 articles included in their review, they found that the median sample size was only 267, that EFA accounted for only 52.03% of item variance, and that most studies used default factor extraction and rotation methods without providing justification for doing so. Building from these observations, they concurred with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562912453919">Hayton et al.’s (2004)</xref> findings regarding the use of parallel analysis and also called for inclusion of the matrix of association and the factor pattern/structure matrix in articles, as well as justification for the adopted extraction and rotation approaches.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1052562912453919">Table 4</xref> presents these best practices and the percentage of studies that comply with each practice. Unfortunately, across the articles in this review, use of this technique appears to vary somewhat from established best practices. None of the studies in this review used parallel analysis or minimum average partial techniques to determine the number of interpretable factors, relying instead primarily on the mineigen approach. These studies also tended to use the varimax rotation exclusively for interpreting factors. On a more positive note, 19 of the studies reported reliability coefficients of generated factors, and 12 provided factor pattern matrices. This review suggests that there is room for improvement in the use of EFA in its application and presentation in future studies.</p>

<title>Structural Equation Modeling</title>
<p>Since the early roots of its introduction in the 1970s, SEM has become increasingly influential as a statistical technique. In fact, as analysis of variance is seen as a special case of regression, some researchers now see multiple regression, discriminant analysis, and EFA as special cases of SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1052562912453919">Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1052562912453919">Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 1996</xref>). As a result, the technique’s influence has grown steadily in management research over the past 20 years. For example, SEM use in articles published in <italic>SMJ</italic> increased from none during 1980-1982 to 3% during 1990-1992 to 14% during 2000-2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen et al., 2008</xref>). Similar trajectories of SEM usage can be seen in articles published in the <italic>Journal of Applied Psychology</italic> (<italic>JAP</italic>), <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic> (<italic>AMJ</italic>), <italic>Journal of Management</italic>, and <italic>ORM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912453919">Aguinis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562912453919">Austin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1052562912453919">Scandura &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>). Our review suggests that SEM approaches are becoming increasingly common in online business education research, with 24 studies using various forms of this technique. Of these articles, use of SEM first appeared in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1052562912453919">Stoel &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>), with three published before 2005 and the rest after that. This trend suggests that the influence of SEM will only increase in the coming years.</p>
<p>Two characteristics of SEM that researchers find particularly attractive are the ability to specify structures of their models a priori and increased consideration of the potential for measurement error through the use of latent variables. However, such benefits also raised concerns regarding early adoption of SEM where such early adoption may lead to overreliance on a particular measurement approach, while limiting adequate exploration of the nature of emerging constructs. This, in turn, may raise the likelihood of capitalizing on chance variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1052562912453919">MacCallum, Roznowski, &amp; Necowitz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1052562912453919">MacCallum, Wegener, Uchino, &amp; Fabrigar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1052562912453919">Stevens, 2002</xref>). Despite concerns, use of SEM has become more commonplace, and sets of best practice for using the technique have emerged, which are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1052562912453919">Table 5</xref>.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Based on the assessment criteria, researchers using SEM techniques in business education research appear to be using them reasonably well. All 24 studies used at least two survey items to measure perceptual variables. Seventeen studies reported using EFA or CFA to develop psychometrically sound construct indicators, and 15 studies reported two or more fit indicators. However, the group did not fare as well on the other criteria. Only half of the studies reported both measurement and latent factor relationships when presenting model tests. Most of the studies also did not report the use of model fit improvement indices, such as LaGrange multipliers, Wald’s tests, likelihood ratios, and/or Lisrel modification indices, to revise original tested relationships for better fitting final models. Although the lack of mention of such fit improvement indices to modify and improve model fit from an original model may indicate authors were fitting and presenting their original hypothesized models in their articles, the high fitting indices of some models may have benefitted from use of such model fit improvement indices, but with no mention of their usage. Using such model fit improvement indices without specific mention of their usage and required post hoc conceptual review for appropriateness of revised relationships risks chance variance capture that is unique to a particular sample and not replicable in the larger population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1052562912453919">Mueller &amp; Hancock, 2008</xref>). This, in turn, could lead to replication failure in other studies. Exceptions, such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1052562912453919">Hwang and Arbaugh (2006)</xref> study that acknowledged model revisions by eliminating nonsignificant relationships to improve model fit, are consistent with greater transparency of model evolvement and helpful to readers in relating the hypothesized model and the final model. Overall, there is a need to acknowledge model improvement attempts and related subsequent, albeit post hoc, literature justification to provide some assurance that improved model fit did not come at a cost of consistency with relevant conceptual or theoretical underpinning.</p>

<title>Hierarchical Linear Modeling</title>
<p>As management researchers have become interested in the influence of characteristics across organizational levels, and educational researchers have become increasingly aware of the potential for nesting effects within courses and/or schools, the use of HLM techniques has become increasingly common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912453919">Bickel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1052562912453919">Hitt, Beamish, Jackson, &amp; Mathieu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1052562912453919">K. J. Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000</xref>). The use of HLM is reflected in the management literature by multilevel research issues being addressed in 10.92% of articles published in <italic>ORM</italic> between 1998 and 2007, with the percentage rising throughout the period of that review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912453919">Aguinis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As is the case with SEM, HLM approaches are most appropriate in situations where prior theory is well developed with a rich literature base and there are sufficiently large sample sizes with reliable variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912453919">Bickel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1052562912453919">James &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1052562912453919">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>). One issue that makes sample size challenging is that samples need to be of appropriate size on more than one level. Some early rules of thumb, such as 20 to 30 groups with 30 individuals per group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912453919">Heck &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1052562912453919">Hox, 2002</xref>), recently have been raised to 50 groups in order to ensure unbiased estimates of standard errors for group-level components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1052562912453919">Maas &amp; Hox, 2005</xref>). However, even if the sample has these many group-level observations, nesting effects need not necessarily be present in the data. Therefore, a useful next step for determining whether HLM techniques are necessary is to determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the variable of interest, for which ICCs greater than .12 have been determined to warrant the use of the technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1052562912453919">James, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, HLM techniques have received little consideration in online business education research, and most of the studies that have used them did not appear to fully consider the rules of thumb noted above. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912453919">Alavi, Marakas, and Yoo (2002)</xref> did not use HLM techniques based on the ICC &lt; .12 criteria, but as their sample comprised only four class sections, it is questionable whether ICCs need to be examined in the first place. Conversely, a series of studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912453919">Arbaugh and Benbunan-Fich (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912453919">2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562912453919">Benbunan-Fich and Arbaugh (2006)</xref> used HLM techniques such as HANOVAs and fixed effects regressions. Although the number of class sections in their research (40) warranted HLM consideration using earlier second-level sample criteria, they did not examine ICCs to check for potential nesting effects. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912453919">Arbaugh (2010)</xref> found ICCs between the course level and the dependent variables less than .12 in his study of 46 online course sections, suggesting a reasonable situation for considering HLM techniques. Overall, only 13 studies in our entire review had individual samples consisting of more than 30 class sections, with 4 studies having samples of more than 50 classes. Considering that the average class size in these studies was less than 20 students in each section, there also are questions about whether the samples have sufficient first-level variable populations. Furthermore, J. B. Arbaugh was either the sole author or a coauthor of all but three of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562912453919">Benbunan-Fich &amp; Hiltz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562912453919">Drago &amp; Peltier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1052562912453919">Landry, Griffeth, &amp; Hartman, 2006</xref>). Although this assessment suggests that the field suffers from a paucity of multicourse and multi-institutional studies, it also suggests that for the most part, the field has not rushed to adopt this technique prematurely. Considering that management researchers have contended that multilevel research generally requires examining several organizations, this lack of technique envy here likely is a good thing for online management education research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1052562912453919">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Other Uses of Multivariate Techniques</title>
<p>Seven studies in our review used multivariate techniques other than those previously discussed. Most uses of these other types of multivariate techniques reflect either disciplinary tendencies or the occasional true experimental design approaches. For example, techniques commonly associated with research in marketing only appeared in marketing education journals. Examples include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1052562912453919">Karns’s (2005)</xref> use of multidimensional scaling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1052562912453919">Taylor, Humphreys, Singley, and Hunter’ (2004)</xref> use of conjoint analysis, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1052562912453919">Morrison, Sweeney, &amp; Heffernan’ (2003)</xref> use of cluster analysis. Uses of multivariate analysis of variance or multivariate analysis of covariance reflected the presence of experimental designs and were seen exclusively in studies of information systems education settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562912453919">Bryant, Campbell, &amp; Kerr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1052562912453919">Piccoli, Ahmad, &amp; Ives, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1052562912453919">Santhanam, Sasidharan, &amp; Webster, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>First, the Good News</title>
<p>Two positive observations that emerge from this review are the relatively rapid and appropriate adoption of increasingly advanced statistical techniques and the rigor of presentation and analytical sophistication demonstrated in the online and hybrid learning areas relative to other areas of educational research. Considering that narrative accounts were the dominant research method for online business education in the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2005a</xref>), the progression to techniques such as SEM and HLM within a decade truly is noteworthy and reflects the increasing legitimacy of management education research as a field of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1052562912453919">Rynes &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). This progress is even more noteworthy when we consider that it took almost 25 years for articles in the <italic>SMJ</italic> to move from 37.5% to 75% of them having some empirically driven analytical approaches, and the norm of between two and three decades for methodological approaches to be adopted in discipline-based management research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912453919">Aguinis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen et al., 2008</xref>). Although this practice may indicate that online business education scholars are transporting techniques learned from their discipline-based training, such practice also suggests a positive push toward increasing analytical rigor for the online and hybrid/blended learning research stream.</p>
<p>Although empirical analytical approaches and presentations of the reviewed articles were by no means perfect, online business education researchers’ practices in conducting, presenting, and reporting multivariate research appear to be fairly robust when compared with those of other educational researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1052562912453919">Zientek et al., 2008</xref>). When compared with AERA reporting guidelines, the near universal use of tables to report empirical data, efforts to note measurement reliability, and common use of test statistics and reports on effect sizes are noteworthy. The field is reporting adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>s and generally appears to be using sample sizes appropriate for the number of variables of interest when using multiple regression analysis, and except for lack of reporting on use of LaGrange multipliers, researchers generally are applying and reporting SEM techniques reasonably well. Considering the rate at which this research stream has accelerated over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912453919">Arbaugh et al., 2010</xref>), perhaps other streams of management education research might consider the methodological developments in this area when designing and reporting their work.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the ability of researchers in the relatively new online and hybrid/blended learning field to adopt the appropriate analytical techniques for their research questions at hand. Our review showed that despite the relative newness of the field, and the willingness of researchers to borrow concepts and constructs from other disciplines, plus the demands of sieving through these borrowed constructs for modification and adoption in the online and hybrid learning areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562912453919">Hornik &amp; Tupchiy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1052562912453919">Hwang &amp; Francesco, 2010</xref>), online business education researchers have not been inundated by confusion across these demands. Instead, these scholars have demonstrated their ability to adopt, modify, and integrate borrowed concepts into their research, and at the same time use appropriate analytical techniques for their empirical research tasks at hand. These techniques have ranged from traditional regressions to test hypothesized two-stage relationships between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562912453919">Arbaugh &amp; Rau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1052562912453919">H.

In light of this progress in the field, past perceptions that management education researchers may be less sophisticated in their analytical rigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1052562912453919">Zientek et al., 2008</xref>) need to be revisited, especially considering the evidence presented here.</p>

<title>Now, the Not-so-Good News</title>
<p>Although there is much to be encouraged about methodological rigor and reporting practices, two items stand out as areas for particular improvement emphasis: the reporting of standard errors or confidence intervals in all studies and, the rigor of reporting and analysis when using EFA. First, only 11 of the 85 studies we reviewed included an indicator of uncertainty of measuring the relationships between variables, and most of those studies that reported such data were published by scholars outside the management discipline. Although this issue is addressed somewhat in SEM techniques due to the development of latent variables, we believe that studies using other techniques should be especially strident to report such results. As reporting of standard errors in quantitative research is increasingly common in discipline-based journals such as <italic>AMJ, SMJ</italic>, and <italic>JAP</italic>, we believe online management education researchers should adopt this practice as a matter of course, especially when using multiple regression analysis.</p>
<p>Second, our review suggests that scholars using EFA as a primary data reduction technique have room for improvement in both their reporting and analysis. The lack of reporting factor pattern matrices and near exclusive reliance on the mineigen technique for determining the number of factors are particularly disconcerting to diligent researchers who seek to understand the rationale for use of certain steps of a technique, and of greater importance, deeper underlying data patterns. Although some might question why we should be so concerned about such specific details in EFA given the increasing adoption of SEM, we argue that this practice, indeed, is important for at least two reasons. First, best practice in SEM encourages the initial use of EFA/CFA approaches to determine psychometric validity of measures before moving into the following step of examining structural properties of hypothesized relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912453919">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>). Second, online teaching and learning research have shown tendencies to intertwine constructs from disciplines that do not normally intersect with each other (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1052562912453919">Hwang &amp; Francesco, 2010</xref>, for recent examples). Therefore, it is possible that although borrowed variables may be well grounded within their typical research settings, it does not necessarily follow that they automatically will fit well when combined in studies with other variables from another setting. Given the emphasis on strong theoretical grounding of variables and posited relationships among variables as a prerequisite for using SEM techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912453919">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562912453919">Edwards &amp; Bagozzi, 2000</xref>), we are open to the use of EFA approaches as a first exploration step to identify potential overlaps among measurement items across variables from different research disciplines and background. This first step also should set the stage for an iterative process of variable adaptation and related theory building in new research areas, such as the current online and blended learning area under review. That said, we are conscious that such iterative data with conceptual developments require due care, as advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1052562912453919">Henson and Roberts (2006)</xref>, to ensure EFA usage is not purely empirically driven without a conceptual framework.</p>
<p>Another area of potential concern is the reporting of rationale for using particular statistical techniques. We found that less than half the articles reviewed provided rationale for the techniques they used, and many of those doing so were SEM studies. We are not sure of the reason for this lack of clarification on analytical technique, except for those using SEM. For the SEM situation, the better clarification may be due to particular care when incorporating a relatively new technique or to the development of hypotheses and accompanying tests making choice of technique more apparent. The lack of clarification in use of other techniques may be due to the ubiquitous use of these techniques—which leads researchers to assume their appropriateness—journal editors seeking to manage manuscript length, laxness by some authors, or some combination of these factors. Given concerns of the educational research community regarding this need to justify an adopted analytical technique, it behooves management education researchers to give more thought to articulating the reasons for which they use particular statistical approaches.</p>
<p>A longer term need is the dearth of replication studies to further validate adopted and modified constructs and relationships. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1052562912453919">Hwang and Arbaugh (2006)</xref> study borrowed competitive constructs from both the psychology and cross-cultural research fields in examining competitive attitudes in the hybrid/blended learning environment. Although the exploratory factor analyses and subsequent pruning of variable items, plus a third step CFA, revealed good fit of their measurement and structural models, the study lacks replication by other researchers. This need for replication is an important part of building a firm foundation for new and emerging constructs in the field. Although researchers may find replication studies to be less interesting and rewarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562912453919">Devinney &amp; Siegel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562912453919">Honig &amp; Bedi, 2012</xref>), the validation of new constructs and relationships will help the next generation of researchers to have an arsenal of tested and validated constructs across different learning contexts to build the next generation of theories and models. Researchers in the field should consider how their research agenda may at least validate some of the emerging constructs that are already out there, while at the same time develop models and framework that could meet their personal research interests and needs.</p>

<title>Greater consideration of moderating effects</title>
<p>It has been suggested that an index of how far a field of study has progressed is the extent to which it has advanced our understanding of moderating variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1052562912453919">Hall &amp; Rosenthal, 1991</xref>). If this characterization is accurate, online business education research has ample room for advancement. Examination of moderating effects via interaction has increased from 12.5% to 40% of studies published in <italic>SMJ</italic> from 1980-1982 to 2000-2002, which is comparable with research trends in organizational behavior and human resources fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1052562912453919">Ketchen et al., 2008</xref>). Although there are few theories in the management discipline that do not identify at least some moderation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912453919">Aguinis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912453919">Aguinis, Beaty, Boik, &amp; Pierce, 2005</xref>), this interest in moderation has yet to widely influence what we know about online teaching and learning. Our review showed only eight studies that examined potential moderating effects. This finding suggests that we education researchers lag our disciplinary counterparts, and further supports recent calls for further study of moderating effects in online management education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912453919">Arbaugh et al., 2010</xref>). From the variables examined in the articles from this review, some variables that could be examined as potential moderators include gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1052562912453919">Piccoli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1052562912453919">Williams, Duray, and Reddy, 2006</xref>), academic discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912453919">Arbaugh, 2005a</xref>), overall GPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562912453919">Bacon &amp; Bean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912453919">Gratton-Lavoie &amp; Stanley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1052562912453919">Palocsay &amp; Stevens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1052562912453919">Terry, Mills, Rosa, &amp; Sollosy, 2009</xref>), student academic standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1052562912453919">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>), the educational delivery medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1052562912453919">H. J. Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1052562912453919">Nemanich et al., 2009</xref>), types and perceptions of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912453919">Gratton-Lavoie &amp; Stanley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1052562912453919">Liu, Magjuka, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>), modes of learner interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912453919">Arbaugh &amp; Benbunan-Fich, 2007</xref>), and/or class section size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562912453919">Arbaugh &amp; Duray, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another reason for increased consideration of potential moderators is an emerging concern regarding the use of control variables. Although the use of control variables is common in both discipline-based and educational management research, they often are included in studies in a seemingly ad hoc manner, without justifying rationale or indications of the adequacy of measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912453919">Becker, 2005</xref>). Although 45 of the articles in this review used control variables, the extent to which their measurement and conceptual justification were described in the articles varied widely. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1052562912453919">Spector and Brannick (2011)</xref> argued that control variables that are not explicitly linked to the researchers’ conceptual model amount to a research method’s “urban legend,” with such legend diminishing rather than purifying analytical results. Although the role and importance of control variables likely will draw different views, online management education researchers could take the next step of incorporating control variables such as student GPA in their theory development and examining their direct or moderating impact on established predictor variables when testing online teaching and learning effectiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1052562912453919">
<title>Greater emphasis on multi-institutional studies</title>
<p>Although we applaud online management education researchers for not chasing after the latest and greatest techniques when sample sizes in their studies do not warrant them, we also encourage these researchers to develop samples large and robust enough to warrant the use of techniques such as HLM. Although samples of 50 courses are possible from a single institution, guidance from the management discipline suggests that such samples may be best developed by examining multiple business schools simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1052562912453919">James &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1052562912453919">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>). In addition to the opportunities for larger samples and greater generalizability, multi-institutional studies would help us examine institutional effects that presently only can be inferred from studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562912453919">Arbaugh &amp; Benbunan-Fich, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1052562912453919">
<title>Draw more intentionally from methodological advances in the management discipline</title>
<p>As demonstrated by the increasing influence of the journal <italic>ORM</italic> and dramatic growth of membership in the Academy of Management’s Research Methods division, it appears that management researchers are increasingly interested in and influenced by methodological advances. However, the increasing influence of <italic>ORM</italic> has not extended to management education research in general or online business education research in particular. According to Google Scholar, other than former <italic>ORM</italic> editor Herman Aguinis’s recent Exemplary Contribution article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912453919">Aguinis et al., 2010</xref>), a grand total of five peer-reviewed articles published in <italic>AMLE</italic> have cited articles published in <italic>ORM</italic>. Although its focus as a journal of management pedagogy lends it less to citing research methods articles than does <italic>AMLE</italic>, the fact that <italic>JME</italic> also has published only four articles that cite <italic>ORM</italic> prior to this one further reflects the field’s relative inattention to advances in the discipline’s research methods. In contrast, during 2010 alone, 14 articles published in <italic>AMJ</italic> cited work published in <italic>ORM</italic>. We believe that a more active consideration and incorporation of advances in research methods will help to further research of management education researchers from the mode of doing what they have done and what they know methodologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1052562912453919">Podsakoff &amp; Dalton, 1987</xref>). It also will counter perceptions of management learning and education research being of lower quality than discipline-based management research.</p>

<sec id="section17-1052562912453919">
<title>Do we administer reliable tests?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1052562912453919">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>As noted earlier, we found 25 studies that used exam scores as a dependent variable, but only one of those studies assessed the reliability of these exams. Considering that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562912453919">Cronbach (1951)</xref> originally developed the alpha statistic to assess the reliability of tests, we are concerned that this practice currently is not common in management education research. In addition to the importance of reliability of measures for research purposes, it seems that we would want reliable tests to ensure that our students are learning what we want them to learn. However, we also are aware that many of the studies used samples that consist of sections of classes from different disciplines, making tests of reliability across disciplines not very meaningful. To the extent tests are comparable across subsamples, researchers should examine reliability of these tests. Therefore, we encourage management educators and educational researchers to return to the practice of assessing test reliability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1052562912453919">
<title>Balancing expectations of two or more research communities</title>
<p>Should online management education researchers place primary loyalty with the discipline (where justification of analytical technique often is implied by the research hypotheses and not explicitly stated) or with guidelines of the educational community (and state them, whether or not fellow management scholars might find them to be obvious)? This area could benefit from further discussion. Based on our review data, it is clear that online education researchers do use tools that they were trained in and that were common in their original discipline when examining the online education phenomenon in their areas. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1052562912453919">Karns (2005)</xref> used multidimensional scaling to determine student preferences for online discussions relative to other forms of disseminating marketing knowledge, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1052562912453919">Taylor et al. (2004)</xref> used conjoint analysis to examine marketing students’ preferences for web management tools. Both these analytical techniques are common in research articles within the marketing discipline, but less so in the management, psychology, and education areas. Arising from this lack of familiarity by researchers who may be interested in online education research but not with these tools, explanation of the nature of these tools and implications of findings may be useful for the larger group of researchers in the educational community. Some even may argue that use of any quantitative tools may need better explanations, especially when considering the entire educational research community where qualitative researchers also have an important role in helping everyone understand the online education phenomenon. Likewise, qualitative researchers also may have to better explain their tools and findings to the community. Although the roots and related expectations of different research communities may differ, the focus is the same here—to help everyone in the educational community better understand the online education phenomenon. To do so, it may be better to overelaborate than to underelaborate the tools, findings, and implications.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This review has examined the state of quantitative research approaches in the online and hybrid education area over the past 10 years, with special focus on more advanced analytical techniques such as multiple regressions, EFAs, SEMs, HLMs, and other multivariate techniques. Over the past 10 years, researchers in this field have not only been able to quickly adopt appropriate advanced data analytical techniques to address their research questions but also to borrow and adapt constructs from other disciplines to test their hypotheses in this new and emerging field. We were pleasantly surprised in some places, especially in the speed of adoption of advanced data analytical techniques to answer questions in this field, even while the field is still developing a range of theoretical frameworks to ground its research. Although there were some areas that needed improvements, such as better explaining the rationale for using certain steps and preferences in EFA, and the need to more consistently provide information on effect sizes with confidence levels, by and large, researchers in the field have provided needed information in their results for readers to draw conclusions on the appropriateness of analyses and conclusions. As the field continues to grow in sophistication, we expect researchers also to grow in sophistication in examining contextual influences, such as moderating effects of demographic variables or other variables in the wider environment that have a bearing on relationships of interest in their studies. Over a longer period of time, these increasingly sophisticated studies should lead to new theories of online and hybrid learning, which should benefit the learning community.</p>
