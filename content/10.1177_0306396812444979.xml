<p>Studies of the Labour party have overwhelmingly focused on its domestic successes and failures, in particular on its contribution to the development of the welfare state. This has been very much at the expense of its colonial, defence and foreign policies. Such a focus was always a mistake, but, today, it is surely completely untenable. Even the most parochial of commentators, whether academic or otherwise, is hard-pressed to continue this neglect of Labour’s sorry international record. Blair’s wars changed everything. The uncomfortable fact that the Labour party’s longest-serving prime minister is widely regarded as a war criminal, as a man drenched in blood, who nevertheless succeeded in becoming a multimillionaire on the back of his crimes, has made such neglect intellectually dishonest, to say the least. What has to be acknowledged, however, is that, so far, the quality of those books that have appeared tackling Labour’s international record has been disappointing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Rhiannon Vickers’ new book, the second volume of <italic>The Labour Party and the World</italic>, which examines Labour’s foreign policy since 1951, is no exception. The reason for this is quite simple: she has engaged in an idealist enterprise whereby she focuses on the supposed ‘core beliefs at the heart of Labour’s foreign policy’ rather than on the actual policies it implemented when in power. The real world does, of course, intrude, but her discussion is more concerned to explore the gap between the party’s supposed ‘core beliefs’ and its practice, rather than exploring the material concerns that actually informed and determined that practice.</p>
<p>The problems with her approach are easily demonstrated. Vickers identifies six ‘core beliefs’: support for international institutions; concern with international interests rather than just the national interest; support for democratic principles; for collective security; for disarmament; and, lastly (and most hilariously), ‘a belief in international working class solidarity’. These ‘core values’ add up to what she describes as a commitment to ‘internationalism’. Now, these values might well be embodied in resolutions and speeches at party conferences, but, as she herself acknowledges, in the real world, ‘the Labour leadership tended to see the bedrock of British security as the Anglo-American alliance’. However, this alliance is nowhere evident in the six core values and, moreover, it can be convincingly argued that it has involved the decisive and consistent violation of all of them. Consequently, it can be reasonably argued that in order to understand Labour’s foreign policy since 1951, the starting point should be exploring the reasons for the party’s longstanding commitment to American imperialism.</p>
<p>These so-called ‘core values’ are just so much rhetoric that the leadership feels obliged to tolerate, but they certainly do not inform policy when in government. In the past, they sometimes restricted the Labour government’s room for manoeuvre; for example, the Wilson government did not dare send British troops to fight in Vietnam because of the strength of a Labour Left that <italic>did</italic> take her ‘core values’ seriously. But this did not stop Wilson from wholeheartedly supporting the Americans in every way he could, short of the despatch of troops. Blair, of course, was not troubled by a Labour Left of any consequence and so was able to actually take part in the attack on Iraq, rather than just supporting it. Vickers even argues that Blair’s support for the war derived from his ‘missionary zeal to make the world a better place’. Great powers do not go to war for such reasons. They sometimes say they do, but this is to appease domestic public opinion, and they are lying.</p>
<p>The reality is that Labour governments have consistently aligned themselves with, and subordinated themselves to, the US, sacrificing each and every principle in the process. Most recently, Labour support for the US war on terror even involved complicity in torture. Once again, this is not to say that Vickers ignores the real world, but, rather, that her account does not have any explanatory power as far as the real motives informing Labour’s foreign policy are concerned. Subordination to the US is a policy that British governments follow with grim determination because this is perceived to be in the best interests of British capital.</p>
