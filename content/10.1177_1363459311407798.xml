<p>Ehrenreich’s dramatic title sets the tone for this emotive read. The book argues that the assumption that positive thinking is inherently good has infiltrated all aspects of western society, and this ‘cult of cheerfulness’ has caused broad-spectrum damage through the realms of healthcare, religion, politics, positive psychology, business and the economy. It is a highly readable text and Ehrenreich argues with subversive passion. Interested laypeople will find the style accessible, in places humorous and always stimulating, while an academic mind will find the book appropriately well researched. As a reviewer with a background in psychology and having trained in life coaching, I found this book a valuable challenge to much of the positive psychology and self-help literature.</p>
<p>The book opens with the most poignant chapter. Here we follow Ehrenreich’s personal experience of receiving an unexpected diagnosis and being thrust into the pink-ribboned bosom of the cheerful world of breast cancer. It was her immersion in this false utopia of upbeat personal survival narratives and advice to embrace the ‘gift’ of cancer that spawned <italic>Smile or Die</italic>. She found that the language available to her was skewed in one direction only; cancer blogs and support groups censored against expressions of anger, disappointment and upset. With no allowance for what might be perceived as a victim mentality, one became a ‘survivor’ not a patient, enhanced by military metaphors of ‘battling’ the disease (this seems to be the most prevalent cancer metaphor despite being over 30 years since Susan Sontag wrote in protest against its use). Ehrenreich reports that women whose cancer has progressed beyond the possibility of survival have been known to be expelled by their support groups as an example of the insidious insistence of positivity at all costs. ‘Positive thinking seems to be mandatory in the breast cancer world, to the point that unhappiness requires a kind of apology’, writes Ehrenreich (p. 26). She illustrates the point by adding an experimental post to a blog entitled ‘what does it mean to be a breast cancer survivor?’ in which she outlines her anger at the ‘debilitating effects of chemotherapy, recalcitrant insurance companies, environmental carcinogens, and most daringly, “sappy pink ribbons”’ (p. 32) and suffers a ‘chorus of rebukes’ attacking her negative attitude, with the only true message of support coming from a woman whose cancer had become terminal.</p>
<p>Ehrenreich shows that such attitude policing is based on a ubiquitous belief that positivity plays a causal role in cancer recovery, and documents the flimsy research and giant leaps of assumption that generated this myth. Her educational background (a PhD in cellular biology) gives clout to a persuasive dismantling of the ‘positivity boosts your immune system’ argument for how the progression of a person’s cancer is subject to the state of his/her thoughts. She highlights the dangers of repressing negative emotions when crisis hits and the additional burden placed upon a cancer sufferer by the imposition of having to remain constantly buoyant for fear that any other response will hasten illness and death; no better displayed than in a heart-rending quotation from a psychiatrists’ website of a cancer patient battling with personal responsibility:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know I have to be positive all the time and that is the only way to cope with cancer – but it’s so hard to do. I know that if I get sad, or scared or upset, I am making my tumor grow faster and I will have shortened my life. (p. 43)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This engaging opening paves the way for an exploration of a wider phenomenon of monitoring for positivity and weeding out all things negative. The reader is introduced to self-help literature and motivational gurus that consistently demand that you eliminate negativity, stop watching the news (for it will bring you down) and, as her quotation of Jeffrey Gitomer (life coach) shouts; ‘GET RID OF NEGATIVE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIVES!’ (p. 55), all of which the author swiftly cuts down with a small dose of reason. Although it could seem that Ehrenreich cherry picks ridiculous caricatures to knock down with her argument, I have encountered life coaches, business professional speakers and self-help books sincerely delivering exactly these sentiments to laypeople, trainee coaches and academic professionals alike.</p>
<p>From such money-making positive thinking ‘gurus’ the reader is treated (in a chapter gloriously entitled ‘God wants you to be rich’) to characters like Joel Osteen and other preachers of the (lucrative) US ‘megachurch’ movement, who bastardize Christianity with upbeat mania on a grand scale, promising their thousands of followers untold riches to those who want to manifest them positively into their lives. ‘Almost like a magnet, we draw in what we constantly think about’, says Osteen; ‘in a crowded restaurant … You can say, “Father, I thank you that I have favour with this hostess, and she’s going to seat me soon”’ (p. 127). Thus positive thinking reaches out to God, reducing Him to a mere order catalogue waiting to dish out to the whims and demands of the masses (no matter how insignificant).</p>
<p>Ehrenreich pits the core message of the mega-bestselling self-help book <italic>The Secret</italic> as a major contributor to the influence of the positive thinking message. This is the ‘law of attraction’ which gained massive favour for obvious reasons: its message is essentially that you get what you focus on most, using half-baked quantum physics to bamboozle the reader into believing in the power of positive thinking. It is easy to see why this notion was so popular; it is not hard work and careful investment that gives you future rewards, but ardent wishful thinking that brings these your way now and without effort. Ehrenreich is in her element when presenting the unnerving corollary of this belief: that bad things happen to people who attract (and therefore deserve) them. Enter Rhonda Byrne, <italic>The Secret</italic> author, who cites ‘the law of attraction, [stating] that disasters like tsunamis can happen only to people who are “on the same frequency as the event”’ (p. 205).</p>
<p>Thus Ehrenreich argues that the positive thinking movement has implicitly (and at times openly) laid blame for misfortune firmly at the feet – or rather within the faulty mindset of the victim. This is the most insidious aspect of the ideology – demanding a ‘continuing and never-ending process of self-monitoring’ (p. 94) as the individual turns upon her own mind in the quest to banish negativity. As a means of social control, she argues, this is a powerful force, reminiscent of totalitarian regimes from history – or perhaps an Orwellian dystopia. As recession hit and thousands lost jobs, the positive thinking movement entwined itself in American capitalist ideology and justified the natural order of a world of worsening wealth inequality, healthcare and poverty rates, gun crime, antidepressant use, educational standards and bankruptcy. Lost your job? It’s an opportunity! Adjust your attitude and start pitching for success.</p>
<p>Psychologists may be especially interested in a chapter in which Ehrenreich launches an outright attack on Martin Seligman (former president of the American Psychological Association) and his Positive Psychology movement, presenting not only his and other positive psychologists’ academic credibility as laughable, but also giving the reader insightful detail of her less-than-favourable experiences of meeting the man. Here, no less than throughout all the other chapters, Ehrenreich draws the link between all advocates of positive thinking and massive corporate profit, ending the book with an accusation that positive thinking is responsible for ‘destroying the economy’.</p>
<p>With never a dull page, I would recommend <italic>Smile or Die</italic> to laypeople, psychologists, business professionals, medics and more – particularly life coaches striving for credibility. I would now be extra vigilant about the tendency of life coaching to over-promise rewards to be reaped from working on oneself, and I will be taking a more critical eye to the promises of positive psychology. Ehrenreich provides a very good exploration of the negative side of positivity, hailing a move towards rationality through critical thinking and realism. The general flavour of the book is reactionary (perhaps as it was germinated from traumatic personal experience) and some may wish for a more balanced argument, tempered with some rationale for positivity (for example, work on resilience and overcoming depression), though Ehrenreich’s book would have lost its force with such additions. Whether you agree with her argument that positive thinking is the root of so many of society’s ills or not, the joy is in the challenge she lays down in writing this book.</p>
