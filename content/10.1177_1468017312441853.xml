<p>Once I got past the business-like title, I found this book an interesting read, raising my awareness about human service organizational structures and processes. The book is a broad-brush approach to working in the human service sector. For me, it managed to communicate aspects of human service work that are often learnt on the job; things that you wish someone had bothered to compile a handbook on. The good news is, they have! Its topics range from a broad description of organizational context to more specific practice-related matters – for example, power, advocacy, professional ethics and ethical reasoning. I found the book’s approach provided a road map for the world of human services that guides the reader through the increasing complexities and demands that define the sector. The book takes a realistic view of the human service sector, not challenging systems in any way but offering solid guidance for working within it.</p>
<p>While its proposed audience is the future human service worker, I believe this book functions as a useful reference for social workers at all stages of their career. The book aims to provide ‘pre-service’ education for the beginning human service worker, in order to equip them professionally and practically for their chosen field of practice. As a social work educator I would use this book as a resource for workshops in preparing students for field education placement. There are a number of sections that could be directly related to the preparation of students for placement. For example, in my experience students often express concern about recording and report writing and chapter three offers some good pointers for effective communication. Sections on both administrative and professional ethics provide direction for processing the ambiguous areas of ethical dilemmas. The chapter on administrative ethics, concentrating on agency ethics, adds another dimension to ethical practice and would be a good addition to field education preparation.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to me was the book’s ability to encourage the reader to think in a wider way about the organization they work for. The first three chapters discuss understanding organizations and how they work, leadership, and scoping the context. Having worked in government, not for profit, religious and private business organizations, I could relate to these fields of practice and consider the impact of the different contexts on service delivery. I enjoyed the interactive exercises that were interspersed throughout these initial chapters where I related real life examples to the concept being discussed, and found myself having the odd ‘Aha!’ moment as I reflected on past experiences. Using the reflective questions provided in each chapter I could examine the organizational cultures I had worked in and gain a deeper understanding of why I had encountered substantial differences in service delivery between not-for-profit and private business organizations. As I read on, I found each overview chapter created a good base for the more practice-related chapters that followed. A beginning social worker or a student embarking on placement would benefit from working through these practice chapters as they help to explain why agencies deliver services in the way they do. This encourages a student to think bigger and wider, and mitigates the effects of the ‘tunnel vision’ approach that a student or a beginning worker can have in approaching their first practice experiences.</p>
<p>After the wider organizational issues, further topics included supervision, managing conflict, power and advocacy, dealing with complaints and professional ethics. The text seeks to highlight areas and skills that are of a more generic nature in the human service sector, encouraging the reader to consider aspects of practice that underpin the service they deliver. I found the section referring to the use of email communication in Chapter Four good, as it gives some parameters of working with confidential information and some ideas on the organizing of the never-ending flow of email correspondence. Chapter five contributes a view of how to manage the growing expectations of funders for information development and management, and where the front-line worker fits into the greater scheme of things.</p>
<p>A student or beginning social worker could be empowered by the concepts the book communicates, as it uses case studies and summary questions to encourage the reader to develop a critically reflective framework about their place in an organization, and how they can conduct themselves in a professional and competent manner. For this reason I would encourage the use of this text as a reference for student social workers. I would also use it in my practice as a social work supervisor. While the Australian context is a complicating factor with the use of terms and organizations peculiar to that country, there are enough commonalities to ensure it remains a pertinent read, particularly for the New Zealand setting. Countries further afield may find the Australian focus more of a barrier.</p>
