<p>The Editor Selection Task Force of the Board of Directors of the American Evaluation Association invites nominations for the editorship of the <italic>American Journal of Evaluation</italic> (<italic>AJE</italic>).</p>
<p>
<italic>AJE</italic> publishes original papers about the methods, theory, practice, and findings of evaluation. The general goal of <italic>AJE</italic> is to present the best work in and about evaluation, in order to improve the knowledge base and practice of its readers. Because the field of evaluation is diverse, with different intellectual traditions, approaches to practice, and domains of application, the papers published in <italic>AJE</italic> reflect this diversity. Nevertheless, preference is given to papers that are likely to be of interest to a wide range of evaluators and that are written to be accessible to most readers.</p>
<p>Responsibilities include working with associate editors and the editorial board of the journal to ensure that the quality of the journal is maintained and enhanced; identifying and supervising the work of the managing editor of the journal; evaluating manuscripts; managing the peer review process; working with authors on revisions; soliciting manuscripts; and planning issues. The publisher is responsible for all production aspects of <italic>AJE</italic>. It is assumed that the editor's workplace would serve as the editorial office and a stipend of approximately $20,000/year contributes to the costs of administrative support (usually through a managing editor), telephone, photocopying, and other direct expenses.</p>
<p>Nominees should be established scholars with a strong record of publication and possess good managerial and organizational skills. Self-nominations and nominations of others are welcome.</p>
<p>Please email a letter of nomination indicating your interest and your background in editing and/or publishing as well as a resume or curriculum vita to: Susan Kistler, AEA Executive Director, at susan@eval.org. Finalists may be interviewed by the Editor Selection Task Force and the final selection will be made by the AEA Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Nominations should be submitted before February 1, 2013. A new editor will be named by June of 2013 and transition will begin in summer for a January 2014 start date.</p>
<p>Questions may be directed to Susan Kistler at susan@eval.org.</p>
