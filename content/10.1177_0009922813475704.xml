<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) are events of sudden onset that predominantly affect young infants. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference in 1986 defined ALTE as
<disp-quote>
<p>an episode that is frightening to the observer and that is characterized by some combination of apnea (central or occasionally obstructive), color change (usually cyanotic or pallid but occasionally erythematous or plethoric), marked change in muscle tone (usually marked limpness), choking, or gagging. In some cases, the observer fears that the infant has died.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475704">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is a matter of enormous attention and debate whether ALTE is a precursor of subsequent sudden death, recurrent ALTE or any other serious disorders. The reported mortality of patients after an episode of ALTE varies from 0% to 6% in different studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475704">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite recent studies showing a benign natural history with low morbidity and very low mortality, and that only 6% to 16% of admitted infants need significant medical intervention, upward of 75% of infants presenting to emergency department (ED) with ALTE are hospitalized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813475704">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813475704"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813475704"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475704">5</xref></sup> Once hospitalized, extensive medical evaluation is often carried out to identify any serious underlying condition and sometimes just to alleviate parental/provider anxiety. Pneumography—4-channel (heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and nasal airflow), or 5-channel (with esophageal pH monitoring)—is one such modality that is often promoted and used to identify apnea and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as the cause of ALTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475704">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813475704"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813475704">8</xref></sup> Two studies from the 1990s showed increased likelihood of abnormal patterns being detected on home monitors in infants with ALTE who had an abnormal pneumography as compared with those with normal pneumography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475704">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813475704">10</xref></sup> However, the studies had less than 1% mortality, and did not reveal if these episodes of apnea captured on a monitor were clinically significant, resulting in need for any intervention to terminate the episode. One of these studies also showed that a high proportion of infants with future apneas with a normal pneumogram had an episode of frank GER at the time of the second apnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475704">9</xref></sup> In all, 33% to 50% of infants with ALTE are diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and often treated with antireflux medications, mainly histamine H2 blockers and/or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the hope of preventing recurrence of ALTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813475704">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475704">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813475704">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813475704">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813475704">12</xref></sup> This is despite lack of evidence as to whether GERD is a comorbid condition or causes ALTE, or whether treating GERD in such infants with medications affects the recurrence rate of ALTE. A recent systematic review found conflicting evidence about the benefit of PPIs in reducing GERD-related symptoms in infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813475704">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our objective in this study is to assess if an abnormal result on pneumography, discharge diagnosis of GERD, or treatment of those diagnosed with GERD with antireflux medications affects the recurrence rate of ALTE over the first 4 weeks of follow-up after initial presentation to hospital.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational, cohort study, set in an urban, tertiary care, children’s hospital with an annual ED census of approximately 76 000, over a 20-month period from June 2006 to January 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813475704">3</xref></sup> We included infants younger than 1 year who met standard criteria for ALTE as per the NIH consensus statement and confirmed by the treating ED attending physician or pediatric emergency medicine fellow in the study, and excluded those with clear evidence of a definite disease entity at the time of ED presentation such as a febrile seizure or bronchiolitis. Trained research assistants who were present in the ED 16 hours a day, 7 days a week screened patients with appropriate chief complaints. The treating attending physician enrolled patients who presented during the night hours when research assistants were absent. We sought and obtained informed consent once the diagnosis of ALTE was established. The hospital institutional review board approved the study.</p>
<p>We collected sociodemographic and ED presentation information from parents of eligible patients through a standardized structured interview. The attending physician/fellow who evaluated the infant recorded the ED physical examination. We conducted a medical record review of the hospital course, procedures, and final diagnoses for admitted patients. Hospitalization, laboratory investigations, pneumography, and any other imaging modalities were performed at the discretion of treating physicians. All patients received a 4-week follow-up telephone interview to ascertain the infant’s condition. We provided the research assistants and physicians participating in the study with focused training and orientation for completing the study questionnaire.</p>
<p>The primary outcome measure was recurrence of ALTE in the 4 weeks following discharge from the hospital, which was ascertained from the 4-week follow-up telephone interview. Pneumography was labeled abnormal in the presence of apnea (central or obstructive apnea for more than 20 seconds, bradycardia less than 60 beats per minute for &gt;3 seconds, and oxygen desaturation less than 80% for &gt;5 seconds) or GER (parameters assessed included the total number of reflux episodes, the number of reflux episodes lasting &gt;5 minutes, duration of the longest reflux episode, and the reflux index (percentage of the entire record that esophageal pH was &lt;4.0, reflux index &gt;5% considered abnormal).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475704">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813475704">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475704">14</xref></sup> All studies were analyzed using a standard software package and finally read and interpreted by a dedicated specialist.</p>
<p>We used descriptive statistics to summarize the key demographic and other characteristics of the cohort. Next, we examined bivariate relationships between results of pneumography, discharge diagnosis of GER, and the effect of pharmacologic treatment of GER on the incidence of recurrent ALTE over the next 4 weeks by χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact test. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated using Medcalc statistical software.</p>

<p>A total of 228 (76.0%) of our cohort of 300 infants were hospitalized whereas 72 were discharged home from the ED. Overall, 34 infants (11.3%) had a recurrence of ALTE over the 4-week follow-up period. None died of sudden infant death syndrome during this period. Of the 228 admitted patients, 110 (48.2%) had pneumography—101 had 5-channel pneumography (with pH monitoring) and 9 had 4-channel pneumography (without pH monitoring). Of these, 41 (37.3%) were positive (apnea 23, GER 29, both apnea and reflux 11). Six of these 41 infants (14.6%) had a recurrent ALTE during the 4-week follow-up period as compared with 8 (11.6%) of 69 infants with normal pneumography, showing a RR of 1.26 (95% CI = 0.47-3.38). The association was not statistically significant for apnea or GER separately (RR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.52-4.39 and RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.37-3.30, respectively). Of the 23 infants who had positive pneumography for apnea, 10 were discharged with apnea monitor. Two of these reported recurrent ALTE during the 4-week follow-up as compared with 2 of 13 infants who did not receive apnea monitor at the time of discharge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813475704">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A total of 144 infants (48%) had GERD as an additional discharge diagnosis in addition to ALTE. GER was diagnosed based on abnormal results on pH monitoring as part of 5-channel pneumography, barium swallow, radioisotope milk scan, and/or on clinical grounds. Of the 228 hospitalized patients, 101 underwent pH monitoring as part of 5-channel pneumography (29 [28.7%] positive), 34 barium swallow (16 [47.1%] positive), and 25 radioisotope milk scan (24 [96%] positive) in pursuit of a diagnosis of GER. Thirty-three patients had 2 or more of these tests done (14 pneumography and barium swallow, 12 pneumography and milk scan, 2 barium swallow and milk scan, and 5 all 3 tests). Of the 72 infants with pH probe study negative for reflux, 49 (68%) were still diagnosed with GERD at discharge (based on clinical features or other tests) and started on antireflux medication. Of the 144 patients with a discharge diagnosis of GERD, 52 had an abnormal result on one or more of the 3 investigative tests performed, whereas 92 were diagnosed on clinical grounds, often in spite of normal results on investigations. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate of ALTE in these 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813475704">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In all, 22 of 144 (15.3%) infants with a discharge diagnosis of GERD (in addition to ALTE) had subsequent ALTE during the 4-week follow-up as against 12 of 156 (7.7%) not diagnosed with GERD, showing an increase in risk by 98% (RR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.02-3.86). A total of 123 of 144 (85.4%) infants with a discharge diagnosis of GERD were started on antireflux medication; 16 (13%) of these had recurrent ALTE during the 4-week follow-up in contrast to 6 of 21 (28.5%) not started on medication (RR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.20-1.03).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study has shown that an abnormal result on pneumography for apnea/reflux does not predict increase in recurrence rate of ALTE during the subsequent 4 weeks and that a negative pH-probe study does not affect the decision to diagnose or treat GERD where clinically indicated, thus questioning the justification for doing pneumography or pH probe studies in infants with ALTE. Infants diagnosed with GERD are nearly 2 times more likely to have recurrent ALTE, and treatment with antireflux medications may lower this risk.</p>
<p>Our cohort is similar to others described previously in terms of race, median age, and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813475704">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813475704">16</xref></sup> ALTE accounted for about 1% of ED visits by infants in our study, which is similar to the rate of 0.6% to 1.0% in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813475704">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813475704">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813475704">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role of multichannel pneumography in the evaluation of infants with ALTE has been a matter of debate. According to the NIH consensus statement and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines, there is no evidence that the characteristics of the ALTE or of the polysomnographic record can predict which infants with ALTE are at risk for future life-threatening episodes or sudden death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475704">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475704">14</xref></sup> Whereas about 50% of the infants hospitalized for ALTE in our cohort underwent pneumography, the rate of use of this modality varies from 0% to 100% in literature related to ALTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475704">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475704">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475704">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813475704">10</xref></sup> Rahilly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475704">9</xref></sup> performed 4-channel pneumography on a high-risk group of 340 infants with ALTE (sleep-associated ALTE needing vigorous stimulation or resuscitation to revive them), who presented between 1982 and 1985; 27 of these had abnormal results. On follow-up with home monitors, central apneas were detected in 20 of 26 infants who had had an abnormal pneumogram, compared with one of the 109 with a normal pneumogram. He also found that 27 of the 28 infants with future apneas despite a normal pneumogram had an episode of frank GER at the time of the second apnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475704">9</xref></sup> However, the study had less than 1% mortality and did not reveal if these episodes of apnea captured on apnea monitor were clinically significant, resulting in need for any intervention to terminate the episode. Daniëls et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813475704">10</xref></sup> subsequently also found a higher incidence of abnormalities of cardiorespiratory pattern on home monitoring in infants with ALTE who had had abnormal 9-channel polysomnography as compared to those with a normal study. The results of these 2 studies have driven the popularity of pneumography and pH monitoring following an ALTE, with subsequent home monitoring for apneas. This is despite the fact that no correlation has been shown between the recorded events and clinical outcome or risk of sudden infant death syndrome. The CHIME study in fact showed that normal infants can have respiratory pauses as long as 30 seconds and bradycardia for 10 seconds during sleep without coming to any harm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813475704">19</xref></sup> In a large series of patients on apnea monitor, only 8% of 14 131 events were caused by true apnea or bradycardia. Loose lead alarms accounted for 69% of all events, and false alarms for 23%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813475704">20</xref></sup> Home apnea monitors may only be indicated for infants with high risk of sudden death like those with one or more ALTEs requiring vigorous stimulation or resuscitation, and infants with conditions such as central hypoventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475704">1</xref></sup> Some authors have promoted the use of pneumography in all cases of ALTE to identify occult causes such as apnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475704">6</xref></sup> This approach is questionable, however, as there is no specific treatment for apnea, which is likely developmental and subject to resolution with time. Our study is the first of its kind to show that positive pneumography for apnea/reflux does not predict increase in recurrence rate of ALTE during the subsequent 4 weeks.</p>
<p>A negative pH probe study does not affect the decision by treating physicians to diagnose or treat GERD where clinically indicated. In our study, GERD was the most common additional discharge diagnosis with ALTE, accounting for 48% of cases, which is similar to that in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475704">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813475704">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813475704">11</xref></sup> The role of investigative techniques in the diagnosis of GER in infancy is debatable. In a recent study, GERD was diagnosed in 49%, in the majority, on clinical grounds. Only 13% of patients had upper gastrointestinal series performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475704">5</xref></sup> In a Swiss study, pH study was performed in 75 of the 107 infants in the cohort, and GER diagnosed in 75%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475704">21</xref></sup> In our cohort, majority of the patients with GER suspected on clinical grounds underwent tests to confirm the same. Three investigative techniques were used—pneumography with pH probe, upper gastrointestinal barium study, and radioisotope milk scan. Thirty-three patients had 2 or more of these tests done in the hope of obtaining a positive result. This should be discouraged. GER may be physiological during early infancy. Our study suggests that pH monitoring may not be sensitive enough in diagnosing GER. Multiple intraluminal esophageal impedance recording along with pH monitoring doubles the probability of documenting an association between symptoms and reflux compared with pH monitoring as the symptoms may be independent of the acidity of the refluxed fluid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813475704">22</xref></sup> Twenty-four out of 25 (96%) radioisotope milk scans were positive for GER in our study sample, suggesting that this technique is overly sensitive and that a proportion of these cases may be false positive. This has been shown in a previous study as well where radioisotope milk scans were obtained in 46 of 65 infants admitted with ALTE and demonstrated GERD in 89%; however, clinical diagnosis of GERD was made in only 41% of these. The milk scan demonstrated GERD in 16 infants with other more likely diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813475704">17</xref></sup> The NASPGHAN guidelines also do not recommend the use of nuclear scintigraphy in the routine diagnosis and management of GERD in infants and children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475704">14</xref></sup> As other reviewers have suggested, it seems reasonable to diagnose GERD in the setting of ALTE based on clinical grounds, with investigations reserved for exceptional cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813475704">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to remember that the presence of a condition capable of causing ALTE does not equal causation in an individual case. In the majority of cases, it may be a comorbid condition. This is particularly true of GER, diagnosed in 50% of our cohort. A study of a cohort of infants with both apnea and GER found that in the few instances where episodes of apnea were associated with GER, the predominant sequence of events was obstructive or mixed apnea followed by reflux, rather than the reverse as might be expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813475704">23</xref></sup> In our study, infants diagnosed with GERD were twice as likely to have recurrent ALTE. Doshi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475704">5</xref></sup> found that 9% of their patients with a discharge diagnosis of GERD and ALTE had a recurrent ALTE over a 6-month follow-up period. They did not provide the follow-up results for those without GERD.</p>
<p>A recent systematic review that studied effectiveness of PPIs in reducing GERD symptoms found conflicting results in infants—no benefit from omeprazole but benefit from lanzoprazole and pantoprazole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813475704">13</xref></sup> Medical therapy of ALTEs suspected of being related to GER has not been adequately studied. Approaches that decrease the frequency of regurgitation and the volume of reflux such as thickened feeding may theoretically be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475704">14</xref></sup> In our study, of the patients diagnosed with GERD, 13% of those started on antireflux medications (histamine H2 blockers and PPIs) had recurrent ALTE during the 4-week follow-up in contrast to 28.5% not started on medication showing a trend toward statistical significance. In another study, those diagnosed with GERD were commenced on medical treatment comprising cisapride with or without ranitidine or omeprazole, and very few patients presented with a second episode of ALTE, suggesting a link and beneficial effect of treatment according to the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475704">21</xref></sup> There was no control group, however. Gastric acidity is a major nonimmune defense mechanism against infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813475704">24</xref></sup> In very low birth weight infants being cared for in neonatal intensive care units, use of ranitidine has been found to be associated with increased risk of infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, and fatal outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813475704">24</xref></sup> Such adverse effects have, however, not been shown in infants outside the neonatal intensive care unit setting. Still, use of these medications needs to be carefully thought out and should not be an automatic choice.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study is based on a single, tertiary children’s hospital site thus limiting the generalizability of the results. Even though all the eligible infants who presented to the ED could not be enrolled, a respectable 88% of those eligible were enrolled. The numbers of infants with conditions of interest are modest limiting the power of the study, even though this is one of the largest prospective, single-center studies of its kind.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Positive pneumography for apnea/reflux does not predict increase in recurrence rate of ALTE during the subsequent 4 weeks. A negative pH probe study does not affect the physician decision to diagnose or treat GERD where clinically indicated. Infants diagnosed with GERD are more likely to have recurrent ALTE. Treatment with antireflux medications may lower this risk.</p>
