<abstract>
<p>Friction drilling is a newer nontraditional hole-making chipless process, which is used to make holes in materials that are used in aerospace, automotive, commercial and industrial products, electronic packaging, and thermal management. In friction drilling, a rotating conical tool is applied to penetrate work-material and create a hole in single step. In this study, comprehensive analysis on friction drilling of Al/SiC<sub>p</sub> metal matrix composites is carried out. This article discusses the roundness (hole diameter accuracy) errors on dry friction-drilled holes. The parameters considered for the experiment are: the composition of workpiece, workpiece thickness, spindle speed, and feed rate. The effect of parameters on roundness errors is analyzed using experimental design matrix and empirical relation between the process parameters and roundness error is established using response surface methodology. Analysis of variance is used for analyzing the results. The influences of individual input process parameters on roundness error are analyzed and presented in this study.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410493" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Discontinuous reinforced metal matrix composite is one of the developments in the field of material engineering and it offers various advantages over conventional materials such as improved strength, specific modulus, high toughness, and good wear-resisting property even at elevated temperatures. Due to its unique advantages, it is extensively used in structural, aerospace, and automobile applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410493">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Discontinuously reinforced aluminum (DRA) MMCs find increased application in different industries owing to their properties. They have isotropic properties and provide specific stiffness values that are higher than those of aerospace metal alloys by as much as 100%. The most widely used DRA aerospace materials have volume fractions that range from 15% to 25% of SiCp particles. These materials have isotropic specific stiffness up to 50% higher than that of metal alloys and isotropic specific strengths that are equivalent to those of the best commonly used aerospace metal alloys, such as Ti–6Al–4 V and 7075-T6 aluminum. These MMCs also provide specific stiffness equivalent to that of the best graphite/epoxy cross-plied material and have specific strengths in the midrange of cross-plied organic composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410493">2</xref></sup> Tosun and Muratoglu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410493">3</xref></sup> reported that Al/SiCp MMCs are extremely difficult to machine – turning, milling, drilling, and threading – due to their abrasive properties. They have conducted drilling studies on Al/17%/SiC particulate metal matrix composite (PMMC) with TiN-coated high-speed steel (HSS) drills. They found that the surface roughness decreased with increase in cutting speed and reasoned it with the burnishing or honing effect by the rubbing action of small SiC particles trapped between tool and workpiece.</p>
<p>The researchers are finding some difficulty in drilling of composite materials by ordinary drilling. Davim andBaptista<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410493">4</xref></sup> used a substance harder than SiC, polycrystalline diamond (PCD) drills to make holes in aluminum with 7.0% silicon and 0.4% magnesium, reinforced with 20% by volume silicon carbide (SiC) particles. Basavarajappa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410493">5</xref></sup> studied the influence of cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and their interaction) on burr formation in drilling of Al/SiCp and Al/SiCp–Gr composites with carbide and coated carbide drills. They applied L<sub>9</sub> orthogonal array based on Taguchi techniques and found that statistical models developed by them can be used for the prediction of burr height in drilling MMCs using different tool materials.</p>
<p>In this context, a novel drilling process using a friction tool is experimented here for its effectiveness in drilling Al/SiC<sub>p</sub> MMC plates of varied thickness. Friction drilling is a nontraditional hole-making method that utilizes the heat generated from friction between a rotating conical tool and the workpiece to soften and penetrate the work-material and generate a hole in the work piece. Materials with higher strength should require more thrust force to be penetrated. Friction drilling is also called thermal drilling, flow drilling, form drilling, or friction stir drilling. In this novel process, safe clearance space must be provided at the top and bottom of the work-material being drilled for the extruded work material to form petals/protrusions. Bushing formation will take place when the protrusions of the hole are forced down by the collar of the tool.</p>
<p>A bushing and petal formation around the drilled holes are unavoidable in friction drilling but are well tolerated in the case of Al alloy and any material with low elongation at break (%). For Al alloy, due to the fracture or peeling in the bushing-forming process during friction drilling, much of the work-material is improperly displaced and does not form a proper bushing. But the deformation and fracture of work-material to form petals are not well understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410493">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>These bushing formations are used advantageously by many researchers for lengthening the threaded portion of the hole and consequently increase the fastener clamp load in subsequent assembly operations. This clean and chipless friction drilling process has the advantage of reducing the time required for drilling and incurring less tool wear, thus lengthening the service life of the drill. In friction drilling AISI Steel by Miller et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410493">7</xref></sup> minimal tool wear is reported after producing 11,000 holes and they noted the change in diameter between hole numbers 1 and 11,000 is 0.29 mm, which is near the bottom of the bushing at a depth of 4.46 mm. The performance of the sintered carbide friction drill was compared with the Tungsten carbide (WC) twist drill in drilling AISI-304 material by Chow et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410493">8</xref></sup> They concluded that WC twist drill damaged seriously after three drilling runs but the friction drill showed little wear only after 60 runs of the drill and also good quality hole surface is obtained.</p>
<p>Friction drilling of Al/SiCp MMC plates is advantageous owing to the minimal friction tool wear and improved hole quality. Depending on the thermal conductivity and frictional energy generated during drilling, this localized heating can reduce the magnitude of work hardening that would otherwise occur by deformation alone. The heat generation associated with the friction drilling process is of less concern in the case of friction drilling of Al/SiC<sub>p</sub> MMC plates as this material is a good thermal conductor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410493">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most common roundness problems in drilled holes is the existence of the spaced lobes due to low-frequency vibrations. A mathematical model to predict some properties of holes such as cylindricity, roundness, and perpendicularity values was developed by Pirtini and Lazoglu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410493">10</xref></sup> Hole diameter accuracy (roundness errors) and the surface finish inside the hole are the important qualities or the characteristics of holes required in the aerospace industry. In dry drilling of aluminum alloy, aluminum adheres to the tool and clogs the flutes resulting in tool failure. Drill performance and hole quality are mainly dependent on the cutting parameters and tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410493">11</xref></sup> Hence, to reduce the wear of tool and cost of making flutes of the drill, a fluteless friction drill is studied.</p>
<p>Shin Min Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410493">12</xref></sup> concluded that the coated drills had higher surface temperature than uncoated ones. However, the difference in performance between coated and uncoated drills diminished with increase in number of holes drilled. Gaitonde et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410493">13</xref></sup> conducted machining experiment with aluminum alloy reinforced with 20% of SiC particulates (A 356/20/SiCp-T6) using a PCD tool and did mathematical model using response surface methodology (RSM). They concluded that the machining force and cutting power increase with increase in feed rate while the specific cutting force decreases.</p>
<p>The literature available on friction drilling of Al/SiCp MMC plates and on roundness error of drilled holes is very limited. In the recent past to the knowledge of the authors, neither systematic work nor modeling of process parameter is carried out in friction drilling of Al/SiC composites. Hence, in this study, a comprehensive analysis has been carried out for friction drilling of Al/SiC<sub>p</sub> MMCs with low range of SiC composition excluding bushing formation and including hole quality in terms of roundness error.</p>
<p>A mathematical model has been developed to predict the roundness errors of drilled Al/SiCp MMC plates using response surface method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to check the validity of the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410493">14</xref></sup> This model can be effectively used to predict the roundness errors of drilled Al/SiCp MMC plates. This friction drilling process will pave way for reducing the tool wear and reducing time in manufacturing and the objective is the successful application of friction drill in making holes with very less tool wear.</p>

<p>Friction drilling is one of the novel processes in which the drilling is controlled by many factors. For the aluminum alloy, the thermal conductivity is high. A large portion of the frictional heat is transferred into the workpiece and the effect of friction heating is relatively small. Low temperature causes insufficient increase in ductility and softening, resulting in high thrust force, denting of the workpiece, and improper bushing formation.</p>
<p>These effects dictated the selection of spindle speeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410493">9</xref></sup> During friction drilling, the surface temperature of drills increases with increase in spindle speed and it also increases with repeated drillings or number of holes drilled which is due to the adhesion of tool to workpiece.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410493">12</xref></sup> Davim and Conceicao António<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410493">15</xref></sup> found that while drilling 15-mm thick PMMC discs, with PCD twist drills to cut 5 mm diameter holes at a constant cutting speed, the surface finish of the holes of the drilled samples deteriorates with increasing feed rate but does not change signiﬁcantly with varying cutting speed. From the available literature, it was found that apart from cutting speed and tool feed rate, composition of SiCp particles and plate thickness may have influence on the hole quality.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311410493"><title>Developing the experimental design matrix</title>
<p>Considering the slightly wider ranges of the factors, a five-level, central composite, rotatable design matrix is used for experimentation. Central composite rotatable designs (CCD) of second order have been found to be the most efficient tool in RSM to establish the mathematical relation of the response surface using the smallest possible number of experiments without losing its accuracy. In the present case, the size of the experiment is 31 for four machining parameters. The design is subdivided into three parts as shown below.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410493">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410493">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311410493">18</xref></sup>

All the chosen variables at the intermediate level (0) constitute the center points and the combinations of each of the variables are either the lowest (−2) or the highest (+2) with the other three variables of the intermediate levels constituting the star points.

<p>Friction drilling is one of the important operations in manufacturing engineering getting importance due to its simplest operation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410493">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the stages in friction drilling of Al/SiCp MMC workpiece. First, the tool comes into initial contact with the workpiece, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410493">Figure 1</xref>(a). Next, at the main thrust stage, the tool penetrates the workpiece and a high axial force is encountered, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410493">Figure 1</xref>(b).

<p>The friction associated with the friction drilling between the contact surfaces produces heat which softens the work-material and the protrusions of the displaced workpiece material starts appearing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410493">Figure 1</xref>(c). The tool is advanced further, and the protrusions of the displaced workpiece material starts appearing above as well as below the workpiece, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410493">Figure 1</xref>(d). Provision for the movement of protruding metal is necessary. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410493">Figure 1</xref>(e) shows the material separation stage, where the tool penetrates through the workpiece and makes a hole.

<p>The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis is carried out for the workpiece material in the inner surface of the friction-drilled hole and is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410493">Figure 10</xref>. EDX profile indicates the presence of more silicon in the workpiece. It is due to the presence of silicon in the matrix aluminum alloy as well in the added SiCp particles. The abrasive nature of the SiCp particles is the major reason for the wear on the tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410493">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410493">4</xref></sup> and in this study, the friction tool will not try to cut these abrasive particles but push them in. Thermal softening is believed to take place in machining of Al/SiC<sub>p</sub> MMC composites where the workpiece material becomes softer due to the heat generated and SiC<sub>p</sub> particles become pressed into the workpiece.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311410493">22</xref></sup> This phenomenon is the main cause of minimal tool wear in friction drilling.

<p>The influence of different machining parameters like spindle speed, feed, percentage weight fraction of SiC, and thickness of the workpiece on roundness error has been analyzed based on the developed mathematical model.</p>
<p>The plots of the roundness error vs. machining parameters considered have been prepared and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410493">Figure 12</xref> to illustrate the trend of variation of roundness error with various friction drilling parameters.

<p>Variation of roundness errors with respect to different spindle speeds is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410493">Figure12</xref>(a). Roundness error which is maximum at 3000 rpm owing to the instability of the tool is due to the imbalance of the cutting force. The graph indicates that, the increase of spindle speed increases the roundness error up to 3000 rpm and then reduces. Speed of 3000 rpm may be considered as a critical one and after that the roundness error will reduce in friction drilling of Al/SiCp composite material. The reason being at higher speed, stability of the tool taking place as the matrix and SiCp particles are pushed out easily which makes easy penetration of the tool, thereby producing good roundness. The general trend is that the roundness errors are minimal at lower and higher ranges of spindle speed with peaking at 3000 rpm.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410493">Figure 12</xref>(b) illustrates the variation of roundness errors with respect to different tool feeds. Roundness errors are minimal at 50 mm/min owing to the reduced contact time of the tool with the workpiece and the associated heat generated is sufficient for the penetration of the tool with less thrust force and torque. Further increase of feed though reduces the contact time of the tool with the workpiece, increases thrust force, associated vibrations and thereby increases the roundness error. The general trend is that the roundness errors are increasing with increase in feed values minimal at 50 mm/min.</p>
<p>Variation graph of roundness errors with respect to different weight fractions is drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410493">Figure 12</xref>(c). Roundness errors are minimal at the middle range mainly owing to the number of SiCp particles present at the tool–workpiece interaction area, which is supporting the hole formation by disintegrating themselves from the matrix for the penetration of the tool with less thrust force and torque.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410493">16</xref></sup> This may be the major contributing factor for the high value of roundness error at 5 wt% of SiC<sub>p</sub>. More deviation at the 25 wt% of SiCp particles may be due to the clustering behavior of the particles when their number is large enough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311410493">23</xref></sup> The general trend is that the roundness errors are minimal at midrange of wt% and maximal at the lower and higher ranges.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410493">Figure12</xref>(d) depicts the variation of roundness errors with respect to plate thickness. Roundness errors are stable at and above 3 mm owing to the tool stability due to the presence of the newly drilled surface and heat retained by the plate for easy plastic deformation.</p>
<p>The graph indicates that the increase of plate thickness increases the roundness error up to 3 mm due to the instability of the tool. The general trend is that the roundness errors are increasing with increase in plate thickness minimal at 2 mm. The curve exhibits a tendency of roundness errors reducing with increase in plate thickness as the graph is not sloping upward.</p>
<p>From the above analysis, it has been asserted that medium spindle speed, less feed rate, medium weight percentage of SiC, and low thickness of plate are preferred in friction drilling of Al/SiC Composites.</p>

<p>Mathematical model for roundness has been developed to correlate the important machining parameters in friction drilling of Al/SiCp MMC workpiece. The experimental plan is of rotatable central composite design. The four important input variables considered for this research study is spindle speed, tool feed rate, thickness of the workpiece, and weight percentage of SiCp. The influences of all machining parameters on roundness have been analyzed based on the developed mathematical model. The following conclusions are drawn based on this study:
<list id="list5-0021998311410493" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The roundness error increases gradually with the increase in spindle speed within the range of 2000–3000 rpm and then reduces until 4000 rpm. The general trend is that at lower and higher values of spindle speed, the roundness error is lower. Minimal value is at 2000 rpm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The roundness error increases with the increase in feed rate within the range of 50 to 80 mm/min. The general trend is that the roundness errors are increasing with increase in feed values. Minimal value is at 50 mm/min.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The roundness error decreases with the increase in weight percentage of SiCp within the range 5–15% and then increases up to 25%. The general trend is that the roundness error is higher at lower and higher values of wt% of SiC, it is lower at the midrange.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The roundness error increases with the increase in the thickness of plates within the range 2–3.5 mm and there exists a negative trend afterwards. The general trend is that roundness error increases with increase of plate thickness. Minimal value is at 2 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This technique is convenient to predict the main effects and interaction effects of different influential combinations of machining parameters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Though the number of experimentations is slightly more, this technique is still economical to arrive at the influences of various parameters in a systematic manner.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The procedure can be used to predict the roundness errors for friction drilling of Al/SiCp MMC composites within the ranges of the variable studied. However, the validity of the procedure is mostly limited to the range of factors considered for the experimentation.</p></list-item>
