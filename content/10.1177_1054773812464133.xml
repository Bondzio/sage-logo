<p>We are pleased to announce that after publishing <italic>Clinical Nursing Research</italic> (<italic>CNR</italic>) for 20 years, our first Volume was in February of 1992, <italic>CNR</italic> has received its first Impact Factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812464133">Thomas Reuters, 2012</xref>). This is a significant step in recognition of the nursing research published in <italic>CNR</italic> and recognition that a quarterly journal focusing on clinical nursing research is influential. As the Editor of <italic>CNR</italic> for the last five years, this has been a goal to have <italic>CNR</italic> listed among the approximately 30% of all journals indexed in the Journal Citation Reports<sup>®</sup>. This isn’t the only measure of the quality of a journal but there are some advantages to the journal as well as the authors who publish in ranked journals. Examples include: many academic institutions expect their faculty to publish in ranked journals; other institutions may use the Impact Factor as an assessment of a faculty member’s performance for promotion, tenure or even funding decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812464133">Oerman, 2012</xref>); librarians may also consider a journal’s rank when making subscription decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812464133">Thomson Reuters, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Impact Factors have a history dating back to the 1950’s when Eugene Garfield proposed the <italic>Science Citations Index</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812464133">Garfield, 2006</xref>). The Impact factor came into use in the 1960s as a means of selecting journals to be indexed in the Science Citation Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812464133">Garfield, 2006</xref>). This overall index is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812464133">Thomson Reuters, 2012</xref>). Nursing journal’s presence in the Science Citations Index has been steadily growing. In 2004, here were only 35 nursing journals listed in this index. In 2012, there are at least 95 journals listed for the 2011 Journal Citation Reports® (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812464133">Polit &amp; Northam, 2011</xref>). The Journal Impact Factors are numerical values calculated by the average number of times articles from the journal published in the past 2 years have been cited in the Journal Citation Report year. These include only citations appearing in ranked journals and only citable articles published in the previous two years. None publishable articles include commentaries, letters, interviews, tributes book reviews, obituaries and perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812464133">Garfield, 2006</xref>). The <italic>CNR</italic> Impact Factor is 0.881 ranked 51 out of 97 in Nursing Science and 48 out of 95 in Nursing Social Science; <italic>CNR</italic> has been recognized as a quality nursing research journal for the first time. There is room for growth and increased influence. Over the next few years, <italic>CNR</italic> will be evaluated using the 5-year impact factor that is calculated to the two year impact but using the five previous years instead of just two. Other opportunities for <italic>CNR</italic> include new measures added to the Journal Citation Reports<sup>®</sup>. One is having an Eigen factor Score and the other is an Article Influence Score. The Eigen factor was designed to capture quality as well as quantity of citations. The Article Influence Score was designed to measure influence per article after the first five years of the articles publication (Polit &amp; Northam). These will be new measures of quality to work towards in the future.</p>
<p>When authors chose where to publish their manuscript it may be important to consider a journal’s impact factor particularly, if publishing in a journal with an impact factor is necessary for their career. However, there is some controversy on the value of Journal Impact Factors. For example, it is possible for one well cited article to influence the journals ranking rather than multiple manuscripts having moderate citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812464133">Polit &amp; Northam, 2011</xref>). Journals that publish review articles will often have higher impact factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812464133">Oermann, 2012</xref>). A practice has been reported that reviewers will suggest specific article citations be added to a manuscript to support the science but this practice also raises the citations of the referenced manuscript. This was never the intent of the Science Citations Index. It was meant as one indicator of quality and a proxy measure of the importance of the journal in the field. Other measures of quality include a journals reputation, time to publication, readership, recommendations from colleagues, copyright restrictions and open access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812464133">Olson, 2011</xref>). One that rings true to me is a recommendation from a colleague. During my post doctoral fellowship, I was advised to submit a manuscript to Clinical Nursing Research in 2001. This started my ongoing relationship with <italic>CNR</italic>, first as an Author and then as Editor. So, I invite you on this journey with me toward the ongoing recognition of <italic>CNR</italic> as an influential nursing research journal. I look forward to your submissions and your ongoing relationship with <italic>CNR</italic>.</p>
