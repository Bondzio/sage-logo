<abstract>
<p>Attention is called to disturbing developments in insurance reimbursement that threaten the practice of therapy involving more than one person. This can be seen as part of the movement to marginalize psychotherapy as first-line treatment and replace it with the inappropriate and excessive (and often exclusive) use of medication.</p>

<p>Some of us—especially the older generation who were there at the beginning—are alarmed at the ease with which eternal verities such as “systems thinking” can be set aside.</p>

</p>
<p>A provocative article entitled “When Marital Therapy Isn’t” recently appeared in an independent bimonthly newspaper for behavioral health care practitioners, <italic>The National Psychologist</italic>. Written by two mental health law and ethics scholars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480711420050">Jeffrey Younggren and Stephen Hjelt (2010)</xref>, it warned of several significant dangers facing <italic>all</italic> mental health practitioners who want to treat couples in the context of the identified patient’s health insurance policy not providing coverage for “marital therapy” services. Intended to help clinicians manage risk in their practices, it also signaled the potential death knell for a large portion of couple therapy practice (at least in the United States), notwithstanding the massive evidence-based literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711420050">Lebow &amp; Gurman, 1995</xref>) supporting the efficacy of marital/couple and family therapy for a wide variety of both relational problems and diagnosed problems of individuals (e.g., depression, alcoholism) and the causal role played by chronic couple conflict for various mental health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711420050">Gurman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this brief piece, we focus on the risk to couple and family therapy posed by certain policies of insurance coverage and managed care. Larger issues involving various economic, clinical, and ethical considerations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711420050">Hoyt, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711420050">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711420050">Cummings &amp; O’Donohue, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711420050">2011</xref>) go far beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480711420050">
<title>From an Individual Orientation to a Systems Focus, and Back</title>
<p>The concerns raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711420050">Younggren and Hjelt (2010)</xref> transcend professional boundaries and are relevant to all systems-oriented clinicians. Let us take a brief trip back in time to when couple and family therapy was barely in its nascency. Way back in 1961, then young Jay Haley, the founder of the first family therapy journal, <italic>Family Process</italic>, wrote a paper entitled “Whither Family Therapy?” in which he contrasted individual psychotherapy with the then-just-emerging field of family (which includes couple) treatment: “The family therapist would seem to be arguing that psychopathology in the individual is a product of the way in which he [sic] deals with intimate relations, the way they deal with him, and the way other family members involve him in their relations with each other. Further, the appearance of symptomatic behavior in an individual is necessary for the continued functioning of a family system. Therefore, changes in the individual can only occur if the family system changes, and resistance to change in an individual centers in the influence of the family as a group. Most techniques of family therapy center in shifting the focus from the identified patient to the family and then resolving the problems in family relationships. At that point the individuals in the family undergo change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711420050">Haley, 1969</xref>, pp. 102–103).</p>
<p>The word “whither” in Haley’s title, according to the dictionary, means “to what place; to what point, degree, end, conclusion, or design; whereto.” The “systems/interactional/ strategic” therapeutic orientation he was heralding blossomed into many theories, schools, and techniques. Concepts such as <italic>homeostasis</italic>, <italic>cybernetics and feedback loops, interpersonal function of the symptom</italic>, <italic>triangulation</italic>, <italic>circular causality</italic>, and <italic>boundaries and enmeshment</italic> have proved fertile ground for various approaches. Fifty years later, however, family (and couple) therapy is under attack and is once again being marginalized. Hence the “Wither” in our title, with only one letter <italic>h</italic>; the dictionary tells us that this word means “to dry; to lose freshness, vigor, focus, etc.; to waste away.”</p>
<p>Many examples of this backward shift in the world of mental health could be described. Let two suffice. (1) A woman was very distressed after finding out that her husband had been having an affair. She called her health maintenance organization (HMO) clinic and was seen for an initial assessment. Her level of distress clearly met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (Fourth Edition, Text Revision [<italic>DSM-IV-R</italic>]) criteria for Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features (and possibly Depression NOS or Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode). When the assessing clinician proposed to meet with the woman and her husband to help them resolve their problems and thus restore her sense of well-being, the company’s administrative powers opposed conjoint treatment. The therapist was told to refer the woman to a cognitive–behavioral Overcoming Depression group where she could learn to “restructure her cognitions” and to breathe differently “to reduce her tension.” It was also suggested that she be referred to a psychiatrist for evaluation for an antidepressant medication if her level of distress exceeded a certain level. Couple therapy was said to be “not covered.” (2) A therapist employed at a different HMO submitted an authorization request to seek insurance coverage for several additional therapy sessions to help her patient, a woman undergoing a very painful divorce, now suffering with diagnosed depression. The request was denied outright on the basis that marital therapy was not an insurance-covered service. The therapist repeated what she had already clearly indicated on her authorization request, that she was working with her patient in individual psychotherapy to deal with her relationship loss, which was clearly the cause of her depression. The therapist added that she and the patient had never even considered conjoint therapy. All for naught. The HMO official reiterated that the “treatment of marital problems” was not a covered benefit, the format of treatment notwithstanding.</p>

<title>What is Going on Here?</title>
<p>While it is tempting to simply endorse the cynical view that an insurance company is an institution designed to collect premiums and deny claims, it is also true that affordable insurance cannot provide unlimited services, and that some rational rationing must take place (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711420050">Hoyt, 1995</xref>). Getting embroiled and enmeshed in an endless quagmire of marital quarreling (dueling diagnoses!) is no more useful than getting endlessly stuck with an interminable individual patient. It is also true, however, that helping people change their intimate social relations may be useful and necessary to relieve their psychological distress. To not address the social causes of such distress—which may also include larger sociocultural issues such as economic displacement and poverty, racism, sexism, homophobia, and so on—may be shortsighted and counterproductive, leading not to a useful management of limited resources but to a squandering of such resources. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711420050">Hoyt (2001</xref>/2004, p. 126) emphasized, “A failure to resolve couples conflict often leads to more suffering, increased symptoms, and more expensive one-on-one therapy.”</p>
<p>“Medical necessity” is the <italic>sine qua non</italic> for insurance coverage. It is usually defined as a <italic>DSM-IV-R</italic> Axis I diagnosis and some combination of the following: (1) treatment is likely to yield significant improvement or at least be necessary for stabilization, (2) no treatment is likely to result in a worsening and later require more treatment, and (3) treatment is required because the patient is functioning below a certain level, often identified by some cutoff score on Axis V of <italic>DSM-IV-R</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711420050">Hoyt, 2009</xref>, p. 98). These criteria are used to define both the kinds of clinical disorders for which treatment is deemed “medically necessary” and the kinds of services that are covered by insurance plans. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711420050">Younggren and Hjelt (2010)</xref> wrote, clinicians are ill advised to engage in “creative billing” in which they “upcode” (exaggerate) a patient’s problem to justify treatment: such distortions are dishonest and can be seen as insurance fraud and prosecuted. If both members of a couple are to be seen together, it is important for clinicians to document why conjoint therapy is necessary and to use methods that are likely to prove effective and efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711420050">Lebow, 2010</xref>). Some ways ethically to increase the likelihood of conjoint therapy being approved for insurance coverage are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711420050">Hoyt (2001</xref>/2004).</p>
<p>There is also a larger vision at stake here: the configuration of the self and what it means to be human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711420050">Cushman, 1995</xref>). Do we conceive of people as monads, isolated individuals with intrapsychic problems, or do we conceive of people and their problems in context? What about when disturbed relationships are themselves the source of pain? Do we give more than lip service to the biopsychosocial conception of human functioning? How important are couples/families? The individualization and medicalization of mental health treatment seems often times to be driven and underwritten by the pharmaceutical industry. Special efforts have to be made to educate both the public and private purchasers of health care about just what modes (individual, group, conjoint) and models (cognitive–behavioral, psychodynamic, systems, solution-focused, etc.) of therapy actually have empirical warrant for considering them to be “treatments of choice” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711420050">Wampold, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711420050">Fraser and Solovey (2007)</xref>, for example, describe various strategic–interactional interventions, all empirically supported, for successful therapy with anxiety, depression, parent–child and couple problems, substance abuse, and self-harm and suicidality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711420050">Prosky and Keith (2003)</xref> describe many instances in which family therapy can be used as an alternative to psychopharmacology, resolving rather than suppressing anxiety and depression that result from interpersonal and intrapsychic conflicts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711420050">Milkowitz (2011)</xref> documents the important roles of individual and family therapy, along with psychopharmacology, in the integrated treatment of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Once a need for therapy is established, should it not be the informed clinician and patient who decide how to proceed? Cultural awareness on the part of the therapist often provides an essential perspective, and involving multiple family members in treatment may fit better with the preferences of some groups and individuals. Retreating from relational diagnoses and solutions seems especially wrongheaded at a time when psychology and the other mental-health professions are making important efforts both to embrace diversity and cultural competence and to restore psychotherapy (not medication) as frontline treatment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711420050">Cummings &amp; O’Donohue, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711420050">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to such very important larger-vision issues, there is a conceptual confusion and confounding of major proportions operating. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711420050">Younggren and Hjelt (2010)</xref> note:<disp-quote>
<p>Because the diagnosis fits the client is not the issue because it is arguably the focus and purpose of the treatment and the treatment plan that is important. Thus, if you are treating the couple but identifying one individual as a patient/client for reimbursement purposes, you arguably have given a mental health diagnosis to an individual unnecessarily and have misused the purpose of the CPT code (p. 8).</p>
</disp-quote>Such an assessment entirely confuses the (diagnosed) disorder with interventions that may be appropriate and helpful for the relief of such disorder, as illustrated in our two earlier vignettes. Whether or not one accepts the traditional homeostatic concept that an individual’s symptoms serve functions for the very integrity of the family (couple) system in which the symptom/disorder is embedded, it cannot be denied that dysfunctional partner interactions often reinforce the presence and severity of the diagnosed disorder, even in cases where there may be little basis for attributing a causal role to such interactions in the development of the individual partner’s disorder (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711420050">Beach, Dreifuss, Franklin, Kamen, and Gabriel [2008]</xref> cogent discussion of such effects in the case of depression).</p>
<p>Given this obvious clinical reality, couple therapy may provide the precisely appropriate empirically supported clinical treatment context in which the diagnosed partner’s disorder may find relief. Thus, giving one partner a mental health diagnosis is in no logical way inconsistent with providing couple therapy, when either the causal or exacerbating/maintaining factors of the individual disorder lie within a couple’s relationship. Treating “garden variety” couple problems (which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480711420050">Sabin and Daniels [1994]</xref> call “suffering from life”), such as normal disputes and communication difficulties, where there is no clinical warrant for diagnosing either partner is simply not equivalent to treating those couple (or family) problems which have caused or serve to maintain the symptoms, distress, and suffering for which one member of a dyad seeks psychotherapeutic help. To fail to appreciate this fundamental distinction confounds attempts to understand both the mediators and mechanisms of how psychotherapy leads to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711420050">Kazdin, 2009</xref>) with matters of diagnostic validity. This may seem like a mere academic trifle to insurance underwriters but to fail to make this <italic>distinction</italic> inevitably harms our patients.</p>
<p>In a follow-up article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711420050">Younggren and Harris (2010)</xref> note that some insurance carriers are, at least on their websites, considering family therapy as outpatient psychotherapy and a covered benefit when it is determined to be medically or psychologically necessary for treatment of a valid diagnosed behavioral health disorder. Marriage and family therapists are in the process of being recognized as providers in the Veterans Administration (VA) mental health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711420050">
<italic>MFT Progress Notes</italic>, 2010</xref>). One can only hope that such new VA clinical staff members will actually be practicing in their area of clinical expertise, especially as more recognition is given to the role of couple conflict on the high rate of suicide and homicide among combat soldiers in Iraq and Afganistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711420050">Gottman, Gottman, &amp; Atkins, 2011</xref>), as well as the importance of couple and family treatment for returning veterans suffering from PTSD, depression, substance abuse, and related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711420050">Makin-Byrd, Gifford, McCutcheon, &amp; Glynn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480711420050">Sautter, Armelie, Glynn, &amp; Wielt, 2011</xref>). Still, many HMOs and other insurers are not covering couple/family therapy. One HMO with which we are familiar recently lumped together “marriage counseling” and “family counseling” as nonreimbursable “nontraditional therapies” with dance therapy, art therapy, and “animal therapy”! In addition to being historically inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711420050">Gurman &amp; Snyder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711420050">Kaslow, 2010</xref>), such an administrative feat suggests blindness to the fact that improving couple/family relationships can and often does change the very factors that either created or at least maintain the diagnosed problem. For such (non)insurers, it is not clear how much of the problem is a conceptual inability to see beyond the individual and how much is a motivational problem (they do not want to pay if they can avoid it), or both. They often argue that even if there is a problem that warrants “medical” intervention, it cannot be addressed via treating multiple persons. Instead, they wrongly accuse clinicians of “upcoding.”</p>
<p>The importance of couple and family therapy is recognized by its professional licensure in every state within the United States. It is an emphasis within a separate division (43, Family Psychology) of the American Psychological Association and is included, of course, in the graduate training of every marriage and family therapist and in many residency training programs in psychiatry. Should insurance companies be allowed to “exclude” empirically supported couples and family services over the research-supported judgment of the mental-health professions? To quote Haley (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480711420050">Yapko, 2001</xref>, p. 200, emphasis in original) again, “I think we should send all the managed care people to social work school! <italic>Something</italic> should be done with them, because to have business people determining how therapy should be done, and for how many sessions, seems bizarre.”</p>

<sec id="section3-1066480711420050">
<title>What are We to Do?</title>
<p>There is a movement afoot to reduce or eliminate psychotherapy as first-line treatment and to replace it with drugs, despite abundant evidence that psychotherapy is often better—more effective, more durable, fewer side effects, and so on—than medication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711420050">Caccavale, 2011</xref>). Thus far, most attention has been paid to the assault on individual, one-on-one therapy; this article is intended to serve as a call to arms for those who also value evidence-based therapy involving more than one person. We should not simply capitulate or “get on board” while we can. We need to keep presenting to the public, to purchasers, and to health care policy makers the evidence that appropriate couple/family therapy (and individual therapy) is the best choice, both in terms of reducing human suffering and reducing financial expenditures. We need to advocate, both as individuals and through our various professional associations and societies, for what we think is both clinically appropriate and in the best interests of our patients. The National Alliance of Professional Psychology Providers (NAPPP; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nappp.org/white-paper.pdf">http://www.nappp.org/white-paper.pdf</ext-link>) has taken such a position. Whither the American Psychological Association (APA), the American Psychiatric Association (ApA), the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT), the American Family Therapy Academy (AFTA), the American Counseling Association (ACA), the National Association of Social Workers (NASW)? Wither couple/family therapy?</p>
