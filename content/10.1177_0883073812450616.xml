<abstract>
<p>Phantosmia is an infrequently reported and poorly understood qualitative olfactory disorder characterized by the perception of a frequently unpleasant odor in the absence of an odorant stimulus. Peripheral phantosmia is hypothesized to involve abnormally active olfactory receptor neurons while central phantosmia is theorized to be the result of hyperactive neurons in the cortex. The authors present a case report that describes 2 patients with incomparable tumors and radiation fields who both experienced phantosmia featuring a halitosis-like odor during their courses of radiation therapy. Both the 6-year-old with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and the 15-year-old with World Health Organization grade II-III astrocytoma in the bifrontal lobes experienced significant distress and decreased quality of life during treatment because of the phantosmia, which resolved after completion of radiation therapy. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, these are the first descriptions of phantosmia during focal or whole-brain radiation therapy.</p>

<p>Phantosmia is a rare and poorly understood qualitative olfactory disorder characterized by the perception of an unpleasant odor in the absence of an odorant stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812450616">1</xref></sup> It can be differentiated from an olfactory hallucination by its longer duration, which typically extends over a few minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812450616">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Phantosmia may be classified as peripheral or central in origin. In cases of peripheral phantosmia, distorted perceptions of smell are thought to be the result of hyperactive olfactory receptor neurons, or conversely, inactive inhibitory neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450616">2</xref></sup> Central phantosmia is hypothesized to be the result of hyperactive neurons in the temporal lobes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812450616">3</xref></sup> Known causes of phantosmia include schizophrenia, trauma, temporal lobe epilepsy, medications, and space-occupying lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812450616">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450616"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450616"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812450616">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1991, Sagar et al<sup>7</sup> surveyed 40 patients who received radiation therapy to areas encompassing the olfactory mucosa of the nasal cavity in the previous 2 years. Fifteen patients reported an odor, often described as bleach-like, that began with the first treatment and ended when radiation therapy was completed. The authors attributed the odor to the nasal mucosa’s perception of ozone formed by the radiation beams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812450616">7</xref></sup> Costello et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812450616">8</xref></sup> subsequently found the measured concentration of ozone resulting from a day of radiation therapy amounted to well below levels needed to produce a detectable odor. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these are the first cases of phantosmia occurring during focal or whole-brain radiation therapy described in the literature.</p>

<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 6-year-old boy was noted to have a new left cranial nerve VI palsy. Contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass consistent with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Physical exam at time of diagnosis was notable for left cranial nerve VI and VII palsies, drooling, and mild right-sided weakness. All other cranial nerves were intact, as were sensory and cerebellar exams. The patient was treated according to Children’s Oncology Group protocol ACNS0927, a phase 1/2 study delivering a 6-week course of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (230 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) once daily Monday through Friday combined with local irradiation of the pons (59.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fraction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812450616">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient tolerated daily suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and radiation therapy well with only intermittent nausea, which resolved with twice-daily ondansetron. At approximately day 22 of treatment, the patient reported an odor during radiation therapy. The odor was halitosis-like and did not improve with the application of a strong strawberry-scented perfume under his nose. The odor continued for a short period after completion of the radiation therapy session, causing the patient to brush his teeth several times a day in an effort to minimize the odor. The patient was awake with normal mental status and sensorium during these episodes, making seizures less likely. He experienced accompanying nausea and emesis despite regular ondansetron dosing.</p>
<p>The patient’s phantosmia made it difficult for him to comply with daily radiation therapy, which was already a challenge given his young age and the decision to forego anesthesia. After completion of radiation therapy, the phantosmia resolved completely. At last follow-up of 3 months, the patient was well with improvement of his neurological deficits and no recrudescence of phantosmia.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 15-year-old male who presented with new-onset seizures was subsequently diagnosed with gliomatosis cerebri, World Health Organization grade II/III astrocytoma involving bilateral frontal lobes and white matter tracts to the left occipital and temporal lobes. At the time of diagnosis, he only complained of occasional visual blurriness in the classroom when transferring focus from a near object to a far object. His neurological exam was completely unremarkable. Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact, as were cerebellar, sensory, and motor function. The patient’s performance status was 100%. The patient received a course of radiation therapy encompassing his extensive disease to a dose of 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions with concurrent temozolomide (90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) for 42 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812450616">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>On day 2 of radiation treatment, the patient stated that he experienced an abnormal sense of smell when the radiation beam was turned on. He described the odor initially as a combination of “water and rubbing alcohol” but later as severe halitosis. He noted this sensation occurred at least twice during each radiation therapy session, lasting 3 seconds each time, and was accompanied by a “blue light.” Immediately after radiation therapy, this odor and associated nausea, continued for a few hours and then reappeared intermittently throughout the evening and next day. The patient was awake and alert during these episodes and his neurological exam remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging performed on day 16 of treatment to investigate his phantosmia showed increased T2 signal in the left hemisphere, likely secondary to chemoradiation effects. The right olfactory nerve could not be defined in the study though the left olfactory nerve appeared normal. The paranasal sinuses appeared normal, as well. Electroencephalogram performed on day 17 of treatment revealed rare focal epileptiform discharges in the right parietal region, continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere, and diffuse intermittent slowing, suggestive of a potential epileptic area over the right parietal region and focal cerebral dysfunction over the left hemisphere. He was prescribed ondansetron 8 mg every 8 hr and dexamethasone 2 mg twice daily, which resulted in improvement of the nausea but no change in quality or frequency of the phantosmia.</p>
<p>By day 20 of treatment, the patient reported he experienced phantosmia throughout the day, which severely affected his quality of life. He began wearing a mask, brushing his teeth frequently to decrease his perceived halitosis, and avoiding social activities. Since completion of radiation therapy, his phantosmia symptoms have resolved. Follow-up electroencephalogram 34 days postcompletion of radiation therapy was unchanged though no phantosmia was noted during the recording.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the authors' knowledge, these are the first case reports of phantosmia during radiation therapy. The authors hypothesize that the 6-year-old had central phantosmia while the 15-year-old had a mix of central and peripheral phantosmia. It is interesting that the patients did not have comparable tumors or radiation fields though they both experienced phantosmia featuring a halitosis-like odor during treatment and intermittently afterwards.</p>
<p>The sense of smell begins with olfactory receptors within the nasal cavity, which pass through the cribiform plate and end in the olfactory bulb. The olfactory cortex is located at the medial aspect of the temporal lobe. As the 15-year-old had tumor involvement of the bifrontal and temporal lobes and an electroencephalogram showing global cerebral dysfunction, it is possible that his phantosmia was the result of hyperactive neurons secondary to his malignancy. His report of a “blue light” prior to the perception of an odor suggests additional elements of peripheral phantosmia as it likely represented activation of the patient’s retinal photoreceptors, which makes concurrent activation of peripheral olfactory receptors possible as well.</p>
<p>Research using functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare patients with and without phantosmia found that persistent activation of the frontal and temporal cortices correlated most closely with phantosmia and that while normal patients had left hemispheric localization of pleasant odors and right hemispheric localization of unpleasant odors, patients with phantosmia localized odors in the opposite way. Furthermore, when phantosmia patients were treated successfully, they regained normal localization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812450616">9</xref></sup> Perhaps radiation therapy stimulated all neurons in the 15-year-old during treatment, but the patient experienced greater right hemispheric activation because of left hemispheric dysfunction caused by his malignancy, thus causing phantosmia featuring an unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>In the 6-year-old who had neither disease within nor radiation to the anterior frontal or temporal lobes, it is possible his phantosmia was caused by a small amount of dose to a portion of the olfactory cortex during focal irradiation to the pons. Perhaps he also had foci of micrometastases that served as lead points for cerebral dysfunction predisposing him to phantosmia.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the phantosmia in the patients may also be attributable to either chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, as neither patient experienced phantosmia during chemotherapy alone, and the phantosmia appeared to correlate well with the start and end of radiation treatment, it seems more likely to be associated with radiotherapy. In the literature, though it has been well established that chemotherapy may cause anosmia or hyposmia, it is infrequent to see qualitative olfactory disorders such as phantosmia or paraosmia, the distorted perception of a smell when an odor stimulus is present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450616">10</xref></sup> Specifically, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no reports of phantosmia or paraosmia in patients on temozolomide or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, though there has been a report of a 63-year-old woman who reported unpleasant olfactory sensations when smelling foods shortly after a second induction course of steroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cytarabine, and imatinib mesylate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She was subsequently treated with a nose clip so that she could tolerate oral intake while completing chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450616">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Phantosmia during radiation therapy remains a rare and poorly understood phenomenon. With more awareness of the condition, the authors hope more patients will be identified, and they will eventually be able to understand and treat phantosmia during radiation therapy, thus improving patients’ quality of life during treatment.</p>
