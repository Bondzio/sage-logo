<abstract>
<p>This study explores the seemingly anomalous presentation of Ishmael in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. In a work in which an unbridgeable chasm separates Jewish and Gentile identities, the strikingly positive depiction of Abraham's natural firstborn is surprising. It is suggested that the genealogical considerations so prominent in <italic>Jubilees</italic> allow Ishmael to be treated as an unthreatening character: as son of an Egyptian mother, he cannot be mistaken for the primary covenant conduit; as brother of Isaac rather than the preeminent Jacob, his existence does not call into question the identity of the first Israelite proper. Beyond this, it is suggested that the favorable treatment of Ishmael in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is a matter of his full inclusion within the circle of covenant privilege. This is explained as a function of the laudable pedagogical instincts of Abraham, the friend of God, and, most significantly, the distinctive shape of covenant history in <italic>Jubilees</italic>.</p>

<title>I. <italic>Holy Seed, Hopeless Other: The Puzzle of Ishmael in</italic> Jubilees</title>
<p>The book of <italic>Jubilees</italic> is notorious among Second Temple sources for the attitude it displays towards Gentiles. In the postexilic reconsideration of the parameters of membership among the people of Israel, and in response to the grim reality that nation and land could be disjoined, the book offers a radical response to the question of self-identity. According to <italic>Jubilees</italic>, Israelites are a breed apart from the rest of the human race. The demonstration of the distinction behaviorally is the outworking of an ontological divide. Israel has more in common with the angels than the inhabitants of the earth. Israel alone has been called to keep sabbath along with God and the preeminent angels (<italic>Jub</italic>. 2.17–21, 30–31).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712439830">1</xref></sup> Similarly, to submit to circumcision as the sign of the covenant (15.11) is to replicate the nature of the angels of the presence and the angels of holiness (15.27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712439830">2</xref></sup> In a universe like this, Gentiles are by definition incapable of joining Israel: they have the wrong DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712439830">3</xref></sup> Israel must beware the perils of interaction with others and separate from the nations (22.16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712439830">4</xref></sup> This perspective of <italic>Jubilees</italic> is rightly understood as a turbocharged form of the ‘holy seed’ ideology of Ezra (Ezra 9.1–2), wherein the pentateuchal requirement for priestly genealogical purity is applied to ordinary Israelites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712439830">5</xref></sup> To the democratization of the genealogical demand, <italic>Jubilees</italic> adds an appropriation of pseudo-angelic status across the ranks of the people.</p>
<p>In keeping with this dichotomous worldview, the <italic>Jubilees</italic> account of the institution of circumcision for Abraham and his children (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15; cf. Gen. 17) is careful to insist on the chasm that separates Israel from the other descendants of Abraham. The circumcision command is ‘forever on all the Israelites’ (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15.29). That is, the Lord ‘did not draw near to himself either Ishmael, his sons, his brothers, or Esau’; rather, ‘he chose Israel to be his people’ (15.30). It is unexceptional to find a pointed clarification at this juncture in the narrative. For a self-definition that makes genealogical purity decisive for discerning the boundaries of Israel, no verses are more awkward than the account of the divinely mandated circumcision of the Abrahamic line that does not become Jacobean (15.11–14; 23.24). The tension is, of course, intrinsic to Genesis. The logic of the divine command that those with whom the covenant will not be maintained (Gen. 17.21) must nevertheless bear the covenantal sign—a sign so significant it can be conceived of as the covenant itself (Gen. 17.9–10)—is one of the great imponderables of the patriarchal stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712439830">6</xref></sup> For the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712439830">7</xref></sup> the potential implications are remarkably worrying and must be reined in at all costs. Circumcision as sign of election belongs to Israel alone. It must be understood that other connections to Abraham will not suffice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712439830">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The urge to clarify the boundaries of the elect people renders the hatchet-job presentation of Esau in <italic>Jubilees</italic> rather predictable. On arrival he is not only hirsute, and much less the insider than Jacob (cf. Gen. 25.24–27), he is evidently a harsh, rustic man, altogether undesirable when lined up against the smooth profile of his brother (<italic>Jub</italic>. 19.13–14). Indeed, from the outset of his involvement in the narrative, his behavior renders him manifestly unsuitable for inclusion in the chosen Abrahamic line (19.16). He will be described by none other than his mother as one ‘malicious since his youth’ and ‘devoid of virtue’, one who has subjected his parents to both abandonment and robbery (35.9–11). Most scandalous of all, he commits the heinous crime of marrying Canaanite women (<italic>Jub</italic>. 25.1, 9; cf. Gen. 36.2; Exod. 34.15; Deut. 7.3–4); no behavior marks with greater clarity the presence of decidedly unholy seed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0951820712439830">9</xref></sup> It is unremarkable when the détente between the twins is broken such that the innocent Jacob has no choice but to put an end to the sorry life of his brother (<italic>Jub</italic>. 38.1; cf. 37.13, 19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0951820712439830">10</xref></sup> Esau always had it coming (cf. 26.33–34); such is the lot of one meant for destruction (15.26, 30).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0951820712439830">11</xref></sup> His status as a son of Abraham deconstructs on account of its non-Israelite hue. He is a Gentile.</p>
<p>The presentation of Esau rubber-stamps the conclusion that, according to <italic>Jubilees</italic>, the predicament of all Gentiles is hopeless. If we turn to the case of Ishmael, however, we encounter a surprise. Outside the polemic surrounding the institution of circumcision in ch. 15, the treatment of Ishmael is not generally unsympathetic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0951820712439830">12</xref></sup> Quite the contrary, at various points the rewriting of Scripture in <italic>Jubilees</italic> privileges Ishmael in a manner that is foreign to Genesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0951820712439830">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking difference between Ishmael and Esau in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is the absence of a description of the character of the former. More specifically, the colorful account of Gen. 16.12 is missing. On the one hand, <italic>Jubilees</italic> simply reflects and by means of the omission exaggerates the hollow portrayal of Abraham's firstborn in Genesis. Though the arrival and experience of Ishmael plays a vital role in the course of the scriptural story, he is less than a fully formed character, largely passive and silent throughout the narrative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0951820712439830">14</xref></sup> Further, the absence of Gen. 16.12 in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is tied to a larger concern: the vindication of the matriarchs of Israel in comparison with the other wives of the patriarchs, with regard to both genealogical credentials and the depth of the matrimonial relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0951820712439830">15</xref></sup> The profile and, ultimately, privilege of Hagar in Genesis 16 are domesticated in <italic>Jubilees;</italic> the narrative context for Gen. 16.12, not least in the form of angelic proclamation, largely disappears (<italic>Jub</italic>. 14.21–24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0951820712439830">16</xref></sup> On the other hand, the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic> is quite able to color the portrait of any participant in the scriptural account in accord with the overall bent of the retelling, as we have seen in the scarlet portrayal of Esau.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0951820712439830">17</xref></sup> The omission of Gen. 16.12 in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is clearly avoidable. Moreover, Gen. 16.12 functions programmatically over the course of Ishmael's life in the book (cf. Gen. 25.18). The Ishmael who is introduced to the story is announced as a wilderness dweller, inevitably distinct from and perhaps at odds with others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0951820712439830">18</xref></sup> The nonexistence of the announcement in <italic>Jubilees</italic> removes one of the poles around which Ishmael's status as other is established.</p>
<p>After circumcision, the next major event in Ishmael's life in Genesis is the episode that triggers his expulsion from Abraham's household along with his mother (Gen. 21) at the time of the weaning of Isaac. The corresponding passage in <italic>Jubilees</italic> simultaneously foregrounds Ishmael in the account, accents his significance and preciousness in the eyes of his father, and resolves much of the ambiguity surrounding the interaction between Ishmael and Isaac that brings out the harridan in Sarah. In <italic>Jub</italic>. 17.2, Ishmael is not simply part of the scenery on a day that belongs to Isaac. ‘The son of Hagar the Egyptian’ is found ‘in his place in front of his father Abraham’. Indeed, Abraham, for his part, is overjoyed and blesses the Lord on account of the vision of his sons. The sight of Isaac <italic>and Ishmael</italic> before him is the leading edge of the fulfillment of what the Lord has promised (17.3; cf. 13.17–21). Correspondingly, the straw that breaks the matriarch's back is no longer merely the cryptic ‘Isaacing’ of Ishmael (Gen. 21.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0951820712439830">19</xref></sup> Sarah's jealousy is a product of the tight connection she perceives between the playing and dancing of Ishmael and the extreme happiness of her husband (<italic>Jub</italic>. 17.4). As in Genesis, Abraham is displeased by the demand that Hagar and Ishmael be cast out (<italic>Jub</italic>. 17.5). The preceding material in <italic>Jubilees</italic>, furthermore, renders the Lord's endorsement of Sarah's petition and reminder to Abraham of the priority of Isaac over Ishmael all the more poignant (<italic>Jub</italic>. 17.6–7). While the message to Abraham in Gen. 21.12–13 simply rearticulates the perspective of Gen. 17.19–20, <italic>Jub</italic>. 17.6 constitutes a more insistent admonition to the patriarch who, much more explicitly, still considers Ishmael an heir to all aspects of the covenantal promises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0951820712439830">20</xref></sup> Abraham's confusion with regard to Ishmael contrasts sharply with the clarity of thought he displays in his subsequent assessment of Esau (<italic>Jub</italic>. 19.16). From a covenantal perspective, Abraham's opinion of Ishmael is too high.</p>
<p>The account of Abraham's charge to his children in <italic>Jubilees</italic> 20 serves up the most remarkable example of the upwardly mobile profile of Ishmael on occasion in <italic>Jubilees</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0951820712439830">21</xref></sup> In a substantial address not found in Genesis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0951820712439830">22</xref></sup> the aged patriarch lectures all his descendants together, with ‘Ishmael and his twelve children’ at the head of the pack (20.1)—ahead not only of the children of Keturah and their sons, but also ‘Isaac and his two children’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0951820712439830">23</xref></sup> All must adhere to the Lord's ways, ‘doing what is just and right on the earth’ (20.2). They should avoid sexual impurity, heeding the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (20.6), and choose to worship the most high God who is able to render those who shun idolatry famously prosperous on the earth (20.7–10).</p>
<p>There is good precedent in <italic>Jubilees</italic> for the comprehensive scope of those beholden to the injunctions of the departing hero. In Noah's testament (7.20–39), his sons and grandsons are in view as he describes the pattern of behavior required of those who would avoid judgment (7.32, 34).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0951820712439830">24</xref></sup> Indeed, there are numerous parallels in the focus of the Noahic and Abrahamic testaments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0951820712439830">25</xref></sup> Those addressed must do what is right and love one another (7.20; cf. 20.2), and, in the wake of the disastrous activities of the Watchers, avoid sexual impurity and uncleanness (7.21; cf. 20.5). Nevertheless, the consequences of the approach to intergenerational instruction shared by Noah and Abraham provide the most startling aspect of <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.1–10. Just as Noah is concerned to lay down for his offspring ‘every statute which he knew’ (7.20), so Abraham appears not to distinguish between his sons in the promulgation of the full range of obligations of which he is aware. Since Abraham, unlike Noah, is one to whom <italic>the</italic> great sign of God's covenant with his people has been made known, <italic>all</italic> his offspring are called to ‘circumcise their sons <italic>in the covenant</italic> which he [the Lord] had made with <italic>them’</italic> (20.3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0951820712439830">26</xref></sup> The resolution of the tension inherent in the circumcised status of the unselected Ishmael alongside the chosen offspring provided by <italic>Jub</italic>. 15.28–32 (cf. 15.19), recalled in the remedial instruction of 17.6–7, is apparently undermined. All Abraham's sons must walk in ‘all the ways which the Lord commanded us’, and ‘hold fast to all his commandments’ (20.2, 7). All, according to Abraham, have the opportunity to cement their covenant relationship with the Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0951820712439830">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The inclusive perspective of Abraham is confirmed in two further ways. First, the blessing on offer for Abraham's offspring in <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.9–10 surpasses the benefits promised, or, perhaps, conceded, to Ishmael in Genesis (17.20; 21.13; cf. <italic>Jub</italic>. 15.20; 17.7). While the Ishmael of Genesis can expect to head up a great nation on account of being Abraham's seed, the Ishmael of <italic>Jubilees</italic>, along with the sons of Keturah, partakes of the internationally significant blessing otherwise reserved for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (cf. Gen. 12.3; 26.4; 28.14; <italic>Jub</italic>. 12.23; 24.11; 27.23), such that ‘all the nations of the earth will be delighted with [them]’ and will prompt further good by blessing their sons (<italic>Jub</italic>. 20.10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0951820712439830">28</xref></sup> In this instance, not one of Abraham's offspring is an outsider to any of the covenant benefits. Second, the fiery death penalty awaiting any woman among the people who is guilty of sexual impurity in <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.4 is a prime example of the application of scriptural law intended for priests to the people in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0951820712439830">29</xref></sup> It has, in fact, been widely understood as a prooftext for holy seed ideology in <italic>Jubilees</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0951820712439830">30</xref></sup> Yet the immediate context of the instruction in <italic>Jubilees</italic> has invariably been ignored: somehow, the consequences of the democratization of the priesthood bear on <italic>all</italic> the children of Abraham. In fact, the nature of the punishment described in <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.4 serves to highlight that which is presupposed throughout Abraham's testament in the multiple injunctions to avoid sexual impurity. Exogamy is a morally defiling sin for those whose seed is special;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0951820712439830">31</xref></sup> here Ishmael and the sons of Keturah are addressed as part of the people of Israel.</p>
<p>Following his dismissal, gifts in hand, from the presence of his brother Isaac, Ishmael departs with Keturah's sons and settles in the east.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0951820712439830">32</xref></sup> In Genesis, all that remains for Ishmael is to return for the burial of his father, following which his own genealogy and death are recounted (Gen. 25.12–18). In <italic>Jubilees</italic>, however, another episode intervenes (cf. <italic>Jub</italic>. 23.7): in <italic>Jub</italic>. 22.1–9, Abraham celebrates the festival of weeks along with ‘his two sons’ (v. 1), Isaac and Ishmael.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0951820712439830">33</xref></sup> No occasion could be more fitting to mark the close of Abraham's life (22.1; 23.1) and the passing of the covenant to Jacob (22.10–24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0951820712439830">34</xref></sup> In <italic>Jubilees</italic>, the festival of weeks is the time for the making and renewing of the covenant (6.15–22).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0951820712439830">35</xref></sup> Along with the laws pertaining to sabbath and circumcision, it sits at the center of the nexus of institutions that most fundamentally defines Israel as the Lord's distinctive people. Adherence to this triad of obligations signals Israel's otherworldly status: these markers of identity are shared with the angels of the presence and the angels of holiness (2.30; 6.17–18; 15.27). Ishmael's arrival on the scene reintroduces him to the heartbeat of covenant life (22.3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0951820712439830">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The return of Ishmael to celebrate the festival brings happiness to his father (22.1), recalling Abraham's joy at the sight of his two sons together on the occasion of Isaac's weaning (17.3). As in the earlier episode, the pecking order in which Isaac and Ishmael stand is, ultimately, not in doubt. Isaac prepares burnt and peace offerings ‘in front of his brother Ishmael’ (22.4). Furthermore, both will be overshadowed subsequently by Jacob's role in the developing scene (22.10–23.3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0951820712439830">37</xref></sup> Once more, nevertheless, Abraham exhibits an inclusive approach where his biological sons are concerned. His closing plea to God before summoning Jacob is for the descendants of his <italic>sons</italic>, ‘that they, of all the nations of the earth, may become your chosen people and heritage from now until all the time of the earth's history throughout all ages’ (22.9). At the end of his life Abraham retains a significant strand to his thinking that balks at the prospect of drawing an exclusionary line between the sons of Sarah and Hagar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0951820712439830">38</xref></sup> For all the relative distinctions he is willing to make, Abraham cannot shake the conviction that Isaac and Ishmael belong to the same group.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to conclude on the basis of these passages that the Ishmael of <italic>Jubilees</italic> is Isaac's equal. Following the lead of Genesis, Isaac retains his status as the one chosen among Abraham's sons. This is clear from both the explicit pronouncements to this effect (e.g. <italic>Jub</italic>. 15.21), and the various ways in which Isaac is privileged in a manner unknown to Ishmael (e.g. the priestly charge addressed to Isaac alone in 21.1–26, in spite of his membership of the group addressed in the previous chapter). Neither does <italic>Jubilees</italic> manifest an interest in what might be called specifically Ishmaelite concerns: Ishmael shares the spotlight in <italic>Jubilees</italic> 20 with all his brothers, while the full genealogy of Ishmael found in Gen. 25.12–17 is absent in <italic>Jubilees</italic> (cf. <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.12–13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0951820712439830">39</xref></sup> Moreover, the booming voice of <italic>Jubilees</italic> 15 is inescapable: in what is the most explicit pronouncement on the orientation of the various Abrahamic characters in the story, Ishmael lines up with those whom the Lord did not choose (15.30).</p>
<p>The puzzle of Ishmael's treatment in <italic>Jubilees</italic> remains, nonetheless. It is precisely the forcefulness of the polemic against the non-Jacobean descendants of Abraham found in <italic>Jubilees</italic> 15 that renders the portrayal of Ishmael elsewhere in the book so enigmatic. Abraham's delight in and promotion of the status of his firstborn son is greater in <italic>Jubilees</italic> than in Genesis. The standing of Ishmael as sometime covenant insider is bolstered in <italic>Jubilees</italic> by extended passages not found in Genesis. In a work that apparently affords no hope to those born outside the chosen Israelite line, and illustrates the conviction so graphically in the depiction of Esau, this is a peculiarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0951820712439830">40</xref></sup> While the Lord did not draw near to himself either Ishmael or Esau (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15.30), the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic>, on behalf of Abraham, gives Ishmael a moderate push in the divine direction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0951820712439830">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>II. <italic>Abraham, Ishmael and Jacob:</italic> <italic>The Shape of Covenant Obedience in</italic> Jubilees</title>
<p><italic>Jubilees</italic> is not alone among ancient Jewish texts in portraying Ishmael in relatively positive, or at least impartial, terms. The trajectory is set in Genesis. Abraham's concern for his firstborn notwithstanding (Gen. 17.18; 21.11), Ishmael does not get caught up in an extended rivalry with his brother in the manner of Jacob and Esau. Whatever the sense of Gen. 16.12, it does not prove to be a foretelling of a life of settled conflict between Ishmael and the proto-Israelite people. Though Ishmael is unequivocally not-Isaac, he offers no resistance to the divinely ordered scheme. The text points up the experience of the Israelites: the peoples associated with Ishmael rarely appear as enemies of Israel in Scripture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0951820712439830">42</xref></sup> Correspondingly, Ishmael does not serve a consistently negative purpose as he appears in tannaitic and amoraic midrashim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0951820712439830">43</xref></sup> Before he becomes a cipher for Islam, Ishmael can be used by the rabbis in multiple ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0951820712439830">44</xref></sup> While sometimes seen as an idol worshiper,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0951820712439830">45</xref></sup> he can also be listed among the righteous in distinction from the wicked: ‘Four were named before they were born. They are: Isaac, Ishmael, Josiah and Solomon… This is the case regarding the righteous people. But regarding the wicked, “The Wicked are strangers from the womb” (Ps. 58.4)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0951820712439830">46</xref></sup> The tenor of the portrayal of Ishmael in <italic>Jubilees</italic> coheres with a larger exegetical tradition.</p>
<p>Ishmael's unthreatening status is reinforced when he is assessed by the genealogical standards so fundamental to the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic>. As Genesis makes clear (16.1), Ishmael's mother is an Egyptian. That is, she comes from the line of Ham (Gen. 10.6). While there is some uncertainty in Genesis as to exactly who is cursed as a result of the ogling of Noah (9.24–25), <italic>Jubilees</italic> is unambiguous. The line of Canaan is thoroughly damned; the other sons of Ham, including Mizraim, are not (<italic>Jub</italic>. 7.10, 13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0951820712439830">47</xref></sup> Ishmael, then, quite naturally qualifies for a position that is simultaneously privileged, safe, yet secondary. As son of the patriarch, he finds himself stationed on blessed terrain. As son of an Egyptian, he is uncredentialed to become the chief covenant conduit since his mother comes from outside the family line (<italic>Jub</italic>. 14.22), while the fact that she is not a Canaanite renders him nontoxic as a subsidiary character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0951820712439830">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The genealogical perspective goes some way to explaining the difference in treatment between Ishmael and Esau in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. The book's heightened concern with ancestry bears on the assessment of Ishmael from the moment of his introduction to the story (14.24). He does not possess the genetic equipment to function as a genuine rival to Sarah's son (15.21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0951820712439830">49</xref></sup> No additional criterion is required to discriminate between Ishmael and Isaac. Esau, in contrast, is as biologically blessed as his brother.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0951820712439830">50</xref></sup> Since the choice of Jacob over Esau cannot be justified on a priori grounds, another means of distinction is required. The exaggeration of Esau's behavioral inadequacies (19.16) is a function of the need to disqualify a candidate for covenantal priority whose lineage does not keep him out of the running. He becomes a noxious presence whose influence must be resisted for the survival of the chosen line (25.8; 38.3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0951820712439830">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>An additional aspect of <italic>Jubilees</italic> with implications for the presentation of Ishmael is the priority of Jacob in the covenant arrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0951820712439830">52</xref></sup> According to <italic>Jubilees</italic>, Jacob is the preeminent forefather of the nation, the privilege afforded Isaac and even Abraham notwithstanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0951820712439830">53</xref></sup> Jacob is the figure to whom the Lord's prior dealings with his favored ones point (19.25), whose significance is impressed on the structure of history (2.23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0951820712439830">54</xref></sup> He is, quite simply, the beginning of Israel. Abraham's fulsome evaluation of the importance of his newly arrived grandson— an assessment that the narrative order of Genesis will not permit— proclaims Jacob as the true object of the Lord's promises of blessing. Not only is the person, indeed the generation, of Isaac marginalized by the facilitation of direct covenant succession between Abraham and Jacob, Abraham himself is rendered preparatory for the advent of one whose descendants <italic>all</italic> belong to God (16.18).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0951820712439830">55</xref></sup> Jacob will occupy Abraham's place on the earth since the Lord will choose him as his own special people (19.18). Abraham loves this grandson more than any of his offspring because ‘he will be blessed forever and his descendants will fill the entire earth’ (19.21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0951820712439830">56</xref></sup> The Lord will adopt Jacob as his firstborn (<italic>Jub</italic>. 19.29; cf. Exod. 4.22); Jacob's biological father is not so shrewd (<italic>Jub</italic>. 19.15, 30).</p>
<p>The contrast between the treatment of Isaac and Jacob in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is particularly stark. As Isaac leapfrogs over Ishmael in the divinely ordered scheme (17.6), so Jacob comprehensively outstrips his father, even before he is born. The puzzling dischronologization of the narrative in <italic>Jub</italic>. 16.15–19 functions to shift attention away from the newborn Isaac. No sooner has Isaac been circumcised than there is a flashback to an angelic encounter with Abraham and the pregnant Sarah. The functionally <italic>post eventum</italic> prophecy acknowledges Isaac's precedence among his brothers but immediately relativizes his ultimate significance. Reputation and descendants will come through Isaac, but one of his sons will be ‘a holy progeny’, the head of a ‘kingdom, a priesthood, and a holy people’ (16.18). Later on, pride of place with the dying Abraham belongs to Jacob, not Isaac (23.1–2). Abraham's climactic words are addressed to his grandson (22.10–26); even Isaac's tribute to his own father must be mediated through Jacob (22.5). While Isaac is still alive, Jacob receives his father's legacy; now he is Abraham's son (22.23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0951820712439830">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>The contraction of the patriarchal territory occupied by Jacob's natural father drains Ishmael's status as not-Isaac of some of its sting. While Ishmael is not the primary child of his peer group, <italic>the</italic> covenant child belongs to the next generation. The dawn of full covenant blessing is ultimately a post-Ishmael affair (<italic>Jub</italic>. 22.10). The full implications of the distinction between Israel and the nations emerge in the charge to the foundational Israelite (22.16). As Jacob's star ascends, the impulse to emphasize the status of Ishmael in distinction from Isaac is muted.</p>
<p>The tendency we have observed in <italic>Jubilees</italic> to treat Ishmael in a surprisingly positive way can, however, be defined more precisely. All the relevant passages we have considered share a common denominator: the desire of Ishmael's father, Abraham, that all his sons enjoy the status and lifestyle of full covenant insiders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0951820712439830">58</xref></sup> This is inherent in <italic>Jub</italic>. 17.2–3, and explicit in 20.1–10 and 22.1–9. As we have seen, Abraham displays a related instinct in Genesis (17.18; 21.11), but the impulse is much more developed and insistent in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. This does not translate into a rejection of Isaac's special status; the Abraham of <italic>Jubilees</italic> continues to privilege Isaac among his biological sons (20.11; 21.1–26). Instead, Abraham holds these somewhat incongruous convictions together. The paternal balancing act can be seen in the juxtaposition of chs. 20 and 21.</p>
<p>It is extremely unlikely that the breadth of Abraham's intentions is highlighted as a cause for criticism in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. In a book that goes to such lengths to exonerate his character, it is inconceivable that such emphasis should fall on an intuition that is deemed at least irresponsible, and of which Abraham is unrepentant at the end of his days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0951820712439830">59</xref></sup> This is Abraham the precocious monotheist (11.16), whose fulfillment of familial obligation is beyond reproach (12.28–31), who avoids double-talk in Egypt (13.10–15), and whose obedience is a matter of debate for Prince Mastema only (17.16–17). The Abraham of <italic>Jubilees</italic> is faithful and patient in spirit, perfect before the Lord whom he loves (17.18).</p>
<p>It is in Abraham's irreproachable conduct that a clue concerning his covenantally inclusive convictions is to be found. Abraham is described in <italic>Jubilees</italic>, along with Levi, as one ‘recorded on the heavenly tablets as the friend of the Lord’ (19.9; cf. 30.20). The qualification for divine friendship is spelled out in response to Levi's laudable actions. Israelites who do not ‘sin or transgress the statutes or violate the covenant which was established for them so that they should perform it [will] be recorded as friends’ (30.21). Those who transgress the covenant will be ‘recorded on the heavenly tablets as enemies’ (30.22). Abraham is the Lord's friend in <italic>Jubilees</italic> because he maintains his covenantal responsibilities. <italic>Jubilees</italic> 30.20–22 bears the imprint of Deut. 7.9–10 as it appropriates for Levi the covenantal reward granted Phinehas for his decisive action in removing a Midianite woman from the Israelite community (Num. 25.6–13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0951820712439830">60</xref></sup> Levi the friend of God is by definition one who loves him and keeps his commandments (זחזצמﬞךמשלז זﬞבהאל, Deut. 7.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0951820712439830">61</xref></sup> The same is true of Abraham; he is faithful and loves the Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0951820712439830">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>A distinguishing mark of one who loves the Lord is a suitable attitude towards the generations that follow. Within the covenant between the Lord and his people nothing is of greater importance than handing down the divinely given laws and commandments. Most famously, the Shema of Deut. 6.4–9, the command to ‘love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might’ (תבהאזךראמֿלככז ךשפנֿלככז ךככלֿלככ ךﬞהלא לזלﬞ תא), encapsulates the body of instruction that Israelites must impress upon their children (ךﬞנכל םתננשז, Deut. 6.7; cf. Deut. 5.29; 6.2, 20). The same connection is observed in the <italic>Damascus Document</italic> III, 2–4:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Abraham did not walk in it, and was counted as a friend (ויעל אוהב) for keeping God's precepts (בשמרו מצות אל) and not following the desire of his spirit. And he passed (them) on to Isaac and to Jacob (וליעקב וימםור לישחק), and they kept (them) and were written up as friends of God (ויכתבו אוהבים לאל) and as members of the covenant for ever (ברית לעולם ובעלי).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0951820712439830">63</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A similar perspective is found in <italic>Targum Neofiti</italic> on Gen. 18.17–19:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>And the Lord said through his Memra: ‘Am I to hide from my friend (רחמי) Abraham what I am going to do? Since the city of Sodom is among the gifts I have given him, it is right that I should not overthrow it until I inform him. And Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation and in his merits all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. Because it is manifest before me that he will charge his sons and the men of his house after him (יפקד ית בנוי ךית אנשי בײחיה בחרה) that they observe the way of the Lord by doing justice and right (ודינא ױטדון אורחא דייי למעבד צדקתה) so that the Memra of the Lord may bring upon Abraham what he spoke with him.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0951820712439830">64</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These passages throw up an interesting question: To whom was Abraham, friend of God, obligated to offer instruction? The <italic>Damascus Document</italic> focuses on the chosen line of Isaac and Jacob, while <italic>Targum Neofiti</italic> suggests he taught all the members of his household. Genesis 18.19 as found in the Masoretic text closely matches the Targum:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity (יצוה את‾בניו ואת‾ביתו אתריו) to keep the way of the L<sc>ord</sc> by doing what is just and right (ושמרו דדך יהוה לעשות צדקה ומשפט), in order that the L<sc>ord</sc> may bring about for Abraham what He has promised him (למען הביא יהוה על‾אברהם את אשר‾דבר עליו). (<sc>jps</sc>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A strong resemblance also exists, moreover, between Gen. 18.19 and <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.1–10:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) During the forty-second jubilee, in the first year of the seventh week, Abraham summoned Ishmael and his twelve children, Isaac and his two children, and the six children of Keturah and their sons. (2) He ordered them to keep the way of the Lord so that they would do what is right and that they should love one another; that they should be like this in every war so that they could go against each one (who was) against them; and do what is just and right on the earth… (10) You will become a blessing on the earth, and all the nations of the earth will be delighted with you. They will bless your sons in my name so that they may be blessed as I am.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It would appear that Abraham's testament in <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.1–10 is framed as a midrashic exegesis of Gen. 18.18–19.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0951820712439830">65</xref></sup> Between the bookends of vv. 2 and 10, the patriarch becomes a mouthpiece for the author's most distinctive concerns. Above all, he warns his offspring to avoid sexual impurity and reminds them of the deadly consequences of failing to listen (vv. 3–6). Such is the context-appropriate behavior of a father who is a friend of the Lord. The stimulus to address the instruction towards <italic>all</italic> his children is found in Genesis. According to Gen. 18.18–19, the sweeping focus is apt in the case of one for whom the Lord has such globally significant plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0951820712439830">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, Abraham's unabashed concern for the obedience of all his offspring sounds a note that jars with the genealogically exclusive perspective of <italic>Jubilees</italic>. Could not the patriarch instruct all his children in some behavioral matters while preserving the orbit of full covenantal compliance and reward for the chosen line only (cf. CD III, 2–4)? At this point, a consideration of the shape of covenant history as propounded in the book is enlightening. In <italic>Jubilees</italic>, the inauguration of the covenant is front-loaded on multiple levels. The author not only concludes his reworking of Genesis 1-Exodus 19 with instruction in a Sinaitic setting, the prologue frames the entirety of the book as revelation given to Moses on Sinai. The covenant with Israel at Sinai, in other words, provides the lens through which the pre-Sinaitic world should be viewed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0951820712439830">67</xref></sup> This is not simply a matter of rereading history in light of subsequent revelation. As the appearance of Jacob in the world is tied to the creational order of sabbath (<italic>Jub</italic>. 2.19–25), so the fabric of the universe itself testifies to God's election of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0951820712439830">68</xref></sup> One eternal covenant binds the Lord to his chosen people. The individual covenants with Noah, Abraham and Israel are simply iterations of the same singular state of affairs. The first presentation of the covenant is to Noah (6.1–14); the festival of weeks is revealed as the celebration and renewal of the eternal pact (6.15–22).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0951820712439830">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>A consequence of the unicovenantal scheme in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is that long before the arrival of Jacob, the holy progeny who fathers only people holy to the Lord, the stipulations incumbent on humanity, selected and unselected lines alike, are those of the eternal covenant. There is no separate or distinguishable class of generic instruction available to those born outside the chosen line. All directions are essentially Sinaitic; Israel is a people of Noahides (14.20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0951820712439830">70</xref></sup> Those to whom the laws are revealed are those especially favored by the Lord (5.19; 12.22). Yet before the legacy of such figures is comprised of thoroughbred individuals only, the potential circle of influence of covenantal revelation is not restricted to a singular chosen line. The same dynamic is evident in the testaments attributed to Noah and Isaac:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>(7.20) Noah began to prescribe for his grandsons the ordinances and the commandments—every statute which he knew. He testified to his sons that they should do what is right, cover the shame of their bodies, bless the one who had created them, honor father and mother, love one another, and keep themselves from fornication, uncleanness, and from all injustice… (34) Now listen, my children. Do what is just and right so that you may be rightly planted on the surface of the entire earth. Then your honor will be raised before my God who saved me from the flood waters.</p>
<p>(36.3–4) This is what I am ordering you, my sons: that you do what is right and just on the earth so that the Lord may bring on you everything which the Lord said that he would do for Abraham and his descendants. Practice brotherly love among yourselves, my sons, like a man who loves himself, with each one aiming at doing what is good for his brother and at doing things together on the earth. May they love one another as themselves… (6) My sons, remember the Lord, the God of your father Abraham (afterwards I, too, worshiped and served him properly and sincerely) so that he may make you numerous and increase your descendants in number like the stars of the sky and plant you in the earth as a righteous plant which will not be uprooted throughout all the history of eternity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Noah prescribes for his offspring all the commandments he knows, that is, all the behavioral entailments of the covenant (<italic>Jub</italic>. 6.5–38). This is in spite of the fact he is already aware that two out of three sons have chosen a course at odds with their ongoing participation in covenant life (7.26; cf. 7.13, 15–16). Likewise, Esau is addressed as one to whom the Lord might bring all the good promised to Abraham, though the course of the narrative makes clear such hopes are in vain given his unalterable bias towards wrong. The laws of the eternal covenant have the people of the pact in view. Before the arrival of the people proper, however, they are addressed to a broader constituency. The mismatch is related, of course, to the question of pre-Sinaitic behavior in all versions of the pentateuchal material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0951820712439830">71</xref></sup> By retrojecting the revelation of the <italic>one</italic> covenant to a time long before the arrival of Israel, <italic>Jubilees</italic> provides a Sinaitic framework for the actions of the pre-Israelite heroes that simultaneously impinges on the also-rans of the primordial and patriarchal histories.</p>

<title>III. <italic>Squaring the Circle: Inside Out or Outside In?</italic></title>
<p>Unlike Ham, Japheth and Esau, in <italic>Jubilees</italic> Ishmael does not behave in a way that amounts to a rejection of the sphere of covenant privilege. He neither chooses to leave his father nor gives unambiguous evidence of a morally inadequate character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0951820712439830">72</xref></sup> His conduct does not disqualify him from being understood as a blessed, circumcised Abrahamite. Indeed, it would seem to be his God-given privilege to enjoy this status. As a result, a significant question arises: Does Ishmael constitute an exception to the dichotomous worldview of <italic>Jubilees</italic>, an acceptable non-Israelite not destined for destruction?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0951820712439830">73</xref></sup> It is easy to make the case for a negative response. Ishmael's profile in <italic>Jubilees</italic> notwithstanding, his destiny is in his genes. As one excluded from Israel (15.30) he cannot offer persistent resistance to the misleading influence of the divinely ordained spirits (15.31). Though the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic> does not consider it necessary or prudent to spell out the point explicitly, Ishmael cannot ultimately escape his non-Israelite heritage. Whereas a rightly behaved Ishmael retains a welcome in the covenant community (cf. 22.1–9), it is assumed he will show his true colors in time; this Gentile cannot change his spots (16.17). The command to separate from Gentiles is based on the need to avoid imitation of their works (22.16);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0951820712439830">74</xref></sup> such works inevitably follow, and have no place within the community of Israel (cf. 30.8–9).</p>
<p>It is possible, nevertheless, to respond in a different way. That is, the profile of Ishmael in <italic>Jubilees</italic> is that of a circumcised non-Israelite whose behavior is such that his proximity to the chosen people, indeed his place within the covenant community, is both facilitated and maintained. He can never become a Jew; conversion is a contradiction in genealogical terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0951820712439830">75</xref></sup> Yet this does not mean he cannot inhabit the territory of the covenant people and share enjoyment of the same blessing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0951820712439830">76</xref></sup> On the one hand, he ought to mess up (15.31); only Israelites receive the protection needed to avoid disaster (15.32). On the other hand, he stands as a prime example of one who finds a place among the covenant people by moderating the nature of his claims. In the postexilic period in which the phenomenon of Gentile conversion to Judaism was inescapable, Ishmael offers an incarnation in the narrative of <italic>Jubilees</italic> of a privileged, obedient Gentile who can never truly convert. Such a concession may appear to grate with the overarching sensibilities of the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic>. It should be understood, however, as more than a function of situational pressures. It is difficult to fillet the founding stories of Israel of all positive gestures towards non-Israelite peoples. In <italic>Jubilees</italic>, as in Genesis, Abraham's whole household reflects some of his privilege (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15.23–25; cf. Gen. 17.23–27). Even the blessing of the sabbath, which is linked exclusively with Israel (<italic>Jub</italic>. 2.20), is somehow shared with the foreigner among the people (<italic>Jub</italic>. 50.7; cf. Exod. 20.9–10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0951820712439830">77</xref></sup> It may be that even in <italic>Jubilees</italic>, the uncomfortably broad horizon of biblical particularism cannot be entirely ignored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0951820712439830">78</xref></sup></p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0951820712439830"><label>8.</label><p>In a recent study, Michael Segal has argued that the rewriting of the base text in <italic>Jub</italic>. 15.23–24 represents a further attempt to resolve the ambiguity surrounding the circumcised Ishmael's identity (‘The Commandment of Circumcision and the Election of Israel’, Chapter 11 in <italic>The Book of Jubilees: Rewritten Bible, Redaction, Ideology, and Theology</italic> [JSJSup, 117; Leiden: Brill, 2007], pp. 229–45). <italic>Jubilees</italic> 15.25–27 showcases the author's dualistic theological-cosmological scheme as it divides all between ‘the people of the pact which the Lord made with Abraham’ and ‘the people (meant for) destruction’ (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15.26). The presenting criterion for the former party is not, however, mere circumcision. For the cutting of the foreskin to count, it must be performed by the eighth day (cf. Gen. 17.12 <sc>lxx</sc>). The novelty of the requirement prohibits its fulfillment at the appointed time on the part of the first wave of the circumcised. Nevertheless, a willingness to submit to the knife immediately is the appropriate response of those aged nine days and up. Here, though, for Segal, a subtle but telling move is made in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. In Genesis, Ishmael is circumcised ‘on that very day’, along with his father and the rest of the house (Gen. 17.23–27). In <italic>Jubilees</italic>, when Ishmael's circumcision is referenced it is not described as an immediate affair (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15.23). When the procedures occurring ‘on the same day’ are announced, Ishmael's name has disappeared from the list (<italic>Jub</italic>. 15.24).

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn41-0951820712439830"><label>41.</label><p>In response to these observations, Michael Segal's literary-critical explanation for the heterogeneous nature of <italic>Jubilees</italic> is decidedly appealing. According to Segal, we should not be surprised by the many tensions internal to <italic>Jubilees</italic>. While the 21 individual halakic sections and the book's distinctive chronological scheme were composed by the author, or compiler, of <italic>Jubilees</italic>, the rewritten narratives were carried over from earlier reworkings of the scriptural passages. The ideas intrinsic to the traditional material inevitably stand in some tension with the perspective of the redactor. If we apply Segal's theory to the case of Ishmael, initially the results are illuminating. <italic>Jubilees</italic> 15.25–34, the legal expansion on circumcision, is, as we have seen, thoroughly exclusionary in its perspective on Ishmael. <italic>Jubilees</italic> 17, 20 and 22 are, conversely, largely the work of an earlier hand. The tension caused by their flirtation with an inclusive approach to Ishmael is a symptom of the variegated literary development of the book.</p>
<p>The explanation has significant problems, however. According to <italic>Jub</italic>. 15.30, the status of Abraham's non-Israelite descendants is a primary concern of the author of this material, an outworking of the dialectical worldview that informs the polemic on intermarriage in <italic>Jub</italic>. 30. In this light, the author's willingness to fold the accounts of <italic>Jub</italic>. 20.1–10 and 22.1–9 in their current form into <italic>Jubilees</italic> is puzzling. Furthermore, the contents of the aforementioned accounts reflect clearly the distinctive perspective of the author of the legal passages. <italic>Jubilees</italic> 20.1–10 is especially concerned to warn against sexual impurity in the form of marriage to Canaanite women (cf. <italic>Jub</italic>. 30; on intermarriage as <italic>zenut</italic> [<italic>Jub</italic>. 30.8; cf. Gen. 34.31] in and of itself, irrespective of the further condemnable deeds to which the arrangement leads, see Hayes, <italic>Gentile Impurities</italic>, p. 76). The setting of <italic>Jub</italic>. 22.1–9 is none other than the festival of weeks, that is, the occasion of covenant renewal that forms one of the most characteristic elements of the retelling of Scripture in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. It is improbable that the dissonance generated by the treatment of Ishmael in these passages, on the one hand, and the circumcision halakah, on the other, is wholly attributable to a difference in sources. The interests of the same authorial-editorial agent are too readily apparent in each.</p>
<p>For a summary of Segal's hypothesis, see <italic>The Book of Jubilees</italic>, pp. 21–35. A list of the legal passages is provided on p. 24. A documentable example of the reliance of <italic>Jubilees</italic> on other traditions is the case of <italic>Aramaic Levi</italic> (or the tradition behind it), the influence of which can be discerned <italic>in Jub</italic>. 21.7–20 and, in particular, 30.1–32.9; see VanderKam, <italic>Jubilees</italic> (2001), p. 138.</p></fn>

<p>The lack of discomfort displayed in <italic>Jubilees</italic> in maintaining Ishmael's company among his more favored relatives suggests he is not considered intrinsically morally impure. As several studies dealing with the question of impurity have shown, the presenting concerns in <italic>Jubilees</italic> are generally moral rather than ritual. See Klawans, <italic>Impurity and Sin</italic>, pp. 46–48; Hayes, <italic>Gentile Impurities</italic>, pp. 73–83; Liora Ravid, ‘Purity and Impurity in the Book of Jubilees’, <italic>JSP</italic> 13 (2002), pp. 61–86. In engagement with Ravid's work, James C. VanderKam has drawn attention to the need to relate the relative absence of ritual concerns to the focus in <italic>Jubilees</italic> on the pre-temple period (‘Viewed from Another Angle: Purity and Impurity in the Book of Jubilees’, <italic>JSP</italic> 13 [2002], pp. 209–15). If we assume that the author of <italic>Jub</italic>. 15.30—through the lens of which Ishmael is surely viewed as a Gentile (cf. Himmelfarb, <italic>Kingdom of Priests</italic>, pp. 78–79)—also signed off on <italic>Jub</italic>. 22, it is difficult to agree with Klawans that ‘the moral impurity of Gentiles is deemed to be inherent’ (<italic>Impurity and Sin</italic>, p. 48). The ease with which Ishmael can occupy and revert to a position close to the center of covenant life (cf. <italic>Jub</italic>. 22.1) argues against the notion that, as a non-Israelite, he is necessarily morally impure (similarly, Hayes, <italic>Gentile Impurities</italic>, p. 81). Rather, on the basis of his behavior in <italic>Jubilees</italic>, he poses no intrinsic threat to the chosen line as long as his standing in relation to Isaac is uncompromised.</p></fn>

It would appear that the two objects of blessing stand in apposition: Abraham quickly clarifies which descendants are primarily in view. Not until the case of Jacob is such clarification unnecessary. The one exception to the pattern we have identified is found in 22.11, where Abraham applies the partitive principle to Jacob: ‘May the Lord give you righteous descendants, and may he sanctify some of your sons within the entire earth’. This does not undermine the fundamentally blessed, chosen status of all Jacob's sons, however. The same verse begins with the request that ‘Jacob and all his sons be blessed to the most high Lord throughout all ages’. Rather, it allows for a hierarchical arrangement of individuals (/tribes) within the elect nation of Israel (cf. 30.18). The distinctions internal to Israel are, nevertheless, a much smaller concern in <italic>Jubilees</italic> than the basic dissimilarity between Israel and all other nations.</p></fn>

We might assume that had the sons of Keturah been in Ishmael's shoes at the weaning of Isaac, or later returned to celebrate the festival of weeks, Abraham would have treated them in a similar way. Of course, the sons of Keturah cannot quite be in Ishmael's shoes: Ishmael is Abraham's (biological) firstborn. They do not exist when Isaac is weaned, and are not primary characters in the events surrounding Abraham's death (<italic>Jub</italic>. 23.7; cf. Gen. 25.9).</p></fn>

As recipients of the preceding covenantal instruction they have all been warned to avoid sexual impurity. Once sent away from the control center of covenant life, they appear to have no other acceptable partners with whom to mix. The reference to Arabs and Ishmaelites ‘mixing’ is perhaps best explained as a pun on the Hebrew עוב (I am indebted to James C. VanderKam for this suggestion).</p></fn>

The inevitably corrupt behavior of Gentiles provides the missing link between their lack of inherent moral impurity (contra Klawans) and the injunction against mixing with them (22.16). Klawans, then, is right to link the prohibition of intermarriage as a source of ‘moral defilement in its own right’ to the fear—we might say inevitability—that it leads to idolatry (<italic>Impurity and Sin</italic>, p. 48).</p></fn>

As we have argued, the gene-sensitive ideology of <italic>Jubilees</italic> will not allow this (similarly, Hayes, <italic>Gentile Impurities</italic>, pp. 73–76). Halpern-Amaru suggests that the choice of the equivalent of the Hebrew נכרי in <italic>Jub</italic>. 50.7 renders the meaning ‘convert’ additionally unlikely (<italic>Empowerment of Women</italic>, p. 157 n. 28).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn76-0951820712439830"><label>76.</label><p>Werman (‘Attitude towards Gentiles’, p. 139) suggests that Ishmael in <italic>Jubilees</italic> symbolizes the biblical <italic>ger</italic>, one who lives on the edge of society, takes on a limited yoke of the commandments, and is circumcised at a later age. There are difficulties with her analysis, however. In the legal material in the Hebrew Bible, the circumcised <italic>ger</italic> is obligated to both the prohibitive and performative commandments of the law. In the Prophetical Books, the start of the movement of the <italic>ger</italic> towards full integration among the people can be observed (Isa. 14.1; Ezek. 47.21–23). If the circumcised Ishmael represents the <italic>ger</italic> in <italic>Jubilees</italic>, he is not as thoroughly marginalized a character as Werman suggests.
