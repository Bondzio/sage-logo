<abstract>
<p>The aim of this systematic review was to critically examine the research that quantifies and describes the daily patterns of time use by parents of children with complex needs. Four electronic databases were searched. A total of 32 studies (30 peer-reviewed journal articles and two theses) met the inclusion criteria. Three key findings emerged from the review: (a) Parents of children with complex needs carry a significant caregiving burden that often does not reduce as the age of the child increases, (b) supervision or ‘vigilance’ is a category of childcare that carries a particular time requirement for these parents and (c) parents of children with complex needs spend (sometimes considerable) time undertaking health care–related tasks outside the ‘normal’ parenting role. The time demands placed on parents caring for a child or children with complex needs at home should be considered when health professionals are negotiating essential and/or additional therapies or treatments to be included in a child’s home care regime.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Having children is a major life course event that substantially alters how parents allocate their time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511420186">Craig and Mullan, 2010</xref>). Children depend on their parents in all domains of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367493511420186">Tadema and Vlaskamp, 2009</xref>). For the parents of children with complex needs, however, there is a blurring of the normative activities of parenting and the non-normative requirements of the caregiver role for children with atypical needs or development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367493511420186">Leiter et al., 2004</xref>), creating a level of caregiver burden beyond that experienced by other parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367493511420186">Nelson, 2002</xref>). There has been a steady increase in the survival rates for children born with complex medical conditions or prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511420186">D’Amore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367493511420186">Milligan, 2010</xref>). This creates a requirement to meet the increased health care needs of these paediatric populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493511420186">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493511420186">Grupp-Phelan et al., 2007</xref>). Central to this is an assumption that parents, particularly mothers, will assume a health care provider role, undertaking daily caregiving tasks previously provided in hospital or other health care settings that stretch the parenting role into the role of caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367493511420186">Leiter et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The multiple roles undertaken by parents of children with complex needs create time pressures above those experienced by other parents. This time pressure, and in some cases, the resultant effect on parental psychological and physical health, has been a common research theme (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511420186">Crowe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511420186">Crowe and Florez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367493511420186">Lucca and Settles, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493511420186">Padeliadu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367493511420186">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>). The increased time commitment required from the parents reduces the time available for other activities, including work, leisure activities and personal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511420186">Brandon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1367493511420186">Tilford et al., 2001</xref>); parents frequently forfeit employment opportunities, leisure time and social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511420186">Carnevale et al., 2008</xref>). Even when parents are working, time restrictions mean that they frequently rely on sick leave entitlements or family leave to meet the challenge of caring for their child and attending the child’s medical appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511420186">George et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493511420186">Green, 2007</xref>). This decrease in time available for employment, leisure activities and personal care activities directly affects the sense of control a parent has over their own life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511420186">Brandon, 2007</xref>). But despite what is now known in this area, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493511420186">Leiter (2004)</xref> argues that much of the additional work undertaken by the parents remains hidden. Therefore, there is a need to gain a better understanding of what time-use research demonstrates in regard to the time expenditure of parents of children with complex needs and how this compares to the parenting experience of typically developing children.</p>
<p>To address this, this systematic review aimed to critically examine the research that quantifies and describes the daily patterns of time use by parents of children with complex needs to determine the following:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>What is the daily amount of time that parents of children with complex needs spend in the care of their child or children?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What are the classifications of childcare and associated time requirements for parents of children with complex needs?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Are there differences in the daytime patterns of time use between parents of children with complex needs and the general population of parents?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A comprehensive electronic literature search for relevant research was conducted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511420186">Table 1</xref>
). Searches were also conducted using the names of key researchers in the field and ‘Related articles’ functions. The existence of a relevant unpublished study was identified via a publication describing the study methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1367493511420186">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>). The primary author of that paper was contacted, but data were not available for inclusion in the review. No other attempt was made to locate unpublished or grey literature. For the purpose of this review, ‘children with complex needs’ encompassed any studies that included at least one group of primary caregivers of children who were described as having a congenital abnormality (diagnosed or undiagnosed), intellectual or physical impairment and/or a chronic illness.</p>

<title>Setting and sample</title>
<p>The majority of the research (<italic>n</italic> = 19, 58%) originated in the United States, with the remainder from European countries (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 22%), Australia (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 12%), Canada (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and Israel (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Most studies recruited parents on the basis of the child’s diagnosis or type of disability. A range of conditions and diagnostic groups were represented. Children with Down syndrome (DS) were the highest represented group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367493511420186">
<title>Total daily time spent on childcare activities</title>
<p>An overview of the study-specific total daily time spent in childcare is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>. The overall childcare time ranges from 63 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367493511420186">Smith, 1986</xref>) to a maximum of 726 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511420186">Brust et al., 1992</xref>). There is a large individual (within group) variation as illustrated by the wide standard deviations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511420186">Moskowitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493511420186">Padeliadu, 1998</xref>) and a considerable difference in the minimal and maximum timings when ranges are provided (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>, Studies 3, 6, 10, 13, 15, 21, 27 and 32).</p>
<p>The majority of studies provide maternal childcare data only, although five (Studies 7, 18, 23, 24, 29) provide detailed data for paternal caregivers. Maternal caregivers are the primary care providers in all of these studies. Two studies include estimates of non-parental caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367493511420186">Lucca and Settles, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1367493511420186">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). A third study reports a weekly average of 11 hours per week of care by other caregivers based on maternal perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511420186">Crowe et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the studies that compare time spent providing care on weekdays versus weekend days (Studies 2, 3, 17, 22, 29 and 32), the general trend is for higher time requirements on weekend days, although this difference does not always achieve significance. Only one study reports similar patterns of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367493511420186">Joosten, 1979</xref>). Those studies demonstrating a significant difference report more than an hour of additional childcare time on weekend days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367493511420186">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a higher time requirement with younger children compared to older age groups in studies comparing childcare based on the age of the child (Studies 7, 11, 12, 15, 19, 27 and 32). While there is no longitudinal data, this is best illustrated in a comparison of the time spent in childcare across three time points from unrelated studies using the same measurement tool (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511420186">Crowe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511420186">Crowe and Florez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>). The comparison shows lower childcare time requirements as the age of the children with disabilities increases: 39.7 hours/week for children aged &lt;5 years, 27.5 hours/week for children aged 5–14 years and 21.8 hours/week for adolescents aged 13–19 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>). Four out of the seven studies that include condition severity as a variable show a higher childcare time requirement associated with the child having a lower functional ability and/or increased condition or disability severity (Studies 7, 12, 13 and 14).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367493511420186">
<title>Classification of childcare-related tasks and associated time requirements</title>
<p>The inconsistency in the classification of childcare across studies limits the ability to provide comprehensive summary statistics or make detailed cross-study comparisons. Childcare is presented as one broad classification incorporating a range of related tasks for 13 studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>, Studies 2, 3, 4, 9, 13, 15, 18, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 32). The remaining studies, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1367493511420186">Turner-Henson et al. (1992)</xref>, divide childcare into at least two categories. Several categories—physical care, feeding, supervision or vigilance, enrichment- or education-related activities, emotional care–related and health care–related activities—are common to a number of studies, although not all categories necessarily appear and some are combined (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>). The childcare category may also encompass the care of all children, not just the target child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511420186">Breslau, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367493511420186">Lucca, 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1367493511420186">
<title>Physical care</title>
<p>Physical care is a significant daily time requirement for parents of children with complex needs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>), and there is a degree of consensus regarding what constitutes this type of care—usually hygiene, dressing and toileting, with the possible addition of feeding. In seven studies (Studies 7, 10, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 25), the physical care of the child accounts for at least half the overall childcare time. Physical care is undertaken on weekdays by 100% of Australian primary and 76% of secondary caregivers, with a similar pattern occurring at weekends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Significant time may be spent feeding children, particularly when the child has severe impairments that impact on their ability to eat. Parents of children with spastic tetraplegia spend an average of 113 minutes/day feeding their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511420186">Edebol-Tysk, 1989</xref>), while parents of children with physical handicaps spend 30 minutes/day, more than four times that of comparison group parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511420186">Johnson and Deitz, 1985</xref>). The median feeding time was 75 minutes/weekday for 94% of primary caregivers in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden (2007)</xref>, not including the additional 38 minutes provided by 51% of secondary caregivers. Time required for feeding may remain high even during weekdays when children are away at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511420186">Cant, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Supervision</title>
<p>Six studies (Studies 9, 12, 21, 25, 29 and 31) have a specific classification of childcare focusing on supervision or minding, as distinct from other ‘active’ forms of childcare. This category carries substantial time requirements in all of these studies, at times greater than all other categories of care combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493511420186">Harris and McHale, 1989</xref>); although in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493511420186">Harris and McHale (1989)</xref> this encompasses any time that the mother is ‘available’ to her child. The highest parental time allocation for this category is 6.5 hours per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511420186">Brust et al., 1992</xref>), their ‘vigilant’ category incorporating both watching the child and providing emotional support.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493511420186">Dupont (1980)</xref> does not provide specific timings for ‘supervision’, but parents in this study identify the need for constant supervision as their heaviest burden, with 64% of the children only able to be unattended for 5 minutes. The need for close supervision remains even when children are older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>). Mothers describe the need to remain close to their teenage child with cerebral palsy to deal with contingencies that arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511420186">Cant, 1994</xref>). Luescher and colleagues (1998) differentiate between ‘sitting with patient’ and ‘sitting with other children’, one of the only studies (along with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>, and Wilson et al., 2005) to provide any form of delineation between the care of a child with complex needs and other children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1367493511420186">
<title>Health care related</title>
<p>While health care activities are often included in the overall childcare classification, the actual time spent on these activities cannot be calculated from the data provided. A total of 11 studies (Studies 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 25, 26, 29 and 30) include a category of parental childcare relating specifically to the health care needs of the child. Only three of these studies (Studies 26, 29 and 30) use more than one category to describe the health care–related tasks. These include travel to appointments or treatments (may include waiting time), medication administration, education, therapy/intervention procedures and health care management. In a fourth study, health care related is the only category of childcare for which timings are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1367493511420186">Turner-Henson et al., 1992</xref>). In addition, few studies detail specific tasks contained within the health care–related categories, the exception being the primary focus on medical treatment in three studies focusing on children with chronic illness (Studies 14, 26 and 30). Almost 75% of children in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1367493511420186">Turner-Henson et al. (1992)</xref> require daily treatment in the home (average of 42 minutes/day), the most frequently reported being oral and injectable medications, special diet, blood, urine and stool testing. Some specialised types of care are diagnosis-related crisis care carrying an additional burden for parents of children with sickle cell disease (SCD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511420186">Moskowitz et al., 2007</xref>), while medication administration is a significant proportion (up to 50%) of the ‘technical’ health care provided for children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), an average of 38 minutes/day in one sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1367493511420186">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>) and 29 minutes/day in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511420186">Moskowitz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Estimates of the travel and waiting times required for visits to health care appointments and/or therapy sessions are provided in a number of studies, including 104 hours/year (2 hours/week) for a primarily rural sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511420186">Brust et al., 1992</xref>) and 30 hours/year for medical visits only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511420186">Breslau, 1983</xref>). Visits to physiotherapy alone can require an average time expenditure of 2.3 hours/week equating to 120 hours/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511420186">Edebol-Tysk, 1989</xref>). Parents of preschoolers with cerebral palsy spend 26 minutes/day (158 hours/year), usually associated with clinic appointments or therapeutic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511420186">Cant, 1994</xref>). In a recent study, 77% of primary caregivers spent a median 60 minutes/day (equating to 364 hours/year) travelling with their child, not including appointment time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>). Travel times may be included in a ‘health care management’ category that also includes time spent arranging childcare and organising health care–related finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511420186">Moskowitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1367493511420186">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Education, teaching and/or enrichment activities are included as separate categories of care in five studies (Studies 8, 17, 19, 20 and 29). An average of 35 minutes/day is spent in recommended home activities for children with motor impairments, developmental delay and DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511420186">Erickson and Upshur, 1989</xref>). Greek mothers of children with DS are involved in ‘recreation and education’ activities 12 times daily, double that of comparison group parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493511420186">Padeliadu, 1998</xref>). Parents of deaf children spend an average of 37 minutes per day in teaching and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367493511420186">Lampropoulou and Konstantareas, 1998</xref>), while 54% of Australian primary caregivers spent a median 75 minutes/weekday undertaking therapy with their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>). Children with spastic tetraplegia average 203 care procedures per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511420186">Edebol-Tysk, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of parental time use: complex needs and general population</title>
<p>The majority of studies compare the time spent in childcare by parents of children with complex needs with a comparison group of parents (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511420186">Table 3</xref>

<p>Eight studies (Studies 2, 6, 7, 9, 18, 20, 26 and 27) report a significantly greater average daily caregiving time requirement for parents of children with complex needs compared to controls (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511420186">Table 3</xref>). Significant between-group differences may also occur in the specific categories of childcare within these studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511420186">Table 3</xref>). Three studies (Studies 10, 17 and 23) report a difference in the time requirements, but no information regarding significance is provided. Nine studies report no significant difference in total childcare time requirements between the study groups and the controls. The samples for these studies include parents of children with DS only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493511420186">Hedov et al., 2002</xref>), chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511420186">Moskowitz et al., 2007</xref>) and a range of physical and intellectual disabilities and/or conditions (Studies 4, 5, 11, 22, 28, 29 and 31). Significantly greater time spent in specific categories of childcare is reported for the parents of children with complex needs in some of these studies (Studies 29, 30 and 31) despite there being no significant difference in the overall time spent providing care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511420186">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The heterogeneity of the included studies makes it impossible to definitively answer the review questions, cross-study comparisons made difficult due mainly to the lack of consistency in childcare classifications and the variety of data collection tools utilised. Time-use diaries, interview questions (particularly 24-hour recall) and time-use estimates, often questionnaire based, were the most commonly used forms of data collection. Recognised deficits exist in the use of interview recall and time-use estimates; time-use diaries are being widely accepted as the most valid measurement instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493511420186">Geurts and De Ree, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367493511420186">Juster and Stafford, 1991</xref>) because they produce data consistent with real behaviour for most activities and are not subject to the misunderstandings, recall problems, altering tendencies or overestimation that may occur with other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367493511420186">Neimi, 1993</xref>). The one study in this review comparing two data collection methods within the same population reported significantly higher childcare time estimates on the questionnaire compared to the time diary (Jarbink et al., 2003: 398). This may provide some explanation for the substantially higher childcare time reported in the studies using time estimates (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511420186">Brust et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367493511420186">Leonard et al., 1993</xref>), particularly if the time diaries captured only primary activities.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties in definitively answering the questions posed by this review, three key findings do emerge: (a) parents of children with complex needs carry a significant caregiving burden that often does not reduce as the age of the child increases, (b) supervision or ‘vigilance’ is a category of childcare that carries a particular time requirement for these parents and (c) parents of children with complex needs spend (sometimes considerable) time undertaking health care–related tasks outside the ‘normal’ parenting role.</p>
<sec id="section12-1367493511420186">
<title>A significant caregiving burden</title>
<p>Parents of children with complex needs carry a significant caregiving burden. While it could be argued that this is common to all parents, the relentless and intense nature of the care is a particular challenge faced by the parents of children with complex needs (Bourke-Taylor et al., 2010). The unpredictability of the care requirements presents an additional burden, mothers of children with disabilities reporting fewer ‘typical days’ than comparison parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>). The increased caregiving burden is frequently positively correlated with the severity of the child’s condition and negatively correlated with the child’s functional ability and age. The negative correlation with age mirrors the pattern observed within the general population. The childcare time allocation for any first-born infant is as high as 10.5 hours/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511420186">Craig and Bittman, 2008</xref>). The characteristic dependency of infancy means there is less apparent difference between infants with complex needs and their typically developing counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367493511420186">MacDonald and Callery, 2008</xref>). This may explain why the study with a sample of infants aged 0–2 years failed to show a relationship between childcare time requirements and the severity of the child’s condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511420186">Erickson and Upshur, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Where the care of children with complex needs deviates from the normal pattern is in the continuation of high childcare requirements despite the child’s increasing chronological age, particularly in children with severe disabilities. There is only a small difference in the basic care needs between children aged 9–17 years with multiple profound disabilities and those aged 1–8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367493511420186">Tadema and Vlaskamp, 2009</xref>). The number of items of personal care that children with complex needs require per waking hour does not decrease with increasing age, in contrast to the negative correlation between increasing age and frequency of personal care items for typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511420186">Curran et al., 2001</xref>). Increasing chronological age means children grow bigger and heavier, increasing the physical caregiving burden for parents still providing basic care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511420186">Brinchmann, 1999</xref>; MacDonald and Callery, 2008). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael (2011)</xref> do demonstrate a reduction in the time spent in childcare activity as the age of children increased, but the time requirement remains significantly higher for parents of children with complex needs compared to their typically developing counterparts at each stage of development. While this finding is not conclusive across all the studies, the findings from this review suggest that the time spent in primary childcare by parents of children with complex needs, outside of infancy, is higher than that of other parents.</p>
<p>Mothers are the primary caregivers, assuming responsibility for the majority of the physical and health care–related tasks. Again, this follows the societal pattern, women spending significantly greater time caring for the child compared to men, even when the mother is employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511420186">Craig and Bittman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511420186">Craig and Mullan, 2010</xref>). The focus on maternal caregivers in studies in this review may overemphasise the role they play in childcare, but this would appear to be refuted by the primary role played by maternal caregivers in the studies comparing time use of mothers and fathers and by the commonality of this finding across other research in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511420186">Coffey, 2006</xref>). Despite these gender-based differences, there is some support in these studies for the suggestion that families with two parents may adopt more of a shared caregiving model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511420186">Brandon, 2007</xref>), fathers of children with complex needs spending more time in childcare than fathers of typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511420186">Barnett and Boyce, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367493511420186">Smith, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>What emerges from the heterogeneity in the time requirements across the studies and the wide standard deviations within individual studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511420186">Table 2</xref>) is that each family responds differently to the care requirements of their child. There is not an established pattern of time expenditure for parents of children with complex needs, even when children have similar diagnoses or level and type of disability. Instead, parents find a division and pattern of labour that works for their individual situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511420186">Crowe et al., 2000</xref>) and ‘no day really is typical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511420186">Crowe and Florez, 2006</xref>: 200).</p>

<sec id="section13-1367493511420186">
<title>Supervision or ‘vigilance’</title>
<p>Supervision or ‘vigilance’ is a category of childcare that carries a particular time requirement for parents of children with complex needs, whether as the sole task or, as is more likely, when performed in conjunction with other caregiving- or household-related tasks. Mothers describe the constant need to supervise or be involved with their children to ensure safety, because the child cannot amuse themselves or because they have a ‘compulsion to run, climb and escape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511420186">Bourke-Taylor et al., 2010</xref>: 132). Children with autism can require the attentions of a family member from the time of awakening until the time they fall asleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511420186">DeGrace, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511420186">Breslau (1983)</xref> shows no significant difference in childcare-related time expenditure between mothers of children with disabilities and a comparison group. However, the mothers of children with disabilities spent an additional 3 hours/week in housework; the author suggests that this estimate probably includes time spent feeding, assisting and supervising disabled children at home, the concurrent nature of the mothers’ activities making it difficult to separate time in childcare from time in other homemaking activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511420186">Breslau, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367493511420186">Lucca (1990)</xref> suggests this may also explain his finding of decreased (1 hour less) personal care time for study mothers despite no commensurate increase in childcare time.</p>
<p>There is greater likelihood that time spent supervising children is documented as a secondary activity. In the study reporting the highest daily parental time requirement, 6.5 hours per day were spent in vigilant tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511420186">Brust et al., 1992</xref>). This category was classified as a ‘secondary activity’ due to the mothers’ difficulty separating vigilance from other activities, reporting it as a 24 hours a day task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511420186">Brust et al., 1992</xref>). However, ‘secondary’ childcare still requires the presence and at least partial attention of the parents, constraining their choice of other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511420186">Craig and Bittman, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511420186">Cant (1994)</xref> argues that classifying childcare as a secondary activity underemphasises the demanding nature of the task, suggesting that the care of a child with complex needs is the central organising feature and other activities are selected as complementary to it. Ignoring the time when childcare is viewed as a background activity results in time estimates that mothers find laughably low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511420186">Craig and Bittman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>An important implication of the time requirements for supervision/vigilance is the potential under-recording of the time parents spend in childcare if only information about primary activities is collected. The Caregiver’s Activity and Recording of Events (CARE) inventory used in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511420186">Crowe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511420186">Crowe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511420186">Crowe and Florez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>) allows for the inclusion of secondary or parallel activities and allows researchers to divide the time evenly between multiple activities occurring within a half hour time block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511420186">Crowe, 1993</xref>). While this method recognises the existence of parallel activities, there is no ability to identify the primacy of tasks. Supervision carries a considerable time requirement in the studies that include it as a childcare category, and time spent in this form of care may be significantly higher for parents of children with complex needs compared to comparison parents. One study does negate this trend, with the comparison group of a national normative sample spending significantly more time than study parents (more than double for females) ‘minding’ their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>). However, the author notes that based on the other study findings, the care of children with complex needs requires more ‘active’ involvement, while most of the childcare by parents in the normative sample was recorded as a secondary activity, thus indicating that these parents were actively engaged in other activities while looking after their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Tasks outside the ‘normal’ parenting role</title>
<p>Parents of children with complex needs spend (sometimes considerable) time undertaking health care–related tasks outside the ‘normal’ parenting role. This dual role of parenting and medical caregiving is tiring and stressful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1367493511420186">Tong et al., 2010</xref>), requiring parents to attend to a myriad of management responsibilities and activities, including condition monitoring, organisation and negotiation of care and accessing and coordinating resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367493511420186">Sullivan-Bolyai et al., 2004</xref>). Children with disabilities may be seeing multiple physicians, the prescribed treatments often including hospitalisations, surgeries and highly complex home care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493511420186">Green, 2007</xref>). The related time demands of travel with the child are significant, as high as an hour of primary caregiver time each weekday, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511420186">Breslau, 1983</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>) and may be inflated because the child needs to see a specialist rather than the most convenient medical service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511420186">Breslau, 1983</xref>) or because of the frequent need for assessment of younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511420186">Cant, 1994</xref>). The unpredictability of the health care requirements places additional demands. The presence or absence of seizure activity in a child can dictate whether the family has ‘a good day or a bad day’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>: 131). Parents of children who require the use of technology intermittently (e.g. suction equipment or oxygen therapy in the event of a medical crisis) find it difficult to commit to regular activities or holidays because of the unpredictable nature of their child’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493511420186">Heaton et al., 2005</xref>), while crisis care carries a significant burden for parents of children with SCD and HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511420186">Moskowitz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A specific category of care that emerges from a number of the studies is the provision of ‘enrichment activities’ for the children. Mothers of children with DS have greater involvement in ‘recreation and education’ activities compared to other parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493511420186">Padeliadu, 1998</xref>). It may be that these mothers recognise the significant role they play in their child’s development and progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493511420186">Padeliadu, 1998</xref>). But this awareness, coupled with the increasing emphasis on early intervention programmes for a range of conditions, can create considerable anxiety and guilt for parents who find it difficult to find the time for these activities in their daily family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>). The extra time and energy demands that home treatment programmes place on families, particularly mothers, may contribute to role strain (Crowe et al., 1996) and the need to be considered when professionals suggest additional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511420186">Crowe, 1993</xref>). Mothers may feel overwhelmed by the expectations of health professionals, particularly if they are expected to provide therapeutic care that exceeds their knowledge or requires them to assume a ‘therapist’ role that they may not want (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493511420186">Leiter, 2004</xref>). While the importance of intervention and therapy to enable children to reach their full potential is not in dispute, the fact that parents of children with complex needs are frequently undertaking health care and/or therapy roles and tasks needs to be clearly acknowledged when assessing the need for respite and support to enable these parents to continue to provide this level of care.</p>
<p>In addition to time spent meeting the health care–related and therapy-related requirements of their child, parents suggest that ‘working the system’ is the worst part of having a child with a chronic condition; it consumes a substantial proportion of their caregiving time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367493511420186">Ray, 2002</xref>). The non-responsiveness and poor coordination of health care service delivery lead to mothers spending considerable time on advocacy activities and negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493511420186">Green, 2007</xref>). Parents describe that having to complete multiple forms for everything requires significant time and causes confusion and frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511420186">Bourke-Taylor et al., 2010</xref>). Mothers make particular mention of the difficulty in finding the time to access and organise services for their child, completing daily caregiving and undertaking required therapy; these time demands limit the time available to spend with other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>). The amount of time and effort involved in planning and managing an outing with a child with learning disabilities and associated problem behaviours makes it less likely that their parents will respond to social opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493511420186">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>). The reduced parental time for self-care and social or leisure activities reported in time-use studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511420186">Barnett and Boyce, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511420186">Crettenden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511420186">Crowe and Michael, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493511420186">Jarbrink et al., 2003</xref>) and in national surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511420186">Brandon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511420186">Craig and Bittman, 2008</xref>) supports these assertions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1367493511420186">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A meta-analysis was not possible in this systematic review due to methodological differences in the included studies, so summary statistics for the time-use of parents are not able to be provided. Additionally, the small sample sizes in some studies and the wide within-group variation in many decreases the likelihood of showing significant differences across groups. This may be one reason why some studies fail to demonstrate a significant difference in the childcare time use of parents of children with complex needs compared to their typically developing counterparts, despite substantial time differences being reported.</p>
<p>There is a focus on daily time expenditure only. While this may in some cases include care provided overnight, the night-time activities of parents of children with complex needs have not been a key focus. Only research published in English and French is included, reducing the applicability of the findings. However, the fact that this review includes studies from a number of countries including the United States, England, Australia, Israel, Greece, France, Sweden and the Netherlands does allow for some country-specific variations in the daily care of children with complex needs and related health care service provision. The lack of representation from African and Asian regions suggests an area of future research.</p>

<sec id="section16-1367493511420186">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This systematic review supports the assertion that parents of children with complex needs carry a significant caregiving burden, resulting in high childcare-related time use that does not decrease proportionately as the age of the child increases. While physical care involves significant time expenditure, particularly in children with reduced functional ability, the need for constant supervision or hyper vigilance is a category of childcare that carries a particular burden for parents of children with complex needs. Further research into this category of care is required to improve understanding regarding the time demands and associated family stresses that this type of care places on parents and other family members. As treatments become more readily available and there is increasing emphasis on ‘early intervention’ for children with complex needs, health professionals need to consider the implications of adding to the caregiving burden of parents by creating expectations that they assume an advanced therapist or health care provider role in undertaking health care–related tasks that may add a considerable time demand on their already busy days.</p>
