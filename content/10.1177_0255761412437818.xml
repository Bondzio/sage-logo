<abstract>
<p>This article builds on enquiry aimed to discover Kenyan music teachers’ perceptions and expectations of their role; their view of the training they received; head teachers’ perceptions and expectations of the role of the music teacher; and the expectations of both music teachers and head teachers of a music teacher education programme in Kenya. The findings have steered a discussion towards suggestions for an improved framework to guide teacher education for music at all levels of education in Kenya.</p>
<p>Through questionnaires, a sample of 16 music teachers and 11 head teachers recorded their opinion that teachers were not adequately prepared to implement the music programmes; that the role of the music teacher covered in and out of class activities; and that this expectation could only be accomplished with proper academic and professional training. Guided by principles of indigenous African education and learning conceptual orientations, the discussions led to recommendations that call for better grounding of music teachers in the processes of music and ability to facilitate music learning.</p>

<p>Music in the public (government) schools in Kenya is a paradox. In early childhood education, music means singing at various intervals of the school day. In primary school, it is combined with fine art as a non-examinable subject called creative arts. In secondary school, it is an elective subject, presenting relatively few students for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), a national examination that comes at the end of the secondary school cycle. The teacher training colleges (TTCs) have music in the timetable, with a singing content in the curriculum. At university, only two of the seven government institutions provide music as a subject. There is no middle-level music college. Yet song, dance and instrument playing characterize a range of activities in learning institutions. These include participation in the annual Kenya Music Festival competitions that involve thousands of pupils from nursery school to university.</p>
<p>In this environment, the music teacher is an undefined entity. Where music is taught, the teacher is expected to be well-trained and competent, supported by academic certificates and validated by students’ examination results. Elsewhere, the music teacher is a choir trainer whose qualifications in music appear not to matter. Yet if music teachers were to impart knowledge and skills to learners through music, they would presumably require an understanding of how music works and the nature and concept of music. They would need to be familiar with diverse music types and have the ability to create and interpret music. Music teaching requires the ability to communicate these attributes of music, and to employ music in diverse circumstances to facilitate learning. This study sought to gauge school head teachers’ and music teachers’ perception of the latter’s preparedness for such a role.</p>
<sec id="section1-0255761412437818">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In Kenya, government and private – mostly church-based – learning institutions offer teacher education. There are three levels of qualification:</p>
<list id="list1-0255761412437818" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Certificate in Education is awarded to graduates of a three-year post-secondary education prepared as generalist teachers for the primary school;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diploma in Education is awarded after three years of post-secondary education in either humanities or sciences to semi-specialized teachers for secondary school;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A bachelor of education degree is awarded after four years of post-secondary training in two subjects with graduates destined for secondary school or teacher training college.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All three types of qualification are categorized as professional. The TTCs and diploma colleges follow a national syllabus, and candidates are assessed through a common examination. At the university level, each institution sets its own curriculum, seeing that each is governed by its particular charter. Since the curriculum is uniform at the lower levels of training, there are common provisions for teacher education in the country. The Ministry of Education has specific units that develop, monitor the implementation of and assess the outcome of the curriculum for primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education. The Kenya Institute of Education (KIE) is the curriculum developer for all subjects, with objectives to enable the country to achieve broadly stated national goals that reflect its ethos and philosophy. These include enhancing culture and developing creativity, areas served well by music and other performing and creative arts in the curriculum. The Directorate of Quality Assurance and Standards (DQAS), formerly the Inspectorate, is charged with monitoring quality in education, and standards. Examination matters rest with the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC). It sets, administers and oversees examinations for primary, secondary and post-secondary learning programmes, excluding university. The Teachers’ Service Commission (TSC) is the employer of teachers for the state-funded institutions, once more excluding universities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0255761412437818">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a practical subject, music relies on music making for its mastery. Students learn in a variety of ways. Kenyan indigenous communities are traditionally oral societies. Learning in indigenous format follows knowledge transmission and skill development through apprenticeship. Its success relies on masters (teachers) who are well equipped with knowledge and the relevant vocabulary to facilitate learning. Its principles have had lingering effects on the thinking of current researchers on music teaching.</p>
<p>Research had indicated that teachers’ choice of learning resources impacted the kind and manner of learning that occurred. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761412437818">Digolo (1997)</xref> indicated that some schools had western music instruments but, since there were no teachers who could play them, the instruments were not used to equip learners for practical music making. Learners resorted to singing (voice) for their performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761412437818">Mushira (2000)</xref> found that the secondary schools that had African instruments presented strong candidates for examination in the performance of African music and dance, leaving the western component of the syllabus under-prepared. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi (2000)</xref> reported that, at TTC, there were a variety of African and western music instruments but student teachers could not access them due to the absence of relevant skilled educators. Their education neglected music performance in favour of other areas of the curriculum.</p>
<p>As role models, teachers’ attitude to the subject and actual engagement with it has been shown to transfer to pupils through the teachers’ enthusiasm and freedom with the subject, or lack thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>). The success and effectiveness of the teacher is assessed in students’ achievement at national examinations and performance platforms. These expectations of learning are yet to be met. At secondary school, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761412437818">Mushira (2000)</xref> cited insufficiency of content, contact time and learning experiences in the implementation of a section of the music curriculum. An examination-oriented teaching was further reported to be denying learners the chance to develop music literacy and translation skills. She concluded that ‘teaching methodologies and resources employed do not fully support the nature of Kenyan indigenous music’ (p. 72). She supported this conclusion by citing a theoretical approach to teaching that focused on books, charts, pictures and posters as teaching resources, and lack of experiential learning that led to poor concept development.</p>
<p>Though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761412437818">Mushira (2000)</xref> focused on the teaching of indigenous Kenyan music, other studies have reported this insufficiency as a widespread phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761412437818">Akuno (2006)</xref> reported inadequacy in teacher preparation, programme design and resource. The shortcomings revolved around teachers’ preparedness to generate music for instruction, emanating from the already cited theoretical approach to music teaching. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761412437818">Mbeche (2000)</xref> observed the effect of inappropriate procedures on the teaching of musicianship, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala (2004)</xref> noted that students were not always given access to learning equipment, and teachers could not utilize some for lack of skills. These observations have confirmed challenges, pointing to a learning gap in teacher education where graduates of learning programmes are unable to utilize relevant resources for curriculum delivery. This may have far reaching effects on the sustenance of the music programme in schools. It begs to ascertain if teachers consider the education they received adequate for the role they are expected to play in the practice.</p>
<p>The Kenyan school environment provides a rich field for music learning and development. The annual Kenya Music Festival is a nation-wide competition housed by the Ministry of Education, and designed as a co-curricular event. Open to, and catering for, participants from nursery school (kindergarten) to university, both private and government institutions take part. Competition categories are divided into classes and labelled by ensemble type and genre. There is provision for African, oriental and western singing, dancing, elocution and instrumental playing in solo, ensemble and large group/choral organizations. The music classes call for composition of new items in African or western idiom, adaptation and arrangement of traditional music for choral ensembles, performance of traditional songs and dances and playing of instruments in traditional and modern forms of music. The selection, creation and teaching of music for these activities require a high level of proficiency in music for the teacher who aspires to succeed and to give pupils a worthwhile experience. The expectations are no less significant than those for classroom music teaching, requiring musicianship and ability to transfer knowledge.</p>

<title>The problem</title>
<p>The ability to implement a curriculum requires knowledge and skills. In music, this is evident in the quality and diversity of music experiences provided for learning and judged by the teacher’s own involvement in music activities. Previous research on music education in Kenya highlighted issues of curriculum implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761412437818">Mbeche, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761412437818">Mushira, 2000</xref>) and selection and use of learning material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761412437818">Digolo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>) among others. These are only part of the education complex that includes teachers. Theirs is the catalyst role that brings education to life, where success is determined by factors that include their training analyzed in relation to their expected role.</p>
<p>The three types of teacher education that are in place in Kenya lead to certificate, diploma and degree qualifications. They produce teachers with varying levels of competence, skills and perceptual orientation. Teacher education programmes of these varying durations are meant to equip student teachers with knowledge and attitudes to enable them to operate as teachers. Research indicated a degree of inefficiency and low achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>). But how do the music teachers view themselves? On the one hand, having undergone teacher education, and with teaching experience, it is expected that the teachers get to a position where they recognize and can articulate pertinent challenges to their activities. They should learn what is expected of them by the employer and the learning environment, and discover if they are able to deliver as per expectation. They should analyze the source of their ability or deficiency. On the other hand, perception of competence depends on who is judging. The teacher and the administrator have different roles to play in the education process, and as such have and present different perspectives of what teacher education should entail. This makes them prime informants for inquiry into how to equip teachers for service. The key question in this article, considering the various teacher education programmes in Kenya today, is whether music teachers are perceived to be competent to sustain the growth of music in the school.</p>

<sec id="section5-0255761412437818">
<title>Assumptions</title>
<p>This study was based on the assumption that the nature of a subject dictates how it should be practised and what manner of person ought to teach it. Music being a subject that includes practice would therefore require music practitioners to teach it. The study also assumed that, since teaching is the impartation of knowledge and skills, the teacher ought to have skills and knowledge to impart. The teacher further needs skills to impart these skills and knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0255761412437818">
<title>Rationale</title>
<p>This investigation took place at a point in time and in a subject where efficiency and relevance in education were serious concerns of education planners. With the introduction of free primary school education in Kenya, the classrooms were full, and the pupil–teacher ratios high. Unless teachers understood and lived up to their role, and teacher education prepared them to fulfil this role, the education process in the country would falter. The above concerns continue to demand attention from educators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0255761412437818">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The research included a survey completed by head teachers representing school administration, and music teachers. Investigation focused on personnel from primary and secondary schools who participated in the national level of the 2007 Kenya Music Festival competitions held in Nakuru, Kenya. They were sampled from Western Province and Nairobi, two of the country’s eight administrative provinces. These provinces were purposively sampled from reports of the large number of schools that engaged in music activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>), the number of schools that presented learners for examinations in music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761412437818">Mushira, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 1991</xref>) and their visibility at the music festivals as observed by the researcher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0255761412437818">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information was obtained through written questionnaires administered by research assistants. These were festival officials who were familiar with participants from their provinces and identified them at the Provincial Registration Desks at the festival venue. The questionnaires had open- and closed-ended questions that solicited factual information as well as respondents’ opinions (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761412437818">Appendix 1</xref>). Music teachers and head teachers from the selected provinces were requested to participate. Those who were willing were given the questionnaire and requested to complete and return them on their next visit to the Provincial Registration Desk. Several questionnaires were not returned, and of those returned, not all questions were completed. Eleven questionnaires for head teachers and 16 for music teachers were completed in full, making them suitable for inclusion in the study.</p>
<p>The head teachers were asked to state their perception of the role of the music teacher and the expected qualifications that should enable one to fulfil that role. The music teachers were asked to articulate how they were viewed, and to give their opinion of the training they received vis-à-vis their expectations of a training programme. Secondary data were obtained from previous research on music education in Kenya and beyond. The information gathered from both primary and secondary sources was scrutinized and categorized in relation to the stated objectives, leading to the discussion that follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0255761412437818">
<title>Conceptual underpinnings</title>
<p>The author’s experience confirms that confidence, which is evidence of security emanating from proper grounding in a discipline, is as much a motivator to the teacher as are the accolades that accompany success. ‘Music learning is the ability to apply musical understanding to a musical process . . . Teaching music means facilitating this in others. The ability to do this effectively requires that an individual achieve a certain level of mastery himself or herself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761412437818">Wiggins, 2007</xref>, p. 38). The starting point is a good training that prepares the teacher to manage subject-related challenges in the practice of teaching, empowering him/her to employ knowledge in the subject for the socialization of the learners in his/her care. The resulting level of achievement (in students’ examinations/performance) becomes an external motivator. Through sufficient training and practice, the teacher develops personal confidence. This anchors all activities and sustains interest in the work, leading to good results, which further boost confidence. Such a cycle keeps the teacher motivated, focused and productive.</p>
<p>This concept of training as the fundamental ingredient in the formation of the teacher, catalyzed by practice in order to lead to achievement that eventually motivates him/her as presented in the motivation cycle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761412437818">Figure 1</xref>) is the guiding principle behind this study.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0255761412437818" position="float">

<p>The motivation cycle</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0255761412437818-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This conceptual framework is developed from the author’s experiences and observations as a music educator. It is further strengthened by concepts from literature on music teacher education in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>). It follows that:</p>
<list id="list3-0255761412437818" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Initial knowledge equips practitioners with the tools and vocabulary of the discipline;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Actual practice enables the teacher to develop competence and achieve results;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results or outcome of teachers’ input into the practice reflect their preparation (education) and their experiences in the practice;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Success in practice is often a reason for continued engagement. Interest in an activity is developed due to prospects of a good outcome. A good outcome also sustains interest and may lead to a desire for further personal development.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The four elements in the motivation cycle are inter-related and fuse to make a whole that defines the practice of education, as employed in this article.</p>
<p>This article further contemplates creative knowledge as a conceptual orientation to guide teacher education. The author’s experiences as a music student teacher and music teacher educator bring to the fore issues on the nature of learning experiences and expected outcomes of teacher education. The manner in which a student teacher engages with knowledge spells out what kind of teaching he/she ends up doing. The impact of teacher education on teachers’ behaviour is said to be minimal due to the gap between theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761412437818">Brouwer &amp; Korthager, 2005</xref>): ‘The structure of teacher education programmes may indeed be counterproductive to student teacher learning, and teacher educators themselves may not display the best examples of good teaching’ (p. 157). In Kenya, the theoretical approach, characterized by content-focused instruction, leaves little room for reflection or engagement with gathered information. This is compounded by examination-based assessment that demands recall.</p>
<p>Since ‘specific characteristics of pre-service teacher education programmes can have a specific influence on graduates’ teaching competence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761412437818">Brouwer &amp; Korthagen, 2005</xref>, p. 157), this article embraces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761412437818">Brownlee, Purdie and Boulton-Lewis’s (2003)</xref> concepts of teaching as a guide to articulating preferred tendencies and orientation in teacher education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761412437818">Brownlee et al. (2003)</xref> reveal a series of concepts of teaching held by student teachers, summarized as quantitative and qualitative. In the former ‘learning involves the acquisition of knowledge without any transformation of the information to develop understanding’ (p. 110). Quantitative learning, on the one hand, is reproductive because information is recalled as acquired, usually in large quantities, and is not necessarily concerned with connections between sets of knowledge. A quantitative student teacher would graduate into an educator whose activities are characterized by inability to provide learning environments upon which learners could build or generate tangible learning experiences. His/her teaching may not be creative, but would demand a significant amount of recall and repetition from learners. Qualitative learning, on the other hand, represents ‘views of learning as active, personal constructions of meaning . . . [where] . . . understanding emerges from a transformation of the information in relation to the learner’s prior knowledge rather than from a focus on aggregating quantities of information that remain unconnected’ (p.110). This is transformative because the learner seems to engage with the knowledge and to derive meaning from it. A teacher who had been such a learner would seem to adapt knowledge for application in various circumstances for quality learning outcomes. The author considers this a higher level of engagement with information in education.</p>
<p>Yet teaching causes change and demands a high degree of creativity both in the process and as an outcome of learning. Therefore, for learning to be achieved, teacher education needs to engage with knowledge conceptualized as being creative, and not just reproductive or transformative. Whereas the quantities of information acquired can become transformative as they are interrogated to facilitate understanding of reality, the achieved understanding should move the learner beyond mere recall to actual initiation of events to address the conditions of existence. Valuable knowledge enables learners to demonstrate an understanding of that knowledge in interactions with other people and situations. Learning is expressive when it is projected externally. To this end, this article proposes an additional dimension to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761412437818">Brownlee et al.’s (2003)</xref> conceptual orientations, where knowledge is seen as being not only reproductive (quantitative) or transformative (qualitative) but also creative (expressive).</p>
<p>In the progression of learning hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761412437818">Figure 2</xref>):</p>
<list id="list4-0255761412437818" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Quantitative learning is reproductive, where learning is viewed as a process of reproducing a mass of gathered knowledge;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Qualitative learning is transformative, where learning is viewed as a process of constructing personal meaning from knowledge;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Expressive learning is creative, where learning is viewed as a process of generating solutions based on assimilated knowledge.</p></list-item>

<p>Creative knowledge develops the individual mind. Learning to teach is a matter of developing the ability to interpret situations wisely. Expressive learning will encourage learners to consider their beliefs and practices in relation to the reasons behind the same. It is against this concept that teacher education is analyzed and weighted in this article.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section10-0255761412437818">
<title>Respondents’ background</title>
<p>The 11 head teachers who participated in the study had an average of 10 years administration experience. Their responsibility included allocation of duties to supervised staff. This means they were responsible for deciding who taught what in the school. Of the music teachers sampled, the nine primary school teachers had a three-year post-secondary school certificate level training, while the seven secondary school teachers had either a three-year post-secondary school diploma or four-year post-secondary school bachelor’s degree qualification. These qualifications indicate that all the teachers in the sample had professional preparation to take up teaching responsibilities. Whereas some teachers were posted to schools by TSC, some schools, through the Board of Governors (BOG), hired practising musicians (without teaching qualifications) to train their choirs for the music festivals (and other school activities).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0255761412437818">
<title>Perceived role and expectations of the music teacher</title>
<p>All the head teachers in the study perceived the music teacher primarily as a classroom teacher and choir trainer as they all selected the two choices in the questionnaire (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761412437818">Appendix 1</xref>). The former role emanates from the general job description of a teacher, and the latter would cover additional assignments based on teachers’ interest or expertise. Not all the head teachers committed a response on whether or not the teachers were effective. In response to the question on how they gauged teachers’ effectiveness, one respondent referred to learners’ ‘. . . willingness to participate in choir’ with two others citing their schools’ ‘achievement at the annual festival competitions’. One teacher specifically stated that they normally made it to the national level. Eight head teachers indicated that the teachers’ success depended on the level of training they had (question 9b). All the head teachers, however, observed the role that teachers’ personal interest in music or choral activities played on their success. None cited budgetary constraints as an impediment to role fulfilment.</p>
<p>All the teachers in the sample were assigned choir training. This was to be expected as they were purposively sampled from music festival participants. Of the secondary school teachers, where music is a taught subject, 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) taught music in class and some had additional responsibilities. All the primary school music teachers in the sample reported that they were generally seen as choir trainers (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761412437818">Appendix 1</xref>, teachers’ question 5). This is also the role that they reported to be comfortable performing (question 9a). One respondent indicated the love of making music as his reason for being comfortable with this role. ‘Music is fun and when people sing, it makes them happy’, with another saying, ‘I like to see the students learn new songs and they sing well. It also keeps them occupied so that they don’t get into bad behaviour or waste time’.</p>
<p>In response to question 5 ‘What is expected of you as a music teacher?’, all the music teachers in the sample reported that they were expected to be composers and teachers of singing and playing instruments over and above choir trainers. Four of the secondary school teachers reported being expected to ‘conduct research and get information to teach’, thereby taking on the additional role of resource mobilizer. In response to question 8, ‘How do you think the music teacher is perceived in your institution?’, they all reported feeling that they were considered valuable in their work stations, selecting ‘An indispensable member/very valuable’ as their response.</p>
<p>In terms of skills, they were expected to be musically literate, selecting ‘Ability to read and write music’ as their response to what makes a good music teacher. Their responses seem to indicate their belief that a good music teacher was one with music literacy and creativity skills, who displays the ability to train performers. None of the primary school respondents selected ‘Ability to play instruments’ as an attribute of a good music teacher. None of these teachers indicated that performance skills were necessary attributes of a good music teacher.</p>

<title>Perception and expectation of teacher education</title>
<p>The head teachers in the study were unanimous that the training that music teachers received was not appropriate for teachers to manage the school music programme. They all selected ‘NO’ in response to the question (10) ‘Is the training offered to teachers of music appropriate for their expected role?’. They were of the opinion that professional academic training for music teachers was desired even for the primary school where there is limited music content in the curriculum. In elaborating this response, one respondent cited the need for literacy skills to facilitate musicianship and ability ‘to teach the set pieces’. Another (who may have taught music at some point) suggested that music being a skill ‘requires professional training if one is to be successful in teaching it’.</p>
<p>Part of the reason given for stating that training is not adequate was linked to the content and duration of teacher education. Respondents noted that the music teacher education curriculum was ‘too short’ and ‘too theoretical’. The head teachers advocated for a longer, more intense training programme, and more practical work as a way of responding to many teachers’ discomfort with performance. These were unanimous statements, expressed in a variety of terms including ‘the training should be longer’ and ‘. . . make practicals compulsory . . . ’</p>
<p>None of the music teachers sampled fully endorsed the education they received. The primary school teachers (with certificate level of training) asserted that the training they received was inadequate, using ‘shallow’, ‘hurried’ and ‘without depth’ to clarify their points. The secondary school teachers lamented the ‘heavily theoretical’ nature of their curriculum. All the teachers found their education barely useful for the job demands, which included participation in the music festival, describing it as being deficient in practical music. Though primary and secondary school teachers concurred that training was necessary for knowledge acquisition and skill development that motivate and boost morale and confidence, primary school teacher respondents did not articulate specific curriculum expectations. Their secondary school counterparts highlighted the need for practical music making, music literacy, composition and analytical skills development as areas needing emphasis. These are components of the secondary school music curriculum they are expected to teach. The respondents’ opinion of existing and expected provisions for music teacher education are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761412437818">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Perceived role and expectations of the music teacher</title>
<p>The aforementioned practising teachers’ statements indicate a belief that a good teacher is musically literate, backed by high academic training with composition and choral training abilities. However, only 20% of them considered music performance key in the definition of a good teacher. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761412437818">Wanjala (1991)</xref> pointed at co-curricular activities as an important avenue through which pupils learn music. The teacher’s familiarity with diverse types of music makes him/her more successful in curriculum delivery, because the music lesson is made interesting and enjoyable, especially through the use of music instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 1991</xref>). The teacher would need to generate this music for successful teaching and would require a level of performance proficiency. It is intriguing that such few teachers endorsed this. This confirms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi’s (2000)</xref> discovery that this is an area of neglect in teacher education, and so its potential and role in facilitating learning is unknown to the teachers.</p>
<p>This position has far-reaching implications for the development of musicians. If 80% of the teachers in the study are not certain that ability to play an instrument is beneficial to a teacher, one can only speculate as to what learning activities they provide for their pupils. This goes to confirm that the theoretical teaching lamented earlier is still prevalent.</p>
<p>It is evident that the role of the teacher is to facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761412437818">Brownlee et al., 2003</xref>). From indigenous African practice as witnessed in Kenya, the concept of ‘teacher’ is one who guides or steers the learning process by moulding the learner into a productive individual. A learned person is expected to provide solutions, and exerts influence over his/her surroundings. The responses here indicate that teachers in the sample expected their role to remain at facilitating quantitative learning. This affects the expected learning outcomes, and reflects the teachers’ aims of the teaching endeavour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761412437818">Brownlee et al.’s (2003</xref>, p. 117) hierarchy of learning outcomes is presented as:</p>
<list id="list5-0255761412437818" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Changed views – result of changed nature;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being open to further learning – appreciates that, since truth is constructed, it is not absolute;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being able to understand – make connection with other knowledge, make meaning of information;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being able to explain – a level of confidence (and comfort with the discipline’s concepts and processes);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changed behaviour – through use of information;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being able to recall and apply – test of memory, and use of information in some context.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The participating teachers in this study appear to expect their role to remain at the lowest level of this hierarchy (being able to recall and apply). This is equivalent to quantitative learning with reproductive knowledge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761412437818">Figure 2</xref>). Such limited expectation does not move one to aspire for greater achievement. The motivation cycle is barely functional in this regard. This study’s ideal, adapted from the indigenous African (Kenyan) principles of education for social responsibility, is to move beyond the ‘changed views’ in the hierarchy, which is qualitative learning with transformative knowledge. It requires learners’ active engagement with situations as an outcome of education.</p>
<p>Though the cited researchers have faulted the theoretical nature of teaching in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>), there has been little interrogation of the principles upon which music education has been built. Future research can investigate the conceptual orientation that forms the basis of learning and, subsequently, how teachers appreciate this to build a friendly and usable opinion of the role of the teacher.</p>
<p>The progression of learning hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761412437818">Figure 2</xref>) is a useful tool in planning for learning in teacher education. It points to developmental processes within the education programme. When teaching and learning are based on that format, the processes in place enhance participation in learning experiences that facilitate growth. A teacher thus prepared understands his/her role as that of similarly facilitating growth for learners.</p>

<title>Perceptions and expectations of teacher education</title>
<p>The third objective of this article focuses on the perceptions of teacher education, with input on expectations of the same for a successful music education programme. Both school heads and music teachers in the study agreed on the necessity for a professional level of training for teachers of music. Both found the training offered theoretical at the expense of practical music making at diploma and degree levels. At certificate level, the teachers in the study found the content ‘shallow’, an indication that not many concepts were covered in the syllabus. Though the objective of teacher education is to provide teachers for the various levels of learning, it appears from the survey responses that there is no articulation of the graduates’ (teachers) expected levels of proficiency in and engagement with the discipline (music). Furthermore, the responses indicate a perception that the music teacher education programmes do not attempt to develop practising musicians. National policy makers must consider whether it is sufficient to equip student teachers with skills for instruction at the expense of knowledge of the discipline content.</p>
<p>The sampled primary school teachers’ failure to articulate specific curriculum expectations may reflect a lack of knowledge of what music education entails, and hence what music learning and teaching involve. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761412437818">Wiggins (2007</xref>, p. 36) explained teaching as ‘ . . . a process of designing experiences and providing support for learners as they actively and interactively engage in those experiences’. In music, those experiences are the processes of music ‘performing, listening and creating . . . authentic music practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761412437818">Wiggins, 2007</xref>, p. 38). If teachers are to behave musically, their education needs to give them skills that will enable them to derive meaning from music experiences. It will enable them to create environments and provide experiences for learners to engage with knowledge that will facilitate musical understanding.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761412437818">Wanjala (1991)</xref> asserted that teachers’ attitude to and mastery of the subject of their discipline were vital in ensuring the success of music education. The academic qualifications, number of tutors in the institution and number of years of teaching experience of these tutors were expected to impact service delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi (2000)</xref> acknowledged that 64.3% of TTC tutors had difficulty in demonstrating instrumental playing and singing skills. This transfers directly to the same percentage of students in Mwangi’s study rating music performance as the difficult topic. It further justifies this study’s head teachers’ call for practical performance to be made compulsory in teacher education. This weakness in music making can be linked to the source of training. If practical music making is not well taught, the graduates may ignore its role in defining a music teacher. The ‘poor utilization of the available instructional resources . . . [paints a] gloomy picture of the quality [of] music taught’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>, p. 124). Mwangi concluded that ‘the music knowledge the students gained . . . was not adequate to enable them understand the music concepts’(p. 125). This translates into a workforce that cannot do justice to music as a subject.</p>
<p>One of the roles of the music teacher is to impart aesthetic sensitivity to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761412437818">Andang’o, 2000</xref>). This may be achieved through training in music performance. The focus of such learning is to develop skills of expression and interpretation achieved through mastery of the instrument and technical development. For this the study of and exposure to a large and diverse repertoire of music is vital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761412437818">Andang’o (2000</xref>, p. 15) referred to this as ‘a process that empowers one to produce a free and beautiful tone’. This is important because music performance provides a musical experience, which can serve as the catalyst to music learning. It would seem that an educator who is a ‘musician’ might best facilitate this. Yet it is not possible to vouch for the teacher educators’ musicianship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>). This incomplete training creates a weak link in the motivation cycle, compromising the success of teaching.</p>
<p>The motivation cycle finds a weak link at <italic>practice</italic> in this study objective. Teachers’ actions are not a true reflection of the expected behaviour of the music teacher. The teachers do not have a practical understanding of music concepts that leads to ‘a satisfactory level of musicianship which can enable them to be labelled “musician”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761412437818">Mwangi, 2000</xref>, p. 126). They fall short of this study’s conceptual description of a music teacher, where the music teacher is primarily a musician.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761412437818">Chokera (2005)</xref> emphasized the need for an internal, personal commitment from student teachers. He called for a serious consideration of music education as a profession, with student teachers convinced of the place of music in the curriculum and their role in facilitating learning. His disclosure that many student teachers had no personally held principles or beliefs that anchored their study of music explains practising teachers’ lack of involvement in music activities outside the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761412437818">Chokera’s (2005)</xref> findings shed light onto the personal factors that determine teacher effectiveness, their attempts and activities towards personal advancement in the discipline, the propagation of the subject and their desire to make students understand, like and learn their subject. This personal interest is a vital link in the motivation cycle that leads to success in music teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0255761412437818">
<title>Towards an effective teacher education programme</title>
<p>The fourth objective of this article is to propose an improved framework to guide teacher education for music in Kenya. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761412437818">Wiggins (2007)</xref> underscored the value of a quality learning programme and an effective teacher in the learning process. The curriculum should enable learners to synthesize what is learnt into a level of musical understanding and proficiency appropriate for someone entering the field as a professional musician. As for the music teacher, he/she needs to be adept at analysis, evaluation and application of music ideas, and initiation of music activities. This means that music education courses need to be taught in a way that is connected to both music practice and learning process.</p>
<p>The responses in this study indicated primary teachers’ inability to articulate what should be an appropriate education programme or process to prepare teachers for music. From the preliminary literature review, it emerged that two components of the motivation cycle were weak in the teacher education practice in Kenya. The weakness in training, upon which the learning process appears to be anchored, compromises practice. The music teachers in the study confirmed this weakness in their failure to include music performance among traits that define a ‘good teacher’. This means that their ‘practice’ in teaching is not balanced or supported by ‘practice’ in/of the discipline – that is, music making or performance. Without adequate practice, there is dismal performance of duties, hence feeble achievement.</p>
<p>That the best musicians will be music teachers is an ideal of indigenous African education that puts the value of education in perspective. A well-articulated principle needs to anchor the theory and practice of teacher education for this and other ideals to be met. A merger between apprenticeship and reflection which characterize the oral tradition of indigenous Kenyan music practices, and the contemporary approach to formal education that is also practised in Kenya, should provide sufficient anchorage for the design of teacher education. In apprenticeship, on the one hand, learning proceeds from participation in social practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761412437818">Cain, 2007</xref>, p. 282). These social practices in music are the processes of music creation, performance and listening. Indigenous music training involves learners in these behaviours at various levels of proficiency, in the company of better accomplished performers who provide models to copy. This is the way indigenous music is learnt to date in Kenyan schools. Reflection, on the other hand, engages learners in consideration of what they are learning, so that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761412437818">Brownlee et al.’s (2003)</xref> transformative knowledge characterizes learning. Teacher education benefits from this when learners dig into the information received and construct meaning out of it. The knowledge is beneficial for a teacher in as far as it can be used to facilitate learning. At the next level, creative knowledge should enable the teacher to use the meaning acquired from the provided information, to generate solutions through a learning situation with well-articulated expectations and outcomes.</p>
<p>The principle approach advocated by this article is therefore a move towards constructivist learning. Since constructivism is grounded in a ‘belief that knowledge is a human construct . . . that we can only know the world though the lens of our own experience – physical and sociocultural’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761412437818">Wiggins, 2007</xref>, pp. 38–39), it provides the bridge between the indigenous African system and formal educational practices, the two traditions that shape (music) education in Kenya.</p>
<p>In outlining a framework for teacher education, the first step is to articulate what tasks will be required of teacher education. This article endorses the central goal of teacher education to be the development in student teachers of a basic teaching competence that will equip them for performance in the music teaching profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761412437818">Brouwer &amp; Korthagen, 2005</xref>). The Ministry of Education articulates the curriculum requirements for the primary and secondary school levels in Kenya. Since this is the playing field for the music teacher, these requirements need to be part of the content of teacher education study. An understanding of this environment should help facilitate equipping teachers to operate in it.</p>
<p>For music, the playing field is characterized by the use of sound to impart knowledge – at reproductive, transformative and creative levels. The apprenticeship model leads to the development of one like the mentor. The teacher’s role is to facilitate the development of a musician. This requires the teacher to know and exhibit music behaviour. Music behaviour requires music knowledge at reproductive, transformative and creative levels. The role also requires the ability to teach based on a clear concept of what teaching is, the capacity to reflect on one’s belief within the context of their occupation and a potential to develop further during teaching service, an ingredient scarcely recorded in Kenyan research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761412437818">Wanjala, 2004</xref>). This is innovative competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761412437818">Brouwer &amp; Korthagen, 2005</xref>, p. 158) that forges integration between learnt theory and expected practice. If educators are to ‘go beyond transmitting and having pupils reproduce what is in the standard textbook’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761412437818">Brouwer &amp; Korthagen, 2005</xref>, p. 162), they should have a knowledge structure of the discipline and the capacity to select, structure and present learning content in forms that are learnable by the pupils they teach. The music teacher should be a musician and a teacher.</p>
<p>The format of teacher education for such an endeavour needs to mix practical experience with theoretical reflection. The music teacher will be an informed practitioner – knowledgeable in music and competent in transmitting knowledge (and skills). The teacher education programme will facilitate theoretical knowledge acquisition, with the content and processes of teaching, before sending learners out into the classroom to practice. After practice, there is also need to spend time on reflection, so that the relationship between practice and theory is interrogated and any discrepancies negotiated.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the approach best suited for this is cyclical programming, where learning (teacher education) is followed by teaching experience (student teaching), in a cycle that has a determined objective and duration. This gives immediate space to reflect on practice; interrogate related theory; develop practice vis-à-vis learnt theory; etcetera. This is the format currently employed at teacher training colleges for primary school teachers, but not at university level for bachelor of education graduate teachers in Kenya. In the latter, student teachers go for a one-off teaching practice session at the end of their study programme. There is no time to regroup or examine the experience-based questions or challenges in the presence of a mentor and guide. This denies learners the opportunity to formulate concrete personal teaching strategies based on information and practice prior to formal engagement as a teacher.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article concludes that music education in Kenya could benefit from a music teacher education that is guided by clearly articulated education principles. In this case, the best principle will be one that addresses the role of the music teacher, recorded in this study as practitioner-pedagogue. At philosophical level, the creative knowledge orientation for teacher education will marry the demands of indigenous African practice and formal education designs that are currently at play in music education in Kenya. In practice, expressive learning will enable the student teacher to accumulate knowledge and skills in music, construct meaning out of these and use them creatively to develop solutions for the challenges of the music classroom. Teacher education will take a cyclic format, where sessions of content learning are followed by sessions of teaching practice. This should ensure musician-teachers for the music programmes in the institutions of learning in Kenya.</p>
<p>This article recognizes that several pertinent issues have been raised by the study but are not addressed. There is scope for further study to determine, among others, the conceptual orientation and principles upon which music education is built at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education in Kenya. This will throw more light onto how these perceptions and expectations of a music teacher have been developed, and how they can be negotiated for a successful music education programme in the country.</p>

<title>Head teachers’ questionnaire</title>
<p>Dear head teacher,</p>
<p>Let me start by thanking you sincerely for the time for the time you have spared to assist me in gathering information about music education in Kenya.</p>
<p>Second, it is hoped that your observations and suggestions will go a long way in making music a vital tool for the education of the Kenyan child. The purpose of this study is to establish perceptions of education providers and administering on music teacher education. I beg that you honestly respond to the issues raised and that you feel free to add others or that you may find appropriate.</p>
<p>Thirdly, may I assure you that this is a purely academic exercise whose outcome will hopefully build policy and practice in Kenya, and not an evaluation of yourself or your institution.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<title>Perceptions et réflexions sur la formation du professeur de musique au Kenya</title>
<p>Cet article s’appuie sur l’enquête qui visait découvrir les perceptions et les attentes des professeurs de musique du Kenya; leur vision de la formation qu’ils ont reçue; les perceptions et les attentes des directeurs quant au rôle du professeur de musique, et les attentes des professeurs de musique et des directeurs d’un programme d’éducation musicale pour l’enseignant de musique au Kenya. Les résultats ont dirigé une discussion vers des suggestions pour un meilleur cadre pour guider la formation des enseignants pour la musique à tous les niveaux de l’éducation au Kenya.</p>
<p>Grâce à des questionnaires, un échantillon de 16 professeurs de musique et 11 directeurs ont enregistré leur opinion que les enseignants n’étaient pas suffisamment préparés à mettre en œuvre les programmes de musique, que le rôle du professeur de musique comprenait des activités dans et hors de la classe, et que cette attente ne pouvait être accomplie qu’avec une formation académique et professionnelle appropriée. Guidé par les principes de l’éducation africaine indigène et des orientations d’apprentissage conceptuelles, les discussions ont abouti à des recommandations qui appellent à une meilleure formation de base des professeurs de musique dans le processus de la musique et de capacitation pour faciliter l’apprentissage de la musique.</p>

<title>Percepciones y Reflexiones sobre la Formación del Profesorado de Música en Kenia</title>
<p>Este artículo se basa en una investigación dirigida a descubrir las percepciones y expectativas del profesorado de música en Kenia sobre su función: su opinión sobre la formación recibida; las percepciones y expectativas de los directores escolares sobre el papel del docente de música; y las expectativas tanto de los maestros de música como de los directores sobre el plan de estudios de formación del profesorado de música en Kenia. Los datos llevaron a un debate hacia la mejora de una estructura que oriente la formación del profesorado de música en Kenia a todos los niveles educativos.</p>
<p>Mediante cuestionarios, a partir de una muestra de 16 docentes de música y 11 directores se recogió su opinión acerca de: los maestros, a los que no se les consideraba preparados adecuadamente para desarrollar programas educativos musicales; la función del docente de música, que habría de cubrir actividades escolares y extraescolares; y que esta expectativa sólo podía conseguirse mediante un formación profesional y académica adecuada. Siguiendo los principios de la educación africana indígena y las orientaciones conceptuales del aprendizaje, los debates llevaron a recomendar una mejor base de los procesos musicales por parte de los docentes de música y de la capacidad para facilitar el aprendizaje musical.</p>
