<title>‘Pious Passengers’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2230807512459408">1</xref></sup> and Pestilential Voyages</title>
<p>It is common knowledge but needs to be reiterated that, unlike Hinduism, Islam in South Asia has a stronger international dimension, qualitatively very different from ancient Buddhism and the younger Sikhism, and therefore, the Muslim community ‘should be studied to be sure, but it cannot be investigated in isolation from its links with other Muslim areas, and especially with the holy cities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2230807512459408">2</xref></sup> In this context, Haj becomes an important enduring link. Haj in the times of cholera can be even more illuminating in capturing many hitherto unknown aspects of this sacred journeying to Mecca.</p>
<p>In the study of trade and maritime history in the Indian Ocean, ‘passenger traffic’ has been largely neglected. The faithful, journeying for spiritual ends were also prone to vagaries of disease and pestilence. This brings to the fore the temporal–medical dimension of the otherwise spiritual journey. While retrieving the forgotten story of this recurrent voyage, Mishra has privileged the medical dimension to study the Haj from the Indian subcontinent focusing on the period of 1860 to 1920, its ramifications on South Asian politics and its interlinkages to the imperial context and considerations. This book is an extension of the area of Haj studies, particularly pertaining to South Asian pilgrims and pilgrimages. It situates the medical dimensions of the global ravages which cholera occasioned and the public health policy debates it fostered both in the colony and in the metropole. Mishra’s work reinforces M.N. Pearson’s observation that ‘[I]n terms both of Indian Ocean history, and more importantly in terms of the history of the Islamic world, the Hajj is a vital subject of study’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2230807512459408">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Haj is a divine journey par excellence, an act of piety and devotion, a journey to identify with the acts and deeds of the prophet Mohammad, an affirmation and assertion of Muslim brotherhood and fraternity. ‘For over 1300 years Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca has been one of the great events of world history.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2230807512459408">4</xref></sup> With today’s improved and speedy means of communication, the phenomenon and event of Haj has become an annual spectacle par excellence; a journey ‘<italic>dayare nabi ke janib</italic>’, rupturing the regional, national and linguistic identities, Haj is a call towards the convergence to Mecca. ‘Mecca is closed to all but the faithful.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2230807512459408">5</xref></sup> In this sense, Mecca is an exclusive site and, therefore, the relationship between Haj and the percentage of Muslims in South Asia is too significant and central economically, politically, religiously and more particularly medically to be ignored. Haj was an overarching religious congregation primarily undertaken due to religious motivations. It was also a great event for the sanitarians in an age of pestilence with great number of bodies moving and rubbing together as carriers and disseminators of germs causing diseases and provoking pestilence. Cholera was an important marker of the pestilentiality of the period. Though Haj studies emerged in late 1970s, through the choleraic contexts of Haj from 1860 to 1920 the author has added many new dimensions to it. Here the politics of piety and pestilence overlap and their interlinkages have been explicated by hinting at their international contexts and their combined impact on colonial policies in India.</p>
<p>Seen from this vantage point, one of the important aspects of the second half of the nineteenth century was ‘the rise of public health and sanitary administration in several parts of the world, as a result of which the idea of disease importation and spread of contagion came to be more widely discussed. This led to a greater focus on Indian pilgrims to Mecca’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2230807512459408">6</xref></sup> As India was the endemic site for cholera, South Asian Muslims ‘were seen as the chief carriers of cholera to Arabia, from where the disease was believed to subsequently spread into European territories’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2230807512459408">7</xref></sup> The huge mortality rates caused by cholera in 1868 at Mecca gradually led to ‘[the] “medicalization” of the pilgrimage in European eyes, so that it no longer remained a subject of exclusively religious interest. As a result, the Hejaz region was forced to tolerate the intrusion of European medical regulations and acts, its holy places pulled into a grid of sanitary rules.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2230807512459408">8</xref></sup> Quarantine became synonymous with surveillance. Among various factors impacting the nature and organisation of Haj, Mishra by privileging the missing medical dimension of Haj invites us to further deepen our understanding of how its transformation was contextualised by the politics of public health in the prevailing choleraic context.</p>
<p>For the author, cholera is synonymous and symptomatic with the pestilentiality of the nineteenth century. The entire gamut of rules, regulations and sanitary apparatus which was visualised, acted and implemented as a response to the choleraic context of Arabia by European countries is clearly demonstrated by the mass of evidence produced by the author, but almost in a self-contradictory vein he seems to connote that ‘the hypothesis proposing a strong link between cholera and public health reforms needs to be challenged’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2230807512459408">9</xref></sup> Mishra himself privileges cholera in contexualising his book but half-heartedly seems to accept the need to challenge the strong link between cholera and public health reforms both in India and in Europe.</p>
<p>In an era of global steamship navigation and the rapid expansion of railways in the Indian subcontinent, interestingly, the pious pursuit of Haj witnessed hitherto unknown impediments and restrictions as cholera acquired newer contexts to prove fatal. It is precisely in this era marked by the proliferation of print culture that both the desire for pious pursuit and the actual number and frequency of Hajis and Haj increases and the experiences of the realised pursuit is extensively documented and articulated through the ‘emergence of a whole genre of travelogues’ pertaining to it. Precisely banking on this literature of travelogues and with the simultaneous reading of documents pertaining to the politics of public health, both colonial and international, Mishra probes and explicates the impediments to the ‘fruitful journey’ towards Mecca, to ‘arrive at larger conclusions about colonial perceptions of Islam and Muslims’. Needless to say, these colonial perceptions re-echoed in and during the politics of competing identities and ideologies of the twentieth century in various ways.</p>
<p>With greater British and European involvement in Islamic lands, and with the emergence of Haj as a powerful unifying symbol for Muslims in the constantly changing and reconfiguring world politics, the colonial policy makers of India vested Indian Muslims ‘with various traits, predispositions and allegiances, nearly all of which were based on long-standing Orientalist assumptions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2230807512459408">10</xref></sup> The notion of timelessness of Haj was one of those Orientalist–traditionalist assumptions. Mishra challenges this ‘timelessness’ accorded to Haj as he clearly shows how essentialisation premised on Orientalist assumptions went on to cast the phenomenon of Haj in a mould in which Haj not only acted as a metaphor of inclusive brotherhood of Islam but also served as a metaphor for the Muslim community’s propensity for cross-national allegiances, thereby attributing to them the inherent vice of disloyalty, which further acted as a proof of their insularity and fanaticism. The perception of Haj and politics of essentialisation in the colonial context were entwined. The contours of changing politics in South Asia along with power realignment in Europe also brought a ‘change in the nature, organization, and meanings of the pilgrimage’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2230807512459408">11</xref></sup> For Mishra, the changing nature and meaning of Haj is amply attested and reflected in the nature of travelogues written by pilgrims themselves during the period under study.</p>
<p>The linkage between the growing popularity of Haj, the fate of Turkey and the Caliphate, allows us to understand the manoeuvrings of western imperialist powers in the context of their endeavour to control the crescent. The impact of all these and their intimate linkages and role in the identity formation of Muslims in South Asia allows us to understand the context in which pan-Islamism was anti-imperialist and anti-west. That this pan-Islamism and anti-imperialism was sometimes burdened with strong revivalist pulls is captured in a comprehensive way by the author. This comprehension sheds fresh light on the various interpenetrative ways in which the anti-imperialist slant and orientation of pan-Islamism in the colonial Indian context fed Indian nationalism. The strong tinge of revivalism within pan-Islamism was also to fracture nationalism in many ways, and it further fuelled and strengthened the ongoing colonial essentialisation of the Muslim community and the appropriation of such rhetoric by right wing nationalist camp.</p>
<p>Moreover, the depiction of the changing ways in which the reconfiguration and re-articulation of Muslim identity took shape could have been more insightful and meaningful if the divine movement towards Mecca was further juxtaposed with the phenomenon of visitations to influential Sufi centres during Urs. After all, these were lesser cradles of Islam where not only Muslims but adherents of other faiths were welcomed and accommodated. If this aspect of internal pilgrimage had been captured coeval to the Haj phenomenon, perhaps a more complex and comprehensive, if not complete, picture could have emerged. Mishra has also presented the missionary perception of Haj, Mecca and Arabia and the way they saw the popularity of Haj as a recurring impediment to their efforts to seek converts. He further juxtaposes the missionary perception with the pilgrims’ own enriching and energising experience and articulation of their faith. In this sense, the book also compels us to ponder on the torturous and faltering journey through which we have today reached a stage when inter-faith dialogue is at least possible.</p>
<p>One of the nagging shortcomings of this book, especially for readers unfamiliar with its theme, is the missing map of the routes through which South Asia’s ‘pious passengers’, braved all travails and tribulations to finally stand before the Kaaba. The nuances of the journey, both in its socio-economic and medical dimensions have been captured in great detail, but the absence of a map as an aid leaves the helpless reader bewildered and crippled. The book has been rendered in a picturesque, fluid and transparent language. Concomitant with the theme of Haj and Hajis, Mishra writes with literary flourish though sadly on many pages poor copyediting has left its mark.</p>
