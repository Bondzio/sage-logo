<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820613497311">Rob Kitchin and Martin Dodge’s (2011)</xref> <italic>Code/Space</italic> has been rightly fêted in a number of reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613497311">Adey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2043820613497311">Wilson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2043820613497311">Zook, 2012</xref>) and with the Association of American Geographers’ Meridian Award for outstanding scholarly work in Geography in 2011. <italic>Code/Space</italic> offers a future-oriented glossary for the understanding and description of the, increasingly technical, ongoing reconfiguration of everyday life. Building from a longstanding and prolific writing partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613497311">Dodge and Kitchin, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613497311">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613497311">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613497311">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820613497311">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613497311">2009</xref>), in the book, Kitchin and Dodge offer an accomplished engagement with code and software via geographical sensibilities, describing a range of examples of the ways in which software is integral within and modulates the spacings and places of (largely Western capitalist) everyday life. <italic>Code/Space</italic> not only offers a rigorously argued conceptual framework for understanding software in everyday life but also hones this framework through case studies concerning air travel, the home and consumption. In the final, ardent and more speculative section of the book, the authors augment their theoretical framework with the speculative ruminations of urbanist Adam Greenfield in the guise of ‘everyware’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820613497311">Greenfield, 2006</xref>), the proposition of ubiquitous computation embedded into the fabric of the everyday urban environment. To conclude, Kitchin and Dodge offer a manifesto for the emerging discourse and disciplinary context of ‘software studies’ that insists on an ontogenetic understanding of the capacities of code. Thus, <italic>Code/Space</italic> is a valuable work for two reasons. First, it elaborates a useful and very clear conceptual framework, drawing on contemporary philosophies of technology. Second, and importantly, it brings into conversation a range of important work concerning digital technology that has previously been somewhat distant: geographers concerned with the automatic production of space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820613497311">Graham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820613497311">Thrift and French, 2002</xref>), computer scientists studying human-computer interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820613497311">Dourish, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613497311">Dourish and Bell, 2011</xref>) and humanities scholars critically reflecting on computation and software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613497311">Berry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820613497311">Fuller, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820613497311">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820613497311">Manovich, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Software code, in the terms of <italic>Code/Space</italic>, is the exemplar of the human ability not only to produce other entities and forms of spatial experience but more significantly to create things that in themselves produce space that are <italic>ontogenetic</italic>. The agency of software must be understood, following the book, in its quasi-generative properties, accomplished through code, which are called by Kitchin and Dodge ‘secondary agency’ (p. 5), following Adrian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820613497311">Mackenzie (2006</xref>: 8). Code, in Kitchin and Dodge’s terms, is both a process and a product, both a means of systematically calculating the world and an operation grammar for action, or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2043820613497311">Thrift (2008)</xref> has it elsewhere, ‘worlding’. To account for this capacity, <italic>Code/Space</italic> offers a taxonomy of coded entities: coded objects, infrastructures, processes and assemblages (pp. 5–7). Kitchin and Dodge thus arrive at the distinction between ‘coded spaces’ and ‘code/space’. Whereas there are many examples of software and code augmenting the production of space, which the authors call ‘coded spaces’, there are increasing examples of the modulation of and making anew of spatial experience through code, which are ‘code/spaces’. Building from space, conceptualised (between pp. 66 and 71) as ‘constantly bought into being as an incomplete solution to an ongoing relational problem’ (p. 71), Kitchin and Dodge offer an account of forms of space that are co-constituted with software, because code ‘modulates the conditions through which space is beckoned into being’ (p. 71). It is this reiterative and transformative modulation that forms one of the central theoretical tenets of <italic>Code/Space</italic>—conceptualised as ‘transduction’.</p>
<p>The conceptualisation of ‘code/space’ and the account of ‘transduction’ are the foremost of a number of significant contributions that Kitchin and Dodge make in this book. Indeed, the former is arguably a particular empirical category of the latter. <italic>Code/Space</italic> is accordingly something of a watershed moment, for geography, in the operationalisation of the work of the philosopher Gilbert Simondon. A significant influence on the work of Gilles Deleuze, Bruno Latour, Brian Massumi and Bernard Stiegler, amongst others, Simondon was a philosopher of technology, or more accurately of the human–technology relation in terms of ‘technogenesis’. The theory of technogenesis offered by a range of anthropologists and philosophers is the idea that humans and technology co-evolved together, that you do not get one without the other. It is this form of human–technology relation that is being described when we consider the processes of transduction described by Kitchin and Dodge, themselves drawing the concept from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820613497311">Mackenzie (2002)</xref> who translates it from Simondon. Transduction, in Simondon’s terms, decentres the human, it is<disp-quote>
<p>a procedure of the mind as it discovers … [that] consists in <italic>following being in its genesis</italic>, in carrying out the genesis of thought at the same time as the genesis of the object is carried out. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820613497311">Simondon, 2005</xref>: 34; translated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613497311">Combes, 2013</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In offering a Simondonian analysis of software and everyday life, <italic>Code/Space</italic> strikes directly at the heart of the question of what it means to be human in an age of a perceived increase in technological agency. The account of the human here is not one of the miraculous separations from nature or from technology, but of imbrication and becoming with a wealth of other entities. This is not a deterministic relation, for the authors, precisely because:<disp-quote>
<p>The nature and transduction of code/space is then never fixed, shifting with place, time and context (social, political and economic relations and situations). Code/spaces are relational, emergent, and peopled. (p. 75)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As Kitchin and Dodge suggest (pp. 71–73), in the formation of code/spaces and the encoding of parts of everyday life, we are negotiating the ongoing reformulation of what it is to be human. Indeed, this resonates with the account of technogenesis that is firmly established in other disciplinary contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820613497311">Hansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820613497311">Hayles, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820613497311">Stiegler, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820613497311">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820613497311">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>While the major theoretical contribution of the book is the work the authors offer in synthesising Mackenzie and Simondon’s accounts of transduction, a substantial portion of the book is given over to case studies of how code/spaces and transduction through software emerge in everyday life. Chapters seven to nine provide three case studies of air travel, the home and consumption. Those familiar with the prolific output of this writing partnership will readily recognise some of the content of these chapters, particularly Chapter seven on air travel, although the detail has been updated. Equally, the analysis has been translated into the new lexicon put forward by the book, which works to the extent that the project here is clearly to advance a form of ‘software studies’, although it could prove bewildering to some (there is a helpful glossary at the back). These empirically based analyses draw out something like a dialectic of software, with its potential to both empower and control, which the authors carefully unpick with a distinctly Foucauldian sensibility. Genealogies of the various assemblages of actors and discursive regimes in which code/spaces consist are critically discussed to demonstrate how and where labour, power and values are variously located. In the penultimate chapter, the analysis takes a distinctly speculative direction in considering future code/space in the guise of the ‘everyware’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820613497311">Greenfield, 2006</xref>) of ubiquitous computing, a long-held aim for computation embedded into the fabric of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820613497311">Weiser, 1991</xref>). Kitchin and Dodge entertain a significant range of speculations about a world of ‘everyware’, from enthusiasm for a prospective empowerment of citizens (pp. 225–228) to opposition of an increased securitisation (pp. 228–230) through ‘sousveillance’ (pp. 230–233). However, despite a well argued and impartial discussion of these themes, there remains a tacit acceptance of these visions of ‘everyware’ without much critical reflection upon the source and reasoning behind the speculation. The ‘powerful discursive regime’ (p. 224) that the authors rightly argue supports the embedding of software into everyday life and can further support the implementation of ‘everyware’ must also be recognised to include speculative discourse (addressed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820613497311">Kinsley, 2012</xref>). Thus, there remains cause for further critical reflection upon such governmentalised representations of the uses of computation.</p>
<p>
<italic>Code/Space</italic> offers a wealth of examples, albeit mostly Western and from the global North, of the transformations of everyday life through the transductive capacities of software and code. It is not only a snapshot of contemporary technogenesis with and through computation, and a critical response to such observations, but also a rallying cry for further critical research, in the shape of the concluding manifesto for software studies. Many geographers may ignore or skim the concluding manifesto, focusing instead on the case studies of Chapters seven to nine. However, in many ways, it is in the concluding chapter that we find Kitchin and Dodge’s challenge to geography. The digital is the latest significant step in the processes of the descretisation of knowledge and memory external to the body, as the philosopher Bernard Stiegler forcefully shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820613497311">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2043820613497311">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820613497311">2012</xref>), and code is precisely its ontogenetic vanguard. Following Stiegler, to study code and software, is to study the latest stage in the spatialisation of time-based forms. To transform the temporal flow of speech and gesture into discrete forms, such as text and mechanical movements, makes them <italic>spatial</italic> objects: they are constituted in various material forms (from sheets of paper to silicon chips). The transductive power of code can accordingly be understood as the latest phase in the process of what Stiegler, following the linguist Sylvan Auroux, calls ‘grammatisation’, which describes<disp-quote>
<p>all technical processes that enable behavioural fluxes or flows to be made discrete… and to be reproduced, those behavioural flows through which are expressed or imprinted the experiences of human beings (speaking, working, perceiving, interacting and so on). If grammatisation is understood in this way, then the digital is the most recent stage of grammatisation, a stage in which all behavioural models can now be grammatised and integrated through a planetary-wide industry of the production, collection, exploitation and distribution of digital traces. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820613497311">Stiegler, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Software code is thus the ‘grammar’ of an increasing range of objects and activities of everyday life. Read through Stiegler then, <italic>Code/Space</italic> issues a formidable challenge. Kitchin and Dodge invite us to study (and offer the analytical tools to do so) the ongoing, and increasingly automated, spatialisation of knowledge and the forms of space they reciprocally produce.</p>
