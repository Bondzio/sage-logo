<sec id="sec3-1741134312456694" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic>, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the counterclaim provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act permitted a defendant to assert a counterclaim seeking an order that a use code identified by a brand manufacturer to the FDA be changed. Thus, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which was the subject of an October 2010 case report in this Journal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741134312456694">1</xref></sup> The current case report addresses the Supreme Court’s decision and the briefs of the parties and amici, which led to that decision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741134312456694"><title>Background – The Federal Circuit</title>
<p>In its decision, the Federal Circuit addressed the statutory construction of 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(C)(ii), which states, in part, that “the [ANDA] applicant may assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder under subsection (b) or (c) of this section on the ground that the patent does not claim … (bb) <italic>an</italic> approved method of using the drug.” (emphasis added). Specifically, the Federal Circuit stated that it “detect[ed] no ambiguity in the statutory language. When an indefinite article is preceded and qualified by a negative, standard grammar generally provides that ‘a’ means ‘any.’ … Therefore, the Hatch-Waxman Act authorizes a [§ 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)] counterclaim only if the listed patent does not claim <italic>any</italic> approved methods of using the listed drug.” <italic>Novo Nordisk A/S et al. v. Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd., et al.</italic>, 601 F.3d 1359, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (emphasis added). The Federal Circuit also noted that “the terms of the [§ 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)] counterclaim provision do not authorize an order compelling the patent holder to change its use code narrative.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 1366. Rather, the provision only authorized the holder to correct or delete the ‘patent information’ submitted by the applicant under the statute and ‘patent information’ is specifically defined in 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1) as limited to the patent number and the expiration date of the relevant patent. <italic>Id.</italic> Thus, the Federal Circuit found that the counterclaim provision only authorizes suits to “correct or delete an erroneous patent number or expiration date. The authorization does not extend to the use code narrative.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>The Federal Circuit therefore reversed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment and vacated the District Court’s injunction ordering Novo to request that FDA change the overbroad use code to the original, narrower use code. <italic>Id.</italic> at 1367.</p>
<p>Judge Dyk dissented from the majority opinion, noting that, in his view, the majority had construed the [§ 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)] counterclaim provision, which became law with the enactment of the MMA, “contrary to its manifest purpose and allows the same manipulative practices to continue in the context of method patents.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>Contrary to the majority opinion, Judge Dyk argued, <italic>inter alia</italic>, that “[t]here is, in fact, no definition of ‘patent information’ in the statute, and in reaching this construction, the majority ignores critical statutory language.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 1371. Judge Dyk further stated that the majority decision “strikingly limits the [§ 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)] counterclaim provision with the consequence that, in all likelihood, the ANDA applicant is left without any remedy to correct an erroneous Orange Book listing with respect to a method of use patent. This cannot be what Congress intended.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 1382.</p>
<p>Caraco filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied on July 29, 2010. <italic>Novo Nordisk A/S et al. v. Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>., No. 2010-1001 (Fed. Cir. July 29, 2010) at 3. Judge Gajarsa, joined by Judge Dyk, authored an opinion dissenting from the Federal Circuit's decision denying Caraco's petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, stating, in part, that “[t]he majority opinion construes the counterclaim provision contrary to its manifest Congressional purpose. That construction renders 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(viii) (“Section viii”) carve-out statements a virtual nullity and leaves generic drug manufacturers without a remedy to challenge inaccurate Orange Book listings with respect to method of use patents.” <italic>Novo Nordisk A/S et al. v. Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>., No. 2010-1001 (Fed. Cir. July 29, 2010) (Gajarsa, J., dissenting) at 3.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1741134312456694"><title>Arguments Before The Supreme Court</title>
<sec id="sec6-1741134312456694"><title>Caraco’s opening Supreme Court brief</title>
<p>In its opening brief, Caraco argued that the Federal Circuit’s decision “is foreclosed by the text, structure, history, and purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act’s carefully crafted counterclaim provision.” Brief for Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 16-17, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). Specifically, Caraco argued that the Federal Circuit decision had essentially rewritten the phrase “an approved method of use” to mean “any approved method of use” and that “[t]his altered the statute’s meaning.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 17. In addition, Caraco argued that the Federal Circuit had “erred in holding that Novo’s patent use code is not ‘patent information …’… But a use code describes the <italic>patent’s</italic> scope, and thus is ‘<italic>patent</italic> information’ within any fair reading of that term.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 19 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Caraco argued that the Federal Circuit’s decision contravenes the structure of the Hatch-Waxman Act as a whole. Specifically, Caraco argued that “[t]he point of the counterclaim statute is to provide a remedy for gamesmanship that delays generic competition. Yet the Federal Circuit read the statute in a manner that effectively licensed brands to block concededly non-infringing generic drugs, eliminated the statute’s remedy for ‘correcting’ patent information, and ‘eviscerate[d] Section viii.’ In effect, brands have been handed the ability to extend their patents to cover ‘unpatented uses.’” <italic>Id</italic>. at 20 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>With respect to the statutory interpretation of the phrase “an approved method of using the drug” Caraco noted that “Congress did not say ‘any’; it said ‘an.’” <italic>Id</italic>. at 23. Thus, “[b]y substituting ‘any’ for ‘an,’ the majority below changed the statute’s meaning.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 24. Caraco further noted that while the Federal Circuit had “detect[ed] no ambiguity in the statutory language,” the meaning of “an” depends on how the word is being used.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741134312456694">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Caraco further argued that the counterclaim provision requires that the ANDA applicant “show that ‘the patent does not claim *** an approved method of using the drug.’” <italic>Id</italic>. at 29. Thus, continued Caraco, “the counterclaim asks not whether the <italic>brand</italic> can show that its patent <italic>does claim</italic> ‘an approved method,’ but whether the <italic>generic</italic> can point to ‘an approved method’ that the patent ‘<italic>does not</italic> claim.’” <italic>Id</italic>. (emphasis in original). Caraco further noted that “[f]requently, however, a drug has multiple approved uses, and the patent-in-suit claims only a subset of those uses. In those situations, it can simultaneously be true that the patent <italic>both</italic> (1) ‘claims an approved method of use’ <italic>and</italic> (2) ‘does not claim an approved method of use.’ That is why the counterclaim’s structure – which turns on the generic’s ability to identify an approved use that the patent ‘does not claim’ – is so important.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 29–30 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>With respect to the term “patent information submitted by the holder under subsection (b) or (c) …” Caraco argued that “Congress used the phrase ‘submitted under,’… throughout the Act when referring to patent information submitted under FDA regulations.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 35. Thus, when reading the Act as a whole, “it is clear that Congress did not limit the courts’ ability to correct inaccurate ‘patent information’ to cases involving incorrect patent numbers or expiries.” <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Carcaco again emphasized that “[o]verbroad use codes eliminate the option of using Section viii” and “by eliminating the Act’s check on allowing brands to overstate their patents, the decision below ‘effectively allows a patent holder to extend its monopoly to unpatented uses.’ This is especially troubling under Hatch-Waxman.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 44.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Caraco argued that “[t]he brand’s ‘patent information’ must reveal what its patent ‘does not claim.’ Because Novo’s patent use code fails to do so, it requires correction.” Thus Caraco requested that the Court reinstate the District Court’s injunction requiring such a correction. <italic>Id</italic>. at 57.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312456694"><title>Novo’s Supreme Court brief</title>
<p>In its brief, Novo first argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction to address Caraco’s arguments. Specifically, Novo argued that “Caraco does not now have – and did not have at the time the counterclaim was filed – a Paragraph IV certification as to the sole patent claim at issue. Rather, Caraco amended its ANDA in April 2008 to assert only a section viii statement, thus depriving the federal courts of jurisdiction and destroying the statutory prerequisite for invoking the counterclaim.” Brief for Respondents, No. 10-844, at 23, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). Novo argued that a counterclaim under § 355(j)(5)(C)(ii) may only be brought where a Paragraph IV certification has been made and “[t]he jurisdictional basis for the counterclaim is therefore coterminous with a Paragraph IV certification.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 24–25.</p>
<p>Novo next argued that the Federal Circuit had correctly construed the scope of the counterclaim provision. Specifically, because the patent does claim an approved method of use, “[t]he counterclaim is therefore unavailable.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 28. Novo further argued that “[a] patent either ‘claim[s] an approved method’ of using a particular drug, or it does not. This dichotomy is at the heart of the Hatch-Waxman Act’s listing requirements, and was expressly adopted by Congress in the counterclaim.” <italic>Id</italic>. With respect to Caraco’s argument that a patent can both claim an approved method of use and not claim an approved method of use, Novo responded: “[n]onsense. To be sure, as a matter of quantum mechanics, ‘[e]lementary particles can both exist and not exist at the same time.’ But ‘[j]udicial power needs a more predictable basis, and patent claims, unlike Schrödinger’s cat, cannot be in multiple, inconsistent states at once.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 28–29 (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, argued Novo, “the counterclaim provision operates to remove from the Orange Book those method-of-use patents that were not properly listed in the first place … A patent is either correctly listed in the Orange Book or it is not – as with the counterclaim provision, the listing requirement turns on the dichotomy between patents that ‘claim … an approved use’ and those that do not. It <italic>is</italic> an either-or proposition.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 32 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Novo further argued that “[t]he language enacted by Congress means that the counterclaim is available only if ‘the listed patent does not claim <italic>any</italic>’ (or, equivalently, claims <italic>no</italic>) ‘approved method of using the drug.’… on Caraco’s reading, an ANDA applicant may invoke the counterclaim if it can identify any ‘“approved method” that the patent does not claim.” The statute, however, says no such thing.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 29–30. However, argued Novo, in order for Caraco’s construction to work, it “requires substituting a definite article (‘the’) for the indefinite article (‘an’) that Congress actually used. [<italic>i.e.</italic>, changing the phrase ‘on the ground that the patent does not claim … <italic>an</italic> approved method of using the drug’ to ‘on the ground that the patent does not claim … <italic>the</italic> approved method of using the drug’] Caraco repeatedly reminds the Court that ‘[c]hang[ing] an “an” to a “the”… go[es] from huge savings to huge cost.’ But that is <italic>precisely</italic> what Caraco is attempting to do.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 30 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>With respect to the word “correct” in the counterclaim statutory provision (in the phrase “the applicant may assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the holder to correct or delete the patent information”), Novo argued that the term “is an artifact of the earlier, failed bills that would have required submission of a much broader range of ‘patent information’ and permitted a suit to correct that information. <italic>Id</italic>. at 38. The term was also not rendered superfluous, as Caraco contended, because the statute thus provided courts with the option of “<italic>either</italic> delisting <italic>or</italic> correction of the statutory patent information” when necessary. <italic>Id</italic>. at 37–38 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Novo further argued that the only “patent information” that could be corrected under the statute was the patent number and expiration date, as found by the Federal Circuit. <italic>Id.</italic> at 39–40. Furthermore, Novo noted that “[t]he counterclaim refers to information ‘submitted … under’ two specific provisions, each of which provides for submission only of the patent number and expiration date – and not other information, even if required by FDA regulation.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 40–41. Furthermore, Novo argued that “Caraco is attempting to obtain through judicial reimagination of the counterclaim provision a result that Congress considered but declined to adopt.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 44. Specifically, Novo argued that before the counterclaim provision was passed by Congress, Congress “considered several proposals that would have required NDA holders to provide an expanded list of statutory patent information, including, ‘if the patent claims a method of use, the approved use covered by the claim.’… These bills would have been broad enough to authorize what Caraco seeks here: a judicial challenge to the use code narrative.” <italic>Id.</italic> (internal citations omitted). However, these bills did not pass, and thus “Caraco’s interpretation of the counterclaim provision ‘would effectively resurrect the scheme rejected by Congress.’” <italic>Id</italic>. (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>Novo further pointed out that the FDA regulations require “applicants to provide ‘a description of each approved method of use <italic>or indication</italic>.’… FDA’s guidance is expressly written in the alternative: An applicant may describe <italic>either</italic> the indication <italic>or</italic> the method of use.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 48–49 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted). Thus, Novo argued that there is nothing “wrong with Novo’s election to frame its use code in a manner that complies with all applicable statutory and regulatory guidance while channeling infringement disputes into pre-approval Paragraph IV litigation rather than post-approval litigation after the generic goes to market with a section viii carve-out label.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 51 (internal citations omitted). “Complying with a regulatory regime is not ‘gam[ing]’ it, as Caraco insinuates.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 52 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>Rather, Novo argued that Caraco’s argument that “use code narratives must ‘describe the patent’s scope’ is just a collateral attack on FDA’s longstanding decision to permit a drug’s approved indication to serve as its use code … The proper forum for such an attack is not a counterclaim against Novo but instead a lawsuit against FDA under the APA.” <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition, Novo argued that it would be inequitable to reinstate the District Court’s injunction because the District Court had not required Caraco to meet the prerequisites for injunctive relief set forth in <italic>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC</italic>, 547 U.S. 388 (2006), and that “[t]hese prerequisites to equitable relief each point in a single direction here: Caraco is not ‘entitled’ to an injunction.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 53. Accordingly, Novo requested that the Federal Circuit decision be affirmed or, alternatively, vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 56.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312456694"><title>Caraco’s reply Supreme Court brief</title>
<p>In its reply brief, Caraco first addressed Novo’s jurisdictional arguments, preliminarily noting that “Novo did not question jurisdiction in the Federal Circuit, and in granting certiorari without supplementing the question presented this Court ‘necessarily considered and rejected’ Novo’s position.” Reply Brief for Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 2, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). Turning to the merits of the argument, Caraco argued that “[i]n truth, Caraco’s Section viii statement stated only that there <italic>ought not</italic> be any controversy under Novo’s <italic>prior</italic> use code. When Novo revised its use code, FDA rejected Caraco’s Section viii statement – compelling Caraco to maintain a Paragraph IV certification ‘under protest’ and litigate accordingly.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 3 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>Caraco further argued, <italic>inter alia</italic>, that “Novo’s position thus rests on the premise that its own claim <italic>should have been</italic> dismissed when Caraco invoked Section viii. Even if this were correct (and it is not), jurisdiction does not turn on ‘events that did not occur.’” <italic>Id</italic>. at 4 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted). In addition, Caraco argued that because it had a Paragraph IV certification at the time Novo filed suit the court had subject matter jurisdiction and “[i]t is irrelevant that Caraco later invoked Section viii.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 6.</p>
<p>With respect to Novo’s argument that “does not claim … an approved method” must mean “does not claim … any approved method,” Caraco argued that “[n]o grammatical imperative holds that ‘not an’ necessarily ‘equates to ‘none.’’ That raises a question of <italic>usage</italic>.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 7 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted). Caraco also noted that “[d]rugs often have multiple approved uses, and related patents often claim some such uses but not others .… This does not mean that [the] patent exists, like ‘Schrödinger’s cat,’ in ‘multiple, inconsistent states at once.’ It means that what a patent claims must be analyzed on a use-by-use basis.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 8–9.</p>
<p>Turning to the meaning of the word “correct” in the statute, Caraco noted that “[s]etting aside the implausibility of Congress passing a counterclaim to correct typos, brands already have ample incentives and opportunity to file correct patent numbers. If they do not, generics can file Paragraph IV certifications asserting non-infringement of the mistakenly listed patent, and brands can be denied their automatic 30-month stay of generic approval.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 14. Furthermore, Caraco noted that “[u]nder Novo’s interpretation, the counterclaim is unavailable if the patent claims ‘any’ approved use – regardless of an erroneous expiry. Thus, the counterclaim could never ‘correct’ an ‘expiration date.’ Only patent numbers could arguably be ‘corrected,’ and that use of the statute is trivial.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 15.</p>
<p>Regarding Novo’s argument that Caraco was trying to “resurrect [a] scheme rejected by Congress,” Caraco noted that “the ‘drafting history’ [referred to by Novo] was superceded by FDA’s decision to define ‘patent information’ to include a ‘description of the patented method of use.’ At that point, (a different) Congress no longer needed to define ‘patent information’ to include use codes; it could simply reference the information submitted to FDA – which is what it did, with support from both sides of the aisle.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 18 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>With respect to Novo’s use code, citing to FDA requirements requiring brands to “provide both ‘a description of each approved method of use or indication *** and *** the description of the patented method of use,’” Caraco argued that “[t]he notion that use codes may be divorced from patent claims grossly misrepresents FDA’s regulations.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 21.</p>
<p>Caraco further argued that its right to an order does not turn on <italic>eBay</italic>-style balancing. <italic>Id</italic>. at 22. Caraco first noted that “Novo waived this argument by not raising it below.” <italic>Id</italic>. Furthermore, Caraco argued that “<italic>eBay</italic> applies only where courts have the option of awarding damages – which are unavailable here – and in any case the equities overwhelmingly favor Caraco.” <italic>Id</italic>. (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, Caraco asked that the Federal Circuit’s decision be reversed and the District Court’s injunction reinstated. <italic>Id</italic>. at 24.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1741134312456694"><title>The Amicus Briefs</title>
<p>Numerous Amicus briefs were filed with the Supreme Court on behalf of both parties.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1741134312456694"><title>Amicus briefs in support of Caraco</title>
<sec id="sec11-1741134312456694"><title>AARP and U.S. Public Interest Research Group (“PIRG”)</title>
<p>The AARP and U.S. PIRG (collectively “AARP”) began their amicus brief by noting that “[t]he American healthcare system is in turmoil.” Brief For AARP And U.S. PIRG As <italic>Amici Curiae</italic> In Support Of Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 3, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). After describing the Hatch-Waxman Act, AARP lamented that “[d]espite the intent of the legislation to incentivize and facilitate generic entry, loopholes, ambiguities, and procedural gamesmanship prevented most generics from using the ANDA process as Congress intended. Most notably, brand pharmaceutical companies learned to amend their method of use patent information to expand the scope of protection and duration, even when the patent did not in fact protect this enlarged scope.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 4–5. AARP continued and stated that “Congress recognized the shortcomings of the ANDA system, and enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 … [which allowed] a generic ANDA applicant to assert a counterclaim against a brand to ‘correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder’ under the Hatch-Waxman Act.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 5. However, “[a] misreading of the counterclaim led the Federal Circuit to conclude that the counterclaim is only available when the patent at issue does not claim any approved method of using the drug.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 6. Thus, AARP argued that “[f]ollowing the rationale of the Federal Circuit, a brand manufacturer can prevent competition from a generic competitor by submitting a method use patent description that overstates the actual scope of the patent.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 7. AARP further argued, <italic>inter alia</italic>, that consumers would be hurt by the Federal Circuit decision, because “if left intact, [it] virtually insures compounded consumer harm through higher prices and less choice over both the short and long-term.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 8.</p>
<p>AARP further argued that if Novo “is successful in thwarting [Caraco’s] attempts at bringing its generic to market, all brand manufacturers will follow suit.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 13. AARP noted that “[t]his is a very profitable maneuver for the brand pharmaceutical industry, and a very threatening reality for generics.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 14. Moreover, AARP stated that Novo “is flaunting the loophole in front of all, showing that even legislation specifically enacted to achieve the opposite result is no match for the brand pharmaceutical industry’s ability to expand and prolong its patents.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 14–15.

<p>GPhA began its brief by stating that the Federal Circuit decision “eviscerates one of the core mechanisms provided by Congress to generic drug manufacturers … [and] severely disrupts the existing drug approval system by converting the FDA’s patent listing process into a conduit for misinformation.” Brief Of The Generic Pharmaceutical Association As <italic>Amicus Curiae</italic> In Support Of Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 2, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). GPhA then focused on “two serious errors the Federal Circuit committed …” <italic>Id</italic>. at 11. The first error, argued GPhA, was that “the Federal Ciruit’s decision ‘eviscerates’ the important section viii process. Because ANDA applicants will now be unable to challenge overbroad method-of-use patent descriptions via a counterclaim … [they] will be forced to proceed by the time-consuming and costly paragraph IV certification process … or to withhold their product from the market altogether until the patent expires … [a result that] is entirely inconsistent with the statutory scheme …” <italic>Id</italic>. The second error committed by the Federal Circuit, GPhA argued, was that their decision “renders meaningless the statutory language authorizing generic manufacturers to request that brand-name manufacturers ‘correct or delete’ improper patent information submitted to the FDA.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 12.</p>
<p>GPhA further stated that “[t]he court of appeals’ erroneous decision provides brand-name manufacturers with a roadmap for blocking FDA approval of generic drugs that would not infringe any patent held by the brand-name manufacturer.” <italic>Id</italic>. More specifically, GPhA noted that “[w]here (as here) the brand-name manufacturer has overstated what the patent actually covers, however, the unavailability of a counterclaim to correct the improper patent description may well make it <italic>impossible</italic> for the generic manufacturer to prove non-infringement. That is because the generic manufacturer will be forced to market the drug with the same label as its brand-name counterpart, which is <italic>by definition</italic> infringing with respect to the patented use.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 15 (emphasis in original). Thus, “the generic manufacturer’s only recourse will be to attempt to prove that the brand-name company’s entire method-of-use patent is invalid … [or] choose to abandon its approval efforts altogether and wait until the very last relevant method-of-use patent held by the brand-name manufacturer expires.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 15–16. Thus, GPhA continued, that “[i]t is this added imposition of being required to prove <italic>invalidity</italic> of the entire patent – as opposed to <italic>non-infringement</italic> of a particular use – that the panel majority failed to appreciate …” <italic>Id</italic>. at 16 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>GPhA also noted that “Section viii specifically addresses how ANDA applicants should address method-of-use patents … [and] the [Hatch-Waxman] Act’s legislative history demonstrates that Congress anticipated that there could be brand-name drugs approved for multiple uses, where only some of those uses were patented, and that there should be no barrier to entry for generic drugs seeking approval for unpatented uses.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 18. GPhA also stated that “the evisceration of section viii will have dire consequences for American consumers [as it] effectively extends the term of the brand-name manufacturer’s expired drug patent.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 20.</p>
<p>GPhA further argued that “[b]y authorizing a remedy to ‘correct or delete’ erroneous ‘patent information,’ the Act presumes that patent information listed in the Orange Book <italic>should</italic> be correct. If that statutorily prescribed remedy is to have any force at all, it <italic>must</italic> dictate that the NDA applicant tailor its use code to correspond to the legitimate scope of the patent, not to whatever use the brand-name manufacturer chooses to claim.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 26 (emphasis in original). Furthermore, GPhA argued that the language of 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1) which specifies that NDA applicants “submit ‘the patent number and expiration date of any patent which claims *** a method of using such drug <italic>and with respect to which a claim to patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug</italic>’… necessarily establishes an accuracy constraint on the language used to describe a patent in the Orange Book. That is, a patent holder could not ‘reasonably’ ‘assert[]’ ‘a claim of patent infringement’ if the patent’s method of use was indefinite or overbroad, and thus the patent information submitted to the FDA likewise may not be so.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 27–28 (emphasis in original). GPhA thus concluded that “the panel majority’s conclusion means that there will be no judicial forum available to resolve disputes over the scope of a brand-name manufacturer’s use-code narrative. By thus removing the only effective check on the submission of misleading patent descriptions for publication in the Orange Book, the decision below renders the FDA’s patent listing process a conduit for misinformation.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 32. Accordingly, GPhA urged that the decision of the Federal Circuit be reversed. <italic>Id</italic>. at 34.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1741134312456694"><title>Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc</title>
<p>Mylan began its brief by noting that “[r]egrettably, branded manufacturers often overstate the scope of their patents, and the FDA does not police the accuracy of Orange Book information.” Brief Of <italic>Amicus Curiae</italic> Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. In Support Of Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 1, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). The availability of the counterclaim “serves as a much-needed check on branded drug manufacturers and deters them from supplying misinformation to the FDA.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 1–2. However, the Federal Circuit decision “effectively eviscerates the counterclaim provision and permits brand manufacturers to block legitimate section viii applications with false Orange Book listings.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 2.</p>
<p>Regarding the statutory construction of the counterclaim provision, Mylan noted that “[t]he legislative history makes plain that Congress broadly intended to stop abuses that had allowed branded drug manufacturers to delay legitimate generic competition …” <italic>Id</italic>. at 7. Furthermore, Mylan argued that “[t]he statutory language reflects Congress’s intent to give courts flexibility to <italic>correct</italic> incorrect Orange Book information in the way that makes most sense in each case.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 9 (emphasis added). That is, “recognizing that branded drug manufacturers could abuse the system in a variety of ways, Congress authorized correction as well as deletion of erroneous patent information. In so doing, it ensured that the counterclaim provision covered cases such as this one … There is no reason to think that Congress intended to open a new loophole when closing the old one.” <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Like GPhA, Mylan argued that the language of 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1)(G) “expressly contemplates that the patent holder will describe the scope of the patents and relate them to the drug or method of use for which approval is sought. The resulting Orange Book listings are supposed to notify later ANDA applicants which drugs or methods of use are patented so that those applicants can submit appropriate certifications under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) and (viii).” <italic>Id</italic>. at 10. Thus, Mylan argued that the term “patent information” must “be construed broadly in light of that purpose.” <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Mylan further noted that under the Federal Circuit’s decision, “[i]ronically, but inevitably, generic entry would be stalled in the very cases where Congress sought to accelerate it.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 14. Finally, Mylan noted that “[a]s a practical matter, an affirmance of the decision below would severely reduce if not eliminate the availability of section viii applications, and the resulting lengthy delays in generic entry would result in significant, tangible costs to consumers and taxpayers.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 17. Accordingly, Mylan urged that the Federal Circuit’s decision be reversed. <italic>Id</italic>. at 18.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1741134312456694"><title>The United States</title>
<p>The United States explained its interest in the outcome of this case as follows:</p>
<p>‘This case presents the question whether an [ANDA] applicant … can challenge the accuracy and precision of certain patent information that is submitted to FDA by the brand-name manufacturer. Because patent information submitted by the brand-name manufacturer is integral to FDA’s decision whether to approve generic drugs, but FDA lacks the resources and expertise necessary to determine whether that information is accurate and precise, the United States has an interest in an effective judicial mechanism for resolving such challenges. If left uncorrected, inaccurate or imprecise brand-name patent information can delay FDA’s approval of generic drugs, thereby depriving consumers of the benefits of competition between generic and brand-name manufacturers’.</p>
<p>Brief For The United States As Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 1-2, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). The United States continued and explained that “[t]he Hatch-Waxman Amen-dments have benefited consumers by fostering substantial competition from generic drugs. … Starting in the late 1990s, however, brand-name manufacturers began to exploit certain features of the original Hatch-Waxman scheme to prevent or delay FDA approval of generic competitors. In particular, some brand-name manufacturers submitted to FDA patent information that arguably was not appropriate for listing in the Orange Book.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 6–7 (internal citations omitted). However, FDA was obliged to publish such information in the Orange Book under the statue and regulation, “and the ensuing litigation prevented or delayed FDA’s approval of ANDAs.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 7. FDA addressed this issue in 2003 by implementing new rules which, <italic>inter alia</italic>, “addressed method-of-use patents in further detail because mischaracterization of such patents had interfered with the agency’s implementation of section viii, the provision authorizing an ANDA applicant to seek carve-out labeling to avoid a listed method-of-use patent.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 9. The United States further stated that “[l]ater in 2003, Congress complemented FDA’s rulemaking by creating a judicial mechanism to resolve disputes about patent information submitted to FDA [i.e., by adding the counterclaim provision].” <italic>Id.</italic> at 11.</p>
<p>The United States argued that Caraco’s reading of the counterclaim provision was correct because it “preserves more natural and distinct roles for the terms ‘correct’ and ‘delete’ in the counterclaim provision than does [Novo’s] interpretation,” and that “the ‘patent information’ that can be ‘correct[ed]’ includes a use code.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 15–16. The United States further noted that “[a]s applied to method-of-use patents, the counterclaim provision would fail to serve its intended purpose in an important category of cases if it could be invoked only when a listed patent claims no approved method of use at all [as the Federal Circuit had held].” <italic>Id.</italic> at 21–22. Rather, such a reading “invites an NDA holder to exploit a patent claiming one approved use of a drug to block generic competition in all other approved uses of the drug.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 22.</p>
<p>The United States further emphasized that “FDA’s ability to administer the Hatch-Waxman scheme depends on precise and accurate information about the particular method(s) of use that the patent covers .… By foreclosing generic competition that FDA might otherwise have approved pursuant to a section viii statement, the submission of overbroad use codes can cause substantially the same ill effects as does Orange Book listing of patents that should not be listed at all, and FDA’s lack of resources and patent expertise prevents the agency from adequately policing either type of abuse. The concerns that prompted Congress to enact the counterclaim provision are therefore directly and fully implicated here.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 31.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the United States urged that the Federal Circuit’s decision be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings. <italic>Id.</italic> at 34.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1741134312456694"><title>Rep. Henry A. Waxman (“Waxman”)</title>
<p>Representative Henry A. Waxman submitted an amicus brief in support of Caraco. In his brief, Waxman began by noting that “[t]his case presents a question of congressional intent … [and] that the Federal Circuit’s narrow interpretation of the counterclaim provisions conflicts with Congress’ intent in enacting them …” Brief Of Rep. Henry A. Waxman As <italic>Amicus Curiae</italic> In Support Of Petitioners, No. 10-844, at 1, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012).</p>
<p>Waxman further noted that “[i]n the preamble to its 2003 regulations, FDA emphasized that requiring NDA holders to submit specific use codes was ‘essential’ to the Agency’s and the ANDA applicant’s, ability to identify unpatented uses for the RLD that could serve as the basis for an immediate section viii approval.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 6 (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, during the drafting of the MMA (which includes the counterclaim provision), “FDA made Congress aware of the agency’s new requirements that NDA holders submit specific method of use information.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 8 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>Turning to the Federal Circuit’s construction of the counterclaim provision, Waxman argued that “[i]nterpreting the statute to mean something different from what it says, the Federal Circuit read ‘<italic>an</italic> approved method of using the drug’ (emphasis added) to mean <italic>any</italic> approved method of using the drug.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 14 (emphasis in original). However, “Congress’ decision not to use the word that would have unequivocally signaled the intent ascribed to it by the Federal Circuit [<italic>i.e.</italic>, the word ‘any’] shows that Congress intended a different meaning …” <italic>Id.</italic> Furthermore, Waxman noted that “Congress’ decision to use ‘an’ in the counterclaim provisions instead of ‘any’ was not unconscious or neutral. It demonstrated Congress’ clear, careful intent to allow a counterclaim where the Orange Book-listed patent did not claim a particular – ‘an’ – approved use, not just when the patent failed to claim ‘any’ approved use at all.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 15.</p>
<p>In addition, Waxman argued that the wording of the counterclaim provision “complements the wording of the section viii provisions … [which states that it applies to] a method of use patent which <italic>does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval</italic> …” <italic>Id.</italic> at 16–17 (emphasis in original). Waxman noted that “[n]o one suggests that Congress intended a section viii approval to require that the NDA’s holder’s patent claim <italic>no</italic> approved method of use – merely that there be a single, particular approved use not claimed by the patent.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 17 (emphasis in original). Waxman also noted, as did other <italic>amici</italic>, that the Federal Circuit’s reading of the counterclaim provision “renders superfluous the statute’s language allowing the counterclaimant to seek an order ‘correct[ing]’ the submitted information.” <italic>Id.</italic> (internal citations omitted). Waxman further argued that “[t]he Federal Circuit’s reading is particularly unwarranted because it denies ANDA holders the judicial forum that Congress and FDA agreed was best equipped to address the patent listing issues implicated by the FDA regulations.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 21.</p>
<p>With respect to Novo’s changing its use code, Waxman noted that “the labeling changes [required by FDA] in no way required Novo to change its original use code description, and the revised description clearly violated FDA regulations. The actual ‘fault’ here lies in the assumption that the use code must track exactly the revised labeling even when it differs significantly from the scope of the listed patent.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 25, n.12.</p>
<p>With respect to the term “patent information,” Waxman argued that “Congress did not draft the ‘patent information’ language on a blank slate .… FDA understood use codes to fall within the definition of ‘patent information submitted … under [21 U.S.C. 355(b) or (c)],’ and Congress, in repeating FDA’s language and working closely with the agency in drafting the counterclaim provisions, sought to ratify the agency’s understanding.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 28.</p>
<p>Waxman concluded by emphasizing that “the Federal Circuit’s narrow reading of the counterclaim provisions would fatally undercut the section viii framework.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 31. Waxman thus urged that the Federal Circuit’s decision be reversed. <italic>Id.</italic> at 32.</p>

<p>Allergan began its brief by noting that “[t]hrough exhaustive and expensive clinical research, the branded pharmaceutical industry has been able to discover new indications and ‘repurpose’ old drugs to eliminate and/or reduce the occurrence and effects of serious diseases and illnesses” and that the reward for such investment is “patent protection on the newly discovered indications, without which innovator companies would be unable to recoup their investments.” Brief Of Amici Curiae Allergan, Inc., Shire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp., And Somaxon Corp. In Support Of Respondents, No. 10-844, at 1, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). Allergan further stated that “Caraco attempts to circumscribe the process set forth in the statute and delay the method of use patent infringement inquiries until <italic>after</italic> generic drugs come on to the market, when the market for the innovator product has already been destroyed by the generic product .… This is contrary to the Act’s language and purpose, whose patent provisions are designed to resolve such disputes <italic>before</italic> the generic is launched.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 2 (emphasis in original). Allergan also stated that if the relief Caraco was seeking were granted “use codes may come to look like patent claims that will have to be interpreted by FDA in the context of drug labeling … [and] FDA is ill equipped to assess patent claims and their scope or to make infringement decisions about generic drugs.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>Preliminarily, Allergan noted that “[u]nlike the objective patent information required by statute (patent number and expiration date), use codes required by regulations are highly subjective and thus, not easily addressed by courts under the counterclaim provisions.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 3. Allergan further noted that “[n]owhere in the statute or legislative history of the Hatch-Waxman Act are use codes and descriptions required.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 10. Furthermore, Allergan stated that “litigating over the particular words of a use code will result in a quagmire and will create a flurry of satellite litigations that are not in the courts’ or the public’s interest.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 11. Thus, argued Allergan, “the patent infringement issue will take a back seat to determining the propriety of certain ‘use code’ language: only after resolution of the ‘use code’ issues will patent infringement cases proceed.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 13.</p>
<p>Allergan also argued that carve-out labels do not avoid infringement liability. <italic>Id.</italic> “This is so,” argued Allergan, because once approved “the drugs may still be prescribed, dispensed and used in an infringing manner. In fact, most are.” <italic>Id</italic>. Allergan further emphasized that “[t]he resolution of any infringement claims prior to the generic drug products launch was a clear intention of the Act as it encourages the development of new drugs and the protection of valid patents.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 17. Allergan further noted that “FDA has already shown that it is ill-equipped to resolve disputes ahead of time through its application of section viii: FDA has permitted section viii carveouts that have resulted in infringement [citing to <italic>AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex, Inc.</italic>, 623 F.Supp. 2d 579 (D.N.J. 2009)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741134312456694">3</xref></sup>].” <italic>Id.</italic> at 20. Allergan stated that the AstraZeneca case “confirms that patent infringement remains a separate inquiry from whether a carve-out is appropriate on a generic label …” <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, Allergan argued that FDA’s policy of requiring either a paragraph IV certification or a section viii statement was in violation of the statute. <italic>Id</italic>. at 21. Allergan noted that 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(j)(2)(A) (vii)-(viii) states, in part, that an ANDA contain “(vii) a certification … with respect to each patent which claims the listed drug … ; and (viii) if with respect to the listed drug … information was filed … for a method of use patent which does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval under this subsection, a statement that the method of use patent does not claim such use.” Thus, Allergan argued that “[t]he plain language of the statute thus requires <bold><italic>both</italic></bold> a certification <bold><italic>and</italic></bold> a section viii statement when the ANDA applicant is seeking approval for a use not claimed by the method of use patent. Nowhere in its language does the statute imply that a section viii statement can replace the certification required by 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii).” <italic>Id</italic>. at 22 (emphasis in original). Thus, Allergan argued that “FDA policy diverges from the statute’s clear language and legislative intent.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 23. Accordingly, Allergan requested that the Court “reject FDA’s ‘either/or’ policy and require the language of the statute to be followed for [] all Orange Book listed patents or, in the alternative, remand to the appellate court for further consideration of this issue.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 26. Allergan also requested that the Federal Circuit’s decision be affirmed. <italic>Id</italic>. at 27.</p>

Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). Like Novo, PhRMA noted that “FDA instructs applicants that the ‘use code’ may track <italic>either</italic> an approved indication <italic>or</italic> method of use.” <italic>Id</italic>. at 10 (emphasis in original). Similarly, PhRMA argued that the term “patent information” included only the patent number and expiration date. <italic>Id.</italic> at 12. In addition, PhRMA noted that “[b]ecause the plain language of the statute is clear, there is no need to consult the legislative history of the counterclaim provision.” <italic>Id.</italic> However, even if legislative history were consulted, PhRMA argued that “[t]here is no indication that Congress was concerned with overbroad use codes.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>With respect to Caraco’s reading of the counterclaim provision, PhRMA argued that “[a]side from bending logic and normal English usage, Petitioners’ interpretation leads to the remarkable conclusion that a patent must claim <italic>all</italic> potential methods for using the drug to be listed in the Orange Book” (<italic>Id.</italic> at 16 (emphasis in original)) and that “Petitioners and their <italic>amici</italic> [are] attempt[ing] to inject ambiguity into the counterclaim provision …” where none exists. <italic>Id.</italic> at 18.</p>
<p>PhRMA further noted that “[n]otably absent from the legislative record of the counterclaim provision is any congressional concern with use codes. … Overbroad use codes were simply not a concern of Congress’s in enacting the counterclaim provision.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 22.</p>
<p>Finally, PhRMA noted that Caraco should have pursued other avenues to challenge Prandin’s use code. Specifically, PhRMA argued that Caraco could have filed a Citizen’s Petition to change the regulations relating to use codes or challenge FDA’s requirement that the labeling for Prandin be changed, and if unsuccessful, brought a judicial challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act. <italic>Id.</italic> at 28–31.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1741134312456694"><title>Washington Legal Foundation (“WLF”)</title>
<p>WLF began by arguing that “the counterclaim provision adopted by Congress in 2003 is unavailable when, as here, the patent listed in the Orange Book claims ‘an approved method of using the drug.’” Brief Of Washington Legal Foundation As <italic>Amicus Curiae</italic> In Support Of Respondents, No. 10-844, at 8, <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012). WLF argued, <italic>inter alia</italic>, that interpreting the counterclaim provision as advocated by Caraco “is inconsistent with the parallel structure created by subclauses (aa) and (bb).” <italic>Id.</italic> at 15. Specifically, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) states that “… the applicant may assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted … on the ground that the patent does not claim either – (aa) the drug for which the application was approved; or (bb) an approved method of using the drug.” WLF argued that under Caraco’s interpretation, subclause (bb) is understood as requiring “a showing that there <italic>exists</italic> ‘at least one FDA-approved method of use that the patent-at-issue does not claim.’” <italic>Id.</italic> at 16 (emphasis in original). By contrast, “the requirement imposed by (aa) can only be expressed in terms of a negative showing: the counterclaimant must demonstrate that the listed patent does not assert a claim for the RLD. There is no way to express that required negative showing in an manner that parallels the affirmative showing required under the meaning ascribed to (bb) by Caraco … The absence of parallelism created by Caraco’s interpretation of the counterclaim provision is an additional reason to reject that interpretation.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 16–17.</p>
<p>WLF also noted that Caraco argued that “the word ‘correct’ would be rendered superfluous if the counterclaim were interpreted as suggested by Novo.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 18. However, WLF argued that “[a]dopting Caraco’s interpretation would require distorting the language and legislative history of the entire counterclaim provision – a far less appealing interpretive solution than simply concluding that a single word in the statute is surplusage.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 19.</p>
<p>Finally, WLF argued that “[t]here is no merit to Caraco’s assertion that the Federal Circuit’s decision leaves it without an effective remedy. To the contrary, to the extent that Caraco disputes Novo’s infringement claims, it can assert its position in connection with its defense of a patent infringement action.” <italic>Id.</italic> WLF argued that there are strong reasons to require Caraco to proceed “under the existing avenues of relief rather than grant it an expanded counterclaim right … [because] Novo is entitled to seek to block approval of Caraco’s ANDA to the extent that it can demonstrate that if Caraco wins approval, it intends to induce others to infringe the ’358 patent.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 20. WLF therefore requested that the Federal Circuit’s decision be affirmed. <italic>Id</italic>. at 24.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1741134312456694"><title>The Supreme Court Decision</title>
<p>Oral argument was held on December 5, 2011 and on April 17, 2012, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled in favor of Caraco and reversed the decision of the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p>Writing on behalf of a unanimous Court, Justice Kagan began by noting that the question before the Court involved the statutory interpretation of three phrases in the relevant statute: “patent does not claim … an approved method of using”; “patent information submitted … under subsection (b) or (c)”; and “to correct or delete.” <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic> (U.S. 2012), Slip. Op. at 10. While noting that “we cannot say that the counterclaim clause is altogether free of ambiguity” the Court noted that “when we consider statutory text and context together, we conclude that a generic manufacturer in Caraco’s position can use the counterclaim.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 10–11.</p>
<sec id="sec21-1741134312456694"><title>“does not claim … an approved method of using the drug”</title>
<p>Turning to the first statutory phrase, the Court noted that the first issue it needed to address was whether the phrase “not an” is to be construed as “not any,” as Novo argued, or as “not a particular one,” as advocated by Caraco. <italic>Id.</italic> at 11. The Court began its analysis by stating that “[t]ruth be told, the answer to the general question ‘What does “not an” mean?’ is ‘It depends’: The meaning of the phrase turns on its context.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 12. The Court concluded, however, that “the statutory context here supports Caraco’s position.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 13. More specifically, the Court found that “[t]he statutory scheme, in other words, contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented uses. Within that framework, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brand’s assertion of rights over whichever use (or uses) the generic company wishes to pursue.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>The Court also noted that Novo’s argument that “not an” must mean “not any” because Congress chose not to specify which method was intended as it did in other parts of the statute was unavailing. Specifically, the Court noted that<disp-quote>
<p>the mere possibility of clearer phrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading of a statute; if it could (with all due respect to Congress), we would interpret a great many statutes differently than we do. Nor does Congress’s use of more detailed language in another provision, enacted years earlier, persuade us to put the counterclaim clause at odds with its statutory context. That is especially so because we can turn this form of argument back around on Novo. Congress, after all, could have more clearly expressed Novo’s proposed meaning in the clearest of ways – by adding a single letter to make clear that ‘not an’ really means ‘not any.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Id.</italic> at 14. “We think that sees, raises, and bests Novo’s argument.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 15.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1741134312456694"><title>“patent information submitted … under subsection (b) or (c)”</title>
<p>The Court began its discussion of this phrase by simply stating that while “[t]he statute does not define ‘patent information,’ [] a use code must qualify. It describes the method of use claimed in a patent.” <italic>Id.</italic> With respect to Novo’s argument that the use code need not be tied to the patent at all but need only provide a “description of each approved method of use <italic>or indication</italic>,” (emphasis in original) the Court noted that “Novo [did] not cite the regulations that specify the information required for publication – i.e., use codes .… Those provisions (whether referring to methods of use, conditions of use, or indications) all demand a description of the patent.” Furthermore, the Court stated, “even the provision which Novo cites … ties information about indications to patent coverage ….” <italic>Id.</italic> at 15, n. 7.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Court noted that subsections (b) and (c), cited in the statute, “provide the basis for the regulation requiring brands to submit use codes … [a]nd the form (Form 3542) on which brands submit their use codes states that the information appearing there is ‘provided in accordance with Section [355] (b) and (c).’” <italic>Id.</italic> at 16. The Court further noted that the phrase “‘patent information submitted … under subsection (b) or (c)’ most naturally refers to patent information provided as part of the ‘comprehensive scheme of regulation’ premised on those subsections.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 17 (internal citations omitted). The Court continued, stating that “[u]se codes are pivotal to the FDA’s implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments – and no less so because a regulation, rather than the statute itself, requires their submission.” <italic>Id.</italic> Indeed, the Court noted that “[a]n overbroad use code therefore throws a wrench into the FDA’s ability to approve generic drugs as the statute contemplates. So it is not surprising that the language Congress used in the counterclaim provision sweeps widely enough to embrace that filing.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 18.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1741134312456694"><title>“correct or delete”</title>
<p>Turning to another aspect of the counterclaim provision, the Court noted that the description of available remedies “dispatches whatever remains of Novo’s arguments.” <italic>Id.</italic> Specifically, the Court noted that its “interpretation of the statute gives content to both those remedies: It deletes a listing from the Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and corrects the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patent’s scope. By contrast, Novo’s two arguments would all but read the term ‘correct’ out of the statute.” <italic>Id.</italic> The Court quickly dismissed Novo’s argument that the term ‘correct’ referred only to correcting erroneous patent numbers, noting that, as Novo conceded, “brands have every incentive to provide the right patent number in the first place, and to immediately rectify any error brought to their attention … [a]nd conversely, generics have little or no incentive to bring a counterclaim that will merely replace one digit in the Orange Book with another.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 19. Reading the statue in that way “would have been, in the most literal sense, to make a federal case out of nothing.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1741134312456694"><title>Legislative history</title>
<p>Finally, the Supreme Court addressed Novo’s arguments that interpreting the statue as advocated by Caraco effectively resurrects an earlier version of the bill which was rejected by Congress. <italic>Id.</italic> at 20. Specifically, the Court stated that “[w]e see no reason to assume, as Novo does, that Congress rejected S. 812 because it required brands to submit patent information beyond a number and expiration date.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 21. Thus the Court concluded that “the drafting history does not support Novo’s conclusion.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 22.</p>
<p>The Court also rejected Novo’s argument that the counterclaim provision was enacted only to address the issues raised in <italic>Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson</italic>, 268 F.3d 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent). The Court stated that “[m]aybe <italic>Mylan</italic> triggered the legislative effort to enact a counterclaim, or maybe it didn’t … Here, we think <italic>Mylan</italic> alerted Congress to a broader problem – that generic companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands’ patent listings, and that the FDA therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to the market.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 22-23. Indeed, the Court noted that the need for a counterclaim is greater in this case than in <italic>Mylan</italic> because when a brand lists a patent in the Orange Book which does not cover any use of a drug, a generic company may always make a Paragraph IV certification and argue non-infringement in the ensuing litigation. <italic>Id.</italic> at 23. “In contrast, where (as here) a brand files an overbroad use code, a generic company cannot use paragraph IV litigation to that end,” because a paragraph IV certification “requires the generic company to propose labeling identical to the brand’s.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 24.</p>
<p>The Court thus concluded that “[t]he statutory counterclaim we have considered enables courts to resolve patent disputes so that FDA can fulfill its statutory duty to approve generic drugs that do not infringe patent rights.” <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. <italic>Id.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1741134312456694"><title>Justice Sotomayor’s concurrence</title>
<p>Justice Sotomayor authored a separate concurrence offering several observations. First, Justice Sotomayor noted that “the counterclaim cannot restore the smooth working of a statutory scheme thrown off kilter by an overly broad use code. At best, it permits the generic manufacturer to do what the scheme contemplates it should do – file an ANDA with a section viii statement – but only after expensive and time-consuming litigation. A fix is in order, but it must come from Congress or FDA.” Concurrence at 3.</p>
<p>Justice Sotomayor also noted that she found “FDA’s guidance as to what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes remarkably opaque.” <italic>Id.</italic> Justice Sotomayor noted that “in some respects we are here today because of FDA’s opacity in describing what is required of brand manufacturers.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 4. Justice Sotomayor concluded by noting that Congress had rejected an earlier bill which specifically required brand manufacturers to provide a description of the approved uses covered by a patent claim, and allowing a generic manufacturer to file suit to correct that information, on the grounds that such a bill would encourage excess litigation. “Absent greater clarity from FDA concerning what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes, Congress’ fears of undue litigation may be realized.” <italic>Id.</italic> at 5.</p>

<sec id="sec26-1741134312456694" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In <italic>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. et al</italic>. <italic>v. Novo Nordisk A/S et al.</italic>, the Supreme Court held that the counterclaim provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a means for a generic manufacturer to challenge a brand’s use code. In doing so, the Supreme Court breathed new life into the MMA’s counterclaim provision. However, it remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court’s decision will result in expensive and time-consuming litigation over the scope of brand manufacturers’ use codes as Justice Sotomayor feared in her concurrence.</p>
