<abstract>
<p>A post-occupancy study was carried out to investigate the thermal environment in a high-standard office building certified by China Three-star Green Building Label. The study included a subjective evaluation of the indoor environment quality and work performance. A total of 182 office workers responded to the questionnaire survey based on the Building Use Studies (BUS) Occupant Survey and Reporting Method. Objective measurements of the thermal environment (temperature and relative humidity) under mechanically and naturally ventilated conditions were also carried out in the building. Although the thermal environment satisfied the majority of respondents, 12% and 20% reported dissatisfaction with summer and winter temperatures, respectively. The complaint on summer temperature was mainly from those working close to the chilled air outlets of the air-conditioners. The perception of cold winter temperatures revealed the potential shortcomings of sustainable building design in humid subtropical climates, where natural ventilation and passive cooling would predominate in the sustainable design while cold air in winter would tend to be neglected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reasons why green buildings succeeded or failed to meet occupants’ perception and this could have an implication in the design decisions for green building practice.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11419311"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Green buildings are considered to be essential in the mitigation of climate change by the building sector. Green buildings are designed to provide occupants with comfortable indoor environments that support productivity and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419311">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11419311">4</xref>]. As a very important indoor environmental factor, the thermal environment can distract workers and affect performance and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419311">5</xref>]. Maintaining an acceptable level of thermal comfort for occupants should be considered a necessity for green building design and operation.</p>
<p>Thermal environment credits in green building rating systems mainly refer to engineering-based comfort standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11419311">Figure 1</xref>), such as the American standard, ASHRAE 55-2004: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy; the International standard, ISO 7730-2005: Ergonomics of the thermal environment; and guidelines from the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, CIBSE Guide A: Environmental design. In the United States LEED system, the ASHRAE comfort zones for mechanically conditioned and naturally conditioned spaces are used as the criteria for green buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419311">3</xref>]. The Japanese CASBEE system also recommends the ASHRAE comfort zones as a design tool for green buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419311">6</xref>]. The ASHRAE comfort zones for naturally ventilated spaces have also been adopted in the Australian Green Star system; for air-conditioned spaces, however, the Green Star system recommends the ISO standard for defining the optimal predicted mean vote (PMV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419311">7</xref>]. The United Kingdom BREEAM system requires that building design and services strategies deliver thermal comfort levels in accordance with the criteria in CIBSE Guide A: Environmental Design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11419311">8</xref>]. These standards are based on numerous laboratory and field research, demonstrating a scientific understanding of human physiological comfort. In addition to the engineering standards, these green building rating systems encourage the provision of high levels of thermal comfort through systems controlled by occupants to promote productivity, comfort and well-being. However, because the majority of green building certifications are one-time events, periodic examinations of the thermal environments over the lifetimes of certified green buildings are rare. Post-occupancy studies are necessary to verify design intentions and to analyze the impacts of thermal environments on comfort and satisfaction.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11419311" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Design of the thermal environment in some green building rating systems.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419311-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In 2007, the Green Building Label (GBL) was introduced as a national sustainable building assessment system in China. The GBL is a green building rating tool promoted by the China Green Building Council (CGBC) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban–Rural Development of the People’s Republic of China (MHURD). The GBL uses a checklist to score three classes in each of the six categories: land saving and outdoor environment, energy saving and utilization, water saving and utilization, material saving and utilization, indoor environmental quality and operation and management. The highest attainable level is the Three-Star Label. Quantitative criteria have not been developed to assess thermal comfort in naturally ventilated conditions. For mechanically ventilated conditions, the Chinese National Standard GB50189-2005: ‘Design standard for energy efficiency of public buildings’ is used, and two indoor temperatures, 20°C and 25°C for heating and cooling seasons, respectively, are defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419311">9</xref>]. This study focused on a demonstration green building situated in China’s humid subtropical climate and conducted a subjective and objective evaluation of the thermal environment to verify the design intent of this certified green building. The research was to find out whether the occupants would be satisfied with the thermal environment and whether the thermal environment would meet the requirement in the green building rating system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11419311"><title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Post-occupancy evaluation (POE) is a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of design components in the built environment. In the United States, the Center for the Built Environment at UC Berkeley compared the results of surveys of LEED-rated buildings with the results of non-certified buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11419311">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11419311">11</xref>]. The study found that occupants in LEED-rated buildings were more satisfied with air quality and thermal comfort. In the United Kingdom, Adrian Leaman compared conventional buildings to buildings with ‘green intent,’ as certified by BREEAM. The results showed that, as a group, buildings with green-intent scored better on summary variables for ventilation and air quality. However, the indoor environment of green buildings tend to be hotter in the summer and are perceived to be less dry and more stuffy in the summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419311">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419311">13</xref>]. In Australia, a highly ranked green building, Melbourne’s City Council 2 (CH2), was studied. CH2 occupants were highly satisfied with the building overall. Thermal environment measurements in CH2 were generally very good and indicated that thermal dissatisfaction levels should be below 10% in most locations in the building; however, occupants were dissatisfied with the airflow, which was considered to be insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419311">14</xref>]. Another study in Australia compared the occupants’ comfort and satisfaction perceptions in a green building with those of the occupants in two conventional buildings. This study found no evidence to support the conclusion that green buildings are more comfortable than conventional buildings. The only notable difference between the buildings was that occupants of the green building were more likely to perceive their work environment as warm, and occupants who felt warm were more likely to describe their work environment as poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419311">15</xref>].</p>
<p>These studies highlighted green buildings’ deviations from predicted performances from the occupants’ point of view, but they did not identify why the discrepancies happened. The interaction between a building’s thermal environment and its occupants’ behaviour was rarely enquired in the literature of green buildings post-occupancy evaluations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reasons why green buildings succeeded or failed to meet occupants’ perception and this could have an implication in the design decisions for green building practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11419311"><title>The Building Under Study</title>
<p>The building that was included for this study is the Headquarter of the Shenzhen Institute of Building Research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419311">Figure 2</xref>), built in 2008, and was awarded the GBL Three-Star Label. By the end of 2010, less than 10 office buildings have been awarded the Three-Star label. The 18,000 m<sup>2</sup> office building is located in the north of Shenzhen (E114°33’, N22°34’). Seasonal variations are fairly similar to those in Hong Kong, with mean daily maximum temperatures of 30–32°C and 18–20°C in the summer and winter, respectively, and an annual mean daily maximum of 25–26°C. Mean minimum daily temperatures range from 14–15°C in the winter to 24–26°C in the summer, with an annual daily minimum temperature of 21–22°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419311">16</xref>]. Given the hot summer and warm winter conditions, most office buildings in Shenzhen are mechanically cooled from April to November. In this building, the mechanical cooling system is operated from June to September. The building consumes three times less energy than other office buildings in the same climate. A 12-storey outdoor atrium was created on the east side of the building to capture southeasterly breezes and introduce daylight and breezes deep inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11419311">Figure 3</xref>). The building extensively uses green features and technologies, such as solar energy generation, natural ventilation, evaporative cooling, gray water recycling and efficient water cooling systems, and serves as a showcase for green design in China.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11419311"><title>Subjective evaluation</title>
<p>The subjective evaluation was to assess user satisfaction from occupants’ point of view. To rigorously assess occupant comfort and satisfaction, the Building Use Studies (BUS) Occupant Survey and Reporting Method was used in this study. This method used a questionnaire survey and benchmarking approach for rapid and comprehensive studies of users’ needs in a range of building types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419311">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419311">19</xref>]. It was developed in the United Kingdom, and is used internationally, and includes a benchmark database. The main body of the survey consisted of a three-page questionnaire administered by hand. In the data analysis step, a comprehensive set of benchmarks covering comfort, health, productivity and control were evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11419311">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Approximately 250 office workers occupy this building. In total, 182 people, or 73% of occupants, responded to the survey. A total of 131 (73%) of the respondents were under 30 years of age, and remaining respondents were over 30. Of those who answered, 95 (53%) were male and 84 (47%) were female. Approximately 58% of the respondents had worked in the building for one year or more, while 42% had worked in the building for less than a year. Only 14 respondents worked in single or shared offices with one or two others; all the others worked in open-plan offices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11419311"><title>Objective Measurement</title>
<p>The objective evaluation was conducted to analyze the building’s physical environment (air temperature and relative humidity) during periods of mechanical conditioning and natural ventilation. Five points were simultaneously and continuously monitored in the middle of five open-plan offices, respectively, in the 4/F, 7/F, 8/F, 9/F and 10/F areas. These floors were occupied by various numbers of office workers. The measurements were recorded in the summer (Friday September 10, 2010 to Saturday September 16, 2010) and winter (Friday December 10, 2010 to Saturday December 16, 2010). The air temperature and relative humidity were recorded automatically every 20 min. Some data (September 12, 2010 16:30:00 to September 16, 2010 23:50:00 of the 8/F) were missing due to equipment malfunction. However, this did not evidently affect the analysis of the temperature variations.</p>
<p>In the mean time, five location points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11419311">Figure 4</xref>) were simultaneously measured on the 10/F, which was the most densely populated floor in the building during office hours (09:00 to 18:00) on Sunday (September 12, 2010) and Monday (September 13, 2010), to reveal the indoor temperature distribution during natural and mechanical conditions in the summer.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11419311">Figure 5</xref> shows a general picture of the temperature and air evaluations from the occupants’ point of view. All questions were answered on a scale from 1 to 7, except for productivity perception, which ranged from –20% to +20%. The ‘square’ represents good performance against other buildings in the BUS dataset; the ‘circle’ indicates typical performance, while ‘diamond’ represents bad performance. Based on this figure, the building scored highly on most aspects by the occupants. Remarkably, there was no indication of poor performance. The occupants were highly satisfied with the indoor temperatures in the summer (mean score: 4.98), the indoor air in the summer (5.04) and winter (4.86). They also expressed that the working environment was comfortable overall (5.41) and more healthy (5.06). Their productivity (+13.18%) was adequately enhanced with respect to their experience of using the building. The temperatures in the winter (4.51) were rated as typical and did not differ from the dataset. Approximately 12% of the respondents were dissatisfied with temperatures in the summer and 20% were dissatisfied with temperatures in the winter. Although the thermal environment of the building generally satisfied 80% of the respondents, the building manager should also take note of the minority complaints.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11419311">Figure 6</xref> shows the discomfort sources. The temperature was considered to be cold both in the summer (4.48) and winter (5.07). The air in the two seasons was reported to be humid (summer: 4.29; winter: 4.14) and draughty (summer: 4.48; winter: 4.7). Complaints about summer temperatures were mainly from those working near the chilled air outlets of the air-conditioners.

<p>Individual control is an important index to better performance and can improve occupant thermal satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419311">20</xref>]. In this study, the occupants were requested to assess their level of control over the heating, cooling and ventilation conditions of the indoor environment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11419311">Figure 7</xref> shows the responses from this survey compared to those from the BUS benchmarking system. The occupants reported a substantial level of control over cooling (4.79) and ventilation (4.53) conditions, but they were dissatisfied with their control of the heating system because there were no heating degree days in the area, and there was no heating provided in the offices in the winter.
<fig id="fig7-1420326X11419311" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Benchmarking personal control against the Building Use Studies (BUS) dataset.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419311-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship that could exist between the evaluations of temperature and air, controls and perceptions of health and productivity. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the linearity between these variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419311">Table 2</xref> summarizes the correlation analysis among the comfort variables. Levels of satisfaction with temperatures and air were significantly related to overall comfort, perceived health and productivity. Thus, in this building, office workers who expressed a high satisfaction with the temperature or air would tend to report improved health and productivity. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419311">Table 3</xref> shows the correlation analysis between environmental control and comfort. Control of heating, cooling and ventilation conditions was significantly associated with satisfaction with thermal comfort, overall comfort, health and productivity. Thus, occupants who reported more control over the indoor environment expressed improved comfort and productivity.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11419311">Figure 8</xref> depicts variations in temperatures during the summer. During the measurement period, the building’s indoor temperature was stably in the range from 24°C to 28°C, except on the 10/F and 8/F, where temperatures were below 24°C during office hours. This was a result of the two floors being used as the main office areas, which were regularly and densely occupied. On the Thursday afternoon, the occupants evacuated the main office areas for a weekly meeting and the cooling system was shut down to save energy. Thus, the temperatures during Thursday’s office hours were different. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1420326X11419311">Figure 9</xref> shows variations in the winter indoor temperatures. The indoor temperature varied with the outdoor temperature. The temperature also varied greatly among the five measured floors. The temperatures on the 8/F and 10/F were relatively higher than those on the other floors, especially during office hours. Dense occupancy on these two floors was an important factor for this difference. The human activities and other normal heat loads contributed to a 3°C difference between densely occupied and sparsely occupied floors. This difference was exaggerated on colder days.

</p>
<p>This building did not satisfy comfort requirements in the winter, especially on cold days such as December 16, 2010. In the summer, the temperatures on the 4/F, 7/F and 9/F during office hours were approximately in accordance with the requirement of the China GBL (25°C for cooling seasons); while on the densely occupied 8/F and 10/F, the summer temperatures during office hours were much lower (22.6–24.8°C) than that on other floors.</p>
<p>Five location points were simultaneously measured on the 10/F, which was the most densely populated floor in the building during office hours (09:00 to 18:00) on Sunday (September 12, 2010) and Monday (September 13, 2010), to reveal the indoor temperature distribution under natural and mechanical conditions in the offices during the summer. A box-plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1420326X11419311">Figure 10</xref> shows the temperature distribution on the 10/F under natural ventilation for 5 scattered points during office hours on Sunday (09:00–18:00 of September 12, 2010). The temperature was relatively stable. Another box-plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1420326X11419311">Figure 11</xref> illustrates mechanically controlled conditions on the same floor during office hours on Monday (09:00–18:00 of September 13, 2010). The temperatures measured at the 5 location points were significantly different, especially at Point 2, where the temperature was much lower than other points. This difference was more than 2°C. Only the temperatures at Points 1 and 4 satisfied the China GBL’s requirement of 25°C for cooling days. The location of the chilled air outlets of the air-conditioners was an influential factor and Point 2 was located directly under an outlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1420326X11419311">Figure 12</xref>).

<sec id="sec10-1420326X11419311"><title>Finding</title>
<p>This article presents subjective and objective evaluations of the thermal environment in a high-level green office building in China. The occupant survey showed there was a high level of satisfaction amongst the occupants with the building’s indoor temperature, air quality, overall comfort and perceived health and productivity. The objective measurement in the building showed that the building’s indoor temperature could vary in the offices of different floors in both the summer and winter. The variation was mainly due to the occupancy conditions. The following are the three key findings of this study:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Subjective evaluation showed that occupants who were satisfied with the temperature and air in the building were more likely to report that their health and productivity were improved. Additionally, users who perceived a high level of environmental control tended to be more healthy and productive. This agrees with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419311">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419311">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11419311">21</xref>] and demonstrates the importance of the thermal environment in shaping occupants’ perception of health and the ability to increase satisfaction levels by designing individual environmental controls.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although the thermal environment satisfied the majority of occupants, 12% and 20% reported dissatisfaction with summer and winter temperatures, respectively. Objective measurements agreed with the perception of cold winter temperatures revealing the potential shortcomings of sustainable building design in humid subtropical climates, where natural ventilation and passive cooling would predominate in the sustainable building design while cold air in winter would tend to be neglected. The perception of cold in the summer and the contrasting temperatures measured at various workstations on the 10/F indicated another source of discomfort due to the poor integration of workstations planning and mechanical cooling outlet design.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When the building was air-conditioned during the summer, the indoor temperature of certain sparsely occupied floors (4/F, 7/F and 9/F) complied with the requirements of the China GBL system (25°C for cooling seasons). However, given the dense occupancy conditions and workstations locations on the 8/F and 10/F, the thermal environment was complicated and did not satisfy requirements.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11419311"><title>Implications</title>
<p>Green building design and evaluations should address the following three issues:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Although maximizing natural ventilation is an important sustainable design strategy to reduce energy load in the summer, the discomfort that could be caused by the cold air should be avoided during the winter in humid subtropical climate areas where heating is not considered in the building design. Temporary heating strategies such as a portable heater should be provided to alleviate the extreme cold days. In the meantime, the individual control could significantly improve the satisfaction level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The mechanical ventilation should be integrated with interior design to remove discomfort sources at the beginning. In the study, the occupants reported discomfort at workstations right under cool air outlets. The layout of workstations was designed separately from air-conditioning system outlet design. There was a lack of coordination between mechanical designers and interior designers. The study has emphasized a need for an integrated design process where different professions should work together from the beginning of the project to remove any possible discomfort sources.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A general criterion for temperature may not be an effective design guide for green buildings. Occupancy conditions and user behaviors were identified as two important contributors to variations in the thermal environment, and these would likely affect the deviations of green buildings from predicted performances. More sophisticated design guidelines should be considered in China’s green building rating system.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X11419311"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were three main limitations in this study.
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The number of sensors was insufficient to represent the large area of office spaces on the different floors for simultaneous monitoring of various workstations in different locations and during different seasons.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The subjective evaluation was based on an international benchmark database from several countries because local benchmarking for buildings in China was limited.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This study focused on the thermal environment and largely disregarded other aspects of green building performance, such as lighting and water use. The results of this study are expected to elicit additional research and contribute to the discussion of post-occupancy evaluations in green buildings, especially in China, where there has been a strong growth in the construction sector and adoption of the green building rating system are relatively new compared to some western countries. Post-occupancy evaluations should become a routine in the green building certification process to demonstrate sustainable performance after construction and during operation.</p></list-item>
