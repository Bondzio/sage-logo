<abstract>
<p>The concept of ‘hegemonic masculinity’ continues to be used widely in gendered studies of men and masculinities, though this does not signify consensus on its meaning and conceptual value. In this article we introduce some different ways in which the concept has been used theoretically, and compare two different political and conceptual locations in which it has been employed, namely South Africa and Sweden. This arises from a collaborative project between teams of researchers based in these two countries. The goal of this project is to review critically and reflexively the use of the concept and associated concepts in the gendered, largely feminist and profeminist, national literatures in the two countries. While both countries have strong feminist traditions, they are distinguished by marked differences in history, geopolitical location and socio-economic structure. This in turn raises more general questions around the relation of the traveling of theory and concepts, and national and transnational context.</p>

<p>Though explicitly gendered research on men has increased rapidly over the last 30 years or more, the subfield is not characterized by unanimity. There are many areas in which disagreement is evident and many concepts remain contested. One such concept is that of “hegemonic masculinity.” The concept was developed originally by Raewyn Connell and collaborators in the late 1970s, and from early on was used in several ways (Connell 1983; Carrigan, Connell, and Lee 1985). On some occasions it concerned hegemony as related to the power of a specific group of men, seeking to explain how, without obvious recourse to violence or physical power, they occupied a hierarchical position in society to the detriment of women and those excluded from power. At other times it referred to embodied, collective practice, a set of social processes, as the center in a relational gender system, to which other positions relate, a normative structure, to which all or almost all men aspire or from which all or almost all men gain, as in the patriarchal dividend.</p>
<p>Hegemonic masculinity has been conceptualized in many ways, but perhaps most usually as an ideal, a set of values, established by men in power that functions to include and exclude, and to organize society in gender unequal ways. It combines several features: a hierarchy of masculinities, differential access among men to power (over women and other men), and the interplay between men’s identity, men’s ideals, interactions, power, and patriarchy. Drawing on Gramsci’s ideas of hegemony, the concept shows that power does not have to be enforced with direct violence or the naked display of power but can be exercised subtly on a foundation of consent, acquiescence, and institutional power.</p>
<p>While the concept has been taken up in many different fields, it remains both controversial and open to various critiques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X11432111">Hearn 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X11432111">Howson 2006</xref>), and highly influential. In 2005, Connell and Messerschmidt mounted a defence of the concept though many difficulties in using it persist. Among these difficulties are What is hegemonic masculinity—is it a social structure or process that organizes the gendered lives of men or something that constantly made in ceaseless masculine performances? How does hegemonic masculinity operate in day-to-day relations? If hegemonic masculinity is fairly easy to identify in history or in macro sociological analyses, can it be so readily identified in the daily doings of men? And does hegemonic masculinity exist in the same way in all settings? Do all, or most, men contribute to the construction of hegemonic masculinity and if so, how? Is it possible to conceptualize of hegemonic masculinity in a gender equitable way or is it necessarily implicated in patriarchy? For example, while the most well-cited definition of hegemonic masculinity specifies that it is “… the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of legitimacy of patriarchy …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X11432111">Connell 1995</xref>, 77), it is now asserted by some commentators that it is possible for hegemonic masculinity to take a gender equitable form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X11432111">Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>). This remains an ambiguity in uses of the concept, and takes on added resonance when attempts are made to apply the concept cross-culturally and indeed transhistorically. We hope our work contributes to this debate. The concept has an interesting and, in some ways, contradictory relation to that of patriarchy. Specifically, the concept of hegemonic masculinity was developed in the late 1970s at the same time as that of patriarchy was being critiqued by some feminists as too monolithic, ethnocentric, and one dimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X11432111">Beechey, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X11432111">Rowbotham 1979</xref>). Revised accounts of patriarchy attempted to historicize, diversify, and pluralize patriarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1097184X11432111">Walby 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X11432111">Hearn 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1097184X11432111">Connell’s 1985</xref> own critique of gender categoricalism can be seen as part of a critique of the concept of patriarchy or a plea for a contextualized, dynamic model of patriarchal relations, adding further ambiguity.</p>
<p>Connell’s theories can be seen as a set of tools and concepts that can be applied rather broadly. Over recent decades the subfield of studies of men and masculinities has diversified greatly and spread to many different contexts. As scholarship grows, so increasingly difficult questions have been asked in both theoretical and empirical work. These questions have in some cases sought to refine the concept, in others to undermine it or limit it or focus it on a more specific set of processes. Questions about its value continue to develop, in part with the growing complexity of feminist, queer, and critical gender theory.</p>
<p>In the two articles that accompany this introduction, the authors engage with the strengths and weaknesses of the concept, as used to theorize men and masculinity, and show how national contexts have exercised an influence on the way the concept has been used and debated, including amongst both us and the larger group in this whole project.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1097184X11432111">1</xref>
</sup> These paired articles that follow arise from comparative, collaborative research on the use and application of the concept in two very different countries: South Africa and Sweden. The joint project brings together research teams of researchers across eight institutions, four in each country, engaged in theorizing and researching men and masculinities. The teams have shared their respective findings in their different national settings to enhance understanding of how men relate to power, how they use power, contribute and reproduce it or indeed are abused by it, and how this can be changed. The concept is thus examined in two national settings where the concept has been put to work to generate appraisal and critique, as well as advance context-specific understandings of men’s power.</p>
<p>In this sense, these two articles are selective critical reviews of literature with a focus on how hegemonic masculinity has been variably used. The project also aims to deepen the understanding of how to approach work that involves men in seeking to contribute to gender equity and gender equality,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1097184X11432111">2</xref>
</sup> reduce gender-based violence, and improve men’s health. In view of the importance and urgency of these issues, as well as the attention they have received in research, in the two articles following we give special attention to selected themes that have emerged in these national contexts: boys and young men in education and family, violence and health. The collaboration is particularly interested in gender change and how the ideals of men’s behavior alter. While there are marked differences between Sweden and South Africa, for example in terms of poverty, both countries share a strong formal and explicit commitment to gender equity. This context is an important framing for the project. Our concern is to examine “hegemony” in national contexts which both feature formal commitment to gender equity but which are marked by very different gender orders.</p>
<p>Our choice of the two national contexts is partly determined by a history of collaboration between the two first authors who first met in 1997 in South Africa and who since have collaborated in several projects on gender, men, masculinity, and violence. Beyond these personal connections, there are compelling reasons for focusing on Sweden and South Africa as comparative cases on the use of hegemonic masculinity. As we show below and in the essays that follow, the gender politics of the two countries differ markedly, reflecting very different politicogeographical locations and histories. The populations of the two countries are vastly different in terms of resources, with Sweden being a well-resourced, high-income nation with relatively small gaps between rich and poor, male and female, and South Africa a middle-income country with huge differentials of wealth between male and female, black and white, and one of the highest Gini coefficients in the world. Sweden was recently placed as the fourth most gender equal country in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1097184X11432111">Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi 2010</xref>). South Africa, on the other hand, was placed twelfth, and has a mixed record, with high levels of female representation in politics, but very high levels of gender-based violence, particularly rape and intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>In global political terms, South Africa is considered, particularly on the basis of Nelson Mandela’s presidency, to have emerged as a major spokesperson for the nonaligned countries, particularly for and of the “South.” Sweden, on the other hand, despite strong social justice credentials, is part of the wealthy “North.” Intellectually, South Africa has been located largely within an Anglo lineage, drawing on literatures from the metropole (including Marxist and other critical traditions), whereas Sweden, while drawing on North European intellectual traditions, has its own deep traditions, including an indigenous feminism. On the other hand, both countries share a strong commitment to social justice, in both policy and law. Gender equity movements exist in both countries and, within these, there have been attempts to include and work with men. Sweden and South Africa therefore suggest particularly interesting illustrative examples of how men and masculinity have been conceptualized and how the concept of hegemonic masculinity has been utilized in gender analysis. In these contexts, a challenge is to analyze the hegemony of men not just to explain how men’s power is translated into gender inequalities, and to search for evidence that changes in masculinity are occurring which contain potential to assist progress toward gender equity and to understand what influences these processes.</p>
<p>There are vast differences in gender/gendered history and politics between the two countries. South Africa has had a long colonial history beginning with Dutch expansionism and consolidated in the nineteenth century as a key wealth-generating part of the British Empire. Contemporary South African society cannot be understood outside this history, the racial politics of apartheid up until its end in the period 1990–1994, and the extent of basic poverty. The post-apartheid period has entailed universal suffrage, and a strong program of legal civil rights, even as class, gender, and race inequalities have persisted. High levels of interpersonal violence and sexual violence continue in the post-apartheid period, for example, in the recent survey study of over 1700 men by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X11432111">Jewkes and colleagues (2009)</xref> over 27 percent reported that had raped a woman or girl. On the other hand, South Africa has undergone major changes in the gender structure of public life, particularly in parliament where close to half of the parliamentarians and ministers are women.</p>
<p>Historically, Sweden has formerly up to nineteenth century been the center of its own northern European empire and is the most populous of the Nordic countries. Key features that bear on contemporary Swedish society include the national class settlement of the 1930s that laid the basis of the welfare state and <italic>folkhem</italic> (people’s home), the well-elaborated postwar social democratic gender equality project, the relatively equal social infrastructure, and yet a labor market strongly differentiated along gender lines. The situation on violence is more complex. In many respects there are relatively low levels of homicide and interpersonal violence, along with much recent policy action against violence to women and children, and criminalization of buying, but not selling, of sex. Yet, Sweden has the highest <italic>reporting</italic> rate for rape in Europe at 46.5 per 100,000 residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1097184X11432111">Diesen, Lovett, and Kelly 2009</xref>). The reporting rate increased four-fold 1977–2006, in part through change in legal definitions and awareness raising, and the conviction rate is low, at 12 percent in 2005. These figures are, however, highly contested, as a comparative indicator of sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1097184X11432111">Kelly and Regan 2001</xref>). For example, in 2001 Greece with a similar population size to Sweden had about 10 times less reporting than Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1097184X11432111">Regan and Kelly 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also major differences in the state of research and higher education generally and the extent and diversity of studies on men and masculinities. There are also more specific differences in researchers’ orientation to the concept in the two countries. There is, for example, a longer national set of different Swedish language traditions in Sweden with regard to feminist and gender studies on men and masculinities, such as on “gender contracts” (Hirdman 1990, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1097184X11432111">2001</xref>) and “(un)manliness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1097184X11432111">Liljeqvist 1999</xref>). On the other hand, in South Africa research on men and masculinities has grown considerably since the end of apartheid, and questions of race and gender are highlighted. At the same time, there are some interesting similarities between the two countries, in terms of the close relations of academic research and policy intervention, and the centrality of questions of health, violence, and youth. There are also some similarities around difference and diversity: the variable use of the concept, the existence of generational issues among researchers, and differences in perspective within the national research teams themselves.</p>
<p>This kind of project involves some deep-seated challenges in terms of the relations of the South and the North, of the Anglo and the non-Anglo, of feminism and men, margins and center, and positioning and reflexivity. The individual researchers involved in the project have diverse theoretical positionings in relation to the concept. For example, Morrell has been instrumental in bringing the concept into the South African debate, partly through an initial international conference in Durban in 1997 and subsequent forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X11432111">Morrell 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X11432111">2001</xref>), while Nordberg has been central in Sweden in mediating debate on hegemonic masculinity with theoretical developments in Swedish feminist and queer research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X11432111">Nordberg 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11432111">2005</xref>). This raises challenges in how to approach the material, critically and reflexively.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are interested in how feminist and profeminist theory and practice operate in a Southern strongly Anglo-framed context and a Northern non-Anglo context, and how both respond to concepts developed in the geographical Anglophone South, if not the economic or political South. In the Swedish case, the “weak breadwinner model” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X11432111">Sainsbury 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1097184X11432111">Sommestad 1997</xref>) has impacted on how masculinity and gender equality politics have been configured. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X11432111">Mellström (2005)</xref> argues that relatively weak gender regimes have been able to develop in part from the peripheral location of these societies outside the main centers of power. On the other hand, Sweden and other Nordic countries should not be seen as operating outside postcolonial/colonial social relations and gender relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X11432111">Keskinen et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, as hegemonic masculinity has gained almost hegemonic status within critical studies on men and masculinities, the concept needs to be recontextualized in relation to contemporary feminist interventions and critiques of the Anglo domination of theory and the “mixed blessings” this brings for scholars in the semiperipheries of the global academic structure (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X11432111">Yuval-Davis, Kannabiran, and Vieten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X11432111">Blagojević 2009</xref>). This concept, itself an example of traveling theory, certainly brings some theoretical and pedagogical insights, but it also needs rethinking critically in different societal, cultural, and indeed transnational contexts.</p>
<p>As a final word of introduction, we should add that this project also engages gender activists in South Africa and Sweden in order to reflect on how the theoretical work can inform and be informed by the applied work of gender practitioners. The quest to understand men, masculinities, and hegemonic masculinity is theoretically important but also has major if contested implications for applied gender work. New understandings of male/men’s power have the potential to contribute to processes in which men actively and consciously produce alternative (and counter-hegemonic) forms of masculinity which explicitly eschew violence and endorse the principle of (gender) equity.</p>
