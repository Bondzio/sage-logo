<p>The Road to Emmaus</p>
<p>One Friday night, I happened to be watching a programme which told the story of the railway from Kalka to Shimla in Northern India. The families who went out and were stationed near Calcutta or Bombay ( Mumbai as it now is) faced a choice. Either they kept their children with them facing the heat and potential ill health, or they sent them to Shimla, hours away in the foothills of the Himalayas where it was cool. The result was two-fold: Shimla became a place where families holidayed and which was noted for its excellent schools; and also, it became an important and busy railway destination.</p>
<p>Looking at the variety of trains and engines, you could almost imagine yourself back in the world of Thomas the Tank Engine, only without the faces, and the scenery through which they pass seems to come from a story book too. If you travel first class (£2.00 for a five-hour trip) you get soft seats, and a breakfast of toast and scrambled egg and tea, brought by vendors at every station. In fact the trains are diesel not steam, and since they were there in the great age of trains, when the British still ruled India, they have to be rigorously maintained to keep them going at all. Some of the rolling stock has been in use for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, after the British left, Shimla went into an economic depression, but they have recovered. The town is very busy with tourists all year: backpackers from all over the world as well as more up-market tourists. It is a favourite destination for railway clubs, people who are enthralled by railways but can no longer see anywhere in Europe the kind of trains that can be seen along that piece of track. It is that Thomas element again – train spotters heaven. One woman described it as the journey of a lifetime.</p>
<p>I think if I had been on the road to Emmaus with those two disciples, it would have been the journey of a lifetime. Travelling from all the bitter shock of grief to new life in a few short miles! Was there ever a journey so filled with promise?</p>
<p>There are so many unanswered questions. Why did they set off when everyone else was staying around Jerusalem? Why go there, unless one of them lived there, or had relatives there and was expected? They must have thought the road was safe enough, perhaps there were many pilgrims beginning to head home after Passover. It cannot have been the scenario I have always imagined, the two of them on a long deserted road and Jesus joining them there. There must have been others on the road, even patrols of Roman soldiers. Why didn’t his disciples recognise him? Was he so terribly changed? And he was no ghost, so where did he come from, and where did he go to, when that flash of recognition came to them?</p>
<p>Anyway they set off for the village of Emmaus and, naturally, fell to talking about the events they had witnessed in the capital. And Jesus himself drew near. It is a funny verb, this ‘drawing near’. It doesn’t just mean came alongside or happened upon. It was used when God approached the mountain of Sinai to meet the slave-nation of Israel after their wonderful deliverance from the Egyptians in the story of the Exodus. That was the point when God called to himself a people, when he chose a nation to be his for all of time.</p>
<p>It was used again, at one of the most dangerous points for God’s nation, when they were sliding into the worship of other gods - when Elijah, the prophet of Israel, held a competition with the prophets of the local Canaanite god, Baal. They were to build altars of wood and sacrifice a bullock, but no fire was to be placed under the altar. The prophets had to call on Baal for the fire to light the sacrifice, which they did, all day, calling ‘O Baal, answer us’ and nothing happened.</p>
<p>Then it was Elijah’s turn. And he ‘drew near’ to the people and asked them ‘how long will you go limping between two opinions, if the Lord is God follow him, but if Baal, then follow him’. When he was building the altar he called to the people again to ‘draw near’ to him, and once his sacrifice was laid on the wood, he prayed:</p>
<p>‘O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel’. Then fire fell from heaven, the sacrifice was consumed, and the people said, ‘the Lord indeed is God.’</p>
<p>And now Jesus ‘draws near’ to these two disciples, who were in crisis after the devastating events of that Friday. ‘What were you discussing?’ he asked them, prompting the amazed question about whether he was the only stranger in Jerusalem who hadn’t heard what had happened. You see, like them, he was headed away from Jerusalem. They told him all about Jesus and his cruel crucifixion and added the poignant note, ‘We were hoping he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.’ They also told him about the visit of the women to the tomb and the story they brought back to the disciples – but they had not seen him, they said.</p>
<p>So he began again at the beginning, starting with Moses and the call of the people, and from that people a Christ. He explained all this, and when they came to the village, they urged him not to go on alone, but to come into the house and eat with them. And when they were reclining at the table, he reached over and took the loaf, blessed it and broke it, and handed it to them. Then and only then, they knew him.</p>
<p>We all know that they turned around and began the journey back to Jerusalem, found the disciples, and told them the news – the good news-beginning with Moses, and the call of a people, and from that people a Christ, who was the one who was going to redeem his people all along. And that even as they were telling the tale, he was there with them, offering peace and proofs,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>‘touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have’</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He had ‘drawn near’ to those two disciples, as the power of God falls on those who are in crisis, to create and resolve a crisis. ‘How long will you go limping between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him.’</p>
<p>He was headed in the same direction as they were, coming from Jerusalem, coming from the dark events that had left them reeling and saddened, and leading them towards hope. ’Weren’t our hearts burning within us as he talked with us on the road?’ And in our life’s journey, Jesus, the Christ, is always headed in the same direction as we are, always coming from our hopeless situations, always leading us towards life.</p>
<p>And isn’t he always recognisable to us in those distinctive and totally commonplace actions: in taking bread, in blessing bread, in breaking bread, in giving us bread, in learning and in eating together. By these things, we know him and follow him.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It was the journey of a lifetime. It is the journey of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Lord of the heavens and of the earth,</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We, your people, lose sight of you. In dark days when our prayers seem unanswered, we cannot see you. When the things for which we hoped seem to lie on the ground in ruins, we cannot see you.</p>
<p>Open our eyes, as you did for those two disciples. Let us, in torn bread, know you and ourselves, Amen.</p>
