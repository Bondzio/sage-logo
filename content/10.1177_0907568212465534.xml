<p>One of the notions that have recently started appearing in the pages of this journal is ‘postcolonial’. Though employed sporadically to designate the newly independent states that gained sovereignty after the Second World War, the notion’s first theoretical use in this journal dates back to 2009. In ‘“<italic>I’m just me!</italic>” Children talking beyond ethnic and religious identities’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568212465534">Farzaneh Moinian (2009)</xref> explores how five children born in Sweden whose parents were born in Iran talk about their own cultural and ethnic backgrounds and the role these play in their lives. The author argues that children resist oversimplification, reductionism and categorization based on their cultural or ethnic backgrounds and refers to postcolonial theorist Homi Bhabha’s notion of ‘the third space’. This notion is seminal for understanding the dynamics of identity negotiation in minority communities. For Bhabha the third space is a temporary area of contingency where hybrid identities can be performed by giving new meanings to existing cultural symbols, including language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568212465534">Bhabha, 1994</xref>). Also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568212465534">Irina Schmitt (2010)</xref> hints at postcolonial theory when discussing young people’s competences in creating and criticizing belonging in Germany and Canada. She writes that her work is ‘inscribed on discussions of the role of gender in the understanding of national belonging, as reflected in the discourses of “traditional” vs “modern” femininities and masculinities that are used to explicitly and implicitly exclude non-western conceptualizations from participation in western societies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568212465534">2010</xref>: 165). One year later, in the special issue on Indian childhood, Sircar and Dutta explicitly find inspiration in feminist postcolonial theory to critically discuss the relationship between Kolkata’s sex workers’ children and their self-appointed western saviours. In criticizing the latter’s drive to save the children by taking them out of their ‘hell holes’ the authors seek to uncover how children practise resilience through tacit negotiations between transgression and conformity. Rather than finding a definition that will make sex workers’ children’s lives easily understood to ‘mainstream’ society, the authors use postcolonial theory to attempt to represent these children’s vision of themselves and of their struggles to eke out a place in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568212465534">Sircar and Dutta, 2011</xref>: 335). An overkill of images and narratives of and about child soldiers in Africa produced in the North are also what enjoins Catarina Martins to use postcolonial theory. The images, she claims, are ideological constructs essentializing a hierarchically superior northern Self and a civilizationally inferior South for the purpose of legitimizing political and military intervention, as well as economic exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568212465534">2011</xref>: 437). This is also the case, she claims, when former child soldiers testify to the legitimacy of such representations in documentary film, for their ‘unconstrained behaviour and speech … [make such testimonies] an unsustainable fiction, not only because of the filming crew of white foreigners, but because many of the sequences have been staged, as the position of the camera often reveals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568212465534">Martins, 2011</xref>: 438). In African fiction (both films and novels), by contrast, Martins finds different conceptions of children and their roles in armed conflict that testify to the strength and creativity of a culture of resistance against colonial domination.</p>
<p>Being mainly concerned with the literary and artistic expressions such as literature and film emerging from the (post-)colonial encounter, postcolonial theory has become popular in the humanities rather than the social sciences. Researchers publishing in this journal, being largely concerned with empirical research in the field of sociology and anthropology, have therefore understandably felt reticent to engage with such a field of studies. But, as the authors mentioned above suggest, postcolonialism has already attracted social scientists in a number of fields and may prove particularly interesting for those, as scholars publishing in <italic>Childhood</italic>, who work on globalization and development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568212465534">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As I spell out below, my use of the ambiguous ‘childhood(s)’ in the title of this editorial is purposeful. Reflecting on the usefulness of some postcolonial ideas and perspectives I put forward that there is much to say in favour of accepting a degree of ambiguity for some time to come. I contend that we need to open up spaces of knowledge production to views and experiences that tend to be systematically dismissed if not simply ignored and that accepting a degree of indeterminacy is crucial to this endeavour. I briefly touch upon three main difficulties that many of us encounter that make the opening up of these spaces particularly important. First, as recurrently remarked upon in the pages of this journal, the dominance of the North over the South is inextricably linked to Northern childhood(s) representations against which Southern childhood(s) are measured and found wanting. I argue that this is a false opposition. The normative dominance of Northern childhood(s) translates, secondly, in an overproduction of knowledge based in disciplinary strongholds that resist critique of their Eurocentrism. Postcolonialism can help subvert this process. The analysis of children’s agency, finally, while playing a seminal role in addressing the two first limitations runs up against a lack of imagination about its wider social, political and ethical implications and risks missing its radical edge. But let me first quickly say a few general words on postcolonialism and why it may be important for the study of childhood(s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0907568212465534">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In its broadest sense, postcolonialism is concerned with challenging the unquestioned Eurocentric ways of looking at the world and seeks to open up intellectual spaces for those who are termed ‘subalterns’. This latter term is used to designate the oppressed people who during the period of European colonial domination have systematically been represented as having no agency or voice and are so also today. The backbone of the drive to colonize was formed by racist theories of white supremacy that were used to legitimize the violent subjugation of darker people in distant countries. The so-called ‘white man’s burden’ depicted the colonized as in need of rescue and enlightenment, typically singling out and magnifying the alleged abuses, such as child marriages and infanticide, that primitive or oriental men would visit upon children (and women). What would justify the role of the colonizer is that the colonized were considered amenable to becoming civilized if put under the guidance of the enlightened European race that God would have singled out for this task. The depiction of colonized people as historically occupying a lower rung on the ladder leading to the higher, European civilization, showed remarkable parallels with theories of child development that were emerging at the same time in Europe. As Ashis Nandy claimed some time ago, colonialism and childhood are inseparably harnessed together for interpreting human life as a trajectory leading towards increasing and endless perfectibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568212465534">Nandy, 1984/2007</xref>). Only when both the child and the colonized could be envisioned as representing imperfect specimens of the enlightened European man (in other words as vulnerable, passive and irrational ‘becomings’), did the endless effort to realize what is now termed ‘development’ – both of the child and of the world – gain currency to the point of being, today, dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568212465534">Burman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568212465534">Cannella and Soto, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One would however be deeply mistaken, I believe, in seeing in postcolonialism a theoretical justification for anti-western sentiment or for rejecting such ‘constructs’ as modern childhood or children’s rights because they would be western inventions. They are not. Foregrounding that representations of the colonized Other buttressed feelings of racial superiority that made western self-aggrandizement possible, postcolonialism challenges the very binary on which these representations were based. From the beginning of colonial expansion the colonial world was part and parcel of the production of modernity and therefore also of ideas and practices shaping both children’s lives and childhood(s). Representations of the colonized as traditional and incapable of change went hand in hand with interventions that radically transformed the lives of colonized people, and of children in particular. For the very project of colonial transformation to be at all possible, the colonized needed to be perceived as traditional and incapable of change. By the same token, the colonizer could only conceive of his/her civilizing mission as arising from the Enlightenment that the white race would have achieved, with the help of God, all by itself. Discovering or inventing childhood (in the singular), as we all know, would have been part of this enlightenment and even today it is hard to find historical studies that challenge this belief. By seeking to distance itself from the colonial view of history, postcolonial theorists look for dissonance in this dominant narrative. Many childhood(s) researchers have of course done this already, contributing to a growing body of scholarship that defends the normality of Southern childhood(s) and tries to make it/them intelligible to Northern readerships. It would take me too far to mention these scholars here, but their work can easily be found in the past contributions to this journal. But we need more research and theorizing on how the colonial encounter affected not only pedagogical, juridical and social interventions in the lives of children in the South but in the North as well, in other words on how childhood(s) have been and still are globally constructed. The very North/South divide is an ideological construct and is in itself problematic. This is seminal to understanding the wider implications of the continuing overproduction of emotional representations of children in an imaginary South as the locus of all that is unfamiliar and repulsive. Rejecting the idea of modern childhood as a western discovery/invention, the postcolonial perspective can, in sum, inspire a more positive approach in which the routine ‘Us vs Them’ binary makes way for a conceptualization of childhood(s) as the unstable and contingent result of a situated encounter.</p>
<p>Postcolonialism’s invitation to look at the other side of the picture or even turn the world upside down, cannot be followed up without challenging current disciplinary boundaries that privilege normative representations of Northern, white, bourgeois childhood (in the singular) and produces by the same token ‘other’ childhoods (in the plural) – both in the North and the South – very much as colonial territories of the past: as epistemological empty spaces yet to be discovered and civilized. Inasmuch as we take a critical stance against the idea of an imaginary North making intellectual advances in the field of childhood(s) with respect to and without the Other, we must also challenge the disciplinary boundaries that reproduce this idea. Since, as postcolonial thinkers suggest, childhood(s) emerge from an unequal, situated encounter, we need to question compartmentalization into different fields of intervention – psychological, paediatric, pedagogical, educational, literary and so on – and resist the relegation of the study of ‘other’ childhoods to ‘lesser’ disciplines such as social work and social anthropology. As remarked by one of the earliest champions of the postcolonial turn in early childhood education, Radhika Viruru, challenging this compartmentalization is a phenomenal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568212465534">Viruru, 2005</xref>). But the task could be eased if, rather than merely criticizing disciplinary boundaries from within a discipline or, alternatively seeking to develop separate specialisms, as in childhood sociology and anthropology, academics would embrace postcolonialism’s eclecticism. Refusing to remain within established theoretical paradigms and disciplinary boundaries may ease the task of looking for the ‘margins’ that point at how childhood(s) is/are constantly and creatively being reinvented. Very much in the spirit of the cultural fusions now popular in the real world, it amounts to looking for the unexpected and contingent by freely borrowing and mixing concepts, data and methods and techniques of research from separate disciplines. Benjamin’s idea of a montage of seemingly unimportant ‘fragments’ – pictures, quotations, objects, descriptions – may for example be particularly revealing of aspects of children’s lives that rigorous research methodology and a systematic organization of data leave out. Disciplinary transgressions that put children’s perspectives and experiences, including their artistic, literary and material culture, at the centre of analysis can in sum offer a wealth of new information and support endeavours to take children seriously and stand by their side. This brings me to my third point.</p>
<p>Rather than replacing one theory with another, postcolonialism enjoins academics to abandon the high ground position from where they have usually sought to understand the world and to look up from a multiplicity of different, marginal positions. This change of position is remindful of what happens when an adult gets down on his or her knees to look at the world from the ever-changing perspective of young children. Many researchers who publish in the pages of this journal (and elsewhere) have remarked that seeing the world from children’s subject positions reveals their resilience, creativity and intelligence in confronting at times extremely challenging situations. For researchers concerned with achieving a more just world for children, establishing their agency has now become an obligatory act of faith and academic production on such issues as participation and voice has multiplied. This production needs however to confront political situations in which children and youth are under attack for disruptive behaviour ranging from alcohol and drug abuse, religious fanaticism, hooliganism, senseless violence to organized crime and terrorism. In a bid to justify harsh responses to children’s subversive behaviour, authorities cite academic research on childhood pathology that is presented as scientific and therefore universal and beyond question. At issue here is not only how mediatized representations of the pathological discipline children (and parents) into submission, but that this is achieved by foregrounding the negative side of children’s agency. Maintaining that children would have no right to transgress norms, to experiment with good and evil and learn from their experiences boils down to assume that they are, indeed, innocent and good by nature. To grow up into an unproblematic adulthood, they would only need to be protected from bad influences and helped to develop useful social skills. Children’s own creativity in challenging social injustices and reinventing childhood(s) is lost. Their agency can only be tolerated if it does not subvert or disturb, which, as postcolonialism suggests, by the very nature of childhood(s), it can hardly avoid doing.</p>
<p>Postcolonialism has been very much concerned with the cultural expressions of subversion and resistance of those who have no place in the academic world, who are portrayed as not to belong and whose knowledge and histories seem not to count. Robert Young reminds the academic world that these cultural expressions should be situated in the context: ‘of the political insights and experience that were developed in the course of colonial resistance to western rule and cultural dominance, primarily during the course of the anti-colonial struggles of the nineteenth and twentieth century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568212465534">Young, 2009</xref>: 13). Perhaps redundantly, these struggles were not limited to the colonial world but fed critically on the ideas and experiences of the subaltern and most particularly of what Young terms ‘translated’ people who, straddling different cultures, felt more acutely than others the injustices of colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568212465534">Young, 2003</xref>). Postcolonialism is therefore more than an exercise in taking shifting positions to better grasp the world as seen by those whose voices are seldom heard. It is also an attempt to challenge global inequality and enforce social justice. As colonial powers connived with male family heads to control children and explain their active roles in society away, holding out a promise of a better life to future generations has been one of the leading themes of anti-colonial movements. These were therefore also anti-authoritarian movements of youth (and gender) emancipation. They drew masses of children and youths convinced that their future depended upon subverting authority systems and reinventing themselves both as a generation and a nation. This active role of children and youth in the struggle for liberation and social justice is particularly interesting for stimulating a fresh and more comprehensive understanding of children’s agency. A telling historical example are the ‘Little Red Devils’ in the Chinese Red Army during the anti-Japanese war of 1930s China, whose roles in the war recognized and built on the special talents and strengths of children and drew them into participating in the struggles. Also in today’s China these roles still feed the representation of children as possessing a peculiar positive political energy and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568212465534">Woronow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568212465534">Xu Xu, 2011</xref>). Importantly, anti-colonial movements are not a thing of the past and they clearly appeal to the young for their engagement with the reinvention of both their societies and their identities. Nicolas Argenti provides for example an enlightening discussion of how, in many post-independence African countries, frustration about unmet promises has set in motion a huge exodus of youngsters from the rural areas and sparked a whole set of uprisings, millenarian movements and guerrilla wars that continue till this day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568212465534">Argenti, 2002</xref>: 124ff.). Recognizing children’s agency and trying to support their participation has, in sum, much to gain from looking for fragments of cultures of resistance and children’s roles in the situated encounters that are the focus of postcolonial studies.</p>
<p>The very intention of taking the child as a social ‘being’, rather than a ‘becoming’, that has been the concern of this journal for now 20 years, has meant a paradigmatic revolution of which the consequences are yet to be fully appreciated and explored. I do not believe that we have understood well enough what we designate as ‘global childhood’ to decide, as Jens Qvortrup and Chris Jenks sought to do some time ago in the pages of this journal, whether we should use the notion childhood or childhoods. This is something we should accept for some time to be and can only be solved if we allow postcolonial perspectives to lighten up our future areas of research.</p>
