<p>We consider a classical shock tube with Helium-filled driver section, and a driven section filled with a <italic>He</italic>–<italic>Ar</italic> gaseous mixture of continuously varying composition. We simulate a shock tube experiment, where the driven section composition starts out with pure Ar and ends with pure He (denoted ‘ − ’), or <italic>vice versa</italic> (denoted ‘+’). The initial pressures are 2 and 0.01 MPa. Two alternate initial species compositions are assumed: ‘Molar fraction’ – a linear distribution of the molar fraction; ‘Mass Fraction’ – a linear distribution of the mass fraction. Wave patterns arising in every case are presented and discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011408386"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Shocks propagating in a compressible medium undergo a sharp jump upon crossing a discontinuous change in the acoustic impedance. What kind of <italic>gradual</italic> change would be produced by a <italic>continuous</italic> variation in the acoustic impedance of the medium? We seek insight to the phenomena associated with this type of wave interactions, using numerical simulation of a classical shock tube configuration, where the driven section of the tube is initially filled with gaseous mixture having a continuously varying density, while the driver section is filled with a light gas: Helium. We contend that a shock tube experiment of this kind is realizable, as will be described in the sequel.</p>
<p>This study is motivated by several considerations. Turning to natural phenomena, the earth's atmosphere exhibits a continuous decrease in density and in acoustic impedance with increasing height. The proposed study can help in understanding the wave phenomena associated with air-blast generation by strong earthquakes, lightening, or volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>Shock interaction phenomena in a multi-species gaseous mixture of continuously varying composition (i.e. a gas of non-uniform molecular weight and polytropic index) take place in various scenarios related toengineering or industrial applications. Examples of adiabatic flow (i.e. no combustion), is the injection of gas (cold or hot) into a supersonic cross-flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011408386"><bold>1</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011408386"><bold>2</bold></xref>] motivated by possible application to missile attitude control. A numerical simulation of this flow field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011408386"><bold>2</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011408386"><bold>3</bold></xref>] is based on multi-species gas dynamics with evolving mixing, as well as wave interactions in the non-uniform multi-species gas flow. Gnemmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011408386"><bold>2</bold></xref>] report that the agreement between computational simulation and measurements confirmed that the force and moments provided by the computational code are sufficiently accurate to assess the jet efficiencyasan attitude control option. Another experimental side-jet research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011408386"><bold>4</bold></xref>] was aimed at studying fuel gas injection into a scramjet, where the interaction with supersonic cross-flow results in mixing and ignition. Arelated engineering application is the deflection of thrust vector by gas injection into a rocket exhaust nozzle, such as references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011408386"><bold>5</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011408386"><bold>6</bold></xref>]. In this case, an oblique shock wave is produced at a certain standoff distance upstream of the jet, clearly another instance of multi-species shock wave interaction.</p>
<p>Industrial safety scenarios often involve accidental release of high-pressure gas into surrounding air, such as the actual incident of hydrogen release in central Stockholm, analysed by Venetsanos <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011408386"><bold>7</bold></xref>]. In this case, it was important to obtain the correct mixing flow of the hydrogen jet in air, so that ignition may be correctly obtained in regions where hydrogen concentration is within the inflammability range. Here, again, shock wave phenomena play an important role. A supersonic jet flow into air always involves a series of oblique and normal shocks. These shocks may have triggered ignition, leading to an explosion as indeed happened within about 10 s from the onset of the accidental release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011408386"><bold>7</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>Obviously, in all these studies, the shock wave phenomena are quite complex, and although some of thepreviously quoted studies include comparison between measurements and computational simulations, a scheme validation can hardly be performed by relying on such complex flows (and the corresponding complex computational scheme). For that end, a simple system – such as our proposed one-dimensional shock tube configuration – is called for.</p>
<p>We simulate a hypothetical shock tube experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011408386">Fig. 1</xref>) in which the driven part (length 6 m) is divided into two segments separated by a sliding partition, and each segment is filled with a different gas at equal pressures (e.g. <italic>He</italic> and <italic>Ar</italic>). Before the shot (while having pure <italic>Ar</italic> or pure <italic>He</italic> at either side), the partition is carefully removed, allowing for inter-<?tjl?>diffusion of the two species. The initial temperature (294 K) and pressure (0.01 MPa) are uniform throughout the mixture. The driver part (4 m long) is filled with <italic>He</italic> at room temperature (294 K) and high pressure 2 MPa. As a result, the driven shock wave propagates into a gas of smoothly varying density (and molecular weight). The resulting post-shock flow is one-dimensional (1D) and unsteady, having lost its self-similarity due to the continuous variation in the driven gas composition. A numerical integration of the governing equations in (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>t</italic>) is hence required. The generlized Riemann problem (GRP) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011408386"><bold>8</bold></xref>] is used here in Eulerian coordinates; the scheme has been modified to treat a binary gaseous mixture of varying composition. The grid spacing is Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0.01 m (i.e. 1000 cells over the entire computational domain – a fairly refined grid).
<fig id="fig1-0954410011408386" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic shock tube diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011408386-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A similar flow configuration was investigated in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011408386"><bold>9</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011408386"><bold>10</bold></xref>], where the transmitted shock propagated into a medium consisting of <italic>discrete</italic> layers of heavy or light gas. While such case cannot be reproduced in a shock tube experiment, a configuration of <italic>continuously</italic> varying composition, of a type similar to the cases discussed here, can conceivably be experimentally realized as outlined above.</p>
<p>As to the computational method, an Euler solver for non-uniform ideal gas mixture, aimed in particular at treating numerically captured (1D) contact discontinuities was proposed by Jenny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011408386"><bold>11</bold></xref>]. Studies aimed at assessing explosion risks as a result of accidental hydrogen are motivated by the future possibility of using hydrogen combustion as a clean source of energy. For example, Venetsanos <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011408386"><bold>7</bold></xref>] have used computational fluid dyanmic methods to study an accidental hydrogen release (and subsequent explosion) from a rack of 18 vessels on a street in central Stockholm. Their study included simulating the hydrogen-air mixing flow, and eventual combustion (using detailed ignition kinetics) of the non-uniform mixture following ignition. Xu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410011408386"><bold>12</bold></xref>] used an arbitrary Lagrange–Euler approach to simulate the non-uniform hydrogen-air mixture near an outflow tube, aimed at minimizing numerical diffusion. Their mixing modelling accounted for molecular diffusion followed by turbulent mixing, all that was combined with detailed chemical kinetics simulation of ignition and subsequent combustion.</p>
<p>In this study, by contrast, we aim at exploring the nature of shock wave phenomena in gaseous mixtures, where the computational scheme is regarded as a means of producing such flow patterns in the form of numerical simulations (since no experimental data are available).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011408386"><title>2 THE GRP METHOD FOR GASEOUS MIXTURE</title>
<p>In our study, the fluid is taken to be a binary gaseous mixture, where the mass ratio of each species is assumed constant (in time) per fluid element. Physically speaking, this amounts to neglecting species inter-diffusion driven by gradients of concentration. In the short-time duration of the wave phenomena considered here, this assumption seems well justified.</p>
<p>Now, in the Euler coordinates (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>t</italic>) used by the governing equations that model the 1D flow of the mixture, the assumption that mixture composition is constant per particle is expressed as the condition that the composition is <italic>advected</italic> at the fluid velocity, as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954410011408386"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011408386-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>z</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>t</italic>) is the mass ratio of the first species in the binary mixture (in our sample results, where an <italic>He</italic>,<italic>Ar</italic> mixture is assumed, <italic>He</italic> was taken as the first species). Alternately, the advection condition can be recast in a conservation law form more suitable for the numerical integration scheme, as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0954410011408386"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011408386-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The 1D flow of a binary mixture is thus governed by the standard (Euler) equations for a compressible inviscid fluid (that express the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy), augmented by the species conservation law <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954410011408386">2</xref>, as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954410011408386"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011408386-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>

where <italic>u</italic>, <italic>p</italic>, <italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>e,</italic> and <italic>E</italic> are, respectively, the velocity, pressure, density, specific internal, and total energy; γis the polytropic index of the perfect gas equation of state.</p>
<p>Using standard relations for a mixture of perfect gas species, we get

where by <italic>W</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>W</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub>2</sub> the pure species properties denoted, and <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>t</italic>) the molar fraction of the first species.

<p>Turning to the finite-difference approximation, the method used here is the second-order accurate GRP scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011408386"><bold>8</bold></xref>]. This scheme has been extensively validated and documented. For studies where the GRP scheme was validated in a variety of experimental setups, we refer the reader to references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011408386"><bold>13</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011408386"><bold>17</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>The spatial domain is divided by grid points <italic>x</italic><sub>1+1/2</sub> into cells of equal length Δ<italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub>1+1/2</sub> − <italic>x</italic><sub>1−1/2</sub>, and the GRP scheme consists of the algorithm for integrating a discrete approximation to flow variables in cells by time steps Δ<italic>t</italic> = <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic>+1</sub> − <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, where <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> is a sequence of discrete time levels.</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the scheme is based on approximating the flow variables as piecewise linear per cell, leading to the evaluation of second-order accurate fluxes from analytic solutions to ‘GRP’ arising at cell interfaces. The GRP finite-difference integration by a single-time step Δ<italic>t</italic> = <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic>+1</sub> − <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> is given by

<sec id="sec3-0954410011408386"><title>3 RESULTS</title>
<p>The results of the decreasing density case (‘−’) with linear initial molar fraction distribution are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011408386">Fig. 2</xref>. The initial and final molar and mass distributions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011408386">Fig. 3</xref>. All physical profiles (mass density, pressure, velocity, etc.) are compared to therespective pure-gas shock tube configurations of <italic>He</italic>–<italic>He</italic> and <italic>He</italic>–<italic>Ar</italic>, where the comparison is always made when the transmitted shock is positioned near the end of the driven section. This comparison underlines the difference between the well-known shock-induced flow in the two pure-gas cases, and the flow in the continuously varying mixture under study here. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011408386">Fig 2</xref>, it is apparent that the pressure profile in the mixture case is intermediate between the corresponding pure-gas profiles. In the following,the wave patterns obtained in every one of the four types of Helium–Argon mixtures are considered and critically discussed.
<fig id="fig2-0954410011408386" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Pressure and velocity in the decreasing density case, initial linear molar fraction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011408386-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>

<p>The results of the decreasing density case (‘−’) with linear initial mass fraction distribution are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011408386">Fig. 4</xref>. The initial and final molar and mass distributions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011408386">Fig. 5</xref>. Clearly, a pronounced effect in this case is the acceleration of the driven mixture due to a continuous negative pressure gradient that evolved behind the incident shock. Similar results are observed in the linear initial molar fraction case, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011408386">Fig. 2</xref>. It is interesting to observe that this continuous acceleration has produced such high fluid velocity at the end of the driven section, exceeding the velocity attained in the corresponding pure <italic>He</italic>–<italic>He</italic> shock tube. The temperature in either initial distribution case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011408386">Fig. 6</xref>) is found to be intermediate between the corresponding two pure-gas shock tube levels. Perhaps an enhanced temperature peak may later evolve upon the shock reflection from the endwall, as a result of the high fluid velocity.

<p>Turning to the increasing density (‘+’) mixture, we look at the density and velocity distributions in the initial molar fraction case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011408386">Fig. 7</xref>). The corresponding initial molar and mass fractions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011408386">Fig. 8</xref>. The results for the initial mass fraction profile are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011408386">Figs 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011408386">10</xref>. A remarkable feature here is a left-facing shock wave that evolved in the initial molar fraction case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011408386">Fig. 7</xref>, at <italic>x</italic> ≈ 3.2). It seems to be analogous to a secondary shock that typically evolves in a spherical blast wave due to overexpansion of the high-pressure products core. Apparently, the initial density gradient in our <italic>planar</italic> case, produces a secondary shock effect that in a pure-species flow is produced by overexpansion in a <italic>spherically</italic> diverging flow. We do not know why no secondary shock evolves in the initial mass fraction case. In that case, no secondary shock is present; instead, a point of <italic>gradient discontinuity</italic> (at <italic>x</italic> ≈ 3) has evolved, indicating a curious type of interaction between continuous waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011408386">Fig. 9</xref>). Such special point <italic>must</italic> propagate along a characteristic line, clearly separating the main (left-facing) centred rarefaction wave (CRW) on its left side from a left-facing compression wave (CW) on the right. (Here, the density profile, rather than the pressure profile is shown, since in the density profile the CW is more clearly observed.) This conclusion is derived from the obtained profiles by the following reasoning. The wave on the right side of that point is compressive since it exhibits a negative velocity gradient, and that implies a compressive flow (in general, the material time-derivative of the specific volume is proportional to the velocity divergence). A (1D) CW must propagate in a direction opposite to the pressure (and hence density) gradient. Hence, the positive density gradient here implies a left-facing CW. Thus, the matching to the left-facing CRW is obtained at the point of gradient discontinuity that propagates along a <italic>C</italic><sup>−</sup> characteristic line, serving simultaneously as the ‘tail’ of the CRW, and as the ‘head’ of the CW. As a further support of these findings, the entropy profiles (actually, <italic>p</italic>/<italic>ρ</italic><sup>γ</sup>) in the two initial distribution cases are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011408386">Fig. 11</xref>). Indeed, it is continuous around <italic>x</italic> ≈ 3 in the CW case (bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011408386">Fig. 11</xref>), and shows a discontinuous increase to the right in the case, where a secondary shock has evolved (top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011408386">Fig. 11</xref>).

<p>Physically speaking, the CW obtained here is in agreement with the well-known fact that a left-facing reflected shock results from a right-facing incident shock that encounters an impedance increase at a contact discontinuity. In our study, the rise in acoustic impedance is <italic>smooth</italic>, producing a correspondingly <italic>smooth</italic> reflected wave, i.e. a CW instead of a shock wave. In the linear-molar case, that reflected CW is steeper, so that its leading part coalesces into a shock wave. Indeed, a careful inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011408386">Fig. 7</xref> reveals that the (left-facing) shock wave is trailed by a (left-facing) CW on its right side.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954410011408386"><title>4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The propagation of a planar shock wave in a gaseous mixture having continuously varying composition was studied numerically. The specific configurationwas a shock tube with <italic>He</italic> driver and a driven section consisting of an <italic>He</italic>–<italic>Ar</italic> mixture. It is suggested that such experiment is conceivably possible, for example by inter-diffusion of two pure species sub segments of either <italic>He</italic> or <italic>Ar</italic> each, some time prior to the onset of the loading of the driver segment and rupture of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>This study is of an exploratory nature. Not know in advance what kind of wave phenomena would evolve in this type of shock tube configuration. Numerical simulations are used to help understand the phenomena accompanying shock wave propagation into a gas where the density (and impedance) either increases, or decreases, continuously. In the decreasing impedance case, a negative pressure gradient evolved behind the shock front, accelerating the post-shock flow velocity to levels well above that obtained in any of the single-species shock tube cases. In the increasing impedance case, the evolving flow pattern is reminiscent of the system of transmitted-shock and reflected-shock, in that a ‘reflected’ smooth compression wave is formed immediately behind the shock front. When the initial molar fraction profile is linear, a secondary upstream-facing (left) shock wave has evolved. This wave is in (qualitative) analogy to the secondary inward-facing shock that typically results from over-expansion of the products gas when a spherical charge is detonated in air.</p>
<p>Evidently, the interaction between a shock wave and a segment of smoothly varying impedance is quite sensitive to the initial profile. Hence, the next logical stage in this study is to estimate the mixing profiles that may be obtained by inter-diffusion of pure species gases.</p></sec>
