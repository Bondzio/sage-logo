<abstract>
<p>The dorsoradial flap is a recently described cutaneous flap, which is harvested from the distal forearm and indicated for covering dorsal soft tissue defects of the hand and thumb. Vascularization of the flap is assured by a cutaneous branch of the radial artery, which arises at the level of the first intermetacarpal space and supplies the skin of the distal quarter of the forearm dorsum. This area corresponds to the skin island of the dorsoradial flap. We report our clinical experience on seven patients where this flap was used for covering post-traumatic defects of the thumb. Dimensions of the defect varied from 18 to 28 cm<sup>2</sup>. The donor site was skin grafted. All flaps survived and provided satisfactory coverage of the defect. Based on a secondary vascular axis, the flap has a large skin paddle and a wide rotation arc that allows soft tissue reconstruction of the dorsal and radiopalmar areas of the thumb.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Various types of distally based island flaps have been reported for the management of soft tissue defects of the thumb, most notably the reverse flow radial forearm flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193413475749">Song et al., 1982</xref>) and the posterior interosseous flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193413475749">Masquelet and Penteado, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193413475749">Zancolli and Angrigiani, 1988</xref>). However, these flaps may frequently appear to be too bulky, especially for limited defects of the thumb, and may also cause significant donor site morbidity. The dorsoradial flap, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413475749">Bakhach et al. (2006)</xref>, is a cutaneous flap, harvested over the distal dorsal border of the forearm; its vascularization is assured in an antegrade fashion by the dorsoradial artery, a constant branch of the radial artery, which arises at the apex of the first webspace, after a 3 to 5 cm proximal course parallel to the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus, the artery enters the subcutaneous tissues and supplies the skin of the distal dorsal radial quarter of the forearm. The pivot point of the pedicle allows a wide arc of rotation that covers the dorsal aspect of the hand and metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers, the dorsal aspect of the thumb and the first web space; it can also reach the palmar aspect of the wrist. One could say that it is the radial equivalent of the distal ulnar artery flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193413475749">Becker and Gilbert, 1988</xref>), with a shorter course and smaller area of cutaneous supply. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413475749">Bakhach et al. (2006)</xref>, the flap paddle is designed over the distal dorsal radial quarter of the forearm, between the dorsal wrist crease distally, the ulnar crest medially and radial crest laterally; this skin territory can measure up to 36 cm<sup>2</sup> and reach the whole hand dorsum, the dorsal aspect of the thumb and MP joints of the long fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193413475749">Figure 1</xref>). The aim of this article is to present our results and evaluate the reliability of the dorsoradial flap in seven patients presenting with skin defects of the thumb and first web.</p>

<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>During a period of four years (March 2007 to March 2011), seven male patients who presented with soft tissue defects of the thumb and radial side of the hand underwent reconstruction with the dorsoradial flap. The age of the patients ranged from 22 to 49 years (mean 33 years). In six cases, the cause of the defect was post-traumatic following crush or avulsion injury; in one case, the defect resulted from an electric injury. In two cases, underlying bones and tendons were involved; in two other cases the skin loss was associated with tendinous lesions. Location of the skin defect was the dorsal aspect of the thumb in six patients while in one of them the defect was also extended over the first intermetacarpal area. In one patient, the defect was located on the thenar eminence, over the radiopalmar aspect of the thumb. Dimensions of the skin loss ranged from 18 to 28 cm<sup>2</sup>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193413475749">Table 1</xref> shows clinical data of patients and management of associated injuries.</p>

<p>Preoperatively, all patients had a Doppler examination to identify the site of emergence of the dorsoradial artery over the apex of the first web space and its course between the tendons of the extensor pollicis longus and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles.</p>
<p>The skin island of the flap was designed over the distal quarter of the dorsal aspect of the forearm according to the size and location of the skin defect. We tried to orientate the longitudinal axis of the skin paddle parallel to the extensor pollicis longus tendon, over the subcutaneous course of the dorsoradial artery. The distal limit of the skin paddle always stayed proximal to the dorsal crease of the wrist.</p>
<p>The surgical procedure was carried out using a tourniquet and started with surgical debridement of the skin defect and management of the associated injuries of the underlying structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193413475749">Figure 2</xref>). Then the flap pedicle was exposed using a skin incision in a lazy S-shaped fashion, which allowed skin elevation with preservation of the superficial venous network. The flap was then raised from proximal to distal including the forearm fascia and passing close to the extensor retinaculum. The median branch of the radial nerve, which crosses the area, was identified and preserved. At the distal border of the dorsal retinaculum, the extensor pollicis longus and extensor carpi radialis longus tendons were identified and retracted. The pedicle was dissected with the surrounding subcutaneous tissue in order not to harm the vessels. At the apex of the first web space, the dissection continued palmarward to the origin of the dorsoradial vessels, obtaining a pedicle length of 3–5 cm, according to the needs and location of the defect. In all cases, after completing the flap dissection, we released the tourniquet to allow revascularization of the cutaneous paddle before transferring it to the recipient area. The flap was then rotated 180° and transposed to the recipient site to cover the tissue loss. A full thickness skin graft was used to cover the donor area. It was important to preserve the extensor epitenon during elevation of the flap in order to enhance graft take. Vaseline gauze and loosely applied bulky cotton dressing were used over the flap. A palmar resting splint was applied to the operated wrist for the first postoperative week to enhance the take of the graft over the donor site. Patients were discharged the second postoperative day and seen in the outpatient clinic every other day. Physiotherapy of the thumb started the second week after surgery, according to the associated injuries.</p>

<p>All flaps survived well and provided satisfactory coverage of the defect. In one patient, where the largest skin paddle was transferred (28 cm<sup>2</sup>), a limited area of skin necrosis 1 × 2 cm at the distal tip of the flap occurred, which healed by secondary intention. No signs of severe arterial insufficiency or venous congestion of any of the flaps were recorded.</p>
<p>Data up to 25 months after the reconstructive procedure (mean follow-up 13.3 months) showed that the dorsoradial flap assured stable reconstruction of the thumb defects. The use of the flap did not affect the postoperative rehabilitation of the involved thumbs; the patients were able to start mobilization of their operated thumb and hand by the second postoperative week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193413475749">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Morbidity of the donor site was minimal. Scars were well accepted by the patients, while no severe sensitive disturbances or painful neuromas were recorded. The cosmetic results of the hands were also acceptable at final follow-up to both patients and surgeons. The hairy skin transferred with the flap did not cause any discomfort to the patients. Secondary procedures were not required.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A variety of regional fasciocutaneous flaps harvested from the forearm, have been described for reconstructing soft tissue defects of the thumb. These flaps, raised on the radial, ulnar, posterior or anterior interosseous vascular pedicle, receive a reverse flow blood supply assured by the rich anastomotic arterial network of the hand and have been widely used to cover distally located soft tissue defects of the hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193413475749">Martin et al., 1997</xref>). Some of the flaps may require the sacrifice of one main vascular axis of the hand or provide a bulky skin paddle, which does not always correspond to the contour of the thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193413475749">Guimberteau et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193413475749">Song et al., 1982</xref>). The dissection of some flaps, especially the posterior and anterior interosseous flaps, can be technically demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193413475749">Hu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193413475749">Masquelet and Penteado, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193413475749">Zancolli and Angrigiani, 1988</xref>). Perforator flaps such as the distal radial artery adipofascial perforator flap may also be reconstructive options for large skin losses of the thumb; however, they too may require demanding dissection, and their arc of rotation may not reach the most distal areas of the thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193413475749">Ignatiadis et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In our clinical cases, the dorsoradial flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413475749">Bakhach et al., 2006</xref>) was used to cover soft tissue defects of the dorsal and radiopalmar aspect of the thumb. Regarding alternative reconstructive solutions, the application of another type of local or regional flap, i.e. homodigital or heterodigital flap, like the kite flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193413475749">Foucher and Braun, 1979</xref>) or the Littler flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193413475749">Littler, 1953</xref>), was excluded for our patients, since the needs of the skin losses that we faced were beyond the reconstructive capabilities of those commonly used techniques for thumb coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193413475749">Riccio et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, our patients did not require reconstruction of thumb sensation, so a large sensitive skin island like the one provided by the twin dorsal middle phalangeal finger flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193413475749">Qi and Chen, 2012</xref>) was not necessary. The reverse homodigital dorsoradial thumb flap, as described by Moschella and Cordova, could not be used because it is only suitable for reconstructing smaller and more distally located thumb defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193413475749">Hrabowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193413475749">Moschella and Cordova, 2006</xref>). Similarly, the adipofascial turnover flap, as recently reported by Braga Silva et al, is only indicated for covering dorsal defects of the thumb of limited size, up to 10cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193413475749">Braga Silva et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative option in our cases could have been the posterior interosseous flap or the reverse radial artery forearm flap that possibly would be more bulky and, certainly, more difficult to perform.</p>
<p>In our series, we found the dorsoradial flap easy to perform, the pedicle was constantly present and its skin territory could easily cover the distal thumb defects reaching the area of the interphalangeal joint. Although the flap was rotated almost 180°, neither the arterial supply, nor the venous outflow were compromised and a successful reconstruction was assured. Another point that should be considered as an advantage of this technique is that the rotation point of the pedicle is located distal to the carpus; thus, prolonged immobilization of the operated limb was not required and rehabilitation of the thumb started immediately following surgery, according to the needs of each patient.</p>
<p>The appearance of the donor site scar could be considered as a major disadvantage of using this flap, as its location over the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist makes it easily visible and perhaps even more prominent as compared with other flaps. However, none of our patients expressed any dissatisfaction about the cosmesis of the donor site. Another drawback is that the flap does not provide a sensory skin paddle; thus, it is not recommended for sensate reconstruction of the thumb.</p>
<p>The advantages of using the dorsoradial flap in thumb reconstruction are multiple:</p>
<list id="list1-1753193413475749" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>it has constant and reliable vascularization;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it is relatively easy to harvest with simple fast dissection;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it has adequate arc of rotation to reach the interphalangeal joint area of the thumb;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the main arterial axes of the hand are preserved;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it offers a thin and quite large skin paddle;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it provides reconstruction with similar tissues and minimal donor site morbidity.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that the dorsoradial flap is a versatile and reliable reconstructive technique and deserves to be added to the armamentarium of the reconstructive surgeon as a valuable tool when dealing with soft tissue defects of the thumb.</p>
