<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783l"><title>Glenn Clark, Judith Owens, and Greg T. Smith, eds., <italic>City Limits: Perspectives on the Historical European City</italic>, McGill-Queen’s University Press: Montreal and Kingston, Ontario, 2010; x + 396 pp; 9780773536517, $95.00 (hbk); 9780773536524, $32.95 (pbk)</title>
<p>This extensive collection of 13 essays centres on relationships of time and space, place and actor in early-modern and modern urban society and culture. Markedly inter-disciplinary, this volume makes a timely contribution to urban historiography. Indeed, <italic>City Limits</italic> is ample proof of just how much urban history has developed over recent years, from a rather niche genre to cutting-edge mainstream history. More than this, the collection’s themes and methodology are of value not only to urban historians, but scholars of society, gender, politics and culture more broadly. As a result, the collection offers a far-reaching and comprehensive contribution to the field.</p>
<p>The title <italic>City Limits</italic> is a paradox, designed to provide the contextual framework for many of the essays, whilst simultaneously breaking down the boundaries of discipline, region, and chronology. Focusing on city space as a way into the physical, cultural and mental communities of city inhabitants (especially the marginal), this collection asks constructive questions about the role of the city in shaping national and international networks, identities and associations. ‘Placing the City’ – the first section – offers a welcome contribution to the literature by a renowned historian in the field; Christopher Friedrichs. His study of the ‘meaningful commonalities’ of Eurasian urban political culture redresses the inward focus of much European literature. Such studies are vital to our understanding of global development, cross-cultural exchange and the understanding of what it meant to be ‘political’, away from an explicitly Western perspective. The rest of the section explores how communities were created by common interest, such as music in Renaissance Venice, vernacular manuscripts in Germany, values and shared heritage in Paris, aesthetics in Florence and New York, and symbolism in Tudor England. The section demonstrates the symbiotic relationship of city and nation, showing how the city functioned as a semi-autonomous hub in far reaching networks of cultural transmission: a key building block in the formation of national identity. Nonetheless, the selection also highlights the irony that as cities increased their cosmopolitan connections, they simultaneously closed their borders, more forcefully demarcating their ‘limits’. Exclusion became the new inclusion.</p>
<p>The second section ‘Gender, Mobility, and the City’ plugs into a relatively new research area for historians: gender and the ‘spatial turn’. A welcome addition to the historiography, the essays draw attention to those marginalized city residents – women, the poor and the physically impaired – to whom (with a few notable exceptions) less analysis has been devoted. In many cases building directly or indirectly on the work of de Certeau, the contributors highlight how physical movement created its own subtexts, communities and experiences, often quite distinct from those observed by the middle-class <italic>flâneur</italic>, which afforded the marginal their own place within the city, albeit often tenuous or contested. Indeed, the focus on the movement of people is a refreshing adjunct to the movement of ideas in the previous section. Together the essays convincingly argue for the existence of competing versions of city space, but most of all emphasize dualities – between tradition and change, gender and ideals, class and mobility, authority and the poor - and the complex relationships which these dualities invariably generated.</p>
<p>The final section ‘Redressing Boundaries’ covers a topic until relatively recently more familiar to twentieth-century sociologists than to historians. Borders within cities are usually created by the existence of sub-communities, who are socially or spatially segregated by ethnicity, politics, religion or class. These groups generate their own sets of dilemmas, problems and allegiances for city dwellers but at the same time it is these very divisions which made cities dynamic, complex and enticing. The essays explore some of these communities in depth, arguing that the diversity of city inhabitants became etched into the landscape itself. Exploring Jewish synagogues in Amsterdam, Catholic processions in the religiously divided counter-reformation Augsburg, maritime communities and sailors’ sub-cultures in port cities, amongst others, the final section highlights the reciprocity between place and people. Crossing boundaries, real and imagined, religious and secular, deviant and authorized, this section demonstrates the multiplicity of the urban experience and the possibility of ‘worlds within worlds’.</p>
<p>The volume as a whole is as fresh and illuminating as it is ambitious. The choice of such varied authors, topics and themes across time and space is stimulating, enabling the reader to transcend cultural givens, historiographies, disciplines, and geographic borders. The selection mirrors the multiple constructions of ‘the city’ available to contemporaries, whilst concurrently embracing a multiplicity of ‘turns’ and methodological approaches. Nevertheless, there is a danger in trying to do too much. The sheer variety of themes, periods, topics and genres teeters on the limits itself, feeling a little disjointed and self-consciously post-modern. The bibliography is also confusingly light on archival resources, and it is not clear whether this reflects an actual lack of primary evidence, or an editorial choice not to cite it. However, these criticisms are minor compared to the collection’s overall value; the strength of many of the contributions and the wide-ranging appeal to scholars across the humanities and social sciences.</p>
