<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) are medically complex and often dependent on electrical technology devices (technoelectric dependent) for life support or maintenance. Electricity failure could seriously jeopardize the lives of technoelectric-dependent CYSHCN.</p>
<p>Natural disasters are not the only reason for electricity failure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813482762">Table 1</xref> lists the various causes of electricity outage/failure. Whereas only some of us have experienced a significant hurricane or a large earthquake, nearly everyone has experienced several episodes of electricity failure. Although most of these are brief, prolonged and widespread electrical power failures have occurred in the United States several times each year.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A 19-question technoelectric dependence and preparedness questionnaire (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813482762">Table 2</xref>) was completed by parents or caregivers of each CYSHCN. Some questionnaires were completed via phone interview. We excluded CYSHCN who are in long-term hospital or nursing facilities because these facilities are responsible for electrical power reliability and backup. We collected a convenience sample of data from 50 patients who depend daily on at least 1 medical electric device at home.</p>

<p>In all, 21 patients indicated that their child’s most important device could run on battery power for 1 hour or less. This includes zero because many of the devices did not have a battery backup. Also, 9 patients indicated that their child’s most important device could run on battery power continuously for 1 to 5 hours. The remaining 20 patients indicated that their child’s most important device could run continuously for periods longer than 5 hours; however, this is not likely to be correct because battery backup time typically falls far short of this. Of the 17 patients identifying a ventilator or oxygen concentrator as their child’s most important device, 8 felt that their child could survive for longer than 24 hours without the device.</p>
<p>Of the 50 patients, 22 had a preparedness plan for a prolonged power failure. The quality of this plan was not reviewed. Of the 17 patients identifying a ventilator or oxygen concentrator as their child’s most important device, 10 had a power failure preparedness plan; 8 of these 17 (47%) possessed a generator compared with 3 of the other 33 patients (9%). Of the 50 patients, 43 had access to a car or van, and 24 knew that their car or van could be used to generate electricity. Yet only 9 patients had a device that could convert the car’s electricity to household electricity.</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922813482762" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Electricity availability is fairly reliable, but periods of nonavailability occur more frequently than major natural disasters. Its perceived “reliability” gives us a false sense of security. Most of us have experienced several electrical power failures, and their inevitability and frequency requires hospitals to have a highly reliable backup system that must initiate electricity backup almost instantly; yet this system sometimes fails.</p>
<p>For families with no significant health concerns, a prolonged power failure can result in serious health consequences such as refrigeration failure compromising food safety, alterations in food preparation, inadequate lighting at night, communication infrastructure compromise, water utility failure, and alterations in hygienic practices.</p>
<p>For CYSHCN whose life support is dependent on electricity, power failure is more serious. This survey demonstrates that only some families have a power failure preparedness plan. We did not ask what this plan was. Many families think that they can go to the hospital in case of power failure, but this would not be practical because of a high probability of traffic gridlock, public transportation failure, and hospital lockdown.</p>
<p>This survey demonstrates that knowledge of battery backup is lacking even for critical devices such as ventilators and oxygen concentrators, and it represents optimistic numbers because we did not confirm whether the battery backup was functional. It is likely that the duration of battery backup was exaggerated. Battery performance degrades with time, and it is unlikely that the duration of the battery backup was actually known.</p>
<p>Because getting to a hospital is not a well-conceived preparedness plan, we would like to emphasize a home preparedness plan to keep CYSHCN safe. Families should know how to react promptly to avoid medical device failure during a power failure. As the first step, families need to realize that power failure can happen anytime. We sometimes have a warning period (anticipated bad weather), but this is not always the case. Patients trust their primary care physicians as a medical home for anticipatory guidance and overall medical care. Yet preparedness for home electricity failure requires electricity knowledge that is not necessarily part of the training of medical home physicians.</p>
<p>It is clear that the best way to maintain a child’s technoelectric device is to generate electricity at home. This is especially important for children who are immediately vulnerable because of high-level life support dependence on a technoelectric device, such as a ventilator or oxygen concentrator. A preparedness plan for such patients would be different compared with the plan for patients with less-acute/critical technoelectric dependence. The medical home primary care physician who has assessed the patient’s degree of technoelectric dependence is likely the best person to determine a plan to prepare for electricity failure.</p>
<p>Some basic knowledge of electricity is necessary. One family indicated that their photovoltaic roof panels would provide them power during a power failure. This is not likely to be correct unless the household has a very expensive battery storage system added on to a conventional photovoltaic system. Only some patients claimed to have a generator. One family claimed that their generator did not use gasoline. This is not likely to be correct because nearly all consumer generators utilize gasoline. They also require lubricating oil, and in many instances, an unprepared user will not have the oil available. Gasoline cannot be stored for long periods of time in the generator or in gasoline storage containers. It will degrade and render the generator nonfunctional. Gasoline must be obtained from a pump (high risk of nonavailability during a power failure) or siphoned from an automobile’s gas tank. Our survey did not ask if the families knew how to properly siphon gasoline. The suction technique is likely to result in hydrocarbon aspiration.</p>
<p>The key facts are listed below as a numbered list:</p>
<list id="list1-0009922813482762" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Battery capacity diminishes with time. Battery backup time is likely to be shorter than anticipated. Backup batteries are typically expensive and difficult to replace. Battery replacement is best done by the home device company providing and servicing the machine. A spare battery provides an added safety margin, but this could be expensive, and the parent/caretaker must have the technical ability to replace the battery under emergency conditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) can be used to provide additional battery backup for fairly short periods of time. These are typically used on computers, but they can often (not always) power a medical device as well. A large UPS will power a device for a longer period of time. These can be large and heavy, and because they are battery powered, they are subject to all the factors that degrade battery performance over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The power capacity of the UPS is measured in watts. This wattage must exceed the power rating of the device in watts or amps (amperes), which can be converted to watts (volts × amperes). For example, a 120-V device that is rated at 0.5 A requires 60 W.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An inverter is a device that converts 12 V from an automobile’s electrical system to household electricity, 120 V alternating current.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An inverter with a cigarette lighter receptacle (now called automobile power receptacle because the cigarette lighter device is no longer present) is a low wattage device (200 W or less), and it can only power a small home electrical device. Plugging in more than 1 device at a time is likely to exceed the electrical rating of the automobile’s wiring resulting in a blown fuse and loss of electrical power. Thus, because the typical automobile wiring is rated at 20 A, the maximum wattage rating to utilize this type of inverter must be less than 240 W(12 V × 20 A).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An inverter with red and black clamp contacts must be attached directly to the car’s battery (one should carefully follow the instructions on how to do this). By doing so, it does not use the automobile’s internal wiring, allowing it to exceed the 20-A, 240-W limit. These are higher wattage inverters that can power larger devices. These can also deplete the automobile’s battery; therefore, the automobile’s engine must be running (in a well-ventilated area) to continuously charge the battery while the device is in use.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using a home generator requires skill and knowledge. It requires fresh gasoline, oil, and ventilation. It gets very hot. It has a wattage rating that must exceed the sum of the devices plugged into it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Standard solar photovoltaic panel installations do not provide home electricity during a power failure. These could provide home power only if expensive and special battery storage units are installed to separate the home from the electricity grid.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In determining the resources available for home electricity in the event of a power failure, one has the option of internal battery backup, UPS, automobile inverter, and home generator. A primary care provider (PCP) creating a preparedness plan should determine the requirement for rapid/immediate electrical power as well as the duration of the power. Internal medical device battery backup and UPS provide the most immediate electricity backup, but these are likely to last only for short periods of time. A home generator provides the longest duration of home electrical power, but its use requires skill and knowledge. Automobile inverters can provide electricity within a few minutes, with a duration as long as the automobile can run in a ventilated area. A PCP must match the patient’s clinical technoelectric requirements and vulnerabilities with the power backup/generating characteristics of the devices above to customize a power failure preparedness plan. Patients who are critically technoelectrical dependent are likely to require all the above. A hands-on drill with real equipment is likely beneficial; however, the drill would have to be done at home with devices that are seldom used. This could be theoretically risky without assistance because an important life support device could fail during a power backup exercise. A table-top simulation could be done during an office visit with the PCP. Other types of drills would not be feasible in our current system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813482762">Figure 1</xref> illustrates a form that could be used to inventory technoelectric devices and develop a preparedness plan.</p>

<p>One study confirmed the overwhelming nature of caring for CYSHCN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813482762">1</xref></sup> A technoelectric preparedness plan adds additional burdens to the family and PCP. Although the medical home has focused on the PCP, a study of PCPs’ comfort level with technology-dependent CYSHCN found that many of them were uncomfortable with home care medical technology support measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813482762">2</xref></sup> A plan that is intimidating, seldom used, and seldom drilled is not likely to succeed. This is likely to be the case for such a preparedness plan, but this places technoelectric-dependent children at high risk. This is similar to a need for fire drills, cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, earthquake/tsunami drills, and other infrequent but potentially catastrophic events that are drilled. Additionally, the technoelectric component of preparedness is only part of the overall preparedness plan for CYSHCN. Medication, nutrition, supplies, communication needs, documents, and so on should all be included in an overall preparedness plan.</p>
<p>One publication suggested that the conventional medical home model may not be a standard practice for CYSHCN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813482762">1</xref></sup> A profile of families with more complex CYSHCN has demonstrated a greater degree of unmet medical needs (compared with less complex CYSHCN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813482762">3</xref></sup> Technoelectric-dependent CYSHCN are probably the most complex group of patients. Institution-based programs could theoretically assist with the coordination of complex technoelectric management measures and preparedness plans. Experience with multidisciplinary institution-based programs has been examined in the overall management of CYSHCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813482762">4</xref></sup> without a definitive conclusion about whether this is better. Adding technoelectric preparedness makes this more complicated, further adding to the justification that assistance from a multidisciplinary institution could be better. Another published guidelines document for CYSHCN recommends a medical home model but that the primary care physician of the medical home be part of a special care clinic that is institution based. This combines the institution-based resources with the advantages of a PCP serving as a medical home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813482762">5</xref></sup> Emergency care providers are more likely to be called on during a “disaster,” which includes a prolonged power failure. Thus, emergency care providers (especially those who are familiar with principles of electricity) should be part of the multidisciplinary team and respond to requests to assist medical homes of CYSHCN to develop power failure preparedness plans. It seems logical that an institution-based or an institution-affiliated medical home would be better equipped to facilitate preparedness.</p>
<p>Home care services companies that provide technoelectric medical devices are part of the multidisciplinary team and should review the electricity requirements (volts, watts, and amperes) with families and caregivers. Because a power failure is fairly common, preparedness for a power failure should be part of the routine training to use the device if the device is essential for life support.</p>
<p>If CYSHCN are hospitalized, hospital-based physicians and staff should ideally review battery backup functionality and overall disaster preparedness plans with family members. An acute illness requiring hospitalization typically raises the level of concern by family and caregivers about disaster preparation measures, creating a teachable moment.</p>
<p>Families of CYSHCN should ideally drill for unexpected power failure. In some instances, the power failure will occur while everyone is sleeping, so a power failure alarm is necessary. The device that is most critical to maintain the child’s life should be prioritized. In some instances, the need is not immediate. The electrical requirement (wattage rating) of the device(s) should also be determined. If a device has a backup battery, it is important to keep it charged and to know how long the device can run on the backup battery. If the device is always plugged into a UPS, this provides additional battery backup time. Having an automobile inverter is the next essential step. Small devices totaling less than 200 W can be powered by small inverters that plug into the automobile power receptacle. Devices totaling more than 200 W must use high-powered inverters that clamp directly onto the automobile’s battery. The automobile’s engine must be running to maintain the charge on the automobile battery, so it must be run in a well-ventilated area. An enclosed garage that has an electric garage door will not open during a power failure. The garage door must be opened manually. A very long electrical extension cord is necessary to connect the medical device(s) to the inverter. If prolonged electrical power is needed, a home electrical generator must be fueled and started. A fuel siphon, a gasoline transfer canister, and oil for the generator will be necessary. This is a challenging series of tasks requiring equipment that must be stored for infrequent but immediate use. Assistance from neighbors can be very helpful and should be part of the preparedness plan. Some neighbors might own a generator and might have greater knowledge and skill in starting and operating a generator.</p>
<p>Getting to the hospital for electricity is a reasonable plan if the electricity failure can be anticipated as in a forecast of bad weather or if the power failure is limited to a small area. However, this is often not the case because electricity failure can be unexpected, sudden, and widespread. Thus, a home preparedness plan is still necessary. In the event of a widespread power failure, traffic control systems will fail, resulting in traffic gridlock. A hospital’s emergency power generation system is likely to be sought and utilized by the public, requiring the hospital to eventually lock down to maintain its critical operations by not exceeding its emergency power generation capacity. If a nearby source of electricity backup could be identified, such as a designated disaster shelter, a police station, a fire station, an emergency medical services ambulance unit, and so on, families of CYWHCN should confirm that their child can be brought there in a power failure emergency.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has published a policy statement on the use of the emergency information form for CYSHCN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813482762">6</xref></sup> The technical appendix of this policy statement provides information on technoelectric preparedness for a power failure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that technoelectric-dependent CYSHCN are poorly prepared for electrical power failure. Disaster preparedness planning for technoelectric-dependent CYSHCN is very complex and best facilitated by an institution-based or institution-affiliated medical home.</p>
