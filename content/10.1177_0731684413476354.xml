<sec id="sec1-0731684413476354" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in conventional fiber-reinforced composite materials have significantly increased in recent years. The most common application in this subject involves using the CNT by mixing them in matrix resin at a certain ratio. Although this process is easy and fast, adding CNT significantly increases viscosity of resin and therefore makes production of composites difficult. As a result, adding CNT into the resin can only be performed at rather low ratios like 0.1–0.5% in practice. However, even at these low ratios, it was reported that interlaminar shear strength of the composite structure improved by 69% and fracture toughness decreased by approximately 25%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413476354">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413476354"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413476354">7</xref></sup> In case of CNT addition into resin, increased viscosity of resin is not the only problem, tendency of easy agglomeration of CNTs is also a significant problem. This causes non-homogenous distribution of CNT in the structure and thus leads to the formation of weak spots in the structure. On the other hand, it can be possible to produce composite plates at desired quality level by cautiously controlling the conditions during production.</p>
<p>The fact that the CNTs develop very high mechanical properties at abovementioned levels even at low ratios is really interesting. However, it is a fact that high ratios cannot be achieved by mixing CNTs into resin. When CNTs are grown on fabric or fibers, it is possible to reach relatively higher CNT ratios.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413476354">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413476354"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413476354">10</xref></sup> CNT grown on fabric can be later used to produce the composite plates through resin transfer molding (RTM) or autoclave methods. Since the CNTs on the fabric will not cause a problem like increasing resin viscosity, they will clearly show a more homogenous distribution. By growing CNTs on fabric, it is possible to reach high ratios like 10%. However, potential problems during production of composite at high CNT ratios using such a technique remain unknown.</p>
<p>Almost many of the studies on CNT-reinforced composites concentrated on interlaminar shear strength, fracture toughness and fiber-matrix interface bonding strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413476354">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413476354"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413476354">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, the studies on how adding CNT affects damage initiation and progress generally analyzed composite materials where CNTs are mixed or dispersed to the resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413476354">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413476354">10</xref></sup> In CNT grown on composites, the effect of CNTs on damage initiation and propagation was not analyzed.</p>
<p>This study examined basic mechanical properties with damage initiation and propagation properties of composite plates produced with CNT grown on 2 × 2 twill woven carbon fabric and compared the results without CNT or virgin plates. The study focuses on static tensile tests carried out along the fiber direction that are accompanied by acoustic emission (AE) registration and full-field strain measurements.</p>

<p>Parameters and the surface view of the fabric, chosen as the baseline material and a substrate for growth of CNT, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413476354">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413476354">Figure 1</xref>. The geometric aspects of the fabric structure are identified in ref. [11]. The size of the substrate used for growth of CNT is limited by the dimensions of the reactor. Therefore, the fabric was cut into strips with the size approximately 5 × 25 cm. These strips were handled with all the possible care, as the twill fabric is easily deformed.

<p>The CNT were grown using the proprietary knowledge of company Nanocyl. The process parameters used to grow CNT on the fabric samples were from the standard production process of multiwall CNT (MWCNT) of Nanocyl. Time, temperature and flow rate of gases was very important in controlling the homogeneity, level (wt%) and length of CNT on the fabric surface. First, the fabric sample is heated up to 300°C to remove the sizing from the carbon fibers. Then the sample is immersed in the ethanol solvent of the catalyst (Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)2.6H<sub>2</sub>O). The concentration of the catalyst, the synthesis time, the flow gas rate of acetylene and hydrogen depends on the desired amount of CNT growth. The resulting amount of the catalyst particles (size of several nanometers) on the carbon fibers is estimated as about 6 mg of Ni per 1 g of carbon for 8 to 10 wt% CNT growth and about 2 mg of Ni per 1 g of carbon for the 2 to 4 wt% CNT growth (the weight percents in relation to the weight of the fabric). The sample is dried at 120°C during 1 h and placed in the CNT-growth reactor. A flow of acetylene, hydrogen and nitrogen (respectively 1/0.5/1 ratio) passed through the 600°C heated reactor during 90 sec. The average diameter of such an MWCNT is 9.5 nm, number of walls 5 … 10, the length depends on the growth time.</p>
<p>CNT could be introduced on the surface of fibers via coating process like putting CNT in fiber sizing but its applied in nanometric thickness. Dispersions based on CNT are very viscous and difficult to obtain homogenous coating or equal distribution on CNTs everywhere. Therefore, growth on surface route to obtain local placement of CNTs was followed.</p>
<p>Two batches of the CNT-grafted fabric samples were produced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413476354">Table 2</xref>). The values of the amount of CNT on the fabric samples were determined by weighing of the samples before and after the processing.

<p>The size of the fabric strips used for growth of CNT is limited by the dimensions of the reactors in the labs. Therefore, 25-mm wide fabrics were used to produce the composite samples. Shell epoxy resin Epikote 828 LV and the hardener Epikure DX 6514 were used as the matrix. The composite plates were produced by using vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) equipment with 5 plies of fabric to obtain a fiber volume fraction of 52% and a thickness of approximately 1.5 mm. For comparison, the results of a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413476354">12</xref></sup> obtained from sample produced with same fabric, resin and lab conditions but without CNT were used.</p>
<p>Before placement of the fabrics, the mould cavity was warmed to 40°C to reduce resin viscosity and hence the cycle time. The fabric was stacked in the mould cavity in the warp direction. After degassing, the resin was injected into the mould cavity at a pressure of 2 bars for 2 min. Then, the pressure was increased, up to 4–5 bars, until the cavity was filled. As the cavity was filled, the resin flow was maintained as long as possible, allowing the resin flow to fill the voids. Subsequently, the vacuum port, where the resin was stored in the mould, was closed, and a packing pressure of 5 bars was applied. This post-fill action was necessary to minimize voids in the plate. After injection, the mould was heated to 70°C for 1 h to cure the resin. The composite plate was post-cured in the mould at 160°C for 2 h. The mould was then cooled to 40°C. Main production parameters were given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413476354">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Tensile tests were performed on an Instron 4505 testing machine with a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min. The 20 × 210 mm samples were cut out of the composite panels in the warp direction using a diamond saw. Glass/epoxy composite tabs were stuck to the ends of the samples using epoxy resin. The specimen length between the tabs was 120 mm.</p>
<p>A LIMESS camera took images of the black and white painted region at a frequency of 2 Hz. The first image, which was taken as soon as the test started, showed the non-deformed stage. The local displacement and strain data were established by comparing subsequent images to the first image with Vic2D software (LIMESS Messtechnik und Software GmbH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413476354">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413476354">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Displacement of the speckle was used to quantify the deformation of the sample because this speckle pattern deforms with the sample under loading. This allowed the software to produce a strain field. The strain mapping system was also used as an optical extensometer with a precision of about 0.01% strain; the local strain components were averaged over an area of interest (normally a square zone of the sample) to obtain the strain components.</p>
<p>Two AE sensors, which were placed at the boundaries of the gauge length region, allowed each AE event to be recorded and related to energy and the corresponding applied load. Signals that occurred outside of the sensors were filtered out by the AE system AMSY-5 by using a suitable calibration procedure. In the course of the experiment, the energy of AE events was registered and the cumulative energy of AE events was followed as function of applied tensile strain. Changes of rate of generation of AE events, reflected by the change of slope of the diagram, indicate change in damage mechanisms in the sample. Since the AE sensors are very sensitive, they had to be removed before the final failure of the sample. This made it impossible to study the very last stage of damage development. As a result of these tests, the ultimate stress and strain values were determined. Also, characteristic damage threshold strain values (<italic>ɛ<sub>min</sub>,ɛ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>ɛ<sub>2</sub></italic>) were determined with the help of the AE records: <italic>ɛ</italic><sub>min</sub>, at which the first AE event occurred; <italic>ɛ<sub>1</sub></italic>, first damage initiation; <italic>ɛ<sub>2</sub></italic>, second damage initiation stage. Several samples were cross-sectioned and polished, and the crack and damage patterns were studied with an optical microscope.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0731684413476354"><title>Fiber volume fraction of composite samples</title>
<p>Unexpected results were obtained from identification of thickness and fiber volume fraction of composite plates, which are produced according to VARTM method. Despite using fabrics having the same amount of layers and using mould at the same thickness in VARTM method, it was found that nano fiber-reinforced composite (nFRC) plates were thicker than virgin plates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413476354">Table 2</xref>). Thickness increased by 3.9–7.9% depending on CNT ratio. On the other hand, fiber volume fraction decreased by 2.7–6.2%. Although the difference was not so high, it was observed that thickness of plates increased as well. Increased plate thickness is caused by the CNTs around the fibers. The CNTs around fibers increase the distance between the fibers. This also affects compressibility of fibers during RTM process. Due to high RTM pressure, thickness cannot vary during the production of composite plates. The final thickness of the plate is defined by the spacer thickness and by relaxation of the plate after the mould is open, which, in its turn, depends on cure shrinkage of the matrix, which is affected by the presence of CNTs.</p>
<p>Due to CNT layer around fiber, the fiber diameter increases and therefore compressibility in mould during resin injection becomes difficult. As a result of this, thickness of the produced composite plate increases, which causes decreasing of fiber volume fraction locally within the composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413476354">8</xref></sup> This is an important limitation that should be taken into account in production of nFRC. Because it should not be ignored that mechanical properties will also decrease depending on decreased fiber volume fraction of composite. A similar problem occurred even in carbon epoxy composite plates where the CNTs produced with the same fabric and resin are mixed or dispersed with resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413476354">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Local fiber volume fraction decreases depending on increased diameter or increased distances due to the CNTs in around the fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413476354">Figure 2</xref>). This will clearly cause a significant decrease in mechanical properties and damage initiation properties of composite material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413476354">12</xref></sup>

In addition to the decrease in elastic properties, damage threshold properties decreased as well.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413476354">Table 3</xref> shows three different values of the Young’s modulus for each of the samples due to the non-linearity of the stress–strain curves. These values are computed over the initial range (strain up to 0.1%), the middle range (strain between 0.1% and 0.3%) and the upper range (strain between 0.3 and 0.6). The Young's modulus values have been determined from the stress and strain data for equal length strain intervals (<italic>ɛ<sub>a</sub></italic>, <italic>ɛ<sub>b</sub></italic>) using equation <italic>E = </italic>(<italic>σ<sub>b</sub></italic>–<italic>σ<sub>a</sub></italic>)/(<italic>ɛ<sub>b</sub></italic> – <italic>ɛ<sub>a</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>The initial Young’s modulus was 64.74 GPa for the composite sample A. Young’s modulus decreased by 1.32 GPa (or 2%) between 0.1% and 0.3% strain. Although the decrease was low within this range, it increased after 0.3% strain. The Young’s modulus decreased by 2.87 GPa (or 4.5%) within the range of 0.3%–0.6%. A decrease of approximately 25% in the Young’s modulus occurred from the beginning of the test until the ultimate failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413476354">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The initial Young’s modulus was 58.5 GPa for the composite sample B. A. Young’s modulus decreased by 1.24 GPa (or 2.1%) between 0.1% and 0.3% strain. The Young’s modulus decreased by 2.74 GPa (or 4.6%) within the range of 0.3%–0.6%. A decrease of approximately 32% in the Young’s modulus occurred from the beginning of the test until the ultimate failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413476354">Figure 3(b)</xref>). This indicated the damage propagated as significantly for nFRC plates after a certain value of strain. The initial Young’s modulus was 54.4 GPa for the composite sample C. A. Young’s modulus decreased by 2.27 GPa (or 4.2%) between 0.1% and 0.3% strain. The Young’s modulus decreased by 6.09 GPa (or 11.2%) within the range of 0.3%–0.6%. A decrease of approximately 36% in the Young’s modulus occurred from the beginning of the test until the ultimate failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413476354">Figure 3(c)</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison of the results showed that Young’s modulus value decreased by 14% on average for Sample B while it decreased by 18% on average for Sample C according to the Sample A. The same thing was also valid for tensile strength. In tensile strength values, for Sample B there was 21% decrease on average according to reference sample and for Sample C there was a decrease of 18% on average. Ultimate strain values were 15% low for Sample B and 17% low for Sample C according to Sample A.</p>
<p>Stress–strain diagrams given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413476354">Figure 3</xref> shows that they are almost linear to a certain value. However, after a certain value, the curve shows a non-linear behavior. This is caused by the decrease of modulus depending on damage progress in composite structure and modulus-strain curves support this view. The non-linear region in the curve is thought to be the region where damage significantly progressed and this will be discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>The decrease in mechanical properties due to CNT on the fibers is rather strange. It was found that adding CNT to resin generally improved mechanical properties, particularly in fracture toughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413476354">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413476354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413476354"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413476354">7</xref></sup> With this method, it is possible to add CNT to the resin at rather low ratios, however even this has significant limitations. For example: excessive thickening of the resin and agglomeration. CNT grown on fibers makes high amounts of CNT addition in composite structure possible. However, it was found that stiffness values of composites significantly decreases (14–18%) with this method. This is believed to have two reasons. The first reason is reduced local fiber volume fraction. This occurred due to increased distance between the fibers and fiber volume fraction has a direct effect on mechanical properties. Lower fiber-matrix interface bonding is thought to be the second factor. CNT layer around the fiber makes it difficult for the resin to sufficiently wet the fiber. Damage images obtained from SEM analyses obtained in another study that used the same fabric and resin support this view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413476354">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413476354">15</xref></sup> In the mentioned study, it was observed that the cracks in a virgin composite plate which without CNT showed a more brittle structure character and damage progressed through the propagation of transversal cracks; while in composite plates with CNT, the cracks were first initiated as individual fiber-matrix interface and then these cracks combined and turned into transversal cracks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413476354">15</xref></sup> Apart from previous studies, we worked with much higher ratios of CNT in the present study and in microscope analyses on the tested samples it was observed that there were debonding not only in fiber-matrix but also in yarn-matrix boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413476354">Figure 5</xref>). This is caused by inadequate wetting of the fibers and therefore a weak fiber-matrix interface bonding. A considerable amount of CNT layer forms around the fibers and this layer makes penetration of resin to fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413476354">Figure 6</xref>). This causes weak fiber-matrix interface and makes the damage to progress easily.

<p>Results of a previous study which added low ratios of CNT into resin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413476354">15</xref></sup> contain highly comparable data with the present study. In a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413476354">15</xref></sup> it was reported that adding CNT into 0.25% CNT-reinforced composite plates produced with the same fabric, resin and laboratory conditions did not cause a change in Young’s modulus but however caused a slight increase in resistance value. Increased CNT ratio caused significant decreases in mechanical properties and Young’s modulus. This indicates that there is a sufficient limitation in composite materials produced by adding CNT.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0731684413476354"><title>Damage initiation and progression</title>
<p>Damage initiation and development in the composite samples was characterized by monitoring AE during the test, as well as by microscopical examinations.</p>
<p>The energy of the AE events and the associated loading levels determined the dependency of the cumulative energy of the AE events on the tensile strain. From this information, the damage initiation thresholds were determined. At the beginning of the test, no acoustic events were registered. Starting from a certain load threshold, low-energy events start to occur with a low frequency. Then the frequency of events increased sharply and the energy content increased; this was reflected by an increase in the slope of the cumulative AE event energy curve. At a higher level of applied stress, a second knee on the AE cumulative energy curve may appear. According to these observations, the following characteristic measures were determined for each sample: (1) the AE threshold strain <italic>ɛ</italic><sub>min</sub> at which the first AE event occurs; (2) the first damage threshold strain <italic>ɛ<sub>1</sub></italic> at the first increase in the slope of the cumulative AE energy curve and (3) the second damage threshold strain <italic>ɛ<sub>2</sub></italic> at the second knee on the AE cumulative energy curve. The damage thresholds are an important property of composites. A change in the rate of AE event accumulation indicates a switch to another damage mechanism.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413476354">Table 3</xref> shows characteristic strain levels for damage initiation and propagation in samples having different fibre volume fractions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413476354">Figure 7</xref> shows AE measurements with the average stress–strain curve for the composite samples.

<p>AE records showed highly similar trend for all three samples. For the reference sample (Sample A), ɛ<sub>min</sub>, ɛ<sub>1</sub> and ɛ<sub>2</sub> were determined as 0.19 (stress about 130 MPa), 0.26 (stress about 180 MPa) and 0.30 (stress about 205 MPa), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413476354">12</xref></sup> For Sample B, ɛ<sub>min</sub>, ɛ<sub>1</sub> and ɛ<sub>2</sub> were found to be 0.11% (stress about 65 MPa), 0.16% (stress about 90 MPa) and 0.19% (stress about 105 MPa), respectively. For Sample C, ɛ<sub>min</sub>, ɛ<sub>1</sub> and ɛ<sub>2</sub> were found to be 0.088% (stress about 45 MPa), 0.13% (stress about 70 MPa) and 0.17% (stress about 90 MPa), respectively. Characteristic strain values for damage initiation and development are comparatively presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413476354">Figure 7</xref>. Based on these results, according to reference sample, for Sample B, ɛ<sub>min</sub>, ɛ<sub>1</sub> and ɛ<sub>2</sub> decreased by 42%, 38% and 36%, respectively, and for Sample C, ɛ<sub>min</sub>, ɛ<sub>1</sub> and ɛ<sub>2</sub> decreased by 53%, 50% and 43%, respectively. These values indicate a dramatic decrease in damage initiation and propagation strain values. In some studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413476354">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413476354">15</xref></sup> nFRC samples where produced with the same fabric, resin and laboratory conditions, but with CNT mixed to the resin, approximately 0.2% increase was reported in damage threshold strain values. These results revealed that CNT grafting method on fibers at high ratios have big limitations for composite properties.</p>
<p>Analysis of AE diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413476354">Figure 7</xref>) show that damage initiated much earlier and propagated much faster in nFRC samples than virgin sample. This indicates that transversal cracks rapidly propagate in the sample due to weak fiber-matrix interface. The cracks generally occur in fiber-matrix interface in nFRC samples and then propagate along the entire sample width. Transversal cracks cause a gradual decrease in stiffness of the material. Based on the analysis of the change in Young’s modulus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413476354">Figure 3</xref>, it can be stated that the decrease in the modulus gradually and slowly decreased for the virgin sample depending on the increase in the amount of transversal cracks. However, in nFRC samples, this decrease rapidly occurred particularly after a certain level. This means increased transversal cracks and delamination in yarn boundaries and/or between the layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413476354">Figure 8</xref>).
<fig id="fig8-0731684413476354" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Delamination cracks between the yarn boundaries in nFRC samples. Arrows indicate the delamination cracks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684413476354-fig8.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Since the diagrams are prepared with the same scale, the difference between ɛ<sub>1</sub> and ɛ<sub>2</sub> values can be easily observed. In addition to early initiation of damage in nFRC samples, high-energy events take place quickly and the frequency of occurring events was higher than the virgin sample. Increase of cumulative energy level proves this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413476354">Figure 7(c)</xref>). Damage progression after it initiated occurred earlier than the reference sample.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain these unexpected results both in tensile properties and damage initiation and progress properties. However, as indicated in the present study, although CNT application has many advantages reported in the literature, there are low number of limitations as well. It is believed that these results probably have three main causes:
<list id="list1-0731684413476354" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– High temperature is used during CNT grafting process on fibers and the sizing (coating material) on carbon fibers are fully removed during this process. The sizing has two important functions: the first one is to reduce friction of the fibers during weaving and production and to protect fiber breaking and the second one is to increase bonding with resin during composite production. When this material is completely removed from fiber surface, bonding with resin property of the fibers might be decreased and thus fiber-matrix interface resistance might be decreased. This can be a major factor for lower mechanical properties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– The second important cause is that CNTs that are intensively placed on fiber surface prevent the fiber to be wetted by the resin and therefore fiber-matrix interface bonding decreased.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– The third cause can be that the CNTs increase the distance between the fibers and as a result decrease fiber volume fraction. This can also cause a decrease in mechanical properties. However, damage initiation and progress strain levels are not affected from change of fiber volume fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413476354">12</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>All of these three principle causes are believed to have a cumulative effect on decreased mechanical properties, damage initiation and progression properties. Unwetted fibers by the resin properly, poor fiber-matrix interface and lower fiber volume fraction might have caused decrease in these properties. These assumptions are verified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413476354">Figure 9</xref>. According to these figures, increased distance between CNT-coated fibers is clearly visible. In addition, small air packets in composite cross-section which are not wetted by the resin are clearly visible. All these factors are believed to cause a decrease in properties.

<p>This study examined the effect of CNT grafting on fibers on mechanical and damage threshold properties in nFRC materials. The results are presented below.
<list id="list2-0731684413476354" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– CNT grafting at high amount causes a CNT forest around the fiber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413476354">16</xref></sup> and this causes significant limitations in composite material production.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Due to increased distance between the fibers, local fiber volume fraction decreases within the yarns. Fiber volume fraction was found to decrease by 2.7–6.2% according to CNT ratio.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Significant decreases were observed in mechanical properties of nFRC samples. Young’s modulus values were found to be decreased by 15–17%. It was concluded that decreased local fiber volume fraction and low fiber-matrix interface bonding were the main cause for this situation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Damage threshold strain values globally decreased by 36–53%. It is believed that the most important factor that might cause this decrease is lack of adequate wetting of fiber surfaces and low fiber-matrix interface bonding.</p></list-item>
