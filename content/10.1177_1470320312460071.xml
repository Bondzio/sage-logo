<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has emerged as the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in many developed countries, and this trend is extending to developing countries as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312460071">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312460071">2</xref></sup> Hemodynamic changes characterized by increases in high intracapsular pressure, hyperfusion, and hyperfiltration have been observed in the early stage of DN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312460071">3</xref></sup> Podocytes are terminally differentiated epithelial cells with limited replicative capacity. Podocyte damage is the key step triggering the development of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Viable podocytes are found in the urine, which suggests that reduced adhesive capacity may be one of the mechanisms of podocyte damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312460071">4</xref></sup> Mechanical stress may activate the local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and cause deleterious adhesive effects on podocytes in DN because of glomerular capillary hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312460071">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312460071">5</xref></sup> Integrin α3β1 is the major podocyte anchoring dimer that attaches podocytes to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). In vitro experiments have shown that mechanical stress can reduce podocyte adhesion capacity and α3β1 integrin expression paralleled by increased apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312460071">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 20–25 nucleotides, non-coding molecules expressed in a variety of cellular physiologic and pathologic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312460071">7</xref></sup> They bind to the 3’-untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, causing their degradation or translational repression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312460071">8</xref></sup> The important role of miRNAs in kidney disease, especially in DN, is rapidly emerging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312460071">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our previous study showed that spironolactone ameliorates the impaired podocytic adhesion capacity via upregulation of integrin α3 expression in diabetic rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312460071">10</xref></sup> Based on this result, we hypothesize that miRNA expression patterns might serve as a biomarker of podocytic adhesion damage under mechanical stress. To prove this hypothesis, it is necessary to profile whether differences exist in miRNA expression of podocytes, podocytes under mechanical stress and podocytes under mechanical stress treated with spironolactone. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible miRNAs participant in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury under mechanical stress in vitro and further explore the potential efficient therapeutic intervention point to DN.</p>

<title>Podocytes culture</title>
<p>A conditionally immortalized human podocyte cell line was kindly donated by Prof. Moin Saleem (Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK) and cultured under standard conditions. Podocytes were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in the presence of interferon-γ at 33°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air (permissive condition). To differentiate, podocytes were plated on type I collagen at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and cultured with 1% FBS at 37°C without γ-interferon (non-permissive condition). Podocytes maintained under non-permissive condition for 10–14 days were used for experiments.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470320312460071">
<title>Exposure to mechanical stress and spironolactone treatment</title>
<p>Podocytes were seeded in six-well silastic culture plates that enabled precise deformation at a density of 15,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> for a minimum of 24 h. Cells were covered with 2 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> human extracellular matrix and collagen IV (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). Thereafter, cells were subjected to mechanical stress with the Flexercell Tension Plus system, FX-4000T (Flexcell International Corp., Hillsborough, NC, USA) to apply pathophysiological stretch (elongation strength was 20%, at a frequency of 12 cycles/min). Certain cells were subjected to mechanical stretch for a period of up to 24 h (Group M), whereas others were grown in wells with flexible membranes but were not subjected to mechanical stress, serving as controls (Group C). To figure out potential interactions between spironolactone and mechanical stretch, further experiments were performed on podocytes exposed to mechanical stretch, in the presence of spironolactone (Group S) (10<sup>−7</sup> M; Minsheng Pharmacia Corp., Hangzhou, China). The concentration of spironolactone used in this study was determined in preliminary experiments. Cells and supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C. Aldosterone concentration was examined with an aldosterone radioimmunoassay kit (North Institute of Biological Technology, Beijing, China).</p>

<sec id="section9-1470320312460071">
<title>Western blot analyses</title>
<p>Podocytes were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer, and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto an 8% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 8% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour. Membranes with proteins were incubated with rabbit anti-human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human integrin α3 monoclonal antibody (1:100, Bosider, Wuhan, China), goat anti-human integrin β1 monoclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight followed by incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, we have demonstrated that mechanical stress can cause podocytic local aldosterone activation in vitro, whereas the adhesion molecule integrin α3 and β1 levels decreased significantly. After spironolactone treatment, integrin α3 and β1 were significantly upregulated, which means podocytic adhesive capacity was able to be partially restored. We further demonstrated that four miRNAs (miR-124, miR-190, miR-217 and miR-188) participated in the process simultaneously through miRNA microarray analyses. Among the miRNAs, miR-124 was found to be the predicted miRNA target sites in both gene <italic>Itga3</italic> and <italic>Itgb1</italic> 3’UTRs. MiRNAs might play an important role in podocytic adhesion damage under mechanical stress.</p>
<p>In DN, elevated glucose concentrations and glomerular hypertension are the two major pathogenic factors affecting podocytes. The latter could lead to mechanical stress, which may cause architectural and biochemical changes of podocytes, including activation of local RAAS, upregulation of TGF-β1 and podocytic adhesion damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312460071">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, previous experiments show that podocytes are constantly exposed and sensitive to mechanical force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312460071">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312460071">13</xref></sup> In our previous study, we have proved that integrin α3 is downregulated secondary to diabetes accompanied by increased podocyte leakage from urea in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Spironolactone has preventive effects on podocytic adhesion. In the present research, to mimic diabetic conditions, podocytes were detected under mechanical stress. Aldosterone levels of podocytes were significantly higher under mechanical stress accompanied by upregulation of protein SGK1 and MR. Integrin α3 and β1 were both downregulated. This decrease was significantly restored by pretreatment with spironolactone.</p>
<p>Integrins are heterodimeric, transmembrane proteins that consist of a characteristic combination of α- and β-subunits that are receptors for cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312460071">14</xref></sup> Podocytes are anchored to the GBM principally via α3β1 integrin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312460071">15</xref></sup> Previous findings revealed that α3β1 integrin downregulation is causally related to podocytic adhesion damage, leading to the failure of the filtration barrier. The α3 integrin knockout mouse exhibits an immature GBM with podocyte foot process effacement and a reduction in the podocyte number.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312460071">16</xref></sup> Blockade of β1 integrin by a neutralizing antibody induced foot process fusion, proteinuria and detachment of podocytes from the GBM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320312460071">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320312460071">18</xref></sup> These findings then led us to in-depth analysis and thinking: What participates in podocytic adhesion damage by downregulating integrin α3β1 under mechanical stress?</p>
<p>MiRNAs are a class of short (21–24 nucleotides), noncoding RNA molecules that inhibit target gene expression by blocking protein translation or by inducing mRNA degradation and therefore have the potential to modulate biologic processes including development, cell proliferation and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320312460071">19</xref></sup> Emerging evidence suggests that expression of many crucial adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins are governed by miRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320312460071">20</xref></sup> Cao et al. reported that integrin β1 expression was reported to be directly regulated by miR-124 in the developing neural tube.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320312460071">21</xref></sup> A possible mechanism for the precise regulation of integrin α3β1 in podocytes might be through its regulation by miRNAs. In the present study, miRNA microarray analysis revealed that four miRNAs (miR-124, miR-190, miR-217 and miR-188) of podocytes were significantly upregulated under mechanical stress and significantly downregulated after spironolactone treatment, which was consistent with the changes of integrin α3β1. MiR-124 was found to be the predicted miRNA target sites in both <italic>Itga3</italic> and <italic>Itgb1</italic> 3’UTRs through bioinformatic assessment, suggesting its possible role in regulating genes <italic>Itga3</italic> and <italic>Itgb1</italic>. It cannot be excluded that the other three tested miRNAs (miR-190, miR-217 and miR-188) can also modulate <italic>Itga3</italic> or<italic>/</italic>and <italic>Itgb1</italic> but their effects may be masked by the endogenous miRNAs.</p>
<p>To summarize, our study demonstrates the potential relationship between miRNAs (miR-124, miR-190, miR-217 and miR-188) and expression of integrin α3β1 of podocytes under mechanical stress. To our knowledge, this is the first report that proves the miRNAs might participate in the podocytic adhesion damage under mechanical stress. In order to further validate the predicted miRNA binding sites, co-transfections of <italic>Itga3</italic> and/or <italic>Itgb1</italic> 3’UTR luciferase reporter and expression vectors for the selected miRNAs (miR-124, miR-190, miR-217 and miR-188) remain to be performed.</p>
