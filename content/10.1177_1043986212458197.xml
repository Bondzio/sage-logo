<abstract>
<p>This article explores the reasons for joining and staying in youth-oriented groups offered by 13 to 16 year-old adolescents residing in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Germany, all surveyed as part of two separate school-based youth and violence studies that used the same questionnaire and data collection protocol. The 1,785 youths included in the current analysis self-identified as members of one of three types of youth groups: noncriminal youth group, crime-involved youth group, and street-oriented youth gang, the latter defined by the Eurogang definition. Besides looking at why they joined their respective groups and how they benefitted from membership in them, the current study explores the ties between membership and measures drawn from self-control theory, bonding, and social learning theories, plus the collective influence of these variables on the level of delinquency attributed by the youths to their respective groups. The implications of the findings for both cross-national tests of theory and antigang policies are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Youth gangs are not just a North American problem. Over the past 20 years, criminologists around the globe have come to view the youth-oriented gang as a worldwide phenomenon. The single-nation study, often drawn from one location within that nation, represents a common approach to exploring this phenomenon. This type of research, once a rarity outside of the United States, has become far more common since the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986212458197">Covey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458197">Decker &amp; Pyrooz, 2010</xref>). Some studies of this genre have been combined into single-topic resource volumes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458197">Duffy and Gillig’s (2004)</xref> <italic>Teen Gangs: A Global View</italic> presents insights into gangs of teenagers found in 14 nations around the world; however, no two works are authored by the same people (see too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458197">Hazlehurst &amp; Hazlehurst, 1998</xref>). The concomitant consideration of a series of cross-national gang studies, although often interesting, rarely constitutes a straightforward, valid and reliable means to compare the types of gangs found in the various nations or to answer critical questions about why they form and the types of threats they pose for their communities. This generalization is especially valid when the researchers do not employ a common definition of what constitutes a gang, a topic explored later in this article.</p>
<p>A more beneficial approach employs a common categorical or typological method and summarizes a variety of international data about youth gangs and violent behavior, measures of the latter often taken from official records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986212458197">Curry &amp; Decker, 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986212458197">Covey (2010)</xref> provides a regionally organized review of extant literature on street gangs around the world, although acknowledging the problems related to how those gangs are defined and the limitations of such information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458197">Decker and Pyrooz (2010)</xref> also provide a somewhat piecemeal but ultimately cohesive look at what they call “worldwide gang violence,” again organizing it into geographic regions, including the United States and Canada, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Such works provide baseline information about the nature and scope of the gang problem around the world, but are incapable of yielding a truly comparative analysis of gangs, gang behavior, and gang members. Acknowledging the definitional and data problems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458197">Decker and Pyrooz (2010)</xref> conclude the following: “A more sophisticated understanding of gang violence, sensitive to context, culture, and country, is a long-term, but essential goal if knowledge is to inform effective responses” (p. 149).</p>
<p>Early in the 21st century, a series of comparative projects, using similar methods and definitions, began to provide transnational insights into a wide array of troublesome youth groups, a perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986212458197">Klein (2005)</xref> has argued was long overdue. For their part, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458197">Esbensen and Weerman (2005)</xref> compare and contrast youths involved in gangs and violence in the United States and the Netherlands, concluding that such efforts can reveal a great deal about such phenomena in each nation. In their study, gang-member responses were uniformly alike and different from those of nongang youths. Theoretically driven constructs taken from self-control, social learning, and social control theories also performed well in both the U.S. and Dutch samples. In a broader study of “deviant youth groups,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458197">Gatti, Haymoz, and Schadee (2011)</xref> employ data from the second International Self-Report Delinquency Study (ISRDS-2), a cross-national look at delinquency in 30 countries around the globe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458197">Gatti et al. (2011)</xref> use a uniform definition of street gang, the so-called “Eurogang definition,” which is reviewed later in this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043986212458197">1</xref></sup> However, the implications of this study are somewhat restricted by the fact that the ISRDS-2 looked at general delinquency and was not specifically a study of gangs.</p>
<p>It is also clear from this emergent body of comparative and international studies that only some of these youth groups represent law-enforcement problems for the communities in which they are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986212458197">Bennett &amp; Holloway, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458197">Howell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458197">Wyrick &amp; Howell, 2004</xref>). Many— perhaps most—such groups are simply gatherings of young people, congregating for reasons that are far more related to being adolescent than being delinquent. Moreover, U.S. gang experts suggest that how a local community responds to such groups can create a far worse situation, especially when they employ reactive or repressive law-enforcement tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458197">Howell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458197">Huff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986212458197">Huff &amp; McBride, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458197">Klein &amp; Maxson, 2006</xref>). Specifically, overreaction to a putative “gang problem” or misidentification of a group of misbehaving youths as a high-threat street gang can provide the social glue that binds loose-knit groups into far more stylized and organized street gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458197">Huff, 1990</xref>). Pundits in some nations even question the existence of street gangs, a position often tied to moral panics (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458197">Cohen, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986212458197">Goode &amp; Ben-Yehuda, 1994</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458197">S. Cohen (1980)</xref>, a moral panic exists when: “[a] condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests” (p. 9).</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion are observations that many young people commit illegal acts in groups but those groups are not truly gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458197">Miller, 1982</xref>). Other youths, members of full-blown street gangs, also commit criminal acts that have nothing to do with their gangs, as simply being in a gang accelerates and amplifies one’s engagement in illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986212458197">Battin-Pearson, Thornberry, Hawkins, &amp; Krohn, 1998</xref>). Moreover, the motivations for joining gangs are also quite disparate and the resulting gangs themselves are not all the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458197">Klein, 1995</xref>). Responding to the dearth of research models for youth gang studies in the global context, a group of academicians, policy analysts, and practitioners came together beginning in 1998 to form what eventually became known as the Eurogang Program of Research (hereafter referred to as Eurogang Network; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986212458197">Esbensen &amp; Maxson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458197">Klein, Kerner, Maxson, &amp; Weitekamp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986212458197">Weerman, Maxson, Esbensen et al., 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043986212458197">2</xref></sup> This group identified a series of conceptual, research and policy agenda, including the enumeration of ways to study youth gangs in Europe that did more than simply mimic gang research in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986212458197">Weerman et al., 2009</xref>). One of the biggest tasks, as it turned out, was simply agreeing on a definition of a gang, a task whose difficulty and significance has not escaped the notice of criminologists in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458197">Ball &amp; Curry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986212458197">Esbensen, Winfree, He, &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>). Since 2003, the Eurogang Network has endorsed a multi-dimensional definition for <italic>street</italic> gang, which consists of five elements: (a) the group in which a youth claimed membership had to be “street-oriented”; (b) the group had to have existed at least 3 months or more when the youth was a member; (c) the age of members had to range between 12 and 25 years; (d) illegal activities had to be acceptable to the group; and (e) the group actually had to engage in illegal activities. Only when all five elements are met could the informal social group in question be considered a street gang.</p>
<p>In an effort to bring a measure of clarity to the gang definition problem and add a truly comparative element to the debate, the current study explores youth group members living in two European nations. Before turning to an overview of the samples and measures employed in this article, it is first necessary to review what we know about why youths in the United States and elsewhere join gangs and the links between these explanations and delinquency theory.</p>

<title>Risk Domains and Delinquency Theory</title>
<p>Although this study is not exclusively about street gangs, the extant literature on this particular social phenomenon provides a good starting point, along with research on general youth violence. Since the 1990s, criminologists have focused the lens of a highly regarded medical and mental health paradigm—the risk-domain model—on delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986212458197">Wasserman et al., 2003</xref>). More recently, gang and violence researchers have used this model to orient their studies of why youths join gangs and what happens after they join them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986212458197">Hill, Lui, &amp; Hawkins, 2001</xref>; see too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen, Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Freng, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For the purposes of this work, a risk-domain is defined as a naturally occurring cluster or group of related factors that have been shown by empirical studies, with or without underlying theoretical explanations, to be associated with either antisocial or delinquent conduct, including youth violence and gang behavior. Gang researchers acknowledge at least five such risk domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>, p. 13; see too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986212458197">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458197">Howell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458197">Wyrick &amp; Howell, 2004</xref>). These domains can be connected to specific criminological theories, which is essential if the domain metaphor is to evolve from an interesting categorical device for studying gang and youth violence to an explanatory vehicle that can transcend time and place. First, consider the <italic>demographic-risk domain</italic>, which can include gender and living arrangement Although recent studies have found that females are members of street gangs and do engage in gang-related delinquency at rates that exceed previous estimations, males remain at higher risk than females for becoming street gang members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986212458197">Esbensen &amp; Winfree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986212458197">Esbensen, Deschenes, &amp; Winfree, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986212458197">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, &amp; Chard-Wierschem, 1993</xref>). Gang researchers have also long speculated that family-risk structure could be directly related to joining street gangs, as absent fathers fail to provide prosocial adult male role models or overworked mothers are unable to exercise the type and amount of paternal oversight needed to raise a teenaged youth; at a minimum, it could be indirectly related to gang membership through variables in the family-risk domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986212458197">Wright and Wright (1994)</xref> argue that two parent households provide increased supervision and surveillance of property; single parenthood, however, increases the likelihood of delinquency and victimization given that there is one less person to supervise adolescent behavior (see too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986212458197">Thornberry, Smith, Rivera, Huizinga, &amp; Stouthamer-Loeber, 1999</xref>). Given the possible indirect influence of family-risk structure, and in the interest of as complete a test as possible, the current study includes family-risk structure, defined in this instance as a family-risk with at least two parents or guardians versus any other family-risk configuration.</p>
<p>Demographic domain risk factors are generally more classificatory than theoretical. The measures associated with the second domain, <italic>individual-risk factors</italic>, are nearly all linked to criminological theorizing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen et al. (2010)</xref> note that this domain has inherent ties to both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458197">Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990)</xref> self-control theory and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458197">Akers’ (1985)</xref> social learning theory. Conceptually, the individual-risk domain represents a way of looking at those social psychological factors that can and often do influence human behavior, and includes such things as “rebelliousness, early initiation into problem behavior, favorable attitudes toward norm violation and constitutional factors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>, p. 13). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen et al. (2010)</xref> include impulsivity and risk seeking from self-control theory and perceived guilt and neutralizations from social learning theory in their study of youth gangs and violence. It is just as likely that other individual-level social learning variables, including social and nonsocial reinforcers, are at work in the decision to join a gang or engage in criminal activities with other youth and perhaps even join an informal social group.</p>
<p>The <italic>family-risk domain</italic> explores the ways that a family-risk can place a child on a trajectory toward gangs or protect him or her from them. Control theorists, ranging from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458197">Nye (1958)</xref> to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458197">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref>, view the family as a potential source of delinquency risk and protective factors. More than 50 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458197">Nye (1958)</xref> noted that the absence of family-risk restrictions on their progeny often leads to juvenile misconduct. Parental management and oversight are themes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458197">Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990)</xref> self-control theory, as poor parental engagement sets up a trajectory toward low self-control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458197">Hoeve et al. (2009)</xref>, in a recent meta-analysis of the links between parenting and offending, report that only variables capturing negative parental control had stronger effect sizes than positive parental monitoring. The fourth risk domain captures those peer-related forces that facilitate gang values and behaviors. Gang and violence researchers see this domain as dominated by such things as associating with and committing to delinquent peers and excluding contacts with conventional peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986212458197">Matza, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458197">Thrasher, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986212458197">Winfree, Vigil-Bäckström, &amp; Mays, 1994</xref>). Shared group values, such as the focal concerns of gangs described by W. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458197">Miller (1958)</xref>, and the instrumental socializing functions used by such groups to gain the individual’s loyalty are all part of this risk domain and clearly tied to Akers’ social learning theory.</p>
<p>The school is the locus for the fifth domain. As long ago as the 1920s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458197">Thrasher (1927)</xref> described how poor school performance and a lack of engagement in academic goals were tied to gang membership. The educational arena is important to control theories, ranging from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986212458197">Toby’s (1957)</xref> stake in conformity (i.e., low stake in conforming to the goals of education meant a high risk of delinquency) to Hirschi’s social bond theory (i.e., low commitment to academic norms and rules translated into a weaker bond to conventionality and a higher propensity for delinquency). Gang researchers have come to view the absence of academic success and failure in school as a central risk domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458197">Howell, 2009</xref>). Key descriptors of the <italic>school-risk domain</italic> include early and persistent antisocial behavior, academic failure and a lack of commitment to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458197">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>, p. 13).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043986212458197">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The use of the domains in delinquency research on western and central Europe has provided results consistent with U.S.-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458197">Esbensen &amp; Weerman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458197">Huizinga &amp; Schuman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986212458197">Nash, Mujanovic, &amp; Winfree, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986212458197">Ribeaud &amp; Eisner, 2010</xref>). In addition, it is possible that these domains can provide insights as to what attracts youths in other nations to various kinds of informal groups, ones oriented toward traditional gang behavior, general delinquency, or simply informal social aggregations. The present study, then, represents a unique opportunity to compare and contrast youth group-involved adolescents in two European nations, each culturally distinct from the other. Germany is a western European nation with a history of economic, social, and political stability, particularly the geographical region within Germany—the states of Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia—where the data were collected. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), however, only recently emerged from a vicious and protracted civil war in the mid-1990s and is still a nation in transition from a socialist-oriented political and social economy to a western-style democracy. Although this statement should not be taken to suggest that BiH is rife with all kinds of social, political, and economic turmoil, it is arguably a different sociocultural environment than the two German states included in the study. Keeping in mind these caveats, the inclusion of national residence—BiH versus Germany—as a variable in the present analysis should provide a more thorough examination of the risk-domain concept’s utility outside the United States.</p>
<p>The current research, then, addresses four specific questions. First, do youths in BiH and Germany report the same types of risk factors at work in their lives? Second, do they join different types of youth groups for the same reasons? Third, do they perceive the same benefits from the various types of youth groups? Finally, do they report that their respective groups engaged in the same types and levels of delinquency?</p>

<title>The Youth Surveys</title>
<p>The data used in this study were obtained by two independent sets of researchers, each group working separately at academic programs dedicated to the study of crime, justice and law, one in Germany and the other in BiH. What provided a common focus for both, and made the current study possible, is that the both sets of researchers employed the Eurogang Network’s questionnaire and research protocol. The Eurogang Youth Survey has been pretested in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia and the United States; it has been translated into Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, and, for the present research, Serbo-Croatian.</p>
<p>In 2004, researchers at the University of Tübingen’s Institute of Criminology undertook a school-based study of gangs and youth violence within the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg. The goal of their study was to look at the nature and extent of youth gang problems within local <italic>Hauptschule</italic>, the lower-level standard school for youths finishing elementary school education, essentially years five through nine of the nine years of compulsory education in Germany. Three <italic>Hauptschule</italic> agreed to participate in the study, permitting the researchers to survey students in grades seven through nine. Prior to its administration, parents were informed of the survey and its purposes, as well as their right to withhold consent for their children to participate. Less than two dozen parents/guardians withheld permission and, once their rights of refusal were explained to them, only three children among the 533 eligible youths in attendance on the administration day refused to complete a survey. That is, nearly 97% of those students in attendance could have participated; fully 99% of those in attendance and eligible for participation actually completed a survey. Thus, the researchers obtained completed questionnaires from 530 youths across three grade levels (years 7, 8 and 9) in three schools located in two states. Looking only at youths aged 13 to 16 years, when they may be at greatest risk for gang membership, and eliminating 10 cases with extensive missing data, yielded a final German subgroup of 474 youths.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Sarajevo’s Faculty of Criminal Sciences also modified the Eurogang instrument slightly, translated the entire Eurogang school survey into the appropriate language, and administered it to children attending school in five cities throughout BiH in 2007. Twenty schools were visited; within those schools, a total of 58 classrooms at five grade levels were randomly selected. Following a presentation on the purposes of the survey and a review of the students’ right to refuse to participate, more than 98% of the children in attendance completed the 12-page questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043986212458197">3</xref></sup> The final sample consisted of 2,206 children; however, 72 respondents were excluded due to missing values. Defining the target sample as youths aged 13 to16 yielded a BiH subgroup of 1,882 individuals.</p>

<title>Domain-based measures</title>
<p>Gender, age and living arrangement fall in the demographic domain. The German sample contained significantly more <italic>males</italic> than did the BiH sample (59.7% vs. 49.1%); in terms of <italic>age</italic>, the BiH youths were also slightly older, with a mean of 14.67 years, whereas the German sample averaged 14.35 years. Living arrangements were significantly different in the two samples, as nearly 89% of the German youths lived with two parents/guardians, whereas about 84% of the BiH youths reported the same <italic>living arrangement</italic>.</p>
<p>The survey included four questions indicating the extent of <italic>parental monitoring</italic>, part of the family risk-domain. Specifically, parental monitoring was measured by Likert-type response-set answers, ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree, to the following items: (a) when you go someplace, you leave a note for your parents or call them to tell them where you are; (b) your parents know where you are when you are not at home or at school; (c) you know how to get in touch with your parents if they are not at home; and (d) your parents know who are with when you are not at home. The items were summed and divided by four, providing a single indicator of parental monitoring that ranged from low (1) to high (5). On average, BiH youths reported significantly higher levels of parental monitoring than did the German adolescents (3.68 vs. 3.39). The combined sample’s Cronbach alpha for this scale (α = .66) suggested that the four items formed a reasonably reliable scale; however, the alpha level for the German data (α = .56) was lower than that recorded for the youths from BiH (α = .68).</p>
<p>The survey also included one school-risk domain measure: <italic>school commitment</italic>. This measure has direct ties to social bonding theory. School commitment was measured by Likert-type responses to the following three questions: (a) you try hard in school; (b) in general, you like school; and (c) you usually finish your homework. The measure of school commitment again ranged from low (1) to high (5). BiH youths on average exhibited a significantly higher commitment to school (3.63) than did the German youths (3.39). The three-item scale was reasonably reliable, as indicated by the alpha level (α = .63); once again, the nation-specific reliability analyses revealed that the scale was more reliable for the BiH adolescents (α = .70) than for the German youths (α = .55).</p>
<p><italic>Peer commitment</italic>, a peer risk domain variable with ties to social learning theory, explores the extent to which the juveniles exhibited intra-group loyalty in the face of external opposition. Three items addressed the context and extent of this loyalty, including: (a) if your group of friends was getting in trouble with at home, how likely is it that you would still hang out with them?; (b) if your group of friends was getting in trouble with at school, how likely is it that you would still hang out with them?; and (c) if your group of friends was getting in trouble with at home, how likely is it that you would still hang out with them? The possible answers included the following response set: (a) not at all likely, (b) a little likely, (c) somewhat likely, (d) likely, and (e) very likely. The Germans reported a significantly higher average peer commitment (2.64) than did the BiH youths (2.2); the Cronbach’s alpha (α = .71) portends a reasonably reliable scale overall, but less so for the German data (α = .59) compared with the BiH data (α = .76).</p>
<p>Ten questions explored the reasons for joining groups. Principal components factor analysis performed on these questions (data not shown) yielded three separate and distinct clusters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043986212458197">4</xref></sup> First, the youths were asked to indicate whether any of the following peer-linked factors motivated them to join their group: (a) to make friends, (b) to meet members of the opposite sex, and (c) to participate in group activities. The items created another peer risk domain variable, a <italic>social functions</italic> index, which ranged from zero (no social function reasons) to 3 (three social function reasons).</p>
<p>A second set of reasons addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458197">W. B. Miller’s (1958)</xref> contention that youths join gangs because of shared individual-based focal concerns, which in this case were measured by affirmative answers to the following reasons for joining: (a) to keep out of trouble, (b) for protection, (c) to get away with illegal activities, and (d) to have a territory of your own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1043986212458197">5</xref></sup> Again, the factor analysis revealed that none of these items loaded on the other two clusters and constituted a unique reason for joining gangs labeled <italic>focal concerns</italic>. This individual-level risk domain index ranged from 0 (no focal concern motivations) to 4 (four focal concern motivations); the mean values reported for both the German and the BiH youths were unremarkably different at 1.08 and 1.11, respectively.</p>
<p>A third cluster exhibited conceptual ties to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458197">Aker’s (1985</xref>, pp. 44-45) <italic>social/nonsocial reinforcers</italic>, which are both social factors that require conditioning, such as family-risk relationships, and intrinsically rewarding physiological stimuli, such as the abuse of psychoactive substances. The following reasons for joining an informal social group are circumscribed by these definitional parameters: (a) to get money or other things, (b) to get money or other things from selling drugs, and (c) because someone in your family-risk was a member of the group. The mean values for this individual-risk domain factor index, ranging from 0 (no social/nonsocial reinforcers) to 3 (three social/nonsocial reinforcers), were significantly higher for the German youths (.13) than the BiH youths (.04). Again, the factor loadings revealed that these three items created a unique cluster, one that was distinct from the other two.</p>
<p>The last two variables address perceived benefits of informal group membership. A second factor analysis (data not shown) revealed that each cluster of benefits was separate and unique. One cluster has clear ties to the individual-risk domain, specifically <italic>self-worth</italic>. Four items measured how the individual felt the group enhanced his or her self-worth, including (a) being in my group makes me feel important, (b) being in my group makes me feel respected, (c) being in my group makes me feel like I’m a useful person, and (d) being in my group makes me feel like I belong somewhere. The possible responses ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The context for each self-evaluation is the group. Specifically, membership in the group provides the youth with a reward or reinforcement, satisfying some intrapersonal need. Hence, each could be easily cast in the terminology of Akers’ social reinforcers; as he writes, “approving responses, recognition, status, and acceptance from significant others are universal social reinforcers for humans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458197">Akers, 1985</xref>, p. 45). The mean scores for self-worth reinforcers reported by the German and BiH youths were unremarkably different (3.11 and 3.08, respectively). The higher the scale score, the higher the self-worth reinforcing functions associated with informal group membership; this attitudinal scale was reasonably reliable overall (α = .78), as well as for the BiH data (α = .78) and the German data (α = .80).</p>
<p>The study’s final peer risk domain variable reflects the social reinforcer benefits of informal group membership, again measured by Likert-type responses (1-5) to the following items: (a) my group provides a good deal of support and loyalty for each other, (b) I really enjoy being in my group, and (c) my group is like a family-risk to me. The higher the scale score, the higher the perceived <italic>group support</italic> benefits. The mean values for the two samples were nearly identical (Germans = 3.8 and BiH = 3.76). This scale was reasonably reliable (α = .73) for the overall sample, as well as within both the BiH (α = .76) and German (α = .69) data.</p>

<sec id="section8-1043986212458197">
<title>Group membership measures</title>
<p>A central concern is whether a youth claimed to be a member of one of three types of groups. The first is a youth gang, hereafter referred to as a <italic>street gang</italic>, membership in which was determined by the Eurogang definition. About 7% of the combined age-truncated samples, or 128 individuals, were street gang members. Roughly 6% (88) of the BiH youths were street gang members, whereas 12% (40) of the Germans fit the criteria for a street gang member.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1043986212458197">6</xref></sup> Two key elements defined the second group: (a) the youths had to indicate that they spent time with an informal group of peers that was distinct from a sports club or other formal organization for youths and (b) those peers engaged in criminal conduct. Thus, only one of the sub-elements of the Eurogang definition, group criminality, circumscribed members of a <italic>troublesome youth group</italic>. By these criteria defined, 22% (73) of the German adolescents were members of troublesome youth groups, whereas among the BiH youths, about 5% (76) claimed membership in such a group. The third category consisted of youths who claimed to be members in an informal peer-oriented group, but the group did not engage in criminal mischief. For the German data, two-thirds (217) belonged to an <italic>informal youth group</italic>, but 89% (1,291) of the BiH youths indicated a similar type of membership. In sum, within the age-truncated sample of German youths, there were 69% (330) who claimed to be members of a street gang, a troublesome youth group, or an informal youth group; within the BiH data, there were 77% (1,455) who likewise claimed membership in one of these same three groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1043986212458197">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043986212458197">
<title>Group misconduct measures</title>
<p>The second set of dependent variables explores the nature and extent of group misconduct. Respondents were asked the following preliminary question: How often are the following things done by your group? Possible answers included (a) never, (b) rarely, (c) sometimes, and (d) often. The list of offenses included nine that could be collapsed into three crime categories: (a) <italic>property offenses</italic> (i.e., steal things, steal cars, burglary); (b) <italic>personal offenses</italic> (i.e., threaten people, aggravated assault, robbery); and (c) <italic>organized activities</italic> (i.e., fight, get protection money, sell illegal drugs). The mean index values for the Germans, which ranged from a low of 1.11 for organized activities to a high of 1.32 for personal offenses, were significantly higher than those reported by the BiH youths, which ranged from a low of 1.05 for organized activities to a high of 1.25 for personal offenses. It would appear, then, that the youth groups in Germany were more active criminally than similar groups in BiH.</p>

<p>The second set of figures examines the comparison of informal youth group members with gang members. In this case, nine of the 12 variables made significant contributions. Gang members were significantly older; had higher levels of peer commitment, gang focal concerns, self-esteem, and group support; and more often lived in BiH compared with Germany than was true for members of informal youth groups. Informal youth group members evidenced significantly higher levels of parental monitoring and school commitment than did the gang members. Finally, informal youth group members were far more likely to be male than were the members of street gangs.</p>
<p>The final four columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986212458197">Table 2</xref> summarize the statistics for members of troublesome youth groups contrasted with those adolescents claiming membership in street gangs. The first noticeable finding is that the results are quite different from those reported for the comparisons of membership in informal youth groups and street gangs. In particular, the comparisons were statistically significant in only three instances, suggesting at the outset that the members of troublesome youth groups and street gangs are more similar to one another than are members of informal youth groups and gangs. The significant differences are also interesting: troublesome youth group members compared with gang members are more likely to be male than female and living in BiH as opposed to Germany. Last, street gang members are significantly older than are the members of troublesome youth groups.</p>
<p>The analyses reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986212458197">Table 2</xref> address the extent to which the five risk domains are associated with joining three rather different types of youth groups. Gender, one of the demographic-risk factors, played an unexpected role: Males contrasted with females were more likely to be members of troublesome youth groups and informal youth groups than to be members of gangs. Also, age made a noteworthy contribution in two comparisons: The members of both informal youth groups and troublesome youth groups were significantly younger than the street gang members. Two of the three individual-risk domains—gang focal concerns and self-esteem—provided significant insights into the comparisons between informal youth group and gang members; none of the three made significant contributions in the comparisons between troublesome youth group and gang members. The parental and school domains performed well only for the comparisons that involved members of informal youth groups and gangs: higher levels of parental monitoring and school commitment were observed for members of informal youth groups when compared with street gang members. Only in the comparisons between informal youth groups and street gangs did peer commitments and group support, two of the individual domain measures, make significant contributions to the logistic regression equation: higher levels of both were noted for the latter group compared with the former one. Finally, being a resident of BiH compared with living in Germany provided interesting insights into membership in street gangs: When comparing members of informal youth groups to street gangs, BiH youths rather than Germans were significantly more likely to belong to the latter; when comparing troublesome youth groups to gangs, however, BiH youths rather than Germans were significantly more likely to belong to the former than the latter.</p>

<p>Youths whose groups commit higher levels of personal offenses report the following characteristics: Belonging to either a street gang or a troublesome youth group rather than an informal youth group; more social/nonsocial reinforcers; living in BiH rather than Germany; lower social function; living without two parents/guardians; more gang focal concerns; lower school commitment; lower parental monitoring; and higher self-esteem. The explained variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 30.3%) suggests that this equation rather efficiently predicts personal group offenses.</p>
<p>The third column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043986212458197">Table 3</xref> explores organized group-based offenses, activities generally associated with group organization and structure. Youths whose groups commit higher levels of organized offenses report the following characteristics: Belonging to a street gang rather than an informal youth group; more social/nonsocial reinforcers; belonging to a troublesome youth group rather than an informal youth group; lower social function; lower school commitment; and more gang focal concerns. The explained variance reported for this equation (<italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 19.1%) is more in line with that for property offenses than the one for personal offenses.</p>
<p>The prediction of misconduct attributed to their respective social collectives further accentuates the differences between the various types of youth groups and the differential relevance of the risk domains. First and foremost, being in a street gang is the strongest predictor of all three types of group offenses, followed in two instances by being a member of a troublesome youth group. This finding is not surprising given the fact that both troublesome youth groups and street gangs engaged in criminal mischief. These two variables did not dominate the analyses, as they were joined by school commitment and social/nonsocial reinforcers as significant factors in all three equations. As a general observation, the demographic-risk domain plays as a far smaller role in predicting attributed group offenses than it did in predicting group membership. Among the individual-risk domain factors only social/nonsocial reinforcers played a consistent and significant role across all offense types. Focal concerns were only important for personal and organized criminal activities, which is not entirely surprising as the focal concerns themselves emphasize face-to-face trouble, a central feature of both offense types. Interestingly, self-esteem plays a significant role only in the equation for personal offenses; however, its impact is relatively small, especially compared with the standardized coefficients for the other two individual-risk domains. Parental monitoring was important in the regression equations for property and personal offenses but not for organized crime offenses. School commitment significantly contributed to the prediction of all three offense types. The influence of the peer risk domain is striking in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043986212458197">Table 3</xref> for its absence: Neither group support nor peer commitment demonstrate a link to any of the alleged group offense categories. The social function reason for joining demonstrates a significant linkage only to group personal and organized offenses; however, if the youths joined a group for this purpose, then the offending of that group is lower in these two categories. In essence, this factor assumes the role of a protective factor against the most serious miscreant behavior attributed to those groups. Finally, the domain risk factors are far more important than a child’s nation of residence when it comes to understanding the offending attributed to his or her group.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Troublesome youth groups, positioned between informal youth groups and street gangs, are less well understood than either of the other two. The risk domains work well to predict membership in all three. However, they do a far better job of distinguishing street gang members from informal youth group members, compared with distinguishing gang members from troublesome youth group members. Three variables that work well across both sets of comparisons are living in BiH, age, and gender. When comparing members of informal youth groups to street gangs, residents of BiH are more likely than German youths to be in gangs; however, when comparing troublesome youth groups to gangs, the reverse is the case. Older youths are more likely to be gang members than members of both informal youth groups and troublesome youth groups; females are more likely to be members of gangs than members of informal youth groups and troublesome youth groups, the reverse being the case for males. The risk domains also reveal slightly more about group personal offending than either group-involved property or organized crime activities. Parental monitoring and school commitment levels, social/nonsocial reinforcers, group support, and most importantly belonging to a street gang rather than informal youth group perform consistently in predictions of group misconduct.</p>
<p>In each case, the theoretical measures performed as predicted by the respective theories. Parental monitoring and school commitment were strong and consistent factors in all analyses. Measures derived from social learning theory—specifically, peer commitment, social and nonsocial reinforcers—also performed well. Placing the theoretical variables in their respective risk domains also assisted in the interpretation of their respective influences. For example, the social learning theory’s social/nonsocial reinforcers were less important when considering the group in which a youth claimed membership than they were when looking at the type of offenses attributed to that group. Thus, it is not the type of group but the behavior specifically attributed to the group that provides the context in which reinforcements occur.</p>
<p>These analyses also contain several important caveats and implications for gang policies and practices. First, the reasons for joining various types of youth groups are as different as the groups themselves. Therefore, public programs intended to prevent one kind of youth group from forming or expanding may not work with another type. Efforts to diffuse the impact of a street gang may have negligible impact on troublesome youth groups and no impact on informal youth groups. Second, assuming that all youth groups pose the same threat to the communities where they exist may also be a mistake. Informal youth groups are not the same as troublesome youth groups; and both are different from youth gangs, less so in the case of troublesome youth groups. Children whose groups engage in property offenses are not subject to the same sets of risk domains as those whose groups engage in personal offenses or organized criminal activities. The differential impact of risk domains (and associated theoretical constructs), then, implies that group-oriented antidelinquency strategies may need to be crime-category specific.</p>
<p>This study is not without its limitations. First, there are sampling concerns, as the BiH school survey, although representative, is not a true random sampling of that nation’s youths. Similarly, the German youths represent a purposive sample of only two states and three schools. Second, the risk domains functioned rather well in both nations, a finding that is consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458197">Huizinga and Schuman (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458197">Esbensen and Weerman (2005)</xref>. Nonetheless, several of the scales exhibited somewhat low reliability coefficients, suggesting that the findings based on those scales must be tempered by concerns about their epistemological shortcomings. Consider too that the reliability analyses for the current study revealed that the various domain measures were more reliable for the BiH data than was the case for the German data, a finding that is interesting because BiH is a nation in social, political and economic transition. We clearly have much more to learn about the utility and possible limitations of such domains in cross-national and comparative research (see too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986212458197">Maguire, Wells, &amp; Katz, 2011</xref>). Third, the actual number of street gang members studied (<italic>n</italic> = 128) was relatively small, and the large number of youths claiming membership in the informal youth groups was so large (<italic>n</italic> = 1,508) that the law of large numbers could have skewed the analyses. In spite of these concerns, however, the present study does expand our understanding of the roles played by risk domains for various types of youth groups, and is suggestive of ways communities can respond to them. Clearly, we cannot look at congregations of youths on city streets and assume that they are all created the same way or pose the same threat to that community. If we make this mistake, then what is only a nuisance could become a far larger problem for the juvenile justice system and the community at large.</p>

<p>Two sets of Principal Components Factor Analysis with varimax rotation and Kaiser Normalizations were examined, one for the reasons for joining and one for the benefits of group membership. In both cases, none of the items loaded with a score equal to or greater than .3 on a component other than the theoretically viable one, where a score of .5 was required. The explained variance for the three factor reasons-for-joining solution was 45.6% and no factor loaded with an Eigen value of less than1; the explained variance for the two factor benefits-of-membership solution was 63.6%, with again no factor loading with an Eigen value of at less 1.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, these items also have strong conceptual ties to Aker’s (1985:48-49) discriminative stimuli. That is, shared definitions serve as a strong motivating factor that shape one’s decision-making processes, which in this case is the decision to join the group.</p>

<p>While the proportion of Germans who were gang member was twice that found within the BiH data, this difference is a not entirely surprising fact because the University of Tübingen team purposefully sampled schools defined by education experts as at risk for gang problems.</p>

<p>Before one assumes that the rest of the youths, ranging from 23% to 31% of the age-delimited data sets, were social isolates, it is important to recognize that the subjects were first asked if they participated in any teams, scouts, sports clubs or other formal groups; they were then asked the following question: In addition to any such formal groups, some people have a certain group of friends that they spend time with, doing things or just hanging out. Do you have a group of friends like that? It was this second question that provided the definitional framework for this study’s three types of groups. They could still be involved with other formal or informal groups.</p>
