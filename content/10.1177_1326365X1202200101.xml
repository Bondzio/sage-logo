<p>A student from Mumbai was asked in a phone interview why she was applying to study for a Master of Journalism programme at Wollongong University in Australia where I teach. She said, with her experience in public relations, she would like to move into ‘fashion and lifestyle journalism’.</p>
<p>‘Why fashion and lifestyle journalism where in Mumbai the majority live in slums?’ I asked. She demurred. She had never visited the slums of Mumbai, nor would she want to. She is a ‘Brahmin’. She reminded me of my interview with P. Sainath (rural affairs editor of <italic>The Hindu</italic>, and recipient of the 2007 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism) in Mumbai in April 2006. He said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This April in India, the number of farmers committing suicide in just one region, Vidharbha, crossed 400. This was very poorly covered. Very few national media groups sent their reporters to this region. But, they sent well over 500 journalists to cover the <italic>Lakme Fashion Week</italic>. And also gave phenomenal space to the fact that the Sensitive Index (SENSEX) of the Mumbai Stock Exchange crossed the 11,000 figure (at that time in April 2006 while the farm suicides in Vidharbha had soared past 500). This is the Great Disconnect between mass media and mass reality I spoke of. Journalism teachers should realise they are training their wards within this context. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1326365X1202200101">Sainath 2006</xref>)</p>

<p>Indeed, journalism educators often wonder at the ‘great disconnect’ between what they teach and what the industry expects. We are bent on equipping students with entry-level media skills as well as keeping sight of the goals of critical journalism education to inspire students to the higher ideals of ‘mission and service’ in the words of Mahatma Gandhi. Thus, the continuing efforts by media academics in developing countries to reform the journalism curriculum to achieve the ideal mix of theoretical and professional components. One of the barriers to achieve this goal is the poorly resourced media production facilities and the lack of lecturers experienced in professional journalism. <italic>Asia Pacific Media Educator</italic> (APME) revisits this theme in this issue with a special section focused on the issues of journalism education in India, which, Ang Peng Hwa notes in his prologue, are ‘a peculiarly Indian problem that requires a peculiarly Indian solution’.</p>
<p>Hence, the section features the perspectives of media academics from India (B.P. Sanjay, Tapas Ray, K.V. Nagraj, Nidhi Shendurnikar, Moina Khan and Surhita Basu) on what needs to be done to audit and raise the standards of journalism education in the country. CSHN Murthy, Associate Professor of journalism at Tezpur University in Napaam, Assam, compiled and reviewed the contributions.</p>
<p>Other contributors are from Australia (Kayt Davies; Heather Stewart et.al, Wajeehah Sabahat); Norway (Roy Krovel, Andreas Ytterstad and Kristin Skare Orgeret); Singapore (Andrew Duffy); Cambodia (Tilman Baumgartel), Japan (Harumi Gondo) and the United States (Paromita Pain). Their research articles and commentaries offer readers an insight into how journalism is taught in different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>This issue, published by SAGE Publications (New Delhi) also marks a lift in APME’s profile since the first issue was published in 1996 by the Graduate School of Journalism at University of Wollongong. At that time, the main journal that delved into media practices and communication research in Asia was <italic>Media Asia</italic>, published by the Asian Media Information and Communication Center (AMIC) in Singapore. In collaboration with a colleague, Barry Lowe, from City University of Hong Kong, I conceptualised the journal format and formed an editorial advisory board of media scholars from the region. The first call for paper was themed <italic>Media Education in Asia Pacific: Networking and Changing Trends.</italic></p>
<p>The first editorial for APME (Issue No. 1, 1996) was written on invitation by the head of the Graduate School of Journalism, the late Australian journalist, author and media educator, Professor Clem Lloyd. It is reproduced below to reflect APME’s guiding principles:</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific Media Educator is a new venture aimed at providing a forum for media educators across an increasingly important spectrum of comparative study.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Broadly defined, this area covers communications, journalism, media studies, cultural studies, applied media, and media arts, together with resonances in innumerable other disciplines. With rapid changes in media education and technology it may even extend to other areas that cannot be foreseen at the moment.</p>
<p>  In short, we are taking what the American journal <italic>Press/Politics</italic> describes as a ‘big tent’ approach, welcoming scholars, educators, theorists, journalists, communicators and practitioners to contribute to this journal.</p>
<p> Our main focus is the Asia/Pacific region, broadly defined. We will not, however, exclude contributions that are relevant and apposite from any part of the globe. Our only reservation is that articles, reports, reviews, comments, records of direct experience and other material have some relevance to media education, either directly or as shaped and modified through practical experience. We hope to draw on the best work in the wide range of disciplines applicable to media education and practice.</p>
<p> Because the APME has been conceived and initiated in journalism departments it is, perhaps, inevitable that at least in the formative period, some of our readers may feel that our approach is too narrow. The obvious way of correcting any imbalance, of course, is to encourage contributions from as wide a range of media-related disciplines as possible.</p>
<p> Our editorial board will work rigorously to provide a balanced approach to a wide range of conceptions, and perceptions, of media education. We are particularly interested in encouraging contributions about changes in the inter-relationships between media disciplines with the accumulating stresses of media convergence and technological change.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The core of this journal will be dedicated to refereed and rigorously evaluated research articles devoted to core issues of media education.</p>
<p>Given this emphasis on new research in media education, we hope also to stimulate a much wider range of contribution than pedagogical journals with a narrow, sometimes pompous, conception of what is appropriate for an academic publication. Be assured that we will find space for the innovative, irreverent and unorthodox contribution. Hopefully, we won’t be caught in the trap of taking ourselves too seriously.</p>
<p>APME aims to provide a forum capable of bringing together divergent interests in a crucial and challenging area of education and practice. And we provide a congenial meeting place for scholars to meet practitioners in a rewarding and attractive intellectual environment.</p>
<p>APME was ranked in the top 30 per cent of international journals in related disciplines by the Excellence for Research in Australia board of the Australian Research Council in 2010. ERA has since then changed its ranking system. The quality of an academic journal is now assessed in the context of its recognition within each discipline.</p>
<p>As part of our efforts to improve <italic>APME’s</italic> impact factor, citation frequency and international exposure, the journal will now be published twice a year (June and December) by SAGE Publications (India) from 2012 onwards.</p>
