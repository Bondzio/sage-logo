<abstract>
<p>Most health education specialists have been introduced to the idea of having a philosophy of education statement. Although some in the field have been writing about this career development exercise, little has been written about the process of developing one’s philosophy of education statement. This brief essay explains a sample process health education specialists can use to create or update their philosophy of education statement. The author gives a firsthand account of a systematic, disciplined, intellectually liberating, and reflective approach to articulating one’s philosophy of education statement, by considering the writings of select intellectual giants who have acted on human experience, thought, and practice in education. A philosophy of education statement should be useful to any health education specialist regardless of type of work, site, position in the organization, population served, or health topic. The resultant updated and precisely written statement serves to sharpen a health education specialist’s future role as a health educator, as well as contribute to his or her journey in lifelong learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health education specialists at some point in their careers hear about a philosophy of education, either for the field of public health or health education or as something a professional should consider developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912456533">Gambescia &amp; Black, 2011</xref>). In my presidential address in 2006 while serving as president of the Society for Public Health Education, I challenged the profession to do more to develop a philosophy of health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912456533">Gambescia, 2007</xref>). Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912456533">Black, Furney, Graf, and Nolte (2010)</xref> edited the <italic>Philosophical Foundations of Health Education</italic>. In this work, about 50 authors present philosophical perspectives found in the health education literature and five major constructs in philosophy of education: (a) purpose of health education, (b) role of learner, (c) role of teacher, (d) educational method, and (e) health content.</p>
<p>Discussing one’s philosophy is paradoxically familiar, yet esoteric. We may casually claim that we have a philosophy of work, play, and life in general. However, how often do we really think about our philosophy of health education? Surely philosophical musing is hard work, whether studying it formally in college or thinking about it as a professional. We know that a philosophy can be defined as one’s values, overall vision of, or attitude toward a given construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912456533">Velasquez, 2002</xref>), such as health education. Our philosophy of public health education, therefore, will strongly influence our approach to what we do as health education specialists.</p>
<p>How do you know what your philosophy of education is and what are the benefits to discovering this? Most educators at some point in their academic formation, as subject matter experts or as formal teachers, are introduced to developing a statement of their personal philosophy of education. This introduction may have taken place during a single course in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912456533">Webb, Metha, &amp; Jordan, 2000</xref>) or serve as one of the culminating learner activities in a health education specialist’s professional preparation program. One may have been introduced to this subject at a professional development or continuing education workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912456533">Gambescia &amp; Black, 2011</xref>). Others may have had mentors introduce this important topic to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912456533">Palmer, 2007</xref>). Long-time health education specialists may have something on file that reveals their philosophy of education, be it a powerful action phrase, a collection of quotes from an educator or historical intellectual, or a few pages they produced at some time in their career. Regardless when in their career or what format the philosophical musing has taken, it is healthy for health education specialists to periodically rethink their philosophy of education statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912456533">Black et al., 2010</xref>). To do so will help them understand why they do what they do and will naturally guide their practice.</p>

<title>Benefits of a Philosophy of Education Statement</title>
<p>A philosophy of education statement should be useful to any health education specialist regardless of type of work, place, position in the organization, population served, or health topic. However, spending time musing about one’s philosophy may not go over so well in a workplace that promotes more “Habits of Industry” rather than “Habits of the Heart” or “Habits of the Soul.” Regardless, in an era of positioning oneself in a competitive job market, having a well thought out philosophy of health education statement, either one to hand over to a future boss, or one to espouse to coworkers, could be what separates you from the other professionals. It also gives colleagues of your current or future organization a feel for “where you are coming from.” Sharing one’s philosophy of education statement with a potential supervisor helps both parties decide if the person will be a good fit for the position. Additionally, experienced health education specialists should seriously think about updating their philosophy of education statement as it is tangible evidence in one’s growth in the field of public health.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Having reviewed <italic>Philosophical Foundations of Health Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912456533">Black et al., 2010</xref>) for <italic>Health Promotion Practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912456533">Gambescia, 2011</xref>), I realized that little was said in the book about the process of writing one’s philosophy of education statement. This career development briefing describes a reflective process used to update a statement on personal practice theory and philosophy of education. It involves a systematic, disciplined, intellectually liberating, and reflective approach to articulating a philosophy of education statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839912456533">
<title>The Process</title>
<p>One’s philosophy of education emanates from several sources such as knowledge, life experiences, and one’s formed principles. The process presented here asks one to seriously consider a reflective approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912456533">Dewey, 1933</xref>) working through research, reading, and reflection and writing about those one believes has had significant contributions to philosophy of education (a knowledge base), after which you can write or update your personal practice theory and philosophy of health education statement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912456533">Figure 1</xref>). The selection of those whom you believe have influences your philosophy of health education should be those who have thought about, written and acted on subject matters and areas of interest to you as a health education specialist. For example, I had a long-time interest in political philosophy and its contributions to understanding building community and the meaning of good citizenship. Therefore, in developing my philosophy of education statement, I chose to read original works and biographies of some political philosophers. Some health education specialists may focus on pedagogical or andragogical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912456533">Knowles, 1984</xref>) strategies to teaching; others may wish to articulate their ideas about the democratization of education or the history of women in education. Others may explore the dynamic between public health professionals and community engagement. I selected what I considered “giants in the field” of intellectual history, philosophy, and philosophy of education who made what I believe were significant, world-wide, and continuing impressions on educational theory, practice, and leadership.</p>

</fig>
<p>In selecting your readings, identify those individuals who you believe have or could “speak to you” about developing a philosophy of education. You need not necessarily agree with all of the thoughts and writings of the individuals you select. The purpose of this first step is to read, and in many cases re-read, a selection of those who have made an enduring affect on a philosophy of education and intellectual areas of interest to you. You want to read works by those who can challenge you to think about your own personal practice theory and philosophy of education statement. It may be helpful to ask others in the field whom you respect to help you identify some of the philosophical “giants” who have helped shape the fields of education, public health and health education. I chose to read at a minimum one original work written by each of the persons selected and another reputable source that discussed their lives and works. In most cases, I read more than one of their original works.</p>
<p>Naturally, some of these works will be familiar to you from your professional preparation programs in college or continuing education seminars. Other works you will discover as you begin the research and reflection process. I chose to look at the works and influences of great intellectuals along traditional philosophical constructs; i.e. along epistemic (ideas about knowledge) ontological (ideas about existence of self and relation to others), and axiological (ideas about values) grounds. I selected 17 intellectuals (see below) and consulted nearly 60 original works and bibliographies about these individuals.</p>
<p>Writing one’s philosophy of health and health education statement is useful to any health education specialist, regardless of level and type of practice, population served, or subject matter. It is especially beneficial for experienced education specialists. The project, by design, is not a standard research exercise, but an attempt to consider both the corpus of reading and research during one’s tenure as a health education specialist, coupled with the knowledge and experience gained from formal and continuing education. The resultant work should serve to sharpen one’s future role as a health education specialist and educational leader, as well as contribute to one’s journey in lifelong learning.</p>
<p>While reading the seminal works by 17 select historical figures, key notes were taken along the three constructs above. After working through their writings and reading about their lives, a brief summary of their (a) general philosophy or philosophy of education and (b) enduring influence in education was made. A list of what the author considered seminal works for each intellectual and a few references related to the life of the intellectual was made. This formally written background material extended to some 80 pages.</p>
<p>In presenting to the reader the summary of their contributions, there was no attempt to make normative judgments or analytics, as tempting as it was. There was no comparing or contrasting of the individuals or how one individual was influenced by a prior individual’s work. However, those connections were noted personally, and had some value when writing the personal educational practice statement. The writing about each individual is descriptive. The objective is to allow you to consider in its simplest form the individuals’ works. The objective is to reflect on their contributions and see what can be gained from their work and then write your personal practice statement.</p>
<p>I was familiar at varying levels with the 17 individuals that were eventually selected. Some selections were quite natural, such as Plato and Aristotle. Some selections were made given particular interests outside of education, such as political philosophy; thus the selection of John Stuart Mill and Amitai Etzioni. Some were sentimental favorites, such as Jane Addams. Some intellectuals I had little knowledge of (Catherine Macaulay), and thus this project introduced me to more intellectuals in the philosophy of education. The individuals selected for study in this project were</p>

<title>Results of a Statement</title>
<p>The Personal Practice Theory and Philosophy of Education Statement that resulted from this process is four pages. It includes my thoughts about philosophy of knowledge, how it is generated, and its utility. I explain the unique characteristics of humans as it relates to knowledge, for example, that we by nature “desire to know” and that it is healthy to live a contemplative life. Educators help us to find our unique <italic>duty in life</italic> and often play a role in building our self esteem. I believe that education in general and health education in particular is about learning <italic>self mastery</italic> to <italic>habituate the mind</italic> to organize, prioritize, and appropriately react to impressions in our lives. However, the test of the value of the individual is not solely individual achievement but how the individual responds to a lived social experience. I agree that humans are by nature social and that we aspire to belong to the <italic>polis</italic> and live in harmony not simply for protection or economic benefit but because there is a personal desire to develop camaraderie and friendship. Remarkable educators can assist us in nurturing our innate sense for <italic>empathy</italic>, which involves feeling and caring for others and having concern for the common good.</p>
<p>The statement develops the notion that we are <italic>citizens</italic> who have responsibilities in a participatory democracy and that people should strive for <italic>moral excellence</italic>. Democracy cannot exist without a sense of community; therefore, a major goal of education is to develop <italic>good citizenship</italic> among students or adults. Although we live in a diverse society, we have a lot more in common that is good and gives us something to work with during difficult times. Instead of focusing on the values, customs, and conventions in which we differ, we should first identify what values we can agree on and work from there.</p>
<p>I believe the educational process should value <italic>academic freedom</italic> for both the educator and the learner. Health education specialists should promote diverse ideas and encourage critical thinking. We should seek a high level of tolerance not simply related to the corporeal but to the intellect of the people and populations with which we work. The role of education is to help groom “disinterested, critically minded persons” who can advocate for meaningful social and political change and enhance their health. I believe that schools should unabashedly provide both formal and informal character and moral education. In the statement, I attest that virtue must not only be understood, it must be practiced and it can be learned. Educators can easily integrate knowledge and virtue. Important virtues include justice, prudence, fortitude, and temperance.</p>
<p>The statement I wrote describes important elements in a curriculum; for example, a good school curriculum teaches students (a) <italic>Habits of Industry</italic>, (b) <italic>Habits of the Heart</italic>, and (c) <italic>Habits of the Mind</italic>. Furthermore, a curriculum, through either single courses or integrated in any curriculum, should give students healthy exposure to an intellectual heritage. A well-educated person is one who has attained good character, high morals, and knowledge that can make her or him a valued citizen of society as well as a good health education specialist.</p>
<p>I recognize in the statement that there are differences in learning styles among individuals, among various ages, and between genders, but <italic>ceteris paribus</italic> there is no inherent difference in intellectual attainment and character among all people regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, place of birth, or place where they are living in the world. I believe that the differences are most often explained by social and political constructs and; therefore, a liberal, democratic, and just society ensures <italic>equality of conditions</italic>. However, educators in partnership with schools and communities they serve have a moral obligation to identify leaders in basic societal functions and nurture those leaders. If a society aims to sustain itself, it must identify competent leaders. In the statement I admit to the existence of both good and evil in the world and that we must learn how to do things that are good and avoid evil. I believe that it is important for us to live an orderly and purpose-driven life and to help counter evil we can look to <italic>Divine Virtues</italic> of faith, hope, charity, and love. Finally, I state that education is what is needed to preserve liberty and ensure that we have an opportunity for happiness. If we are happy, then we will flourish.</p>
<p>The document of formal notes that I created was a robust 80 pages in length. I dedicated two to four pages for each intellectual. At the end of the write-up on each person under study, I had a list of important original works and a bibliography. In my personal statement above, one should be able to recognize the influence that these 17 individuals had on helping me articulate my philosophy of education.</p>

<sec id="section6-1524839912456533">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, this reflective process should not be approached as a standard research paper but as an attempt to consider both the corpus of reading and research over a life time, coupled with one’s knowledge and experience gained to date in the area of public health and health education practice. If approached correctly, such a project might serve as an interesting and valuable culminating experience for a health education degree program. The process involves a systematic, disciplined, intellectually liberating, and reflective approach to articulating a practice theory and philosophy of education statement drawing from the works of select intellectual giants who have acted on human experience, thought, and practice in education. The resultant updated statement should serve to sharpen one’s future role as a health education, specialist, as well as contribute to the journey in lifelong learning. Having a well thought out philosophy of education, health, and health education has numerous career development benefits.</p>
