<italic>Conversations About Reflexivity</italic> is an edited collection of articles based on philosophical and sociological analyses on reflexivity as a concept that provides, both theoretically and empirically, a fruitful dimension for sociological research. The basic idea of the book is in presenting various philosophical and scientific approaches to reflexivity and in showing the relevance of this concept in the different fields of sociology. As the editor of the study, Margaret S. Archer, states in her Introduction, ‘reflexivity really belongs to no particular school of thought, unlike other equally general concepts' (pp. 3–4). It can be said that the common denominator for the different views about reflexive monitoring of action is that agents are seen as active rather than passive subjects. This active view of human action means that reflexive deliberation of action is an important element when analysing action as a social and sociological phenomenon. The pragmatist tradition developed in American philosophy and social science gives strong support to this approach, and most of the current discussion about reflexivity is based on pragmatism. Archer’s social theoretical analyses about the role of internal conversation as a way of solving the problem of agency and structure can be considered as a new conceptual approach to reflexivity, although the intellectual scope of this volume is broader than Archer’s contribution alone.</p>
<p>This edited book provides a detailed and diverse view of some of the important theoretical traditions connected with the study of reflexivity. It is in four parts: in the first (Reflexivity and Pragmatism), the role of pragmatism in understanding reflexivity is analysed from essays by Norbert Wiley, Vincent Colapietro and Frédéric Vandenberghe. In the second part (Reflexivity and Realism), the focus is critical realism and its contribution to reflexivity. This part contains articles by Andrea M. Maccarini and Riccordo Prandini, Andrew Sayer, Margaret S. Archer and Pierpaulo Donati. All the articles approach reflexivity from the standpoint of Archer’s works. The third part (Modes of Reflexivity) concentrates on the different forms of reflexivity. The articles presented in this part of the analysis are based on Archer’s qualitative research on internal conversation and the four basic modes of reflexivity that she has described. Adam Mrozowicki’s article is an analysis of the life strategies of Polish workers; Helena Flam’s an overview of research based on the critical view of silenced groups; and Douglas V. Porpora and Wesley Shumar’s an examination of the modes of reflexivity by the use of quantitative data. The fourth part (Reflexivity in Production and Consumption) broadens reflexivity to consumption theory and to the field of organization research. In Pablo Garcia-Ruiz and Carlos Rodriguez-Lluesma’s article, consumption is considered as a social practice based on reflexive consumers. In Alistair Mutch’s article the focus is in the use of information and communication technology in organizations and its connection with reflexivity.</p>
<p>Pragmatism is the philosophy of action. The key figures of classical American pragmatism considered reflexivity as an elementary part of human action and interaction: names such as Charles S. Peirce, John Dewey, William James and G. H. Mead. In the opening essay, Norbert Wiley considers Peirce’s view of the duality of action as a way of overstepping the dilemmas of Mead’s and Schutz’s orientation. According to Wiley, Peirce saw the self and social relationships as dimensions of action, not as opposite parts of action. Wiley’s article deals with the role of inner speech as a way of controlling human behaviour. ‘Dialogue is the magneto of the self, the controlling process', as Wiley puts it (p. 36). Vincent Colapietro’s short article deals with the basic question of the pragmatist view of the private dimension of the human mind and its role in our action. At the beginning of his article he elicits the fact that some philosophers (Hansen) have criticized and some sociologists (Archer, Wiley) have defended Peirce’s philosophical works. Colapietro claims that the Archer and Wiley account of self is a more ‘accurate portrait of human subjectivity’ (p. 52) and a fruitful standpoint for further analysis. The focus of Vandenberghe’s article is in hermeneutics and its relation to the pragmatist tradition.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of reflexivity for realism as a social scientific approach? This question is closely connected with Archer’s theory of agency, which is critical of Bourdieu’s and Giddens's sociological action theories. The essential point of view is that realism defends a non-empiricist, stratified and relational ontology of the social world, as Maccarini and Prandini state at the beginning of their joint article, in which they critically consider Luhmann’s and Habermas's views on reflexivity. The problem with their approach is in the one-sided view of reflexivity. In the next two essays the focus is on the habitus concept and its relation to reflexivity. According to Sayer, there is a need to combine habitus with internal conversation instead of rejecting Bourdieu’s theoretical views. He criticizes Archer for not seeing the role habitus has as a part of our action as competent members of society. Archer answers to Sayer’s, Elder-Vass's and Fleetwood’s critique by considering communicative reflexivity as a tool for producing contextual continuity for human beings, since routine action no longer provides this continuity in modern society. Archer refers to her book about this theme, and her article contains interesting comments on various attempts to reconcile habitus with reflexivity. In the final article of the second part, Donati broadens the discussion on reflexivity by analysing different theoretical views on reflexive modernization and introducing his own view based on relational sociology.</p>
<p>Archer’s two most recent books have been an important source of inspiration for further studies on the modes of reflexivity. This point of view becomes clear in the third and fourth parts of the book. Adam Mrozowicki’s article contains an interesting analysis of Polish workers' life strategies after the collapse of state socialism in Poland based on biographical interviews. Mrozowicki presents a new typology of workers' life strategies based on the distinction between community-centred and private-centred strategies. The idea is to describe the forms of reflexivity of working class people who are living under hard social change. Mrozowicki shows that it is wrong to speak about working class as a homogeneous group, because the forms of reflexivity vary according to the structural and cultural contexts. Helena Flam’s article underlines the meaning of emotions. The focus of her consideration is on the emotional problems of oppressed social groups that have problems with their identity. Instead of seeing reflexive consideration as an unproblematic process, she analyses the questions connected with the structural processes, which lead to a short-circuited self. Porpora and Shumar’s article introduces a new classification of the forms of reflexivity based on their quantitative data. They show that Archer’s approach to reflexivity is also useful in quantitative research, although their perspective differs slightly from Archer’s frame of reference.</p>
<p>According to this book, reflexivity is a central theme for the social sciences, although there is no common understanding over how to study it. The various articles in <italic>Conversation About Reflexivity</italic> underline the point that it is reflexivity that forms an important perspective to human action, social practices and the formation of emotions. As human beings, we do not just adapt passively to the social conditions but actively create life strategies, and reflexively evaluate what is ethically important for us. It is this side of evaluative activity in our life that makes Archer’s considerations on reflexivity so central for social scientific research. The project of a general introduction to reflexivity is, of course, complicated. It is quite a new topic in social theory. The study shows, however, that pragmatist tradition and critical realism contain theoretical similarities considering the way of understanding human subjectivity. In this sense, it is important to continue the dialogue and broaden it to other social scientific traditions, as phenomenological sociology, which also emphasizes the meaning of subjective meanings.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a timely collection of articles on a topic of increasing importance for our understanding of reflexivity and themes related to it, such as human action, agency, selfhood, identity, mental health, pragmatist philosophy and sociology, critical realism and reflexive modernization. The various considerations on the meaning of reflexivity quite clearly show that reflexivity is really an important concept for the social sciences, not just a central concept for psychology or philosophy. Although there is some thematic overlapping and repetition between the essays, all are written with a conceptually clear style. The editor has done an excellent job in carefully refining all the details of the articles all the way. There are some great philosophical differences between pragmatist and realist orientations, but this study shows that dialogue between the leading theorists of the field can be fruitful and lead to constructive cooperation on the fundamental questions of social theory. It shows that reflexivity is also an important conceptual tool in both qualitative and qualitative social research, although the concept needs some elaboration, as in the case of Mrozowicki’s article. In any case, the study clearly brings up that reflexivity is an essential concept for sociological research and that it opens up new perspectives in the different fields of sociology.</p>
