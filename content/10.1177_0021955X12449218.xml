<p><italic>Inventor(s):</italic> Parmentier, Hans; Van Tittelboom, Pieter; Persijn, Bart; Termont, An; Ledoux, Nele</p>
<p><italic>Assignee:</italic> Recticel</p>
<p>The process comprises preparing a reaction mixture from a polyisocyanate component and from a polyol component which comprises one or more polyester polyols formed from at least one dimer fatty acid and/or at least one dimer fatty alcohol. In order to improve the processability of the polyurethane flexible foams so that these foams can be produced with the desired hardness and mechanical properties over a broad density range, the isocyanate reactive compounds contain, per 100 parts by weight thereof, 25 to 95 parts by weight of said polyester polyols and 5 to 75 parts by weight of one or more polyether polyols which are free of dimer fatty chains. In this way, no lipophilic filler is needed so that the fogging and emission properties of the foam can be improved. Moreover, softer foam can be produced without having to apply a too low NCO index resulting in better mechanical properties and in particular in a lower compression set. Finally, higher foam densities can be achieved with an isocyanate component having a lower functionality so that the hardness of these foams can be reduced.</p>

<p>This concept provides a foam having excellent hardness, dimensional stability, thermal moldability, and mechanical strength; the foam being suitable for the midsole, inner sole, or outer sole of a shoe. Provided is a foam that has a specific gravity of 0.1–0.98 g/cc and is obtained by crosslinking a foaming composition containing: (a) a block copolymer containing 65–95 mass% of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon and 5–35 mass% of a conjugated diene, the block ratio of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon polymer being 40–98 mass%, the storage modulus (E') at 30°C in dynamic viscoelastic measurement being 3 108 to 2.35 109 Pa, and one or more peak temperatures existing in the range of 85 to 125°C for the tand function of a dynamic viscoelastic measurement; (b) isoprene rubber and/or diene rubber; (c) a filler; and (d) a blowing agent; the mass ratio of component (a)/component (b) being 1–30/70–99, and the content of components (c) and (d) being 1–100 mass parts and 0.1–30 mass parts, respectively, relative to a total of 100 mass parts of components (a) and (b).</p>
