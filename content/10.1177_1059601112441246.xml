<p>Whereas existing alliance portfolio studies mainly focus on the structure or management of alliance portfolios, we conceptually explore the connections between them. In particular, we formulate propositions, arguing that the formalization, centralization, and customization of alliance portfolio management moderate the relationship between the structural characteristics of alliance portfolios (i.e., alliance portfolio size and alliance portfolio heterogeneity) and innovation performance. Based on this assessment, we identify different alliance portfolio management bundles for different alliance portfolio structures and formulate interesting avenues for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Firms increasingly adopt an open innovation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112441246">Chesbrough, 2003</xref>) in which they rely on alliances or “any voluntarily initiated interfirm cooperative agreement that involves knowledge sharing, or co-development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112441246">Gulati, 1995</xref>, p. 619) to complement and supplement their internal innovation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112441246">Hagedoorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112441246">Poot, Faems, &amp; Vanhaverbeke, 2009</xref>). Although alliance research traditionally focuses on the single alliance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112441246">Doz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112441246">Lui &amp; Ngo, 2005</xref>) or the broader network of direct and indirect alliance ties in which a firm is embedded (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112441246">Ahuja, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601112441246">Wincent, 2008</xref>), various alliance researchers point to alliance portfolios, which are defined as “a firm’s collection of direct alliances with partners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112441246">Lavie, 2007</xref>, p. 1188), as an important additional unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112441246">Jiang, Tao, &amp; Santoro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112441246">Wassmer, 2010</xref>). Alliance portfolios are theoretically significant because they have aggregate properties (i.e., synergies and constraints across alliances in the portfolio) that affect the focal firm’s innovation performance but are not visible when focusing on individual alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601112441246">Wassmer &amp; Dussauge, 2010</xref>). In addition, whereas traditional network studies provide a quite deterministic account of firms’ position in the broader network, alliance portfolio studies illuminate that firms can actively influence this network by shaping and managing their alliance portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112441246">Lavie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112441246">Ozcan &amp; Eisenhardt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the emerging alliance portfolio literature, two different research perspectives can be identified. The structural perspective (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112441246">Baum, Calabrese, &amp; Silverman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112441246">Faems, Van Looy, &amp; Debackere, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112441246">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2006</xref>) focuses on the structural characteristics of alliance portfolios such as alliance portfolio size (i.e., the number of alliances in the portfolio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112441246">Deeds &amp; Hill, 1996</xref>) and alliance portfolio heterogeneity (i.e., the extent to which alliance partners in the portfolio provide access to different resource sets; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112441246">Lavie, 2006</xref>) and their innovation performance implications. In contrast, the managerial perspective (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112441246">Goerzen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112441246">Hoffman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>) focuses on the governance of core alliance portfolio processes (i.e., monitoring, coordination, knowledge transfer), identifying a wide variety of practices and tools that might facilitate alliance portfolio management.</p>
<p>Although existing alliance portfolio studies provide valuable insights into the structural properties <italic>or</italic> managerial aspects of alliance portfolios, they largely ignore the interactions between them. The structural alliance portfolio perspective, for instance, remains rather silent on the managerial implications of simultaneously engaging in multiple alliances with different partners. Nevertheless, we expect that, whereas the structural composition of the alliance portfolio largely determines the <italic>potential</italic> for synergistic value creation across alliances in the portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112441246">Wassmer &amp; Dussauge, 2011</xref>), it is the alliance portfolio management approach that determines whether such synergies are actually <italic>realized</italic>. At the same time, we expect that the added value of particular practices and tools to manage alliance portfolios might depend on the size and heterogeneity of these portfolios. Such a contingency perspective deviates from existing alliance portfolio management research, which tends to apply a more universalistic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112441246">Delery &amp; Doty, 1996</xref>), assuming that added value of alliance portfolio management practices does not depend on the context in which they are embedded.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is therefore to generate insights in the connections between alliance portfolio composition, alliance portfolio management, and innovation performance. In particular, we want to conceptually explore how different alliance portfolio management dimensions (i.e., centralization, formalization, and customization) moderate the relationship between structural characteristics of the alliance portfolio (i.e., size and heterogeneity) and the focal firm’s innovation performance, which is defined as the number of new and/or improved products or services that a firm launches into the market in a particular year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112441246">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is structured as follows. First, we provide an overview of existing research on alliance portfolio structure and alliance portfolio management. Subsequently, we develop propositions on how alliance portfolio management dimensions might moderate the relationship between structural alliance portfolio characteristics and innovation performance. In the discussion and conclusion section, we rely on our conceptual findings to identify specific bundles of alliance portfolio management dimensions for different kinds of alliance portfolio structures and formulate potential avenues for future research.</p>

<title>Structural and Managerial Perspectives on Alliance Portfolios</title>
<p>In the existing alliance portfolio literature, two different perspectives can be identified: the structural and the managerial perspective (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112441246">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="section3-1059601112441246">
<title>Structural Perspective</title>
<p>Scholars adopting the structural perspective point to a wide variety of structural properties (e.g., alliance portfolio size, alliance portfolio heterogeneity, alliance portfolio quality, alliance portfolio breadth) that influence firm performance (for an extensive review of this literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112441246">Wassmer, 2010</xref>). In this study, we focus on alliance portfolio size and alliance portfolio heterogeneity as these two structural properties have received most attention in existing research on the innovation performance implications of alliance portfolios.</p>
<sec id="section4-1059601112441246">
<title>Alliance portfolio size and innovation performance</title>
<p>Counting the total number of alliances in which the focal firm simultaneously participates, numerous scholars provide evidence that alliance portfolio size positively influences the focal firm’s innovation performance. In particular, they show that the size of the alliance portfolio positively influences innovation performance indicators such as (a) the total number of new products produced by the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112441246">Gonçalves &amp; Gonçalves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112441246">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2004</xref>), and (b) the total number of granted patents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112441246">Baum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112441246">Shan, Walker, &amp; Kogut, 1994</xref>). In general, these studies seem to confirm resource-based arguments that, as firms simultaneously engage in different alliances, they get access to a broader stock of complementary resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112441246">George, Zahra, Wheatley, &amp; Khan, 2001</xref>), have more possibilities to realize economies of scale and scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112441246">Lavie &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>), and experience more learning opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112441246">Kale &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>). As the size of the alliance portfolio increases, there also is a higher potential for facilitating interdependencies where “one alliance in a firm’s portfolio has a positive impact on another alliance in the portfolio” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>, p. 30). Such facilitating interdependencies might emerge, for instance, when different alliances are part of the same broader network, provide complementary offerings, or promote similar standards and infrastructure.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, some studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112441246">Deeds &amp; Hill, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112441246">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2006</xref>) suggest that there are limitations to the positive impact of the number of alliances on innovation performance. They report an inverted U-shaped relationship between alliance portfolio size and the focal firm’s ability to develop new products. Different arguments are provided to explain this U-shaped relationship. First, it is argued that, when alliance portfolio size is already high, the ability of each additional alliance to make a unique contribution is likely to become lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112441246">Burt, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112441246">Gulati, 1995</xref>). Second, as the size of the alliance portfolio substantially increases, focal firms’ ability to process all knowledge inflows from different alliances might become restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112441246">Gilsing, Nooteboom, Vanhaverbeke, Duysters, &amp; van den Oord, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112441246">Rothaermel &amp; Alexandre, 2009</xref>). Such lack of absorptive capacity might hamper the ability to effectively realize facilitating interdependencies among different alliances in the portfolio. Finally, it is likely that management’s ability to properly screen partners and monitor alliances declines in the case of an increasing number of alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112441246">Deeds &amp; Hill, 1996</xref>). In such circumstances, firms face an increased likelihood of constraining interdependencies, where “one alliance in a firm’s portfolio has a negative impact on another alliance in the portfolio” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>, p. 30). Such a situation can emerge when different alliances are part of competing networks, provide substitutive offerings, or promote competing technologies. These constraining interdependencies are expected to negatively influence the innovation performance of firms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059601112441246">
<title>Alliance portfolio heterogeneity and innovation performance</title>
<p>Next to alliance portfolio size, scholars point to portfolio heterogeneity as a structural characteristic that influences a focal firm’s innovation performance. Alliance portfolio heterogeneity refers to the degree to which alliance partners own different kinds of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112441246">Lavie, 2006</xref>). In particular, a distinction is made between a homogenous alliance portfolio, in which the resource sets of partners are similar, and a heterogeneous alliance portfolio, in which alliance partners own different resource sets.</p>
<p>Looking at the focal firm’s value chain, some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112441246">Baum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112441246">Powell, Koput, &amp; Smith-Doerr, 1996</xref>) look at alliance portfolio heterogeneity in terms of the presence of upstream, downstream, and horizontal alliance partners in the portfolio. They argue that alliances with upstream partners, such as universities and research institutes, provide the opportunity to engage in explorative collaborative activities, such as fundamental research, experimentation, and improvisation. At the same time, alliances with downstream partners, such as customers and suppliers, allow for exploitative collaborative activities, such as fine-tuning, upscaling and adjusting existing products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112441246">Faems et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112441246">Lavie &amp; Rosenkopf, 2006</xref>). Alliances with horizontal partners, such as competitors, provide the opportunity to share industry-specific knowledge and jointly build platforms and industry standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112441246">Kim &amp; Higgins, 2007</xref>). Adopting concepts from social network theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112441246">Granovetter, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112441246">Uzzi, 1997</xref>), other scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112441246">Hagedoorn, Cloodt, &amp; Van Kranenburg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601112441246">Rowley, Behrens, &amp; Krackhardt, 2000</xref>) operationalize alliance portfolio heterogeneity in terms of the distinction between weak alliance ties (i.e., alliance that are characterized by limited interaction frequency and resource commitment) and strong alliance ties (i.e., alliances that are characterized by extensive interaction frequency and resource commitment). They argue that, whereas strong alliance ties allow for the exchange of fine-grained information about the partner’s existing capabilities, weak alliance ties lead to novel information about emerging capabilities. Finally, alliance portfolio heterogeneity is measured by examining to what extent the focal firm simultaneously collaborates with national and international partners, assuming that the resource stocks of these partners are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112441246">Duysters &amp; Lokshin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112441246">Lavie &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although different scholars focus on different partner characteristics to operationalize alliance portfolio heterogeneity, they all emphasize that higher heterogeneity improves the focal firms’ innovation performance. In particular, it is argued that the broader the scope of resource sets to which the focal firm gets access via its alliance portfolio, the higher the likelihood that it can simultaneously engage in exploitation of its existing capabilities and exploration of new capabilities, increasing its innovation performance. Moreover, some initial empirical evidence for this reasoning is present. Relying on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112441246">Blau’s (1977)</xref> index of heterogeneity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112441246">Baum and colleagues (2000)</xref>, for instance, develop an alliance portfolio heterogeneity measure, reflecting the extent to which nine different kinds of alliance partners (i.e., nonrival biotechnology firms, potential rival biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, universities, research institutes, government labs, industry associations, and marketing companies) are represented in the focal firm’s alliance portfolio. Based on this measure, they find that alliance portfolio heterogeneity positively influences the focal firm’s yearly number of granted patents. In a similar vein, other scholars observe that greater alliance portfolio heterogeneity has a positive impact on (a) the proportion of sales that can be attributed to new or improved products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112441246">Faems et al., 2005</xref>) and (b) the probability of introducing new innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112441246">Nieto &amp; Santamaria, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, structural alliance portfolio scholars provide evidence that both alliance portfolio size and alliance portfolio heterogeneity influence the focal firm’s innovation performance. However, these scholars remain silent on how such portfolios are actually managed, which is the focus of the managerial perspective on alliance portfolios.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059601112441246">
<title>Managerial Perspective</title>
<p>Relying on insights from organizational learning theory and dynamic capabilities theory, managerial alliance portfolio scholars stress the importance of alliance management capabilities or “a firm’s ability to identify partners, initiate alliances, and engage in ongoing management and possible restructuring and termination of these alliances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601112441246">Khanna, 1998</xref>, p. 351). In addition, they point to the need for specific tools and practices to build up such alliance management capabilities.</p>
<p>To synthesize this variety of best practices, we identify the underlying theoretical dimensions that these practices have in common. In particular, we rely on organizational design literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112441246">Aiken &amp; Hage, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112441246">Damanpour, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112441246">Lampel &amp; Mintzberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112441246">Pugh, Hickson, Hinings, &amp; Turner, 1968</xref>) to make a distinction between three different dimensions of alliance portfolio management (APM): APM centralization, APM formalization, and APM customization.</p>
<sec id="section7-1059601112441246">
<title>APM centralization</title>
<p>In line with organization design scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112441246">Aiken &amp; Hage, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112441246">Dalton, Todor, Spendolini, Fielding, &amp; Porter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112441246">Pugh et al., 1968</xref>), we define APM centralization as the degree to which decision power about the alliance portfolio is concentrated within the organization. In a centralized APM system, most strategic alliance portfolio decisions are made at the corporate level, whereas in a decentralized APM system, the power to make strategic alliance portfolio decisions is much more dispersed across different levels of the organization.</p>
<p>Alliance portfolio management studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112441246">Dyer, Kale, &amp; Singh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112441246">Hoffmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112441246">Kale, Dyer, &amp; Singh, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112441246">2002</xref>) point to the possibility of increasing the level of APM centralization by introducing a dedicated alliance function at the corporate level of the organization. Such a dedicated alliance function holds responsibility for the management of the whole alliance portfolio. In particular, it keeps an overview on the various divisions and configures, coordinates, evaluates, and promotes the alliance portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112441246">Dyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112441246">Kale et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112441246">2002</xref>). Alliance teams at the business level are expected to frequently report to this centralized function about their ongoing alliances. It is also noticed that firms increasingly institutionalize such a dedicated alliance function within a separate alliance portfolio department. This department can (a) develop expertise in APM based on the experience it has gained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112441246">Hoffmann, 2005</xref>), (b) support the alliance managers during all stages of the alliance life cycle by developing and implementing APM best practices and tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112441246">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2006</xref>), (c) collect, analyze, and disseminate information about new alliance opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>), and (d) support multidepartmental ad hoc task forces on specific alliance challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112441246">Goerzen, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>APM formalization</title>
<p>Organization design theorists define formalization as the degree to which codified rules and procedures are present (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112441246">Blau &amp; Schoenherr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112441246">Galbraith, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112441246">Hage &amp; Aiken, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112441246">Pugh et al., 1968</xref>). In a similar vein, APM formalization can be defined as the degree to which codified rules and procedures on managing alliance portfolios are present.</p>
<p>Recent APM studies point to several tools and practices that facilitate the management of alliance portfolios through its formalization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112441246">Bamford and Ernst (2002)</xref>, for instance, point to the relevance of balanced scorecards to evaluate and compare the financial, strategic, operational, and relational performance of the alliances that are part of the existing portfolio. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise and Casher (2003)</xref> emphasize the importance of impact diagrams to formalize the alliance portfolio evaluation process. Such diagrams map the facilitating and constraining interdependencies between different alliances in a firm’s alliance portfolio, allowing for identification of potential synergies and conflicts between alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>). Other tools that formalize APM are alliance databases and data warehouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112441246">de Man, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112441246">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112441246">Hoffmann, 2005</xref>). These tools allow for the codification of alliance specific experiences and the dissemination of such knowledge within the focal firm.</p>

<title>APM customization</title>
<p>Relying on the distinction between standardized and customized production systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112441246">Lampel &amp; Mintzberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112441246">Vickery, Dröge, &amp; Germain, 1999</xref>), we define APM customization as the degree to which APM takes into account the characteristics of particular alliances and particular alliance partners. Within highly customized APM systems, an explicit distinction is made between the management of alliances with different types of partners, implying that the content of particular alliance portfolio tools and practices is adjusted to the specific characteristics and demands of these different types of partners. For instance, within a customized APM system, the performance measures to evaluate collaboration with upstream partners, such as universities and research institutes, are different from the measures that are used to assess the collaboration with downstream partners, such as customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Some alliance scholars provided initial insights into how firms can increase the level of customization of their APM. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112441246">De Man (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112441246">Heimeriks, Duysters, and Vanhaverbeke (2007)</xref> suggest that firms can apply alliance-specific policies and programs that allow adapting their standard approach to the objectives of their particular partner. These scholars also suggested the use of cultural trainings in which alliance managers learn to communicate with partners having different organizational and/or national cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112441246">De Man, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112441246">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>The performance implications of alliance portfolio management</title>
<p>In addition to identifying APM tools and practices, scholars have started to examine their performance implications (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112441246">Table 2</xref>). Using performance indicators such as (a) percentage of alliances where the original goals were realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112441246">Heimeriks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112441246">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>), (b) ratio of a firm’s successful or satisfactory alliances to all its alliances in the portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112441246">Kale &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>), and (c) stock market reactions to alliance announcements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112441246">Kale et al., 2002</xref>), these studies mainly focus on how APM management influences the average performance of the individual alliances in the portfolio.</p>

<p>Whereas these studies provide valuable information on the impact of alliance portfolio management tools and practices on the success of individual alliances within the portfolio, they do not capture the ability of firms to realize value across individual alliances. In his recent review study of the alliance portfolio literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112441246">Wassmer (2010</xref>, p. 17), however, stresses the importance of considering the impact of alliance portfolio management on value creation across alliances because this latter issue “determines whether the overall value that firms derive from their alliance portfolios is greater or smaller than the sum of the values of each individual alliance in the portfolio.”</p>
<p>An additional limitation of existing alliance portfolio management research is that it tends to apply a universalistic perspective, assuming that particular APM tools and practices provide added value irrespective of the context in which they are embedded. The recent study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601112441246">Sarkar, Aulakh, and Madhok (2009)</xref>, however, provides some initial indications that it might be more relevant to apply a contingency perspective, where the added value of APM tools and practices depends on the structural characteristics of the alliance portfolio. In particular, they report a negative interaction effect between alliance portfolio heterogeneity and alliance portfolio coordination processes in influencing alliance portfolio success.</p>
<p>In the next section, we contribute to addressing these limitations of existing alliance portfolio management research by (a) highlighting the impact of different APM dimensions on specific value creation processes across alliances (i.e., realizing facilitating interdependencies, translating experience into capabilities) and (b) further exploring the interactions between APM dimensions and structural alliance portfolio characteristics in influencing innovation performance.</p>

<title>Connecting Alliance Portfolio Structure and Management</title>
<p>Exploring the interplay between alliance portfolio structure and alliance portfolio management, we theorize about the different ways in which APM affects the relationship between structural alliance portfolio characteristics and innovation performance. We propose that APM centralization and formalization mainly influence the relationship between size of the alliance portfolio and innovation performance, whereas APM customization is relevant for better understanding the innovation performance implications of alliance portfolio heterogeneity.</p>
<sec id="section12-1059601112441246">
<title>Moderating Impact of APM Centralization and Formalization</title>
<p>In line with prior research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112441246">Goerzen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>), we acknowledge that, as the size of the alliance portfolio increases, there is a higher potential for facilitating interdependencies as well as constraining interdependencies across alliances in the portfolio. At the same time, we argue that the actual ability of the focal firm to identify, monitor, and coordinate such interdependencies is substantially influenced by the level of APM centralization and APM formalization. As mentioned before, firms can increase the level of APM centralization by introducing a dedicated alliance department at the corporate level of the organization. In contrast to alliance managers that are situated at one particular business unit of the firm, people within such a centralized alliance department will have a clearer view on the overall alliance activities of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112441246">Goerzen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>). A centralized alliance department might also function as a central spot where all alliance-related knowledge can be brought together. In other words, it can function as a knowledge-hub that increases the ability to absorb knowledge from different alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112441246">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>). In this way, the presence of such an APM centralization mechanism is likely to increase the ability to identify and monitor potential synergies and conflicts among different alliances that are dispersed across different business units of the firm. In addition, such a centralized alliance department might play a significant role in initiating and managing efforts to really address the identified synergies and conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112441246">Hoffman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect that, apart from APM centralization, APM formalization might also influence a firm’s ability to manage facilitating and constraining interdependencies within alliance portfolios. First, when firms rely on formalized guidelines such as partner screening forms and technology domain maps during the partner selection process, the possibility of initiating alliances that have synergistic potential with existing alliances is improved, whereas the risk of starting up new alliances that might conflict with existing alliances is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112441246">Dyer et al., 2001</xref>). Second, firms can rely on data warehouses, alliance databases, or the intranet to formalize the monitoring of ongoing alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112441246">Anand &amp; Khanna, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112441246">de Man, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112441246">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112441246">Hoffmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112441246">Khanna, Gulati, &amp; Nohria, 1998</xref>). In this way, it becomes easier to identify the emergence of synergies and conflicts among different alliances. Other formalization tools provide guidance in addressing such identified synergies and conflicts. Portfolio impact diagrams, for instance, allow predicting how adding or removing a particular alliance affects other alliances in the portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112441246">Parise &amp; Casher, 2003</xref>). In addition, business unit planning allows coordinating business units in case of conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112441246">Goerzen, 2005</xref>), while shared business planning facilitates coordination of the strategies of the collaborative partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112441246">De Man, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, we argue that high levels of APM centralization and APM formalization improve the ability to realize facilitating interdependencies among different alliances and allow minimizing the emergence of constraining interdependencies among them. At the same time, we expect that, the larger the size of the alliance portfolio, the higher the added value of APM formalization and APM centralization. When alliance portfolio size is low, the potential for facilitating and constraining interdependencies among alliances is relatively low. Moreover, even if interdependencies would emerge in such a small portfolio, we expect that they can be managed in a more informal way, reducing the need for costly centralization or formalization mechanisms. When alliance portfolio size increases, however, the potential for facilitating and constraining interdependencies becomes larger. In such circumstances, the role of APM formalization and APM centralization in terms of realizing facilitating interdependencies and mitigating constraining interdependencies becomes more important.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112441246">Figure 1</xref>, we graphically show the impact of APM centralization and APM formalization on the inverted U-shaped relationship between alliance portfolio size and innovation performance. This figure illustrates that, as the size of the alliance portfolio increases, the difference in innovation performance between low and high levels of APM centralization/formalization becomes larger. This implies that, at higher levels of APM centralization and APM formalization, the inflection point of the inverted U-shaped relationship is situated at higher levels of innovation performance (i.e., upward shift of inflection point) and higher levels of alliance portfolio size (i.e., rightward shift of inflection point). We therefore formulate the following proposition:</p>

<title>Moderating Impact of APM Customization</title>
<p>Whereas the structural alliance portfolio perspective points to the positive relationship between alliance portfolio heterogeneity and innovation performance, we rely on insights from intrafirm innovation portfolio research to argue that this relationship will be moderated by the level of APM customization. Intrafirm innovation portfolio scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112441246">Gibson &amp; Birkinshaw, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112441246">Jansen, Van den Bosch, &amp; Volberda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112441246">O’Reilly &amp; Tushman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112441246">Raisch &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008</xref>) emphasize that highly diversified innovation portfolios (i.e,. innovation portfolios that consist of both exploitative and explorative innovation projects) require extensive differentiation within the firm regarding organizational structures, practices, and tools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112441246">O’Reilly and Tushman (2004)</xref>, for instance, argue that, when a firm wants to simultaneously conduct exploitative and explorative innovation projects, it needs to structurally separate these projects and manage them in different ways. In particular, they propose the adoption of a bureaucratic approach for exploitative projects and a more organic approach for explorative projects. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112441246">De Visser et al. (2010)</xref> provide evidence that exploitative innovation projects benefit from a functional team structure, whereas explorative projects require a cross-functional team structure to be successful.</p>
<p>Adopting the above insights in the setting of alliance portfolios, we argue that, when the focal firm simultaneously collaborates with different types of partners, it should adjust its alliance portfolio management procedures and tools to the specific characteristics and needs of them. In the alliance literature, some preliminary support for this reasoning can be found. It is argued, for instance, that exploration-oriented alliances with upstream partners benefit from applying output control systems, whereas exploitation-oriented alliances with downstream partners benefit from applying process control systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112441246">Faems et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112441246">Koza &amp; Lewin, 1998</xref>). Other scholars suggest that strong alliance ties ask for a managerial approach that maximizes the opportunity for joint value maximization, whereas weak alliance ties benefit from a single cost minimization approach (Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2002). Finally, it is emphasized that, when the focal firm simultaneously collaborates with national and international partners, it should adjust its negotiation, evaluation, and monitoring processes to the cultural background of the alliance partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112441246">De Man, 2005</xref>). At the same time, we expect that, if a heterogeneous alliance portfolio is managed in a standardized way, meaning that similar tools and procedures are applied for different types of alliances partners, part of the alliances are likely to be mismanaged, reducing the positive impact of alliance portfolio heterogeneity on innovation performance. We therefore propose</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we conceptually explored the connections between alliance portfolio structure, alliance portfolio management, and innovation performance. In particular, we developed propositions on how different APM dimensions might influence the relationship between structural alliance portfolio characteristics (i.e., alliance portfolio size and alliance portfolio heterogeneity) and innovation performance. First, we argued that firms’ ability to effectively deal with facilitating and constraining interdependencies, which are likely to become more prominent when the size of the alliance portfolio increases, heavily depends on the level of APM centralization and APM formalization. We also proposed that APM customization substantially influences the extent to which firms can reap innovation benefits from simultaneously collaborating with different kinds of alliance partners.</p>
<p>In this final section, we rely on these findings to identify specific alliance portfolio management bundles for different alliance portfolio structures. Subsequently, we discuss the implications of our conceptual findings for future research on alliance portfolios in general and the connections between structural and managerial aspects of alliance portfolios in particular. Finally, we point to the relevance of linking alliance portfolio research to research on alliance networks and acquisition portfolios.</p>

<title>Alliance Portfolio Management Bundles and Alliance Portfolio Structures</title>
<p>Combining the insights from the propositions that we developed in the previous section, we are able to identify four alliance portfolio management bundles, representing different combinations of centralization, formalization, and customization, that are likely to maximize innovation performance for different combinations of alliance portfolio size and heterogeneity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112441246">Figure 2</xref> provides an overview of the different bundles.</p>

<p>Bundle I represents an alliance portfolio management system that is characterized by high centralization, formalization, and customization. Such an alliance portfolio management system seems to be relevant when both alliance portfolio size and alliance portfolio heterogeneity are high. In such circumstances, centralization and formalization mechanisms are important to maximize value realization across different alliances as well as translating experience from all these alliances into capabilities. At the same time, high levels of alliance portfolio customization make sure that the focal firm pays sufficient attention to the fact that the portfolio consists of different types of partners, which require specific management approaches. At first sight, a combination of high formalization and high customization might seem to be contradictory. However, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, a focal firm can decide to increase alliance portfolio formalization by implementing a balanced scorecard system that allows evaluating the progress and performance of each individual alliance. At the same time, this firm might guarantee sufficient customization by formulating different evaluation criteria for different types of alliance partners within this formal system.</p>
<p>Alliance portfolio management Bundle II, in contrast, represents a system of low centralization, formalization, and customization. This bundle seems to be relevant for firms with low alliance portfolio size and low alliance portfolio heterogeneity. When alliance portfolio size is limited, the costs of implementing centralization and formalization mechanisms are likely to outweigh the innovation benefits of them. Because of limited alliance portfolio heterogeneity, it also makes sense to apply a quite standardized approach for the selection, management, and evaluation of the alliances that are present in the small portfolio.</p>
<p>Alliance portfolio management Bundle III represents a more hybrid approach where high levels of centralization and formalization are combined with low levels of customization. Such alliance portfolio management system is feasible for firms that extensively engage in alliances with one particular type of partner. Some high-tech start-up companies, for instance, increasingly apply a business model where they internally focus on exploring new technologies and, at the same time, engage in multiple alliances with one specific type of alliance partner (i.e., customers) to exploit promising technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112441246">Colombo, Grilli, &amp; Piva, 2006</xref>). For such firms, it makes sense to heavily invest in centralization and formalization mechanisms to maximize the ability for synergistic value realization across different customers and, at the same time, adopt a standardized approach toward managing such alliances.</p>
<p>Finally, alliance portfolio management Bundle IV is characterized by low levels of centralization and formalization and high levels of customization. Firms that have a limited number of alliances with a wide variety of different partners (i.e., low alliance portfolio size and high alliance portfolio heterogeneity) might benefit from such alliance portfolio management bundle. As the alliance portfolio size is limited, we expect that the focal firm can rely on informal approaches to (a) address potential synergies and conflicts across the present alliances and (b) capture, share, and disseminate alliance know-how within the firm. The added value of centralization and formalization mechanisms is therefore likely to be limited. However, as alliance portfolio heterogeneity is high, it remains important that such informal alliance portfolio management approach is different for different types of alliance partners. For instance, in case of limited alliance portfolio size, a firm might decide not to adopt a formal evaluation process for its alliances. However, when alliance portfolio heterogeneity is high, it remains important to realize that informally evaluating an explorative alliance with a university requires a different mindset and approach than evaluating an exploitative alliance with a supplier.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research on Alliance Portfolios</title>
<p>Whereas prior studies on the innovation performance implications of structural alliance portfolio characteristics have ignored how firms internally manage such collection of alliances, our conceptual findings strongly suggest that alliance portfolio management dimensions moderate the relationship between structural alliance portfolio characteristics and innovation performance. We therefore stress that future empirical research on the innovation performance implications of alliance portfolios should not only assess the structural alliance portfolio characteristics but also examine how such portfolio is actually managed. We realize that empirically testing the connections between structural and managerial alliance portfolio characteristics in influencing innovation performance triggers methodological challenges. Structural alliance portfolio studies increasingly rely on merging secondary databases—for instance, linking alliance data from the SDC platinum database to patent data from the USPTO database—to get fine-grained insights into the innovation performance implications of alliance portfolio size and heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112441246">Schilling, 2009</xref>). Data on alliance portfolio management, in contrast, are mainly collected by means of surveys among alliance professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112441246">Heimeriks, 2010</xref>). Empirically exploring the connections between structural and managerial alliance portfolio characteristics therefore will require connecting different kinds of data that are collected in different ways.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge the need for more longitudinal research designs that provide insights into how structural and managerial aspects of firms’ alliance portfolios coevolve over time. Existing alliance portfolio studies have been dominated by cross-sectional studies, measuring structural or managerial characteristics at one particular moment in time. Relying on two longitudinal case studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112441246">Hoffman (2007)</xref> already showed that the structural configuration of alliance portfolios is likely to change over time because of changes in strategic uncertainty and resource endowments. However, he remained rather silent on how such structural changes affected alliance portfolio management. Therefore, it might be very valuable to assess to what extent increases or decreases in alliance portfolio size trigger firms to adjust their alliance portfolio management in terms of formalization and centralization. At the same time, we wonder whether investments in implementing specific alliance portfolio management mechanisms provide incentives to expand the size and/or heterogeneity of the alliance portfolio.</p>
<p>Existing alliance portfolio management research has mainly adopted a universalistic perspective, identifying a wide variety of best practices that firms can implement to improve their management of alliance portfolios. In contrast, we pointed to the relevance of a contingency perspective, emphasizing that the added value of alliance portfolio management mechanisms might differ across different alliance portfolio structures. By doing so, we concluded that, in particular circumstances (i.e., limited alliance portfolio size), the cost implications of implementing alliance portfolio centralization and formalization mechanisms might be higher than their value generating implications. Based on these conclusions, we emphasize the need for future empirical research, disentangling the value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of specific combinations of alliance portfolio management bundles and alliance portfolio structures. Such future research should not only consider focal firms’ innovation performance but should also look at financial performance to fully capture the value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of implementing specific alliance portfolio management mechanisms in the context of particular alliance portfolio structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112441246">Faems, de Visser, Andries, &amp; Van Looy, 2010</xref>). Such future research should also explicitly consider different time frames to measure the cost and value implications of alliance portfolio management. After all, we expect that the cost implications of implementing alliance portfolio management mechanisms are likely to manifest themselves in the short term, whereas it might take several years before the added value of such mechanisms becomes clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112441246">Kale &amp; Singh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies on alliance portfolio management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112441246">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112441246">Kale et al., 2002</xref>) have focused on value creation within alliances, examining the impact of alliance portfolio management mechanisms on the individual success of alliances. In contrast, we focused on the impact of alliance portfolio management on value creation across alliances, showing that APM centralization and APM formalization might increase focal firms’ ability to maximize facilitating interdependencies and minimize constraining interdependencies. At the same time, we point to the relevance of future research that considers both value creation within alliances and value creation across alliances. In our study, for instance, we argued that the presence of a centralized alliance department stimulates value creation across alliances by increasing firms’ ability to identify, monitor, and coordinate facilitating and constraining interdependencies across alliances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112441246">Heimeriks et al. (2007)</xref>, however, provided initial indications that a centralized alliance department might hamper value creation within alliances. In particular, they argued that such mechanisms might trigger institutional rigidity, restricting the flexibility of business managers to flexibly respond to unanticipated problems within a specific alliance. In sum, alliance portfolio management mechanisms might trigger tensions between maximizing value creation across alliances and maximizing value creation within alliances. Further exploring such tensions seems to be an important avenue for future research.</p>

<title>Crossing the Boundaries of Alliance Portfolio Research</title>
<p>In this conceptual article, we focused on alliance portfolios, which is the collection of direct ties in which a firm simultaneously engages. However, our findings might also inspire future alliance network research, which typically focuses on the outcome implications of a firm’s structural position in a network of direct ánd indirect cooperative relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112441246">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). Alliance network scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112441246">Ahuja, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112441246">Gilsing et al., 2008</xref>), for instance, have provided evidence that structural characteristics such as the centrality of a firm in its network influence the firm’s innovation performance. At the same time, they have remained largely silent on how firms actually manage such networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112441246">Ozcan &amp; Eisenhardt, 2009</xref>). However, we expect that the innovation performance implications of alliance networks also depend on how the focal firm actively manages its network position as well as the information flows that emerge from it. We therefore encourage future research to apply the concepts and insights of alliance portfolio management literature into the setting of alliance networks. Moreover, we hope to stimulate scholars to examine the interaction between alliance network management and structural alliance network characteristics (e.g., network centrality, network density) in influencing innovation performance.</p>
<p>Firms can not only engage in alliances to stimulate innovation but they can also acquire an external partner for innovation purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112441246">Hagedoorn &amp; Duysters, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112441246">Villalonga &amp; McGahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112441246">Wang &amp; Zajac, 2007</xref>). Whereas research on alliance portfolios is growing exponentially, the concept of acquisition portfolios has received much less attention. Nevertheless, first indications are present that applying a portfolio perspective on acquisitions might be highly relevant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112441246">Barkema and Schijven (2008</xref>, p. 697), for instance, argue that “an acquisition is usually not an isolated event, but merely one part of an overarching sequence of acquisitions collectively aimed at implementing a corporate strategy.” Moreover, they provide first evidence that, to fully unlock the synergistic potential of acquisitions, it is necessary to engage in organizational restructuring that allows realizing interdependencies across different acquisitions. We also expect that research into the relationship between alliance portfolios and acquisition portfolios might be very interesting. For instance, we wonder whether alliance portfolio size and acquisitions portfolio size are likely to substitute or complement each other in influencing the innovation performance of the focal firm.</p>
