<abstract>
<p>The paper deals with results of experimental study of thermal fatigue of polymeric composites caused by self-heating effect under repeating loading conditions. The tests were carried out on laboratory stand, which provides synchronization of all measured parameters. It was noticed that the process of thermal fatigue consists of three phases and the end of the second phase coincides with critical self-heating temperature, which causes rapid degradation until breakdown. During experiments, composite specimens were loaded for achieving a given temperature value, then cooled and loaded again. Based on experimental results, it was shown that the reloading caused cross-linking process, which causes hardening of a composite. The parametric analysis of self-heating curves was carried out for single-, double- and triple-loaded specimens, and fatigue life for investigated cases was determined and compared.</p>

<p>Wide application of polymeric composites in the most responsible engineering components is resulted by their unique properties: lightweight, corrosion resistance, high strength, etc. However, composites reveal specific behaviour and phenomena during their operation, which are not present in conventional materials. The fatigue mechanisms of polymeric composites apart from mechanical degradation consisted of rheological transitions, temperature and environmental effects, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate behaviour of polymeric composites in various operation conditions.</p>
<p>One of the most dangerous effects occurred during operation of polymeric composites is the self-heating. This phenomenon occurred during intensive cyclic loading of the structure and caused by energy dissipation in the form of heat. Due to the small heat conductivity of the most polymers the heat is stored into the structure and its temperature grows up, which may significantly intensify degradation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The problems of thermal fatigue and degradation intensification were not investigated sufficiently. Preliminary experimental research of thermal fatigue and failure of polymers and polymeric composites are presented by Oldyrev.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412452679">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412452679">3</xref></sup> These researches conducted that polymers’ degradation depends on excitation frequency and temperature and proposed an empirical fatigue model based on thermofluctuation theory. The novel researches in this area reported the importance of consideration of the self-heating effect in problems of fatigue and structural degradation of polymeric composites. Luo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412452679">4</xref></sup> presented theoretical and experimental studies concerned with thermal fluctuations during the tensile testing of ABS specimens. Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412452679">5</xref></sup> analyzed an occurrence of the self-heating effect in specimens loaded harmonically and influence of this phenomenon on the mechanical properties of the material. Original results for the thermal fatigue of polyamide 66 are presented in Ref 6, where the authors investigated the self-heating temperature evolution during cyclic bending of cantilever beams. They discussed the reasons of self-heating effect occurrence and emphasized two types of fatigue depending on loading parameters of polymeric specimens: mechanical fatigue, when the temperature increase insignificantly and stabilized at some value and a thermal fatigue, when the temperature increase dominates the process of degradation. Some theoretical studies on the influence of self-heating effect on fatigue mechanisms of linearly viscoelastic polymers were carried out by Ramkumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412452679">7</xref></sup> The authors developed a thermodynamic constitutive model for the self-heating effect and compare results obtained using the model with experimental observations. The fatigue behaviour of thermoplastic-reinforced composites was investigated and discussed in Goel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412452679">8</xref></sup> Toubal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412452679">9</xref></sup> presented theoretical and experimental research for carbon/epoxy laminates subjected to fatigue loading with accompanying self-heating. The authors presented a damage model, which based on damage function evaluated from residual Young modulus. Karama<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412452679">10</xref></sup> used the self-heating effect for the damage characterization in carbon/epoxy composites. Damage evolution during thermal fatigue was studied by Kurashiki et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412452679">11</xref></sup> They carried out two-step fatigue tests: in the first step, the cyclic loading was applied until the occurrence of the fatigue damage; in the second step, the test was carried out after unloaded and naturally cooled specimens. Interesting study of fatigue damage evolution of glass/epoxy composites with use of acoustic emission and thermography is presented in Naderi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412452679">12</xref></sup> Some constitutive relations based on phenomenological model of thermoviscoelasticity were presented in Meneghetti et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412452679">13</xref></sup> the model was conducted experimentally. Research in the area of self-heating of polymeric composites was also presented for both theoretical and experimental studies in Katunin and Fidali.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup> Analytical models for plates made of polymeric composites were developed in Katunin and Fidali<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup> and Katunin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412452679">14</xref></sup> and covers the description self-heating effect and temperature evolution in cyclically loaded plates and, as a particular case, the plates loaded on their resonant frequencies. Additional dynamic tests of the composite specimens shown that besides frequency and temperature dependence of material properties of a composite significant influence on these properties was exerted by heating rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412452679">15</xref></sup> Basing on experimental results, the modification of Arrhenius law for phase transition of a polymer caused by increased temperature was proposed. Findings of above-cited works will be used for explanation of observed phenomena in the present study.</p>
<p>The research presented in this study is concentrated on experimental investigation of characteristic of temperature evolution during fatigue of polymeric composites with presence of the self-heating effect. Experimental results were presented for a single loading and multiple repeated loadings of composite specimens in order to compare them and identify the character of temperature evolution and irreversible changes occurred during thermal fatigue. The repeated loading tests provide additional information about processes occurred during thermal fatigue and, from practical point of view, describe more realistic operation conditions of elements made of polymeric composites. Presented results of experimental study presented in this paper show that composite elements subjected to the self-heating effect during fatigue should not reach critical values of temperature for initiation of irreversible structural degradation, which was the main statement of this work. Phenomena occurred in the composite’s structure during such a loading procedure were investigated and analyzed. The characteristic phases of temperature evolution were analyzed for both cases and parametric dependencies for the self-heating temperature were determined based on previously developed empirical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup> Finally, an analysis of fatigue life of polymeric composites subjected to thermal fatigue was carried out. Obtained results could be useful in theoretical description as well as in industrial applications for lifetime prediction of operated composite elements.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0731684412452679"><title>Specimens preparation</title>
<p>The specimens were manufactured from the glass fibre-reinforced polymer supplied by Izo-Erg SA in the form of sheets of size 1000 × 1000 mm. The epoxy matrix of a composite was obtained from the mixture of two commercial compounds: bisphenol-A and tetrabrombisphenol-A. E-glass fibre reinforcement with weight of 200 g/m<sup>2</sup> was impregnated in the form of plane weave. The manufactured composite consists of 70% of epoxy resin and 30% of E-glass fibre reinforcement of total mass. Then, sheets were cut in order to achieve specimens with specific dimensions. Preliminary strength tests conducted conformity of material properties with minimal values required by appropriate standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup> The specimens prepared for the tests were cut to the following dimensions: thickness of 2.5 mm, width of 10 mm and effective length (the length of the specimens without their parts mounted in claps) of 50 mm. The specimens were subjected to cyclic loading with an excitation frequency of 30 Hz and initial loading stress of 54 MPa. In the first study, 20 specimens were tested in single-loading mode in order to obtain statistically correct results. In the second study, the specimens were tested with the same excitation frequency but loaded multiple times. The tests were carried out as follows: the loading was applied until the specimen achieved some specific temperature, then the specimen was unloaded, and after the stabilization of temperature of the specimen (when the temperature of a specimen was equal to the ambient temperature), it was loaded again until the breakdown. In this study, the temperature to achieve in the first load was elevated from 30°C to 80°C with step of 5°C. In the third study, the specimens were tested in the same way with the same parameters but were loaded twice until they reach specific temperature, and the third time, the loading was applied until breakdown. Three specific temperatures were chosen in this study 50°C, 60°C and 70°C. In the second and third studies, five specimens were tested for unique experimental parameters, which give total 90 specimens used in all three studies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412452679"><title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>The tests were carried out on own designed laboratory stand. The scheme and photograph of the stand is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412452679">Figure 1</xref>. The experimental stand consists of following measurement and operational devices. TIRA TV51120 S 514 electrodynamic shaker <italic>1</italic> was connected with a specimen holder <italic>6</italic> through the stinger <italic>3</italic> with a PCB Piezotronics 208C03 force sensor <italic>7</italic> at its end. The acceleration of excitation was measured and controlled by the PCB Piezotronics T352C34 accelerometer <italic>2</italic>. The specimen was mounted in additional specimen holder <italic>4</italic> made of bakelite for ensuring thermal insulation of heat generated during excitation.

<p>The measurement of velocity of vibration near the specimen holder <italic>4</italic> was carried out by Polytec PDV 100 laser Doppler vibrometer <italic>9</italic>. The accelerometer <italic>2</italic>, force sensor <italic>7</italic> and vibrometer <italic>9</italic> were connected through conditioning modules to National Instruments BNC 2090 multi-channel data acquisition module <italic>11</italic>, connected to PC <italic>12</italic> and controlled by LabView® application, the acquisition of measurement signals was carried out with a sample rate of 8 kHz. The excitation signal parameters were set by application and through the analogue output of the multi-channel signal acquisition module <italic>11</italic> drives a TIRA BAA 500 shaker amplifier <italic>10</italic>. The measurements of a temperature were carried out by InfraTec VarioCAM hr infrared camera <italic>8</italic>. For ensuring better emissivity and reduce reflectivity on the surface of specimens, they were painted black. All of the measurement devices were connected through the breakout box, which allow time-synchronization of excitation and acquisition of measurement signals.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412452679"><title>Evaluation of experimental results</title>
<p>During the experiment, sequences of infrared images were stored for particular investigated cases. Their analysis makes possible the evaluation of temperature evolution during thermal fatigue. For evaluation, the temperature values in the line of clamping (the temperature has a maximal values here because of stress concentration in this area during loading) were collected regard to the time of observation. Basing on the analysis of temperature curves, it was conducted that the thermal fatigue process could be divided into three phases. In the first phase, an exponential rapid temperature increase was observed, which was caused by a drop of storage modulus and increase of loss modulus of the composite (storage modulus presents elastic behaviour of a composite, while loss modulus presents viscous behaviour, see Katunin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup> for details). In the second phase the temperature stabilizes according to the equilibrium state between dissipated energy and energy convected to the environment. In this phase a slight linear temperature increase was observed, which was caused by propagated mechanical degradation of a composite. The second phase ended, when the structure reach some critical value of self-heating temperature, which is connected with glass-transition temperature for given loading parameters. The glass-transition temperature depends on excitation frequency and heating rate (see Katunin and Gnatowski<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412452679">15</xref></sup> for details). The third phase of thermal fatigue was characterized by rapid temperature increase until the breakdown of a specimen. This increase was resulted by damage initiation and propagation in the structure.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412452679"><title>Single-loaded specimens</title>
<p>For single-continuously-loaded specimens, the sequences of infrared images were collected, and according to above-presented procedure, the self-heating temperature evolution curves were determined. An exemplary infrared image is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412452679">Figure 2</xref>. Following to previous studies presented in Katunin and Fidali,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452679">1</xref></sup> the developed empirical fitting model for temperature evolution curves

<p>The model parameters were as follows: <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> = 57.71°C, <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> = −40.85°C, <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.001166 s<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>F</italic><sub>2</sub> = −0.02574 s<sup>−1</sup>. These parameters reveal connection with physical interpretation of a phenomenon. The sum of <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> determines initial temperature of the fatigue process, while parameters <italic>F<sub>i</sub></italic> determine the heating rate in particular phases of fatigue. Additionally, parameters in the first term of (1) are responsible for temperature magnitude and heating rate in the second phase of fatigue, while parameters in the second term of (1) describe the temperature magnitude and heating rate in the first phase of fatigue.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412452679"><title>Double-loaded specimens</title>
<p>The infrared images were collected separately for first and second loadings. Then, the self-heating evolution curves were determined for every particular temperature of first loading <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub>. Using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0731684412452679">equation (1)</xref>, the self-heating evolution curves were approximated in order to compare the parameters of the model for the first and second loading and with single-loaded specimens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452679">Figure 4</xref> illustrates four chosen cases of temperature evolution curves for double-loaded specimens with their approximations.

<p>Four cases presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452679">Figure 4</xref> are representative in the light of different phenomena observed during double-loading of specimens. As it could be observed, there is a critical value of a self-heating temperature, which is near 60°C. After exceeding this temperature, the mechanical degradation dominates the thermal fatigue process, which is accompanied with initiation of matrix cracks. Considering results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412452679">Table 1</xref>, it could be concluded that, if <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> was lower than critical self-heating temperature, the temperature grows slower during the second loading, i.e. the temperature <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> was reached in longer time than during the first loading. This phenomenon could be explained by occurrence of a cross-linking process initiated by the increasing temperature. Considering research results presented in Legrand and Bellenger,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412452679">16</xref></sup> the cross-linking ratio increases with an increase of temperature, thus the temperature increase caused an irreversible structural changes in the form of additional cross-linking reactions during the first loading. Basing on this statement, it could be concluded that the adhesive connections became stronger following the hardening caused by reaction of amine groups with epoxy groups, which is also conducted by Kiran Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412452679">17</xref></sup> Therefore, due to the local hardening caused by cross-linking during the first loading, the structure reaches the temperature <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> during the second loading in longer time. However, increasing of cross-linking ratio reduces the elasticity of a polymer since the fully cross-linked polymer became brittle and more sensitive to the high humidity.</p></sec>

<p>In order to conduct above-presented hypothesis, additional tests with three loadings were carried out. The first two loadings were stopped when the specified temperature was reached; the third loading was stopped after breakdown of a specimen. Self-heating temperature evolution curves for three investigated cases are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5</xref>.
<fig id="fig5-0731684412452679" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Self-heating temperature evolution curves for <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> of (a) 50°C, (b) 60°C, (c) 70°C during triple-loading of specimens.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452679-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The choice of temperature values of <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> was made in order to present different behaviour of a composite before and after exceeding critical temperature. In the first case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5(a)</xref>), only the cross-linking process occurs; the self-heating temperature evolution curves reveal greater slope to the time axis with each next loading.</p>
<p>In the case, when <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 60°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5(b)</xref>), the first two loadings reveal the same behaviour, but the third loading cause quicker temperature increase due to mechanical degradation of a structure. The last case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5(c)</xref>) presents an influence of mechanical degradation on the heating-up, which was occurred due to exceeding of critical temperature. Comparing two first loadings, it could be noticed that the cross-linking process occurs; but due to mechanical degradation, the temperature <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> was reached quicker in the second loading. According to the assumption of damage initiation at the critical temperature, the microcracks occurred in the structure. Considering cross-linking hardening, the critical temperature became higher in comparison with critical temperature of specimens, which were not loaded. The effects of the microcracks could be evaluated basing on third load results: for the first case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5(a)</xref>), the macrodamaging occurred in temperature 81.91°C; for the second case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5(b)</xref>) – in temperature 68.87°C, for the third case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452679">Figure 5(c)</xref>) – in temperature 60.07°C.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0731684412452679"><title>Analysis of fatigue life</title>
<p>The cross-linking process cause hardening of a composite during heating-up below critical temperature and thus extended the fatigue life of the structure. It could be clearly noticed by analyzing the temperature curves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452679">Figure 4(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452679">b</xref>) that: in the first case, the cross-linking ratio was smaller than in second one according to the smaller value of <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> for the case presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452679">Figure 4(a)</xref>. The fatigue life increases about 1.5 times in the case, when <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 50°C. However, after exceeding a critical temperature, the fatigue life of a composite drastically dropped following to the initiation of cracks. The dependence of fatigue life in function of a temperature <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412452679">Figure 6</xref>) proved presented statement.
<fig id="fig6-0731684412452679" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Fatigue life of a composite depending on the temperature of fist loading.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452679-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the case of double-loaded specimens, it could be noticed the influence of cross-linking for the values of <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> ≤ 50°C. When <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; 60°C, the mechanical degradation occurs and the number of cycles to breakdown decrease rapidly. The same drop of number of cycles to breakdown was observed for triple-loaded specimens. The first loads for both loading procedures reveal near-exponential character of number temperature in function of number of cycles (the non-linearity for load 1 in double-loaded procedure occurred for higher temperatures), which is in agreement with statement of three-phase self-heating temperature evolution with accompanying phenomena. The phenomenon of an increase of number of cycles for double-loaded load 2 curve for <italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; 65°C could be caused by plasticity in the region of self-heating in high temperatures.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0731684412452679" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study concerned with experimental investigation of influence of multiple loadings on the temperature evolution and fatigue life during high-amplitude cyclic loading and self-heating effect presence. It was noticed that the self-heating effect always causes structural changes in the polymeric composite regardless of temperature that it was reached. Moreover, there is a critical temperature with initiates cracking of a matrix of composite and intensifies degradation process. If the critical temperature was not exceeded, the hardening of a structure could be observed due to the cross-linking process. Degree of cross-linking grows with an increase of temperature in this temperature range and the number of cycles to breakdown of the structure grows too. However, if the critical temperature exceeded the crack propagation and mechanical degradation is intensified by the self-heating temperature. Presented results could find an application in modelling of polymeric composite behaviour as well as in diagnostics and structural health monitoring of element made of such composites.</p></sec>
