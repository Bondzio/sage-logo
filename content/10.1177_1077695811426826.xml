<abstract>
<p>A revolution in delivery methods for news and information has created an urgent need for journalism educators to define critical skills for success in the profession. A content analysis was conducted over three-month periods in 2008 and 2009 for all employment opportunities posted by the top ten American newspaper and broadcast journalism companies. More than fourteen hundred postings were coded to determine the most desirable skills and attributes for job candidates. Researchers identified important changes from year to year, including an increased emphasis on Web/multimedia skills for broadcast newsrooms and the emergence of social media and mobile content delivery as desired skills.</p>

<body>
<p>Technological and economic changes within the journalism profession have had a dramatic impact on the hiring practices of American news media organizations. Some research has indicated that higher-salaried veteran journalists are being driven out and replaced with “young, versatile, tech-savvy, high-energy staff.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695811426826">1</xref></sup> The changes in the profession are far-reaching. Six out of ten news executives believe the Internet is changing the fundamental values of journalism, as new emphasis is placed on immediacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695811426826">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a ripple effect, journalism educators are trying to revamp their programs to better meet the needs of the industry. A survey of journalism and mass communication administrators found that many colleges and universities have been working to stay on top of digital developments and incorporating more multimedia into their programs, as well as adding more media-skills experts to the faculty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695811426826">3</xref></sup> Researchers have also found that real-world experience with the technology in today’s newsrooms has a direct impact on the ability of college students to get industry jobs after graduation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695811426826">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a content analysis was conducted over a period of three months in 2008 and in 2009 for all the employment opportunities posted by the top ten newspaper and broadcast journalism companies in the United States. The analysis focused on the types of skills and attributes these positions listed as requirements.</p>
<p>This mixed-method research project also relied on interviews with recruiters for several of the surveyed media outlets to more fully understand the language of the job postings and to answer the question, What are the most important skills for employment and success in the journalism profession today?</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695811426826">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>For more than a decade, researchers have studied the shift to producing news content for multiple media platforms and the corresponding changes in journalism school curricula. Hansen studied how the social, economic, and technological trends that influenced the practice of communication and the traditions of the academy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695811426826">5</xref></sup> “Both are under severe economic pressure. And both the media industry and educational institutions at all levels are struggling to understand and keep up with the technological changes that are challenging every assumption they have had for decades.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695811426826">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Castaneda et al. found technological advances and the new media landscape were the two major catalysts for change at journalism schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695811426826">7</xref></sup> Between 1998 and 2002, 60 percent of journalism schools in the United States were redesigning their curricula or developing new courses to prepare students for producing news in multiple media platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695811426826">8</xref></sup> Criado and Kraeplin surveyed 240 journalism programs and found that nearly 85 percent had adopted a convergence curriculum in response to the industry emphasis on convergence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695811426826">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Royal highlighted the challenge for educators to implement new media skills “in a curriculum that is already full, with this precarious balance of skills and theory stretching existing resources.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695811426826">10</xref></sup> However, changes in curricula were a necessary response to the rapid technological changes in the day-to-day practice of journalism.</p>
<p>In 2005, Criado and Kraeplin surveyed newspaper and TV executives and reported that a majority believe convergence skills are important for new hires.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695811426826">11</xref></sup> The researchers concluded that the goal of a convergence curriculum should be to prepare students conceptually and practically to create an integrated media product that combines elements of both print and broadcast within a digital environment. “Increasingly, the demands of a converged media system ensure that young journalists’ careers will be less stable and predictable than in the past.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695811426826">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dickson and Brandon studied journalism school curricula and newsroom employee desirability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695811426826">13</xref></sup> They found that one of the most valued practices was the cross-training of students in more than one media field, revealing that traditional requirements for specific jobs are becoming further blurred by new technologies and practices. In addition, they reported that a gap exists between professional journalists and journalism educators concerning aspects of journalism education.</p>
<p>Gaps between what journalism education provides and what employers demand make the case for more research to determine what skills are necessary to get jobs in today’s newsrooms. Massey examined job advertisements for newspaper and broadcast reporters and found a modest demand for multiplatform skills by legacy news organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695811426826">14</xref></sup> Newspapers particularly sought reporters who could also shoot news video. “Technological changes, shifts in news consumption habits and audience demographics, fickle economic conditions, and more have put newspapers and TV stations under pressure to do more with fewer reporters.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695811426826">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study goes beyond just reporter positions and examines what skills and attributes news companies are seeking for all newsroom positions in the age of new media.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Employment advertisements are a genre of organizational communication that can provide insight into the characteristics of a company and its employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695811426826">16</xref></sup> Job postings can be considered representations of occupations; their language providing rich detail for researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695811426826">17</xref></sup> Employment advertisements in the journalism field “can serve such an indicator role when it comes to the effect of multiplatform news work on jobs for journalists.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695811426826">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>A quantitative content analysis was performed on job postings from seventeen media companies: Gannett, Tribune, New York Times, McClatchy, Advance, Hearst, MediaNews, Cox, Dow Jones, Lee Enterprises, Belo, NBC, Disney, Sinclair, CBS, News Corp., and Univision. The companies were listed as the top U.S. newspaper companies and the top U.S. broadcast companies according to a 2009 <italic>Advertising Age</italic> survey.</p>
<p>The authors collected job postings from the companies’ websites for a three-month period: September 15 to December 15, 2009. Only jobs postings for newsroom positions were taken for analysis. Jobs in such departments as sales, promotions, advertising, and engineering were not collected. On the first visit to the websites, all existing job postings listed as “current” on the sites that met the criteria were collected, not just the postings dated September 15, 2009. On the daily subsequent visits, only new postings were collected. In total, 735 job postings were collected.</p>
<p>The job postings were coded for job title, beat, and attributes and skills required. The coding sheet was based on a previous study done by the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695811426826">19</xref></sup> That coding sheet was developed after analyzing hundreds of job postings and noting the most common skills and attributes requested.</p>
<p>Twenty-two skills and attributes were coded for: accuracy, aggressiveness, news judgment, creativity, storytelling, enterprising, willingness to work under pressure/tight deadlines, team player, willingness to work long hours, strong writing, proofreading, ability to develop sources, previous professional experience, communication skills, leadership, multitasking, production/field production, Associated Press style knowledge, software knowledge, shooting/photography, nonlinear editing and other Web/multimedia. The other Web/multimedia category included Web and multimedia skills other than shooting/photography and nonlinear editing. Shooting/photography and nonlinear editing were coded individually because of the large number of jobs requesting those specific skills. The authors also coded specific Web/multimedia skills, such as writing for the Web and posting to the Web, as well as specific Web/multimedia programs such as Quark, InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>The data were coded by the study’s authors. Seventy-four randomly selected job postings, or approximately 10 percent of the sample, were coded by all authors. The results fell into the acceptable level of intercoder reliability (Cohen’s Kappa = ~.80).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695811426826">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>After data were analyzed, five in-depth interviews were conducted with recruiters from Hearst, Cox, Gannett, Dow Jones, and Tribune. Of seventeen media companies included in the content analysis, recruiters from five companies responded to an e-mail request for an interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077695811426826" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The study yielded 735 job postings, about a 3 percent increase from the previous year. Of the 735 jobs posted, 31.2 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 229) were newspaper jobs, and 68.8 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 506) were broadcast jobs.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077695811426826">
<title>Newspaper jobs</title>
<p>Of 229 newspaper job postings, the positions sought to be filled were reporter (34.9 percent), editor (19.2 percent), entry level/internship (17.5 percent), copy editor (14 percent), Web writer/multimedia producer (5.7 percent), writer (5.2 percent), photographer (2.2 percent), and management (1.3 percent). Only slightly more than a quarter (28.8 percent) of postings mentioned a specific beat for which the prospective employee would be responsible.</p>
<p>Again, RQ1 asks what skills and attributes news companies are seeking in new employees, as posted in their job listings. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695811426826">Table 1</xref>, previous professional experience and strong writing skills were the top two requirements for print and broadcast positions. Other attributes varied by media type, with newspaper positions requiring more personality-based characteristics such as ability to work under pressure/tight deadlines and being a team player.</p>

<p>RQ3 asks for what journalism positions employers require Web/multimedia skills. Web and multimedia skills, such as writing for the newspaper’s website or posting content online, were mentioned in 41.5 percent of job postings examined. Web/multimedia skills were required most often in newspaper job postings for Web writers/multimedia producers (100 percent), followed by photographers (60 percent), editors (56.8 percent), copyeditors (40.5 percent), reporters (38.8 percent), and management (33.3 percent).</p>
<p>In terms of specific Web and multimedia skills desired among newspapers, 21 percent of newspaper postings asked that applicants have the ability to post to the Web. Other desired skills included writing for the Web (10.9 percent), experience with Adobe Photoshop (9.2 percent), experience with Quark (7.9 percent), experience with InDesign (6.1 percent), content management system experience (5.2 percent), HTML knowledge (4.8 percent), Web analytics experience (4.4 percent), and Adobe Illustrator (3.9 percent).</p>

<p>Looking specifically at multimedia, tasks such as writing for the station’s website or posting content online were mentioned in 29.1 percent of the job postings examined. Web/multimedia skills were required most often in broadcast job postings for Web writers/multimedia producers (100 percent), followed by directors (54.5 percent), production assistants (46.2 percent), anchor/reporters (38.5 percent), anchors (31.8 percent), photographers (31 percent), editors (27.3 percent), reporters (25.8 percent), and producers (24.3 percent).</p>
<p>Specific Web and multimedia skills requested in the broadcast field were the ability to post to the Web (11.3 percent), writing for the Web (7.3 percent), experience with Avid editing system (6.7 percent), experience with Adobe Photoshop (4.5 percent), experience with Final Cut editing system (3.6 percent), HTML knowledge (3.2 percent), experience with social networking websites (2.8 percent), and creating content for mobile platforms (2.2 percent).</p>

<title>In-depth interviews</title>
<p>The real story is in analysis of the data; however, to answer the remaining research questions and to get a sense of why these particular skills and attributes are critical to the hiring process, the authors conducted in-depth interviews with recruiters for five of the biggest news media companies: Hearst, Dow Jones, Gannett, Tribune, and Cox. Three recruiters (those from Gannett, Tribune, and Cox) were interviewed in 2009 about results from the 2008 study. All said that the job of recruiting is and has been changing as the industry evolves.</p>
<p>Virgil Smith, vice president of talent management at Gannett, said he and his team of recruiters had begun facing some new challenges in the past year. He said that sometimes managers doing the hiring are not as far along in understanding industry trends as he thinks they need to be. “What I’ve found is many colleges are ahead of those working in the shops,” Smith said. “It’s somewhat of a challenge, trying to get managers to understand what young people bring to the table. A lot of the good ones can go to a major site and make a contribution right away. Before, you wanted someone with five or ten years’ experience.”</p>
<p>Smith’s statement tracks with one of the research findings. The attribute of previous professional experience was mentioned in 8 percent fewer broadcast positions and about 2 percent (albeit within any margin of error) fewer print positions than one year previously.

<p>Brian Bacco, vice president, news for Hearst Television, said he thinks that drop may be driven by the search for Web-savvy employees. “We’re not going to find someone with 15 years experience in writing for the Web,” Bracco said. He indicated smaller television stations, in particular, may be willing to hire someone to work on a website with little to no previous journalism experience but with strong Web skills.</p>
<p>For educators, this finding may indicate a need to reconsider the allocation of instructional time. Students with more of the desired Web and multimedia skills may be better able to overcome their lack of professional experience now than in years past.</p>
<p>However, in the area of specialized reporting, depth of knowledge may still be at a premium. Michelle LaRoche, editor for training and recruiting at Dow Jones Newswire, said she is actually feeling more pressure to find more experienced people. “This has been growing in the last couple years,” LaRoche said. “We want to find people who have covered the beat, who have a proven background for breaking news. Finding somebody with a proven track record is more of an emphasis than it has been in the past.”</p>
<p>Smith is also concerned about the difficulty in finding minority applicants these days. He said this is a result of a combination of experienced journalists leaving the business and fewer people of color who want to go into journalism in the first place.</p>
<p>Robin Whitmeyer is the news director for WSOC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina, an ABC affiliate owned by Cox Enterprises. For the most part, the individual Cox television stations do their own recruiting with the help of a consulting or recruiting firm for some positions. Whitmeyer said that she was looking for employees a bit differently in 2009. “I’m not as dependent on ads. I do a lot of talking to people who know people,” Whitmeyer said. “Skills are one thing, but you can’t really get a read on the person to find out if they work hard or are curious unless you talk to someone about them.”</p>
<p>In year one of the study, the three recruiters interviewed agreed that job postings were critical in creating a strong applicant pool. In 2009, the recruiters were asked how the language of job postings has evolved, if at all, since 2008. “We tend to mention speed and accuracy more now,” LaRoche said. “We talk more about working under pressure and tight deadlines. That matters more now, as does the ability to break news.”</p>
<p>In fact, more than a quarter of all job postings mention working under pressure/tight deadlines, though the percentages are down slightly for print (5.3 percent) and significantly for broadcast positions (15.2 percent). (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077695811426826">Table 4</xref>.)</p>
<p>According to Smith, the most significant change is that multimedia is key. “Video editing skills, social media skills, blogging—with industry transformation and emergence of new technology, multimedia is now included in all of our job descriptions,” said Smith.</p>
<p>Whitmeyer said her postings are getting more specific. “It’s not just, ‘Do you want to work with the #1 news team?’” said Whitmeyer. “For example, our weekend anchor ad asked for the applicant to tell me about experiences with coaching, about what you do behind the scenes, do [you] have the ability to be a team leader?”</p>
<p>Again, RQ4 asks what skills or attributes the recruiters want to see in job applicants but that are not mentioned specifically in the job postings. “Two go hand-in-hand—be smart and know what’s going on in terms of current events,” said Whitmeyer. She said she has been disappointed many times in how little curiosity about the world many applicants seem to have. Solomon also mentioned curiosity.</p>
<p>For LaRoche, it is all about speed. “The ability to turn a story quickly in multiple formats,” LaRoche said. “The people who are most successful right away when they come in are those who work for newswires or websites where the real-time aspect is king.”</p>
<p>This emphasis on speed and the ability to work under pressure with tight deadlines is a challenge for educators. Simulating the “real-world” experience of reporting and producing content on a deadline requires creative thinking within the construct of a classroom setting. Schools that have student media outlets may have some advantage here.</p>
<p>Bacco is interested in getting applicants with critical thinking skills but says job postings are limited for a reason. “You can’t write all the things we want you to do because we want you to do everything,” Bacco said. “The days where [a posting] was really specific—work nine to five, produce the 5 p.m. newscast—have gone by the wayside; employers don’t want to get trapped by that.” Although this was always good advice, Bacco also said it is incumbent upon the job seeker to research the employer and the position to find out what it will take to get hired.</p>
<p>Recruiters were also asked to help interpret some of the changes in the year-to-year data, as well as to evaluate differences between newspaper and broadcast job postings, as posed in RQ5. For example, in the 2008 content analysis, eight of the top ten skills and attributes were identical for both broadcast and print postings. In 2009, there were seven repeats. “I think the lines are blurring because of multimedia,” Smith said. “I think we’re looking for the same attributes in newspaper and broadcast journalists. We want multimedia journalists with solid basics—the ability to write, inquisitiveness, people who want to dig deeper, who know how to use the tools with an understanding of how their information will be used on multiple platforms.”</p>
<p>Bacco and Whitmeyer agree that the need to produce for the Web is creating a more uniform journalism skill set, with all journalists needing multiplatform skills; however, Solomon and LaRoche are not sure the lines have blurred entirely. “I think yes, they are blurring, but I think that not everybody recognizes that yet,” LaRoche said. “When I see a resume from someone who has done a lot of broadcast, the instinct is that they don’t have the qualifications that we’re looking for. But they do in many ways—the ability to think on their feet, to cover a story quickly and coherently. With the live camera on, you have to talk intelligently right away. Talking isn’t writing, but it’s the same concept.”</p>
<p>Many journalism programs have revised curricula to incorporate more cross-platform skills in core courses. In addition, educators may do well to become more platform-agnostic themselves and to help students see connections between the skills needed to produce a story in multiple media. In both years of the study, Web/multimedia skills were included in the top ten most often mentioned, but on the print side in 2009, strong writing took over the number two spot from multimedia.</p>
<p>LaRoche said she has seen a new emphasis on writing. “We’ve put a lot more pressure and done a lot more training internally for our reporters to write shorter, more concisely, without shirking on information; that’s really hard to do. They need to be excellent to do it well and on deadline,” said LaRoche.</p>
<p>Solomon said writing and Web/multimedia skills may be more closely related than it would first appear. “I think, perhaps, it is because we’re being asked to write for more mediums; now multimedia writing is just something every print or broadcast person is going to do,” Solomon said.</p>
<p>Smith said print journalists may be elevating the importance of writing as a skill because it is something they have been taught to do. Yet he noted that even with a slight decrease in emphasis of Web/multimedia skills for print positions (41.5 percent of postings still mention those skills, down from 45 percent a year earlier, within any margin of error), on the broadcast side, Web/multimedia skills are mentioned in slightly more postings in 2009—an increase from 23 to 29.1 percent. That was enough to move Web/multimedia skills from the number ten to the number five spot on the list of skills and attributes in broadcast postings.</p>
<p>“Broadcast was a little later to the game; they had the natural platform but it was not being executed early on,” Smith said. Bacco expects that Web/multimedia skills will only get more critical for those applying for broadcast positions. “I suspect if you do this a year or two from now it will be one or two on the list,” Bacco said. “I don’t think you can enter a TV market now and not have the ability or skill set to publish on the website.”</p>
<p>Broadcasters seem to have a little more momentum than their print counterparts when it comes to requiring social media skills and the ability to create content for mobile platforms. Just 2.8 percent of postings for broadcast positions referenced a need for social media skills, and just 2.2 percent referenced mobile platforms. (The number of mentions of these skills/attributes in print postings was too small to quantify.)</p>
<p>“I’m surprised social networking is as low as it is,” Whitmeyer said. “It’s the buzz; we all have to be there; we’re just not quite sure how to leverage it.” She also said she expects mobile to be mentioned more in future job postings. “That’s going to be a big difference next year; we keep talking about it, but we haven’t gotten a hold of it yet,” Whitmeyer said.</p>
<p>Bacco agrees, saying, “Our audience is mobile; our audience wants their information now and wants it on three screens. We need to deliver it on every one and the people we hire need to have that skill set.” Smith said, “What this tells me is that some of the folks recruiting haven’t made the connection. We reference social media, not only for our journalists, but for our sales positions.” Solomon and LaRoche were surprised by the lack of social media and mobile platform mentions in print postings. “They should be included on the newspaper side,” LaRoche said. “That’s what we ask our reporters for. They don’t need to know special software, but many of them do blog and we ask some of them to tweet; some have Facebook pages; they’re doing social networking.”</p>
<p>For educators, there is no doubt that instruction in the area of social media and mobile delivery of content will need to increase, and academic research into usage and best practices for producing mobile and social media could be invaluable to both the profession and the academy.</p>
<p>Despite the growth of the Web as a source of news and information while the traditional media lose audience, Web/multimedia job postings decreased for both broadcast (8.6 to 5.7 percent) and print (12.7 to 5.7 percent). “My theory is that the jobs in newsrooms have changed,” Solomon said. “We don’t have a need for copy editors because we’re outsourcing, so there won’t be a posting for a Web job when all we’re going to do is retrain someone.” Bacco said the drop may be related to the still-struggling economy but said Hearst has also been training or cross-training existing staff to work on the Web. LaRoche said more jobs at Dow Jones now include multimedia responsibilities, too. “When someone leaves, sometimes the tasks that person was responsible for are automated or divvied up among other people,” said LaRoche. “It’s not so foreign to people anymore, the idea of posting the Web, for example, is not so scary.”</p>
<p>Another year-to-year change involves the increase in mentions of the need to be a team player. More than a quarter of all of print postings (25.3 percent) mentioned the attribute in 2009 versus 16.4 percent in 2008. Both Smith and LaRoche think this can be attributed to the proverbial need “to do more with less” in newsrooms around the country. “With fewer people working, we have to be smarter, working together is the only way to get it all done,” LaRoche said. “The world of, ‘You cover your beat and I’ll cover mine,’ just isn’t going to cut it anymore.”</p>
<p>Within the classroom, creating assignments that promote teamwork and leverage the expertise of individual students is one important way to help foster this critical attribute in journalism graduates. Again, RQ6 asks what new media skills are desired by recruiters. In hiring for multimedia positions specifically (postings that were categorized as Web writer/multimedia producer), print and broadcast operations both sought candidates with Web/multimedia skills and previous professional experience as the most important skills or attributes.</p>
<p>Positions posted by traditional print news organizations rounded out the top five skills with the ability to work as a team player (53.8 percent), multitasking (46.2 percent), and leadership abilities (38.5 percent). On the broadcast side it was strong writing (58.6 percent), nonlinear editing capabilities (48.3 percent), and working under pressure/tight deadlines (44.8 percent). All five recruiters mentioned the challenge in hiring for Web positions is in knowing what skills or attributes are essential on a platform where technology and audience tastes keep changing.</p>
<p>“We try to stay ahead of what people want, but we don’t know what they want; that’s a real problem,” Whitmeyer said. “Right now we have an open position and we keep changing the job definition. We can’t get a handle on what we need; we want a master of all.” Bacco says Hearst has a digital team with a recruiter who searches the landscape for potential employees. He said all journalists and Web journalists in particular need to be agile. “We won’t know what’s going to happen in five years; our business has always been about change,” Bracco said. “We just have to adapt it.”</p>

<sec id="section8-1077695811426826" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The three-month sample in 2009 yielded 735 job postings—a slight increase (3 percent) from the postings for the same period a year earlier, though not enough to suggest that the traditional print and broadcast news organizations have or will ever reach the levels of employment found a decade ago.</p>
<p>As previous studies in the literature have suggested, even with the technological changes in today’s newsrooms, traditional journalism skills are still in demand; however, Web/multimedia skills appear to be growing in importance for broadcast journalists and remaining relatively steady for print positions.</p>
<p>Web/multimedia skills were mentioned in 41.5 percent of print postings and 29.1 percent of broadcast job listings. In 2008, the researchers found that broadcast positions seemed to de-emphasize multimedia in favor of more traditional skills and attributes; in fact, Web/multimedia skills ranked tenth on the list of skills and attributes mentioned in broadcast postings. In 2009, Web/multimedia skills ranked fifth, after previous professional experience, strong writing skills, communication skills, and nonlinear editing. Two recruiters stated that though broadcasters may have lagged behind their print counterparts in understanding the importance of the Web in the past, they believe that is no longer the case, and they fully expect more broadcast positions to emphasize Web/multimedia skills in the future.</p>
<p>Broadcast programs that fail to reinforce the need for strong text-based writing skills and an understanding of the industry’s three-screen strategy may be ill preparing their students for jobs in a changing profession.</p>
<p>Breaking it down by positions other than those specifically categorized as Web/multimedia jobs, the researchers found that some are much more likely than others to mention the need for such skills. For example, 60 percent of print photojournalist positions list Web/multimedia skills as a requirement, as do 56.8 percent of editor jobs, 40.5 percent of copy editor positions, and 38.8 percent of print reporting jobs.</p>
<p>For broadcast positions, 31.8 percent of anchor openings mentioned multimedia skills, as did 38.5 percent of reporter/anchor positions. Production jobs such as director (54.5 percent), production assistant (46.2 percent), and editor (27.3 percent) quite often required Web skills. Jobs posted as reporter-only emphasized nonlinear editing (42.4 percent) and shooting/photo skills (37.9 percent), which were coded separately from Web/multimedia skills and attributes.</p>
<p>For journalism educators in general, these findings should reinforce the notion that cross-platform skills are and will continue to be important in helping students find employment. Two specific Web/multimedia skills got more mentions than any other—the ability to post to the Web and the ability to write for the Web. In addition, two recruiters suggested that speed has become an important aspect of writing—the ability to create content quickly for the Web and mobile devices. Creating opportunities for students to perfect these skills may be critical to their future success.</p>
<p>For schools with a traditional broadcast journalism curriculum, it is interesting to note the percentages of broadcast reporting jobs that require nonlinear editing and shooting/photo skills. With well over a third of positions requiring one or both, it is clear that the need to be training broadcast journalists to work alone on producing stories is already essential.</p>
<p>The results also show that previous professional experience was the top requirement in job postings for both newspaper and broadcast companies for the second year in a row. But the percentage of postings including the attribute was down slightly for print (57.7 to 55.5 percent, within any margin of error) and a bit more for broadcast (81.4 to 73.3 percent). One recruiter suggested that some younger journalists, with little to no professional experience, may have much-needed skills that the veterans do not.</p>
<p>Strong writing was also a top requirement for both newspaper (51.1 percent) and broadcast positions (48.6) once again in 2009. However, more than one recruiter indicated that strong writing has evolved to mean an ability to write quickly and for multiple media. As one recruiter put it, today’s journalists must know “how to write in AP style, for Twitter and Facebook.”</p>
<p>In newspaper postings, the analysis yielded a significant year-to-year increase in the need for applicants to be team players (16.4 to 25.3 percent). Several recruiters said they see this as indicative of the changing nature of print newsrooms where more collaboration is necessary than ever before. This finding might suggest that educators teaching print courses should look for opportunities to assign team projects or even to work with other instructors and classes, such as pairing a traditional print reporting class with a Web design class.</p>
<p>In 2009, for the first time, researchers noted experience with social networking websites and creating content for mobile platforms showing up as desired skills in broadcast job postings. All five recruiters indicated they expect mentions of these particular skills to increase dramatically in the coming years for both print and broadcast job openings.</p>
<p>Educators would do well to get ahead of the industry need by preparing students who are ready to step into leadership roles in the area of social media and mobile delivery. One recruiter described college students as “already immersed in the culture of social media”; now their instructors need to help them see how social media can be used as a newsgathering and dissemination tool.</p>
<p>Having two years of data has provided the researchers with some interesting points of comparison. For example, the drop in Web/multimedia job postings for both broadcast (8.6 to 5.7 percent) and print (12.7 to 5.7 percent) was a surprising finding in light of the increase in online audience. However, recruiters explained this as a function of two developments: (1) instead of laying off some existing employees, they’re being retrained to take on Web- or multimedia-oriented roles; and (2) some Web or multimedia functions may have simply been absorbed by existing staff as technological advances and staff familiarity with technology make it easier for them to perform these tasks in addition to other duties.</p>
<p>The data and the recruiters also suggest that the industry’s need for multimedia capabilities in its workforce is blurring some traditional demarcations between skills needed to work for a newspaper or a television station. As one recruiter put it, “We’re looking for the same core skills and attributes whether we’re hiring for print or broadcast.” This suggests a need for educators to be sure they are instilling cross-platform skills in all journalism students and to help students think more broadly about the job possibilities available to them.</p>
<p>The authors hope to continue taking a longitudinal approach to this research to track the changes in job postings as the industry evolves. For example, tracking the particular types of Web/multimedia skills that appear, grow, or diminish over time could help educators stay on top of curriculum development.</p>
<p>In addition, the balance between the need for multimedia and platform-specific skills seems to be shifting, and the subject may be fertile ground for future research. Surveys tend to track whether journalism and mass communication graduates find employment in the broad field of communications, but beginning to track more specifically where students find jobs, regardless of their area of specialization in school, may be another way to measure the amount of medium-specific instruction needed versus cross-platform skills.</p>
