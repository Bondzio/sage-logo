<abstract>
<p>This article tackles a new phenomenon that will have profound consequences for the future of the international migration order: international migration to the People’s Republic of China. For decades, China has had large numbers of foreign students, expatriates, returned overseas Chinese, and ethnic Chinese refugees. However, in the past few years, immigration to China has become much more diverse and numerous. Chinese students and scholars abroad return to China in ever greater numbers. Traders and labor migrants from all over the world are attracted by China’s trading opportunities, political stability, and prosperity. Middle-class Koreans, Taiwanese, and Southeast Asians are looking for cheaper living costs and better jobs. European, North American, and Australian university graduates travel to China for employment or to start a business. This article asks to what extent government policy making and the formation of immigrant groups and ethnic relations are informed by unique features of China’s late socialist society and government, or alternatively, to what extent they follow patterns similar to established developed immigrant countries in Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>

<p>Since the start of the reforms in 1978, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the first, largest, and arguably most important of the twenty-first century’s new superpowers, has become a crucial hub of the global migration order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0097700411424564">Pieke, 2007</xref>). China’s economic development has given rise to massive flows of domestic migration and international out-migration. However, both China itself and the global community as a whole will have to consider radical changes currently taking place that potentially will have an even greater impact in the next five, ten, or twenty years. As international immigration is beginning to fill specific gaps in the labor market and foreigners are attracted by the promise of a better life, China is rapidly also becoming an important destination of international migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0097700411424564">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the short to medium term, the rise of China as a major immigration country is mostly predicated on the continued growth of its economy and its gradual transition to an urban, service-based economy. The role, and especially the timing, of demographic factors is less clear. In 2003, for the first time China began to experience shortages of <italic>internal</italic> migrant labor. There are only few people left in rural China younger than 30 years—the cohort most predisposed to out-migration—who still work in agriculture. According to China’s leading labor economist, Cai Fang, and his collaborators, this is because China has started its demographic transition and can no longer rely on an inexhaustible supply of labor to drive further economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0097700411424564">Cai, Yang, and Wang, 2009</xref>: 22–25). Shortages of labor drive up migrant workers’ wages, a trend that has continued apace despite a short blip caused by the economic crisis in late 2008 and early 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0097700411424564">Cai et al., 2010</xref>). In 2010, sometimes violent strikes and protests by migrant workers were reported widely in Guangdong, revealing the strong bargaining power of migrant laborers in the area and causing speculation that the end of China’s labor-intensive, export-processing growth strategy might be near (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0097700411424564">“Is China’s Labour at a Turning Point?” 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet this is very likely only the beginning of a fundamental restructuring of the Chinese labor market. According to Athar Hussain, the imbalances caused by the one-child policy will lead to truly massive shortages of working-age people only in the long term (more than fifteen years from now). Before that, China will in fact continue to benefit from the dividend of the one-child policy. As Cai Fang and Wang Meiyan have shown, until 2013 the number of people either too old (older than 64 years) or too young (younger than 15 years) to work relative to the number of people of working age (between 15 and 64 years) will continue to drop. After that, this so-called dependency ratio will only gradually increase as the size of the elderly population grows and the number of under-age dependents continues to shrink. However, only after the imbalances caused by long-term mandatory family planning and population aging fully kick in around 2025 will their consequences rapidly become increasingly severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0097700411424564">Cai and Wang, 2009</xref>: 105–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0097700411424564">Hussain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0097700411424564">Hussain, Cassen, and Dyson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, economic and social development and demographic trends will combine to create increasing shortages of labor. Twenty years from now, China will be a country defined by its cities rather than by its countryside, and the latter no longer will be able to act as a limitless reservoir of labor migrants for the lower-end jobs in urban manufacturing, construction, and services. Moreover, China’s alarmingly unbalanced sex ratio will mean that there will be many more men than women, creating a demand for women (mainly as wives, but also as concubines or prostitutes) that will fuel international migration.</p>
<p>In recent years, the media and a few academic researchers in China itself have started reporting on the growth of nonethnic Chinese immigrant communities, such as Muslim, South Asian, or African traders, foreign students, South Korean middle-class settlers, foreign expatriates, and North Korean refugees. There is also a small number of non-Chinese journalistic accounts and academic studies, for instance, on Africans in Guangzhou, Singaporeans and Britons in southern Jiangsu and elsewhere, Koreans in Beijing, Western upper-class gated communities in Beijing, Taiwanese in Shanghai, and Southeast Asian wives in southern China. Of course, historians have written particularly on Western communities and the treaty ports in pre-1949 China (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700411424564">Bickers, 2011</xref>). There is also a modest tradition of studies on returned overseas Chinese and the impact on their home areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0097700411424564">Chen Ta, 1939</xref>, being the earliest), and, more recently, returning Chinese students and scholars. In addition, a cottage industry exists of popular accounts of the trials and tribulations of foreign-invested firms in China, the dos and don’ts of doing business in China, and the idiosyncrasies of living in China as a foreigner. However, with a very few exceptions (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0097700411424564">Li, 2008</xref>), none of these studies approaches foreigners in contemporary China as an immigration issue that is leading to the formation of ethnic communities, comparable in this regard to most if not all of the countries in the developed world, including many East and Southeast Asian countries. The mindset that China is a country of emigration, not immigration, has created a huge blind spot in the perception of China’s global role.</p>
<p>This article cannot possibly pretend to fill this void. Given the dearth of research, I can only attempt to delineate an exciting and largely unexplored field. In order to do so, I have systematically scanned Chinese language materials, in addition to the still small number of accounts of immigrant life that are currently available in English and French. In addition, in June 2010, I undertook a research trip to Beijing, Kunming, and Guangzhou to interview officials and researchers working on various aspects of foreign migration, employment, and residence. Together, these sources provide us with an understanding of the variety of issues that are beginning to confront Chinese policy makers, and how they are choosing to deal with them.</p>
<sec id="section1-0097700411424564">
<title>Origins and Growth of Immigration to China</title>
<p>In 1949, the year of the victory of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), more than 200,000 foreigners (<italic>waiguo qiaomin</italic>, or <italic>waiqiao</italic>) lived in China. This foreign presence was the most visible aspect of what the Party perceived to be China’s hundred years of humiliation since the Opium Wars at the hands of foreign imperialist and capitalist aggressors. Immediately after victory, the Party proceeded, in the words of Party Chairman Mao Zedong, “first to clean out the rooms before inviting new guests” (<italic>dasao ganjing wuzi zai qingke</italic>). Virtually all foreign residents, “with the exception of law abiding foreign residents from Korea and Vietnam,” either chose to leave China voluntarily, or else were expelled, imprisoned, or executed as foreign or Guomindang spies, imperialist exploiters, or Christian missionaries. In 1955, only 7,833 of a 1949 total of 55,944 foreigners from “imperialist and capitalist” countries remained. In 1955, a new system was put in place to accommodate the travel and stay of new China’s “foreign guests” (<italic>waibin</italic>) and “foreign friends” (<italic>waiguo pengyou</italic>): delegates, visitors, students, businesspeople, and apparently even some tourists. Restrictions on foreigners were relaxed and certain areas were opened up for foreigners to travel to.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0097700411424564">2</xref></sup> Although loosely modeled on the way that foreigners were dealt with in the Soviet Union, the PRC’s “foreign affairs” (<italic>waishi</italic>) system was unique in the world in the meticulous differences between foreigners and Chinese that it created in all spheres of life and politics. Aspects of this system continue to exist, still informing attitudes toward foreigners both within the state and among the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0097700411424564">Brady, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The most important foreign presence in the new China of the 1950s was the thousands of experts sent by the Soviet Union and its allies to help China industrialize and set up a socialist planned economy. With the growing rift between China and the Soviet Union after 1956, these experts were withdrawn. In the 1960s and especially from 1964, restrictions on foreigners were reintroduced, including for instance foreigners’ checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0097700411424564">Zhongguo jingcha xuehui, 2003</xref>: 6–7). At the start of the Cultural Revolution, China had become a hermetic state that few foreigners could travel to, and just a few diplomats, journalists, students, and businesspeople from countries that recognized the new People’s Republic remained in China, in addition to overseas Chinese who had fled Indonesia after the anti-Chinese movements there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0097700411424564">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1970s, after the end of the “revolutionary” phase of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1969), a gradually rising number of foreigners began to arrive in conjunction with the gradual opening up of Chinese society and normalization of China’s international relations. After the death of Mao in 1976 and the official start of the “Four Modernizations” in 1978, the number of foreign visitors to China rose quickly. In 1978, 1.02 million foreigners entered China, a number that rose to 3.29 million in 1985 and 16.7 million in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0097700411424564">Zhongguo jingcha xuehui, 2003</xref>: 7–8). In the 1970s and 1980s, foreigners who resided in China for a longer period consisted of three main categories: degree students mainly from developing countries (especially Africa and North Korea) and Chinese language and culture students mainly from the developed world; expatriate businesspeople, journalists, and diplomats; and foreign language teachers and other “foreign experts” hired by Chinese state employers. Foreign residence in all categories was still strictly controlled by state agencies rather than by market forces or other factors beyond the economic plan. Only the further growth and maturation of the market economy in the 1990s and 2000s created the conditions for autonomous immigration and settlement. Housing, employment, trade, investment, health care, and education rapidly “grew out of the plan” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0097700411424564">Naughton, 1993</xref>), allowing not only Chinese but also foreigners to make their own choices where to work and live.</p>
<p>Until the 2010 population census, which for the first time included foreign residents, data on the number of foreigners were highly incomplete and dispersed across the Chinese administration. Furthermore, many foreigners in China either reside illegally or else have only short-term visas, forcing them frequently to travel in and out of the country and being in many instances visible to the administration only as visitors rather than residents. There also is considerable terminological complexity involved due to the inherently fuzzy boundaries of the Chinese nation as defined by the PRC state. “Foreigners” (<italic>waiguoren</italic>) usually refers only to people with a non-Chinese nationality. This officially includes ethnic Chinese and former PRC nationals with a foreign nationality (<italic>waiji Huaren</italic>), although such foreign Chinese in bureaucratic practice are often treated separately from non-Chinese foreigners. To confuse matters even more, although people from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao are considered part of the inclusive category of “Chinese” (<italic>Huaren</italic>, <italic>Zhongguoren</italic>) or even “Chinese nationals” (<italic>Zhongguo guomin</italic>), as residents of a separate administrative region or country they constitute intermediate categories between pure foreigners and full citizens (<italic>gongmin</italic>) of the PRC, termed Taiwanese “compatriots” (<italic>tongbao</italic>) and Hong Kong and Macao “residents” (<italic>jumin</italic>). In discussions and statistics on foreign immigrants in China, some or all of such non-PRC Chinese and full foreigners are often merged into the broader category of “persons” or “population” “from outside the borders” (<italic>jingwai renyuan</italic>, <italic>jingwai renkou</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700411424564">Jing, 2003</xref>: 60). Inevitably, given the many terms and categories involved, it is sometimes impossible exactly to know what a specific fact, figure, or statement refers to.</p>
<p>The most immediately available and internationally comparable data on the number of immigrants in China are those compiled by the United Nations. According to the United Nations, China’s foreign population was 245,700 in 1960, rising to 376,400 in 1990 and 590,300 in 2005. No information is given on what exactly these figures refer to, but they most likely only include foreign nationals without Chinese from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao living in China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0097700411424564">4</xref></sup> This seems to be confirmed by the 2010 population census, which yielded a total number of 593,832 foreigners, in addition to 170,283 Taiwanese, 234,829 Hong Kong residents, and 21,201 Macao residents, for a total of 1,020,145 foreigners in the PRC. The census for the first time gives comprehensive and reliable figures on the number of foreigners that can be analyzed in detail to yield insights into the exact distribution and composition of China’s foreign population. However, I expect the census to have severely undercounted the numbers involved, although a firm judgment on this obviously requires closer scrutiny of the census’s methodology and conventions than was possible at the time this article went to press, only a few days after the publication of the first census results on April 29, 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0097700411424564">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other data that I have been able to find give, when pulled together, a slightly more inclusive picture. Most Chinese sources only give figures on the total number of foreign visitors to China, the number of registered foreigners in a particular location or under the remit of a particular branch of the administration, or estimates of the size of a particular national group. The National Foreign Experts Bureau (Guojia waiguo zhuanjia ju) reported that 400,000 foreign experts were employed through the bureau in China in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0097700411424564">6</xref></sup> In 2001, 500,000 Taiwanese had taken up residence and 176,000 Hong Kong and Macao residents were working in the People’s Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700411424564">Jing, 2003</xref>: 60). Another source gives a total of 380,000 foreign nationals (<italic>waiji ren</italic>, i.e., presumably excluding Chinese from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) registered in 2005 as living in the PRC for a year or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0097700411424564">Xu, 2008</xref>: 27). In 2006, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security reported that 180,000 foreigners held a work permit issued by the ministry in 2006, almost double the number in 2003. Of these foreigners, 55,000 worked in Shanghai, 30,000 in Beijing, and 6,800 in Guangzhou (<italic>Zhongguo peixun</italic>, no. 7, 2007: 59).</p>
<p>Whatever the exact numbers are, we should bear in mind that international migrants still are only a minute fraction of China’s huge population. The United Nations’ figure of 590,292 immigrants in China in 2005, for instance, is just 0.05% of the total population in that year. However, foreigners are highly concentrated in specific parts of the country. The percentage of the total population says little about the impact that communities of foreigners have in cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, or Beijing. In these places, foreigners have become a long-term and important aspect of the urban landscape, and in that sense, China has become an immigration country, despite the small numbers involved relative to China’s huge population.</p>
<p>The scale and variety of immigration in China already clearly defy easy and unambiguous characterization. As a start, and without yet aspiring to a full-fledged analytical typology, five broad and overlapping categories of both older and new types of immigration can be distinguished: (1) students; (2) middle-class professionals, businesspeople, and traders; (3) Chinese return migrants; (4) cross-border migrants; and (5) casual “fortune seekers.”</p>
<sec id="section2-0097700411424564">
<title>Students</title>
<p>China has become a magnet for fee-paying foreign students. In 2007, the number of foreign students was 190,000, or more than five times as many as in 1997 (“Foreign Student Quota to Expand,” <italic>China Daily</italic>, July 29, 2008). Major state and private investment in the tertiary educational sector has made Chinese universities competitive in the lucrative international student market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0097700411424564">7</xref></sup> As China’s global role increases, firsthand knowledge of Chinese language and culture becomes a more important asset, attracting ever larger numbers of students to China. The majority of such students take short-term courses specifically tailored to foreigners. These courses are offered not only by regular Chinese universities or language schools. During my own fieldwork on cadre training in China in 2007, I learned that, for instance, the Beijing City Communist Party School runs a profitable sideline business offering Chinese language and culture courses to foreign students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0097700411424564">Pieke, 2009</xref>: 129).</p>
<p>China has also become the choice of many degree students, mainly from Southeast and South Asia. In 2008, 50,468 foreign students were enrolled in undergraduate and 10,743 in postgraduate programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0097700411424564">Yu and Liu, 2010</xref>: 50). Some of this is part of the government’s “soft power” strategy (particularly in Southeast Asia; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0097700411424564">Kurlantzick, 2007</xref>: 69–71), but many students apply to Chinese universities also because of the combination of good-quality education, reasonable fees, and geographic proximity. According to a 2007 article in the <italic>Guangzhou ribao</italic>, four or five thousand medical students from India were enrolled at over twenty Chinese universities offering English language medical degree programs specifically aimed at foreigners. In India, entry into medical school is extremely competitive and acceptance into Chinese programs requires much lower examination grades than back home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0097700411424564">Lü and Huang, 2007</xref>). In the academic year 2007–2008, 480 Vietnamese—only 40 of whom received a government scholarship—studied in Guangzhou city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700411424564">Huang, 2009</xref>: 75). The rise in foreign student numbers is by no means limited to the metropolitan areas of the coastal region. In Yunnan, the number of Vietnamese students rose from 89 in 2002 to 515 in 2006. Other sharp risers in the province included South Koreans, Thais, Laotians, and Burmese, with a more moderate rise recorded for Americans and Japanese. Among these foreign students, the number of degree students rose sharpest, for instance in medicine, art, and business. Private universities saw an especially rapid rise in the number of foreign students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700411424564">He, 2009</xref>: 19–20).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0097700411424564">
<title>Professionals, Businesspeople, and Traders</title>
<p>China’s cities attract ever larger numbers of businesspeople and professionals from the developed world. The communities of middle-class and elite resident foreigners are no longer numerically dominated by expatriate employees of foreign multinationals, international organizations, diplomatic missions, and “foreign experts” hired by Chinese state enterprises or organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0097700411424564">8</xref></sup> Large numbers of foreigners have independently taken up long-term residence in search of local employment (with either a Chinese or foreign firm) or cheaper living costs, or to set up their own business. Younger foreigners may be enrolled at a university or language school to facilitate their stay, in fact much like many Chinese students at private language schools in, for instance, the United Kingdom. In addition, we should also include in this category the very diverse group of traders from Russia, Central, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. To all of these foreigners, China is a land of opportunity, not just a stopover on an international career.</p>
<p>In the eyes of many Chinese, (white) Westerners are the paradigm of what are known as <italic>yang dagong</italic> (foreign workers).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0097700411424564">9</xref></sup> However, numerically this category of foreign residents is in fact dominated by hundreds of thousands of middle-class Taiwanese, Hong Kong Chinese, South Koreans, Japanese, and Southeast Asians, and, of course, returning Chinese nationals and former Chinese nationals. The Shanghai-Suzhou region alone, for instance, in 2005 had more than 300,000 Taiwanese residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0097700411424564">Xia, 2006</xref>: 26), while there are reportedly 700,000 South Koreans in the whole of China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0097700411424564">10</xref></sup> A very informative article on foreign workers reports on a survey among 1,500 private firms conducted by the Industrial and Trade Association (Gongshanglian). More than a third of these firms stated that human resources rather than capital were the chief constraining factor in their operations. According to the article, head-hunters play an important role in recruiting foreign employees for Chinese private firms, including CEOs. In Wenzhou, the capital of Chinese private enterprise, 50% of foreign workers are employed by private firms and 37% by foreign-invested firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0097700411424564">Zhang Xiaoming, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Policy-oriented articles on foreigners in China often begin by stating that China’s growth, World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, and general opening up have created a need for highly skilled foreign labor despite China’s own very large labor force, for instance high-level managers, engineers, or employees with the skills needed to operate in an international business environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0097700411424564">11</xref></sup> This is in line with the 1996 regulations on the employment of foreigners, which limit foreigners to employment that cannot be filled by Chinese. Furthermore, Article 34 of these regulations explicitly forbids Chinese individual economic organizations or individual citizens from hiring foreign workers, limiting foreign employment to foreign and state and larger private enterprises. However, this is honored mostly in the breach, an important cause of the <italic>san fei</italic> (three illegalities) problem that the authorities are struggling to resolve (see below).</p>
<p>Many professional middle-class immigrants expect to stay long-term. Increasing numbers have brought their families over, while others (usually men) have found a Chinese spouse, partner, or lover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0097700411424564">Ding et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0097700411424564">Shen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0097700411424564">Yue, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0097700411424564">Willis and Yeoh, 2002</xref>: 561). Cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou are becoming more like “global cities” elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0097700411424564">Sassen, 1991</xref>), one of the many homes to Asia’s and the world’s highly mobile transnational elite and middle-class professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0097700411424564">Duara, 2010</xref>: 977–80). The research by Yeoh and Willis on Singaporeans and British migrants and Shen’s work on Taiwanese migrants in China have shown that the lifestyle and household strategies of such migrants involve the often familiar issues of expatriate life. Ambitious and career-focused families and individuals juggle the demands of children, spouses, and careers, feel the conflicting pull of here and home, and are tempted by the material, intellectual, and sexual rewards of foreign life in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0097700411424564">Shen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0097700411424564">Willis and Yeoh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0097700411424564">Willis and Yeoh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The creation of high-price housing estates in the 1990s specifically for foreigners came before the marketization of urban housing for Chinese, leading to a clustered residential pattern of high-income professional and expatriate foreigners in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0097700411424564">Wang and Lau, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0097700411424564">Wu and Webber, 2004</xref>). However, following the housing reforms foreigners have started to rent or buy houses both in foreign and domestic estates, countering the earlier trend of residential clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0097700411424564">Xu and Wang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0097700411424564">Zhuang, 2007a</xref>). Despite certain restrictions put in place in 2006 to forbid purchase by absentee investors, home ownership among foreigners continues to be on the rise, particularly among Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese in Guangdong and Shanghai, but Western Europeans and Russians, for instance, have also entered China’s property market. Reportedly, of the more than 200,000 Europeans in China, more than 10% have bought a house. Some of these are long-term residents, while others buy houses as an investment or a second home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0097700411424564">Qing, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0097700411424564">Su, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite their spread beyond areas designated specifically for foreigners, many groups of immigrants who share a common background tend to concentrate in one particular city or neighborhood and/or specialize in a particular type of employment or business. Such clustering (for instance, through chain migration or professional specialization) is an important feature of settlement of foreign communities in, for instance, Guangzhou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0097700411424564">Li, 2008</xref>), a pattern reminiscent of the settlement of certain domestic rural-urban migrants in contemporary China, such as the well-known “Zhejiang Village” in Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0097700411424564">Xiang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0097700411424564">Li Zhang, 2001</xref>). In some cases, this has enabled the emergence of an ethnic infrastructure. In Beijing, 80,000 or so mainly middle-class South Koreans live in the city’s Wangjing district, supporting a large and well-equipped Korean school, restaurants, shops, and travel agents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0097700411424564">12</xref></sup> Residential clustering and occupational specialization are not limited to immigrants within large metropolitan areas. In the city of Weihai on the northern coast of the Shandong peninsula, 94% of the 895 resident foreigners are South Koreans. They are mostly owners or employees of small self-invested light-industrial plants or, more recently, wharfs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0097700411424564">Sun and Liu, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Taiwanese have settled in China in large numbers since the mid-1990s. Shanghai, as East Asia’s emerging cosmopolitan center, is their favorite destination. In China, the very large communities of Taiwanese in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Dongguan have established many schools that teach for Taiwanese diplomas, while Dongguan even has a Taiwanese hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0097700411424564">ng, 2004</xref>). They live together with other Taiwanese and generally keep separate from the local population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0097700411424564">Lin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0097700411424564">Tanabe, 2008</xref>). Taiwanese migrants are able to capitalize on a combination of an international background and native language and cultural skills. The Chinese government in practice actively encourages their migration. Entry and one-year residence visas and work permits are much easier to obtain than for other foreigners; since 2005, work permits are given without the normal restrictions on foreign employment. Taiwanese migration, together with migration from Hong Kong and Macao and return migration of (former) Chinese nationals, is a phenomenon that straddles the divide between international and domestic migration.</p>
<p>Much smaller communities of traders exist from Russia, Central, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0097700411424564">13</xref></sup> A recent study on the relatively small group of Vietnamese in Guangzhou provides a good example. Since the normalization of relations between Vietnam and China in 1991, a modest but rising number of Vietnamese have settled in nearby Guangzhou. In 2007, almost 1,000 Vietnamese lived in the city, half of whom were students. The other half either were returned ethnic Chinese, owners of small businesses (restaurants, workshops), or traders. The last are concentrated in Guangzhou’s “jeans city” (<italic>niuzi cheng</italic>) where traders from all over the world, especially from less developed countries, come to purchase garments. The Vietnamese traders mostly sell their merchandise in Russia and Eastern Europe, while a few small shuttle traders sell garments and other consumer goods in Vietnam itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700411424564">Huang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Immigrant traders tend to create and exploit highly specific niches where dense co-ethnic networks and access to specific overseas markets give them a competitive advantage. This is perhaps best illustrated by the community of 1,600 registered (and many more unregistered) people and 200 registered companies from India in Shaoxing city in northern Zhejiang province, home to a global “textile city” that attracts domestic and international traders. The Indians in Shaoxing are mostly Sindhis and part of a thoroughly transnational community of textile merchants who trade Shaoxing’s mostly synthetic fabrics across the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0097700411424564">Aiyar, 2007</xref>). Close to Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang is the now-famous city of Yiwu, which has become China’s premier wholesale market in a staggering range of industrial products. Yiwu attracts traders from around China and the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0097700411424564">Weng, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The group of foreign traders that is by far the best researched are the Africans in Guangzhou, partially because of the visibility of what is locally known as “Chocolate City” and partially also as a corollary of the recent interest in the connections between China and Africa, including Chinese migration to the continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0097700411424564">Bertoncelo and Bredeloup, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700411424564">Bodomo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0097700411424564">Bodomo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700411424564">He, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0097700411424564">Le Bail, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0097700411424564">Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0097700411424564">Lyons, Brown, and Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0097700411424564">Osnos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0097700411424564">Park and Tu, 2010</xref>). Guangdong, as a manufacturing center of the global economy, is a magnet for traders and procurement agents, while Africa has emerged as a natural market for cheap manufactured goods from China. Starting with a few enterprising students some fifteen years ago, currently about 30,000 Africans operate in Guangzhou purchasing manufactured goods for export to their home country either from wholesale markets or directly from factories in the Pearl River Delta. Many of these traders have become long-term residents of China, often with families; quite a few of them have become very wealthy. Others operate more on the margins, searching for the deal that will make them rich too. Many of the latter either reside in China illegally, or else shuttle back and forth between China and Africa on tourist visas. In Africa, there is a thriving market for migration brokers who help prospective immigrants gain entry to China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0097700411424564">14</xref></sup> Many new immigrants end up at the margins, taking up illegal employment or petty crime; some, disenchanted with China, hope to earn enough money to pay a Chinese broker to smuggle them into Europe or North America.</p>

<title>Chinese Return Migrants</title>
<p>In government policy, students and scholars abroad (<italic>liuxue renyuan</italic>) are kept completely separate from the overseas Chinese, despite the fact that they are often lumped together under the heading of the “new migrants” (<italic>xin yimin</italic>) and that the state’s overseas Chinese office (Qiaoban) is formally responsible for both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0097700411424564">Nyiri, 2010</xref>). The latter leave China predominantly from rural areas, are unskilled, and in a very real sense deemed superfluous in China itself. Their return is not a priority. The same cannot be said about Chinese students and scholars abroad. This category of migrants is the object of intense scrutiny and interest: their leaving is considered a loss to China that can only be repaired by their eventual return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0097700411424564">Cheng Li, 2005</xref>: 79). Since 1978, the government has embarked on increasingly liberal policies toward study and long-term and short-term academic visits abroad. Large numbers of academics, postgraduate and undergraduate students, and more recently, even high school or primary school students have availed themselves of the opportunity. The accumulated number of foreign students and scholars abroad in the eleven years between 1996 and 2006 was 1,067,000, of whom 275,000 have returned to China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0097700411424564">Wang Huiyao, 2007</xref>: 7). The overwhelming majority of students and scholars that return do so to Shanghai, Beijing, and southern Jiangsu. Shanghai alone accounted for a full one third of all returnees, or 50,000, by 2002, with Beijing not far behind at 40,000 by 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0097700411424564">Cheng Li, 2005</xref>: 90).</p>
<p>Returnees are very prominent among academics and senior administrators in higher education and research institutions, especially the more prestigious and better funded ones. National and local governments and university administrations strongly encourage students and scholars abroad to return to China to take up academic employment, encouraging them with a range of privileges and perks (salary, housing, research funds) regardless of foreign permanent residence status or even citizenship. This has led to considerable tension between what are called the “sea turtles” (<italic>haigui pai</italic>) and “locals” (<italic>bentu pai</italic>), although at least some of these privileges may seem more extreme than they might actually be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0097700411424564">Luo, Fei, and Huang, 2003</xref>). However, the strong drive to build “world class universities” made this an unequal contest, and, as Rosen and Zweig conclude, “the battle is over and the returnees have ‘won’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0097700411424564">Rosen and Zweig, 2005</xref>: 128; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0097700411424564">Zweig, Chen, and Rosen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Returnees in China are a new and growing elite group drawn from upwardly mobile middle-class families, while relatively few members derive from the old political elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0097700411424564">Cheng Li, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0097700411424564">Saxenian, 2005</xref>). Their impact on Chinese society extends beyond the world of universities and research. Chinese administrations actively recruit among overseas graduates and scholars and encourage them to set up businesses or contribute their knowledge, skills, and patents to partnerships with Chinese businesses. To woo potential investors, governments frequently organize conventions or fairs, creating what Xiang Biao has called an elaborate “ritual economy of ‘talent’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0097700411424564">Xiang, 2008</xref>). Saxenian’s study shows how Chinese engineers and entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley have accelerated the development of the information technology sector in China. These business people have transferred technical and institutional know-how much faster and more effectively than local entrepreneurs or large corporations working on their own would have been able to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0097700411424564">Saxenian, 2005</xref>). As China’s affluence grows in the years to come, more and more Chinese professionals and business people will be attracted to the opportunities that their home country has to offer. The majority of highly educated professional Chinese may currently still choose to stay abroad. However, they are a huge talent pool that China will be able to draw on in the years to come.</p>

<title>Cross-Border Migrants</title>
<p>China’s international borders no longer divide and separate. North Korea provides perhaps the clearest example. The famine there in the late 1990s led to a flood of emigrants into China. Chinese accounts strenuously resist the label “refugee” here, which would be highly embarrassing given the government’s continuing support of North Korea’s regime, quite apart from the more general issue of China’s continued commitment to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs. The North Korean influx led to several diplomatic incidents when North Koreans who had made it to Beijing entered the South Korean embassy, Korean schools, or buildings of international organizations seeking asylum in third countries. The PRC government has treated these Koreans as illegal entrants and has little sympathy for them. In 2002, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reported massive roundups, detentions, and repatriations of North Koreans, and a crackdown on religious and human rights groups that assisted them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700411424564">Human Rights Watch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0097700411424564">“China: Crackdown,” 2002</xref>). The issue is made more complex because of the large ethnically Korean population that lives in China just across the border from North Korea. Many North Koreans were taken into rural Korean households and even were irregularly registered as members of these households by the local authorities. In addition, North Korean women were trafficked for marriage across China, reportedly for a price of about 10,000 yuan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0097700411424564">Li and Gu, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>China’s border areas are becoming part of larger cross-border regions defined by complex relationships of co-ethnicity, religion, legal trade and illegal smuggling, marriage, employment, study, immigration and emigration, crime, and (particularly in the case of Xinjiang) terrorism (on the last, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0097700411424564">Cui, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700411424564">Hao, 2002</xref>). In Yunnan, the limits of the bounded nation-state are perhaps tested most clearly. For centuries, Yunnan has been a frontier area that was as much a part of Southeast Asia as of China proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700411424564">Fitzgerald, 1972</xref>, chaps. 3 and 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700411424564">Giersch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0097700411424564">Guo, 2008</xref>). Inhabited by a rich variety of Chinese, partially Chinese, and non-Chinese groups, Yunnan and the northern parts of Burma, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand are an area where cultures and polities meet, clash, interact, and mingle, and where states struggle to extend their reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0097700411424564">Scott, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Today probably more than at any other time since the establishment of the PRC, people living close to the border continue to maintain contact with their relatives and co-ethnics and move freely across the border, with or without a permit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0097700411424564">Sturgeon, 2005</xref>). One particular issue that concerns local authorities is the inflow of women from the other side of the border as wives either for local co-ethnic men or, increasingly, Han Chinese men (on the latter, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0097700411424564">Grillot, 2010</xref>). These women and their children are permanent members of their communities in China, yet have no legal status and are a major headache locally in the enforcement of state family planning. In general, the province continues a policy of lenient border management and a strict approach to in-country foreigners, such as a crackdown and expulsion of illegal foreigners in 1994–1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0097700411424564">He, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700411424564">Jing, 2003</xref>: 61). The leniency in border control has facilitated cross-border traffic both in and out of China, and a considerable economic and social integration has been the result. This integration has been much encouraged since 2002 by China’s accession to the WTO and the process of the creation of the China–ASEAN Free Trade Area and associated infrastructural projects such as the Kunming–Bangkok highway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0097700411424564">Liu Zhi, 2006</xref>). However, traffic and trade have also created space for illegal activities. Drug, gun, and people smuggling into and out of China have become major problems, made worse by ethnic and religious factors and further facilitated by money laundering and financing provided by underground brokers and banks. Furthermore, effective bilateral cooperation with the governments of neighboring countries does not exist, and coordination is often limited to individual counties or government bureaus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0097700411424564">15</xref></sup> Northern Burma in the 1990s became a highly popular tourist destination when enterprising Chinese opened a string of casinos just across the border. After a crackdown by the Chinese authorities in 2003, some casinos adapted by branching out into trans-border Internet gambling, a problem that continues to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0097700411424564">Kurlantzick, 2007</xref>: 148–51; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0097700411424564">Zheng, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A well-researched article on the foreign population in Yunnan by He Yue of Yunnan Normal University presents a detailed picture of the current situation. The long history of cross-border links coupled with the recent surge in China’s opening up have created a highly diverse foreign population in the province. Traders from Burma, often with ancestral links in Yunnan, sell jewels and precious stones in the trading centers along the Burmese–Chinese border. Similarly, small traders from ethnic groups that reside on both sides of the border buy and sell agricultural products or small merchandise. Some of these traders have bought a house or land in Yunnan and have become a very visible presence in border cities; for instance, Ruili city alone has more than 500 Burmese traders. In addition, seasonal workers from Burma and Vietnam come to Yunnan in search of work. All three groups of trans-border migrants have traveled farther inland to Yunnan’s capital Kunming or the province’s main tourist sites in search of business or work, as a rule without proper permits. As a result, the composition of these irregular (<italic>san fei</italic>) foreign migrants is relatively straightforward in border areas as they are mainly from the other side of the border, but becomes more complex farther inland. Farther away from the border, migrants can no longer rely on their relations with kin and co-ethnics residing immediately across the border. As a result, relationships between migrants themselves based on residential concentration, kinship, ethnicity, or nationality become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700411424564">He, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>“Fortune Seekers” and Problems of Immigration</title>
<p>As some of the examples given above already show, neatly dividing foreign immigrants into the categories of “students,” “traders,” “businesspeople,” “professionals,” and “cross-border migrants” hardly exhausts the reality on the ground. Migrants are highly enterprising and proactive in exploring the opportunities China has to offer, and there is very considerable overlap and spill-over between all of these categories as a result. From the perspective of the Chinese authorities and many of the authors whose work I have drawn on, the dynamic nature of migration has created a further category of immigrant that does not come to China for bona fide business, study, or employment, but opportunistically in search of wealth or survival. Such “fortune seekers” (<italic>taojinzhe</italic>, literally “gold panners”), do not bring any skills or capital to China, and “many are people from poor countries without a profession, income, skills, or health guarantee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007a</xref>: 60). In short, these migrants are deemed not to come to China to contribute to its modernization, but merely to take advantage of the country’s new prosperity.</p>
<p>The first “fortune seekers” to come to China in the 1990s were the Vietnamese and North Koreans, dubbed “one south and one north” (<italic>yi nan yi bei</italic>), but the phenomenon has now become much more diverse, including an increasing number of foreigners for whom China serves as a springboard. After having been taken to China, these migrants work there for a while saving money and looking for a snakehead that can take them to Europe or North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0097700411424564">Li and Gu, 2006</xref>). Filipinos are another example of immigrants deemed to be “fortune seekers.” Among richer and upwardly mobile Chinese families, Filipino domestic workers and home tutors have become increasingly common. These families want their children to learn English to give them better opportunities in school, university, and later in life and employ Filipinos for this purpose. This practice is particularly widespread in Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Beijing and most likely has entered China from Hong Kong or Taiwan, where Filipino domestic workers have long been common. However, fortune-seeking illegal migrants are not limited to poor national or ethnic groups. For instance, one other example of fortune seekers given repeatedly is young Westerners who use their student status for residence purposes only. They make a living masquerading as foreign experts or scholars, giving English language classes or lectures about Western culture, society, and business to gullible Chinese audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007c</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>In fact, almost every group of immigrants in China is internally stratified, having both highly successful professionals and businesspeople (although some of these might in fact not have full and proper paperwork either, a point that I will return to) and more marginal groups without formal jobs or fully registered businesses. Instead, new immigrants rely on their own resources and personal contacts, causing the growth of residentially concentrated urban “villages” (<italic>cun</italic>) or “cities” (<italic>cheng</italic>) of foreigners, such as the Burmese and Vietnamese in Guangxi and the South Koreans in Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007a</xref>: 60). Here we see the beginnings of the “ethnic enclave” pattern of immigrant settlement found among many immigrant groups the world over, where the institutional infrastructure and employment offered by a co-ethnic community provide new arrivals with the chance to get established and ultimately become successful too.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0097700411424564">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their discussions on fortune seekers and illegal immigrants, Chinese authors often conclude that such migrants do not deserve the courtesies extended to foreigners, partially as a leftover of the time that all foreigners in China were “foreign guests” (<italic>waibin</italic>) and partially because China needs their “talent” and contribution, but should rather be considered similar to the “floating population” (<italic>liudong renkou</italic>) of domestic rural–urban migrants. Foreign fortune seekers allegedly compete with China’s own huge labor force for jobs. The “foreign floating population” (variously termed <italic>jingwai liudong renkou</italic>, <italic>waiguo liudong renkou</italic>, or <italic>waiguo liudong renyuan</italic>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700411424564">He, 2009</xref>) is cause of increasing concern, but, as China’s immigration policies still remain unformed, at the moment is dealt with mainly as a public order issue. Local police in places with many foreigners periodically carry out crackdowns on illegal foreigners, leading to fines, detentions, and even expulsions without providing a more structural solution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0097700411424564">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increasingly, the problem of the “foreign blind flow” (<italic>waiguo mangliu</italic>) is directly connected with that of the “three illegalities” (<italic>san fei</italic>) of illegal entry, residence, and work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700411424564">Du, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700411424564">Huang Jin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700411424564">Zhuang, 2007b</xref>). As in all countries, it is by its very nature impossible to quantify exactly how serious the issue of foreign illegality is, but it is certain that it has rapidly increased, and is concentrated in China’s large metropolitan areas. In 2007, the head of the Jiangsu province border exit and entry bureau estimated that 30% of resident foreigners in the province were illegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0097700411424564">Zhuang, 2007a</xref>). In 2006, the Ministry of Public Security handled 36,000 <italic>san fei</italic> cases and repatriated 9,560 foreigners. In the city of Guangzhou, the public security bureau estimates that about 10,000 foreigners reside illegally. In 2006, this city alone dealt with more than 3,900 <italic>san fei</italic> cases, or 11% of the national total, while Beijing handled 4,806 cases, or 13%, leading to 339 repatriations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700411424564">Zhuang, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>In many Chinese analyses, the three illegalities and the foreign floating population are often discussed together with many other much more serious problems, including terrorism, organized and petty crime, drinking, drugs and violence, prostitution, and unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700411424564">Du, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700411424564">Hao, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0097700411424564">Qi, 2009</xref>), a list that is depressingly similar to observations on immigration in Western countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0097700411424564">18</xref></sup> Crime in particular is singled out. In Yunnan, along the Burmese border, foreigners and Chinese are involved in large-scale organized crime, including the smuggling of drugs and consumer goods, human smuggling, kidnapping, extortion, and murder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0097700411424564">Song, Yang, and Dong, 2001</xref>). Despite a step-up in law enforcement, crime in these areas is reported to have become more serious because of increasing population mobility, economic development, a lack of international cooperation, and ethnic and religious factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0097700411424564">Hu, 2007</xref>). In the city of Guangzhou crime by foreign “floaters” constitutes an increasing proportion of crime among domestic and foreign floaters put together, a “hidden danger” (<italic>yinhuan</italic>) to public order in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700411424564">Du, 2008</xref>: 165; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007c</xref>: 26). Perhaps the strongest statement is given in a 2002 article on underworld crime, where an explicit link is made between the rise of the market economy and associated corruptibility of local governments, immigration and population mobility, and underworld (<italic>hei shehui</italic>) crime:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some areas and departments simply proceed from economic profit, opening up the approval and management of all kinds of capital inflow and enterprise investment, they provide legal shelter for the infiltration of the foreign underworld, and establish [the conditions for] underworld crime to propagate and develop. . . . Population mobility and foreigners are an important cause of the formation and spread of underworld crime. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0097700411424564">Li Xihai, 2002</xref>: 102–3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the fact that illegality and crime are often mentioned together and a link is assumed to exist between fortune seeking, illegality, and at least some forms of criminality, most authors agree that the lack of compliance with China’s regulations regarding foreign entry, employment, and residence should be separated from more serious law enforcement issues (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0097700411424564">Jiang and Xu, 2007</xref>). The illegality of many foreigners in China often has to do more with the lack of appropriate regulation, the continued restrictions on travel and other activities by foreigners, and a general lack of expertise and coordination within those branches of the administration that are responsible for foreigners. Even many professional and business migrants, the kind of people China says it wants, either have no choice but to bend the rules in order to live and work in China, or else have little incentive to comply with the regulations. An early article, for instance, points out that foreigners often do not want a work permit quite simply because that would make them liable to taxation in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0097700411424564">Lu, 1998</xref>). With its entry to the WTO in 2002, China also signed up to the principle that foreigners in China are entitled to the same treatment as Chinese citizens. Quite apart from the fact that this in reality still has not been achieved (e.g., many areas are still closed to foreigners), several Chinese sources expressed concern that the illegal status of foreigners in fact prevents the authorities from extending these rights to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0097700411424564">Jiang and Xu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0097700411424564">Wu, Zhang, and Yan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007a</xref>).</p>

<title>Evolution of the Administration of Foreign Entry and Residence</title>
<p>China’s wealth and stability have made it an attractive destination not only for skilled professionals and businesspeople from developed countries but also for people without immediately marketable skills, many (but by no means all) of whom come from countries poorer than China itself. This has already sparked large inflows that in many cases have led to the growth of residentially concentrated ethnic communities. As a result, China is beginning to be confronted with issues that other destination countries have grappled with for much longer, yet it still lacks a clear legal and administrative framework and apparatus to deal with the entry, residence, and employment of foreigners. At the moment, administrative responsibilities are scattered over numerous departments, such as public security, foreign affairs, human resources, foreign experts, commerce, and education. These departments not only do not work together, because each takes responsibility for only certain categories of foreigners (diplomats, experts, workers, businesspeople and investors, students, seafarers), but also even compete for turf and influence.</p>
<p>The vast majority of foreigners, even long-term residents, hold visas valid for at most a few years, while many simply move in and out of the country every few months to get a new visitor’s visa or stay in China illegally. It is even more difficult to obtain work permits, particularly for foreigners who are self-employed or work for employers other than foreign-invested firms or state organizations. In response, in China’s large cities a thriving market in visas and work permits has sprung up that are irregularly obtained by specialist travel agencies or “visa boys”; in fact, many employers and employees in China do not even bother with the bureaucratic maze around formal applications at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0097700411424564">19</xref></sup> Public security bureaus are to a certain extent supposed to be responsible for coordination, but even here specialized exit and entry management offices only exist relatively high up the hierarchy. Even in Shanghai, only eight of the nineteen county/district-level public security bureaus had a special section for exit and entry management. In the other eleven bureaus, this task still was the responsibility of the national security section, whose main work consisted of both public and covert operations of an entirely different nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700411424564">Ding and Yang, 2007</xref>: 72). The frequently proposed solution for this problem is to devolve the management of the immigration of foreigners more fully to specialist personnel at local police stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700411424564">Huang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0097700411424564">Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0097700411424564">Min, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0097700411424564">Shen Huizhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0097700411424564">Zeng, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the moment policy is still anything but uniform. This is especially clear in cities such as Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, or Yiwu where concentrations of foreigners prove hard to penetrate and manage using the traditional system of neighborhood committees (<italic>juweihui</italic>), combined with direct monitoring by the local people’s police (<italic>minjing</italic>). These places are now often given the status of “foreign communities” (<italic>shewai shequ</italic>, or <italic>guoji[hua] shequ</italic>). In such areas, the local police may consider handing over much of the responsibility for the registration of foreigners to the real estate companies that own or manage the apartment blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700411424564">Fang, 2006</xref>: 114), for instance through regular liaison meetings of property owners, housing agents, government departments, and police. Conversely, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700411424564">Fang Yan (2006)</xref>, the police should be given the means to strengthen the registration of foreigners and link this information with other government departments. Police could also link this with crime and terrorism databases in order to discover people from key “anti-terrorism countries” and “elements of illegal religions” or the underworld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0097700411424564">Wang Qi, 2008</xref>). In addition, in some of these places special foreigners’ services stations (<italic>waiguoren guanli fuwu zhan</italic>) or foreign affairs services stations (<italic>waishi guanli fuwu zhan</italic>) have recently been created that combine some of the services of, for instance, the local police, water and electricity departments, property management companies, and housing agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700411424564">Fang, 2006</xref>: 112; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0097700411424564">Zhongguo Guangzhou, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0097700411424564">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>China also faces a more fundamental policy gap. Currently, immigration in China is mainly regulated by three sets of laws and regulations: the Law on Control of the Entry and Exit of Aliens and the Law on Control of Exit and Entry of Citizens,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0097700411424564">21</xref></sup> both promulgated in 1985; the Rules for the Administration of Employment of Foreigners in China of 1996; and, lastly, the Regulations on Examination and Approval of Permanent Residence of Aliens in China of 2004. In addition, a large number of more specific national and local regulations and rules exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0097700411424564">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the management of foreign immigration, the creation of a separate Border Exit and Entry Management Bureau (Churujing guanli ju) within the Ministry of Public Security in 1983, followed by the promulgation of the 1985 law on the entry and exit of aliens were somewhat of a watershed. They signaled a public move away from an exclusionary discourse and the recognition that the presence of foreigners was a normal aspect of social life that had to be regulated by law rather than politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0097700411424564">Zhongguo jingcha xuehui, 2003</xref>: 2, 8, 14–15). In the 1990s, this new normalizing discourse gradually evolved into the perception that China, in order to fulfill its modernizing ambitions, needs specific skills, knowledge, and expertise from foreign talents, ultimately leading to the 1996 regulations on the employment of foreigners. Foreigners were still at least somewhat special, but no longer constituted a politically marked category of people. The next step in the process of gradual normalization of a foreign presence was the recognition that foreigners are there to stay. This led to the regulations on permanent residence of aliens in 2004, a policy modeled on the American green card system. However, the regulations on permanent residence are very strictly applied and such residence is reportedly mainly given to ethnic Chinese, mostly as part of a broader policy initiative to turn China’s brain drain since 1978 into a brain and capital gain. Permanent residence of foreigners is still treated as the exception rather than a normal aspect of a modern society. For instance, according to the Yunnan Province Foreign Experts Office, in 2010 nobody in the province held permanent residence, although the office very recently had started to assist with the application by a few of its long-term experts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0097700411424564">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As my Chinese sources readily admit, much of the current regulatory framework is already outdated, while the many existing laws, rules, and regulations of individual government departments and local administrations are not integrated. Particularly the 1996 regulations on foreign employment need to be replaced as they are still rooted in the perception that the employment of foreigners is temporary and needed only to fulfill specific skill and expertise requirements. New legislation will have to be based on the recognition that foreign employment in China is a permanent feature, including employment with small private enterprises and private individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0097700411424564">Zhang Jie, 2007b</xref>: 112). Another much debated issue is that of dual nationality, which China’s current nationality law does not allow. This issue is particularly important in dealing with Chinese return migrants, many of whom have acquired a foreign nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0097700411424564">Zhou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0097700411424564">Qi, 2009</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>At the moment, however, policy making is progressing only at a snail’s pace despite earlier indications to the contrary. Discussions at a meeting at Shantou University in 2008, for instance, suggested that work on a new entry and exit management law and a migration law was well underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0097700411424564">Qi, 2009</xref>). In April 2010, a revision was indeed published of the rules of the management law of foreigners’ border exit and entry, but this is still a far cry from an integrated new law that deals with all aspects of international migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0097700411424564">“Waiguoren churu,” 2010</xref>). Also in 2010, as we have seen earlier in this article, the national census for the first time included foreign residents. However, during my research visit to China in June 2010 several informants independently said that work on a migration law was only at the initial phase and that it would be many years before it would see the light of day. Despite apparent setbacks, a general agreement continues to exist on the need for a new comprehensive migration law and the establishment of either an immigration office separate from the ministries or even a ministry of interior affairs, or else the appointment of a senior member of the State Council responsible for immigration affairs. However, the political impetus behind such a change has clearly waned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0097700411424564">24</xref></sup> Apart from competition between departments currently in charge of aspects of foreigners’ work, the political sensitivity of immigration is also frequently given as a reason for the lack of change. Creating a comprehensive immigration policy and administration would amount to stating publicly that China is becoming an immigration country, which, it is feared, would encounter widespread popular and administrative resistance. China still sees itself as defined by its huge population, and policies in many areas are still predicated on or justified by that fact. What would people think, for instance, if foreigners were freely allowed to live and work in China when so many local workers and university graduates still cannot find a job? And, most contentious of all, what about family planning? Would it be possible to continue to limit Chinese couples to just one child when the government openly adopts a pro-immigration policy?</p>
<p>These arguments amount to a version specific to contemporary China of a problem that currently is almost universal across immigration countries. Immigration is economically beneficial yet politically explosive, frequently leading, as Stephen Castles points out, to “hidden agendas” in migration policies. Governments prefer either not to make any policy at all, or, alternatively, adopt formally restrictive policies or rhetoric while allowing immigration to continue through other measures or even simply turning a blind eye toward illegal immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0097700411424564">Castles, 2004</xref>: 867; for a similar conclusion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0097700411424564">Cornelius and Tsuda, 2004</xref>: 41–42).</p>
<p>Beyond the narrow issues of entry and employment, China will also have to find ways of dealing with a permanent foreign presence. As ethnic communities of foreigners based on common nationality, race, language, religion, or culture are beginning to grow, China is more obviously becoming an immigration country rather than a place where foreigners happen to live. With this, China, like other immigration countries, will have to find ways of permanently integrating these communities, dealing with questions of ethnic and race relations, religious and cultural pluralism, nationality and political rights, and the emergence of a second generation in ways it never faced before.</p>
<p>The awareness of these issues is growing in the administration. At a conference on the management of foreigners’ affairs in Beijing in 2006, the head of the Beijing Municipal Foreign Affairs Office observed that new policy will be based on the recognition that “foreign communities are an integral part of urban society, much as internal migration has become intrinsic to the process of modernization.” She continued that foreigners are an intrinsic part of the city’s population and will be “managed on the basis of their individual or social identity and not their work status.” Moreover, “the management of the external population should be included in the setup for the work of the [domestic] floating population in the whole city” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0097700411424564">“Beijing shi,” 2007</xref>). However, including international migrants in the category of domestic migrants might not in fact be in the interest of foreigners or their integration in society. Internal migration, too, remains a developing policy area. Internal migrants still are conceptualized as the “floating population” and have great difficulty being accepted as full members of the urban population. Although this is very likely to change now that China has firmly committed itself to out-migration and urbanization as a key component of the modernization of rural China, internal migration policy alone can as yet hardly serve as a satisfactory policy template for foreign migration.</p>
<p>Yiwu city’s approach might give some indication where future policy in practice might go. Yiwu proudly presents itself as a laboratory for managing the peaceful co-residence of a multitude of visitors from elsewhere in China and abroad. In 2003, a city-wide video surveillance system was completed to help the police keep crime and conflict under control, while streamlined visa and residence procedures aim to facilitate the steady stream of foreign and domestic visitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0097700411424564">Weng, 2006</xref>). Yiwu explicitly aims at the “integration in the community” (<italic>rongru shequ</italic>) and the creation of a “second home area” (<italic>di er guxiang</italic>) with the objectives of treating foreigners as citizens, fighting and preventing crime and other illegal activities, and encouraging “Chinese and foreign families [to] enjoy a natural bond like members of one family” (<italic>Zhongwai jiating tong xiang tianlun</italic>). To this aim, Yiwu experiments with an interesting mix of measures. The city allows selected foreigners to observe the city’s People’s Congress and People’s Consultative Conference and gives them the opportunity to raise suggestions during special feedback meetings. Yiwu also has equipped special stations at the administrative community (<italic>shequ</italic>) level for residence and visa formalities. Foreigners are involved in the running of certain test-point administrative communities where they live, Chinese language training stations have been set up for foreigners, and their children are given the right to attend local schools. They are also given the same rights as Chinese in business and financial transactions, and have freedom to practice their religion. Special cultural activities are organized to promote Chinese and foreign understanding and friendship. Information networks have been set up with the participation of heads of residential blocks, landlords, personnel of associations, public security cadres, and local people’s police to prevent and fight crime by and against foreigners. Lastly, Yiwu aims its policies mostly at the administrative community level and seeks to concentrate its foreign population even more in those communities that already have a high concentration of foreigners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0097700411424564">Li Zhiqiang, 2006</xref>). Inspiration for these measures seems to have been drawn from several different sources. Empowerment, recognition of equal rights, government service provision, and policing are part of a modern approach based largely on foreign templates. Conversely, celebration of cultural difference and friendship are more reminiscent of China’s older minority and “foreign friends” policies. Lastly, residential concentration and indirect administration through community leaders might be an echo of more specifically Chinese preferences in dealing with internal migrants in pre-1949 Chinese cities.</p>
<p>China still does not possess the regulatory framework and administrative capacity fully to deal with large-scale immigration, and the next few years are likely to be a window of debate and policy making that will determine what kind of immigration country China will become. Currently, the trend is toward a more integrated approach that facilitates the entry and stay of foreigners. The recognition that foreigners are there to stay also comes with the necessity to cater to their needs, such as education for their children and the right to profess their religion in churches, mosques, or temples. However, the normalization of immigration also means that foreign residents are only entitled to the rights that Chinese citizens enjoy as well, and should no longer get an especially privileged treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0097700411424564">Xu, 2008</xref>). Yet in certain respects, the normalization of immigration will continue to be less than straightforward as it touches on some politically very sensitive issues. In these areas, foreigners are still treated on the basis of the old exclusionary discourse as carriers of subversive influences that may harm Chinese society and even the rule of the CCP. The most important example here is possibly religion. In 1994, the State Council issued the Rules on the Management of Religious Activities of Foreigners in the People’s Republic of China, which give them the right to conduct collective religious activities in specially designated locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700411424564">Guojia zongjiao shiwu ju, 1994</xref>). However, importation of religious materials that could be used to spread religion in China is explicitly forbidden. Moreover, in their implementation of the rules, local religious affairs authorities ban Chinese citizens from attending religious activities organized by foreigners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700411424564">Ao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0097700411424564">Zhu, 2008</xref>). It seems unlikely that this lingering sensitivity to foreign subversion will disappear completely. In addition, as we have seen, a new perception is emerging that not all of immigration is necessarily a good thing. The growth of a “foreign floating population” is considered a burden on Chinese society, while immigration is also associated with terrorism, subversion, and international organized crime. As a result, an increasing emphasis on control and national security in addition to service and equal treatment is to be expected.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At present, China continues to be one of the world’s most important sources of emigrants. Chinese are fanning out across the globe, contributing to economic growth in their destination countries and the development and globalization of China’s own economy and society. There is little doubt that China will continue to play this role for at least the next ten years, and quite possibly even longer. Developed countries have little reason for immediate worry about the supply, or migration “pipeline,” of migrant labor, without which their population would peak in 2020 and fall by 7% in the next three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0097700411424564">UNDP, 2009</xref>: 43). However, international migration specialists are already beginning to think about what happens next, when “China, India and South East Asia could well become massive players in the international migration system with relatively little ‘notice’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0097700411424564">Papademetriou, 2008</xref>: 6; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0097700411424564">Hugo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0097700411424564">Skeldon, 2008</xref>). The competition for migrant labor seems set to become a key international concern in the years to come.</p>
<p>This article has given a glimpse of that future. As we have seen, China’s prosperity and opportunity are already attracting a diverse range of immigrants as the country is developing into the center of gravity of the whole of East, Southeast, and Central Asia. The current global recession is bound to bring out future shifts in international migration in even sharper relief as China and India continue their robust growth, while the traditional developed countries are still struggling with sluggish or negative growth and high unemployment. At present, most immigrants in China are highly skilled professionals and business people. However, we have also found evidence of rapid diversification, as immigrants from a much greater variety of backgrounds and countries find their way to China. With the increase in the number and diversity of immigrants, China is beginning to face the formation of more permanent immigrant communities, many of which are residentially clustered and occupationally specialized. Their impact on China’s existing cultural, regional, and occupational diversity will have considerable repercussions for the kind of country China will be ten or twenty years from now.</p>

<p>This seems to be true even in Beijing, where most foreign and international organizations have their offices. A small sample survey of registered foreign workers in the city gives indications of clear differences in attitude toward work and life between expatriate and long-term resident foreigners.

<p>The association of foreigners with violations of public order resonates strongly with popular images, and of course with the CCP’s traditional suspicion of foreign subversion and spiritual pollution.

<p>This observation on a black market in visas is based on my own informal conversations with foreign residents in Beijing over the past few years.

<p>In June 2010, I visited this foreigners’ service station and did indeed find it to be adequately set up to deal with the large foreign (mainly ethnic Chinese) presence in this exclusive neighborhood, although the emphasis was still much more on police work than other forms of service.
