<abstract>
<p>This large urban health unit identified a need for explicit, strategic, long-term organizational priority toward practical application of evidence in health promotion practice. Becoming a Best Practice Spotlight Organization (BPSO®) candidate provided an opportunity to systematically implement this commitment. The primary goals were to support incorporation of evidence-informed practice throughout the organization, increase interprofessional collaboration, and provide opportunities for knowledge exchange for staff. A mixed-methods evaluation consisting of three phases, including an analysis of previous evaluations, a survey of Champions, and an online focus group with the Steering Committee, demonstrated very positive outcomes. Staff reported increased incorporation of evidence in practice and program delivery. Collaboration and consultation amongst interdisciplinary staff across program areas also increased and staff responded very positively to increased opportunities for knowledge exchange. BPSO® candidacy opportunities should be used by health organizations to increase evidence-informed practice and inspire excellence in health promotion practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although public health practitioners have a history of using evidence and evaluation to inform health promotion practice, the ever-increasing volume of evidence and changing landscape of health promotion have led to demand for new knowledge, skills, tools and supports. Despite new evidence being available, uptake is sometimes slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912461274">Cabana et al., 1999</xref>) and resistance to change is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912461274">Lyons &amp; Warner, 2005</xref>). The adoption of evidence into decision making is influenced by a variety of characteristics related to the individual, organization, and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912461274">National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, 2012</xref>). Supporting professionals as they implement evidence in practice is important to improve client outcomes and may lead to more cost-efficient interventions, appropriate use of scarce resources, and improved client satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912461274">Edwards &amp; Grinspun, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This large urban health unit identified a need for a strategic, long-term organizational priority toward practical application of evidence in health promotion practice. The health unit was selected to be a Best Practice Spotlight Organization (BPSO®) Candidate with the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO), to implement and evaluate RNAO’s Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs) in their health promotion programs. RNAO’s BPGs are developed by expert teams of professionals and provide comprehensive practice recommendations based on the best available research. Key aspects of the partnership included collaboration with researchers and academia, use of Champions or “opinion leaders” and learning and development of staff.</p>
<p>Evidence-informed decision making involves individuals adopting the evidence within their organizational context. Managerial leadership is important to the success of an adoption and diffusion process to influence nurses’ use of research evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912461274">Gifford, Davies, Edwards, Griffin, &amp; Lybanon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912461274">Rogers’s (1962)</xref> <italic>diffusion</italic> theory described the process by which innovation is communicated over time, outlining strategies to help innovation reach the critical mass stage, one of which is to have the innovation adopted by highly respected individuals. Rogers described these “early adopters” as individuals who have a high degree of “opinion leadership.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912461274">Valente and Pumpuang (2007)</xref> suggested that opinion leaders could help accelerate the diffusion, act as gatekeepers for interventions, help change social norms, and accelerate behavior change.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912461274">Kent, Hutchinson, and Fineout-Overholt (2009)</xref> described that knowledge that is being transferred effectively is usually iterative and requires organizations to make changes and embed them in their learning strategies and policies. Iterative knowledge translation can be enabled with the use of Champions as they are situated with staff within district teams.</p>
<p>Champions as opinion leaders are an effective strategy to incorporate evidence into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912461274">Flodgren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912461274">Ploeg et al., 2010</xref>). Champions support and spread innovation, form networks and motivate others to adopt best practices and iteratively transfer knowledge after formal learning sessions, as it is required. Champions are “persuasive practice leaders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912461274">Ploeg et al., 2010</xref>, p. 245) who are “respected and sought for their expertise in clinical knowledge by their peers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912461274">Pearson, Field, &amp; Jordan, 2007</xref>, p. 129). They are the “informal leaders” who are committed to influencing and accelerating the adoption of new ideas and approaches, as well as to promoting the use of evidence and reduction of noncompliance with desired practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912461274">Ploeg et al., 2010</xref>, p. 239).</p>
<p>Champions encourage integration of best practice in organizations to achieve higher quality of client outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912461274">Ploeg et al., 2010</xref>). Key roles of Champions are multidimensional, their tasks ranging from supporting and mentoring their peers to developing policy.</p>
<p>Evaluation can effectively build programs that are both accountable and strive for continuous improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912461274">Compton, Baizerman, &amp; VeLure Roholt, 2010</xref>). Becoming a BPSO® candidate provided a way to implement and evaluate BPGs systematically to support the use of evidence in design and delivery of health promotion programs. The goals were to support incorporation of evidence-informed practice throughout the organization, increase interprofessional collaboration, and provide opportunities for knowledge exchange.</p>
<p>A Steering Committee guided the project and facilitated sharing among teams. The Chief Nursing Officer enabled establishment of a project lead, a full-time BPSO® Coordinator and Evaluation Consultant. Five BPGs were selected for implementation and evaluation based on the strength of these guidelines and the potential impact they could have on health promotion practice. Each BPG team implemented and evaluated a variety of the recommendations from their guideline. The BPGs selected were</p>
<list id="list1-1524839912461274" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Primary Prevention of Childhood Obesity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Enhancing Healthy Adolescent Development</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Integration of Smoking Cessation into Daily Nursing Practice</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Woman Abuse: Screening, Identification, and Initial Response</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interventions for Postpartum Depression (PPD)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An enthusiastic cadre of Champions was recruited from several program areas and disciplines. Each BPG team involved their champions in a variety of ways in the implementation of their BPG, from Champion meetings and updates to involving them in literature reviews or evaluation efforts. The Champion’s primary responsibility was knowledge transfer and in being an “opinion leader” about their BPG.</p>
<p>Some Champions were also Advanced Clinical Practice Fellows with RNAO during this period. These Champions used focused self-directed learning to assist with best practice guideline implementation and developed clinical leadership skills.</p>
<p>All five BPG teams determined their projects were successful by evaluating interventions implemented from the BPG recommendations. Because of lack of a dedicated evaluator from the outset of the initiative, some evaluation plans for individual BPG teams were confirmed retrospectively, following initial planning and/or implementation of the BPG. The true success of the project, however, was confirmed with an overall evaluation to determine the impact of being a BPSO® candidate on the organization.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The goals of the overall evaluation were to determine the impact of being a BPSO® candidate on the use of evidence, collaboration, and knowledge transfer opportunities for staff. Key evaluation questions included:</p>
<list id="list2-1524839912461274" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Has the use of evidence-informed practice increased within the BPG teams?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Has interprofessional and interprogram collaboration increased within the BPG teams?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In what ways has the BPSO® initiative led to sustained, system-wide changes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What difference does it make to staff and programs to be a BPSO® (i.e., initiating and implementing new ideas, collaboration among directorates, etc.)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do staff perceive the impact of being a BPSO® candidate on organizational reputation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Has being a BPSO® enhanced opportunities for staff growth, training, and development?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have knowledge transfer opportunities and activities increased?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After approved ethical review, a mixed-methods evaluation was implemented in three phases:</p>
<list id="list3-1524839912461274" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Phase 1</italic>: All five individual BPG evaluations differed in terms of methodology depending on the purpose of the particular BPG. Although the five BPGs aimed to assess the impact of the BPSO® on staff practice, each did so to varying degrees and through different methodologies. Using a data extraction form and the evaluation reports from the individual BPG teams, pertinent information that answered evaluation questions was gathered in a systematic and rigorous way. Metrics on number and type of staff trained in each of the BPGs were also collected. To ensure reliability of the data extraction, each report was analyzed by two members of the team, after which the extraction forms were compared and discrepancies resolved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Phase 2</italic>: A retrospective online survey of Champions aimed to further answer the evaluation questions. The survey consisted of closed-ended (i.e., Likert-type scale; <italic>strongly agree</italic> to <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) and open-ended questions. A total of 101 Champions were invited to participate in the questionnaire, which was assessed for face and validity content by the program evaluator in consultation with the evaluation team. Quantitative raw data were entered into SPSS version 18.0. Results were analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Qualitative data were coded and grouped into themes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Phase 3</italic>: The evaluation team systematically extracted and analyzed data from minutes of Steering Committee meetings taking place during the BPSO® candidacy for information that answered the evaluation questions. Preliminary themes from that analysis became the basis for an online focus group among the members of the Steering Committee, allowing a member-check and continued exploration of the themes.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The online focus group was developed within an interactive web forum. Using a focus group guide, questions were posted by the moderator and participants responded. Responses were visible to all participants, who were able to answer as many or as little questions as they wished, and respond to others’ comments. Participants were encouraged to enter the forum and respond frequently. A postpositivist critical realism approach was used to analyze the data from both the minutes as well as the online focus group. Specifically, this means that because of the nature of qualitative research, there is recognition that all observation is fallible, and there is always a potential for bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912461274">Trochim, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For analysis of the minutes and online focus group, inductive content analysis was used to code the responses into themes. Categories and the coding scheme were developed from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912461274">Elo &amp; Kyngas, 2008</xref>). Two separate members of the evaluation team analyzed the themes, which were then corroborated against one another and a list of master themes was compiled.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To answer Evaluation Question 1 (i.e., evidence-informed practice) and Evaluation Question 7 (i.e., knowledge transfer opportunities), knowledge extraction from the five BPG evaluation reports (Phase 1) revealed similar experiences in staff confidence, competence, knowledge, practice, and use of evidence in their practice as a result of the implementation of the BPGs. Sample results for each of the above indices as well as three of the five BPGs are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912461274">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In Phase 2, the Champion survey aimed to further explore Evaluation Question 2 (i.e., collaboration), Evaluation Question 4 (i.e., difference the BPSO® initiative made to staff), Evaluation Question 5 (i.e., organizational reputation), Evaluation Question 6 (i.e., professional development), and Evaluation Question 7 (i.e., knowledge transfer). Champions (<italic>n</italic> = 72) indicated that in addition to enhancing their knowledge and skill, use of evidence, collaboration, knowledge transfer opportunities, and employee satisfaction, the BPSO® initiative also enhanced the reputation of the organization, accountability, organizational capacity, and client services. The majority of Champions either strongly agreed or agreed that as a result of implementing the BPGs, they use evidence to inform their practice (85.5%), promote evidence-informed practice (90.3%) and that evidence-informed practice is part of the organizations culture (80.0%). Champions also reported that as a result of the BPSO® candidacy they collaborate more with other professionals (37.7%) and that time, people, or resources are committed to interprofessional collaboration (69.4%).</p>
<p>Champions also reported that they had increased opportunities for professional growth and development as a result of the BPSO® initiative (81.9%). They noted that as a result of the professional development opportunities provided, they had increased motivation, improved morale, and were able to provide better service to clients. Finally, Champions reported that as a result of implementing the BPGs they have transferred their knowledge to their colleagues (80.7%) and that the importance of knowledge transfer is part of the organization’s (84.2%) culture. Champions also mentioned that further defining the Champion role would improve the Champion experience and provide further opportunities.</p>
<p>Most Steering Committee members participated in the online focus group (Phase 3; <italic>n</italic> = 11), where all seven evaluation questions were further explored from a perspective different from the Champions. Eight major themes and eight smaller subthemes emerged from the data. The eight larger themes were:</p>
<list id="list4-1524839912461274" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>design and delivery of programs increasingly becoming evidence-based;</p></list-item>

<p>The eight smaller subthemes fell under three themes. Five of the subthemes were categorized under the theme <italic>organizational change and increased capacity</italic> and were as follows: (a) increased capacity through new programs and projects, (b) increased capacity through policy, (c) increased capacity through building a culture of evaluation, (d) increased capacity through new training, and (e) increased capacity by increasing momentum.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overall evaluation clearly demonstrated positive impact on the organization of being a BPSO® candidate with an observable shift in use of evidence, increased collaboration, and increased knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Health promotion practice must be based on the best available evidence. Initiatives such as the BPSO® candidacy can have a positive impact on uptake and utilization of evidence in organizations. Supporting professionals as they implement clinical practice guidelines can improve patient outcomes. This evaluation clearly demonstrated the benefits extend beyond client outcomes to such metrics as enhanced organizational reputation, improved collaboration, and improved motivation and morale. Consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912461274">Edwards &amp; Grinspun, 2011</xref>), our Champions were indeed opinion leaders who spread innovation and helped in knowledge transfer and collaboration, so critical to the project’s success.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912461274">Kitson, Harvey, and McCormack (1998)</xref> suggested successful implementation of evidence into practice is a function of the interplay of three core elements—the level and nature of the evidence, the context or environment into which the research is to be placed, and the method or way in which the process is facilitated. RNAO’s BPGs provide excellent evidence-informed practice recommendations. The management team provided the supportive environment, and champions provided the expertise, knowledge transfer strategies, and enthusiasm to ensure success.</p>
<p>This shift in practice exemplifies how an innovative approach to program development and evaluation produces positive results for staff culture, which indirectly funnels down to client services. Several recommendations for sustainability and future guideline implementation were developed.</p>
<p>To address evaluation results pertaining to use of evidence, collaboration, the difference the BPSO® candidacy made to staff, professional development, and knowledge transfer, the first recommendation was to strengthen the Champion network by continuing to provide encouragement and professional development opportunities. Where possible, the Champion network will be expanded with recruitment of more Champions to fill in gaps and further integration of Champion model in the organization. This affirmation of this innovative method of knowledge transfer will help to provide Champions with a better defined role.</p>
<p>To address evaluation results pertaining to use of evidence, organizational reputation, and professional development, the second recommendation was to build evaluation capacity for BPG implementation from the outset of the implementation of new BPGs. The three common problems in program evaluation are lack of integration of evaluation into program improvement, lack of an appropriate evaluator, and lack of an evaluation plan prior to implementation of an initiative. Evaluation capacity building for health promotion initiatives implemented will ensure the best possible outcomes, as well as continuous program and organizational improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912461274">Compton et al., 2010</xref>). The building of evaluation capacity in the organization’s staff that occurred in this project will increase the organizations’ ability to evaluate all programs in the future to ensure success.</p>
<p>Last, to address evaluation results pertaining to sustained system-wide changes, the organization will continue to leverage resources for BPSO® sustainability and spread in the future. Facilitators include leadership by champions, management support, ongoing staff education, integration of the guidelines into policies and procedures, staff buy-in and ownership, synergy with partners, and multidisciplinary involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912461274">Davies et al., 2006</xref>). Strategies such as implementation support from a coordinator, policy development, interdirectorate collaboration, and the development a knowledge transfer and dissemination plan are methods that will ensure the benefits of the project are sustained.</p>
<p>Advanced Clinical Practice fellowships further supported implementation of guideline recommendations, enriching both the implementation process and the fellow’s learning. The fellowships were invaluable to best practice guideline implementation, evaluation, and sustainability and will be encouraged in the future.</p>
<p>As a result of lacking a dedicated evaluator from the beginning of the BPSO® candidacy, limitations to the evaluation design must be considered. Limitations included the use of retrospective evaluation as opposed to a pre–post evaluation to answer the key evaluation questions. In addition, even though real-world research has high ecological validity, the lack of a control group limits the ability to fully attribute the changes observed to the treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The overall evaluation demonstrated a measurable difference in a systemic approach to service excellence and a shift toward a culture in which decision making about health promotion service delivery is based on the best evidence possible. As a designated BPSO®, this organization will focus on sustainability and commit to continue the spread of implementation and evaluation of BPGs and mentor new “BPSO® candidate” organizations.</p>
<p>The program’s strategic approach has triggered the development of an evidence-informed culture in health promotion, strengthened clinical practice of all staff directly affected by the initiative, and improved our programs and services to optimize public health system outcomes.</p>
<p>Being a BPSO® candidate is an interactive and integrative approach to embrace excellence, promote collaboration, and support knowledge translation.</p>
