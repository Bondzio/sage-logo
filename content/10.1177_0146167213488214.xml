<abstract>
<p>People often prefer inferior options in the present even when options in the future are more lucrative. Five studies investigated whether decision making could be improved by manipulating construal level and psychological distance. In Studies 1a, 1b, and 2, temporal discounting was reduced when future rewards (trips to Paris) were construed at a relatively concrete level, thus inducing a similar level of construal to present rewards. By contrast, Studies 3 and 4 reduced temporal discounting by making present financial rewards more psychologically distant via a social proximity manipulation, and thus linked to a similar high level of construal as future rewards. These results suggest that people prefer the more lucrative option when comparing two intertemporal choices that are construed on a similar level instead of on a different level. Thus, changes in construal level and mental representations can be used to promote more desirable choices in economic decision making.</p>

<p>Every day we face many decisions, ranging from relatively ordinary choices such as whether to abide by a diet plan or grab a chocolate bar, to life-altering decisions such as whether to take a job offer or continue studying. Important decisions usually require thinking and planning beyond one’s present situation. Indeed, a remarkable function of the human mind is that it allows imagining oneself in a different time and space, or in another person’s position, thus enabling judgments and decisions beyond the self and the present. However, people often make suboptimal decisions, in terms of neoclassical economic theory, when dealing with the self in a future time. Many people prefer a smaller reward now to a large reward next year, and generally value options in the future less even when they are more lucrative than options in the present. This phenomenon is referred to as “temporal discounting,” and the further away the future option, the more it tends to be discounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167213488214">Ainslie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167213488214">Frederick, Loewenstein, &amp; O’Donoghue, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213488214">Green, Fristoe, &amp; Myerson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167213488214">Schelling, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213488214">Thaler &amp; Shefrin, 1981</xref>). Understanding why people discount future options is important because it can help us design strategies to improve intertemporal decision making for better long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>Although several explanations for this behavior have been suggested, our focus is on how different time points are cognitively construed and how manipulating these construals might promote more optimal decision making. Building on Construal Level Theory (CLT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>), we investigate the possibility that more farsighted decisions can be encouraged by making the level of construal across different time points more similar. Usually the present is associated with a concrete, incidental, and situated construal (i.e., low level), whereas the future is associated with an abstract, decontextualized construal (i.e., high level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>), and it may be this difference that drives the discounting of future options. If true, encouraging either (a) the present and the future option to be construed at a low level or (b) the present and the future option to be construed at a high level should result in less future discounting, and therefore more adaptive decisions.</p>
<p>A key aspect of CLT is that it spans many different dimensions of “psychological distance.” Time is one such dimension, and social distance is another: People close to us whom we know well are construed at a relatively low level, whereas people far from us with whom we are less familiar are construed at a relatively high level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213488214">Stephan, Liberman, &amp; Trope, 2011</xref>). Importantly, and in contrast to some earlier work, our thesis is not based on the proposition that one kind of construal (i.e., high level) necessarily is associated with optimal decision making relative to another (i.e., low level). Rather, our aim is to test the possibility that decisions can be enhanced by ensuring that the options are presented at similar levels of construal, whether high or low.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167213488214">
<title>Theoretical Account of Discounting</title>
<p>A number of—not necessarily mutually exclusive—explanations for temporal discounting have been proposed. First, it might occur because the future is uncertain and people prefer certain to uncertain options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213488214">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>): Getting the money now is more certain than getting it in 1 year, because many unforeseeable things might happen in the meantime. Consequently, temporal discounting may be a way to cope with the uncertainty of future rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213488214">Baron, 2000</xref>). Supporting this possibility, evidence suggests that people make more rational choices for certain future events than for hypothetical future events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167213488214">Peters &amp; Büchel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, people may view their present and future selves quite differently. Indeed, one’s future self is often represented in the same way as other people, for example, by attributing more observer-like than actor-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213488214">Pronin &amp; Ross, 2006</xref>), and people often make future decisions as if they were making them for somebody else rather than themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213488214">Pronin, Olivola, &amp; Kennedy, 2008</xref>). Indeed, the more similar people view their current selves to their future selves, the less temporal discounting they show, because a future self as a continuum of the present self appreciates a greater reward more than a disconnected future self does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213488214">Bartels &amp; Rips, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, events in the future are not only uncertain and possibly unconnected from one’s present situation, but they are also thought of in a more abstract, decontextualized way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213488214">Wakslak, Trope, Liberman, &amp; Alony, 2006</xref>). In general, when a state or situation is not directly experienced, it is psychologically distant and involves cognitive representations that are abstract, schematic, and broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). Thus, for future events, uncertainty and abstract thinking go hand in hand, and this might be critical for temporal discounting: The immediate reward is construed at a concrete, certain level, whereas the future reward is construed on an abstract, uncertain level, with decision makers eventually comparing apples and oranges, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Given the importance of the approach to our rationale, we outline CLT in more detail below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146167213488214">
<title>CLT</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope and Liberman (2003)</xref> proposed that psychological distance involves different mental representations of events, such that the distant future involves high-level construals that are abstract, decontextualized, and removed from direct experience, whereas the here and now involves low-level construals that are concrete and grounded in physical and perceptual experience. Psychological distance is composed of several domains: temporal (present vs. past/future), social (self vs. other), spatial (close vs. far), and hypothetical (certain vs. probable) distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213488214">Liberman, Trope, &amp; Stephan, 2007</xref>), and these domains can operate interdependently, suggesting a single underlying cognitive mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213488214">Bar-Anan, Liberman, Trope, &amp; Algom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213488214">Fiedler, Jung, Wänke, &amp; Alexopoulos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>). Much research also has shown that the level of psychological distance and its corresponding construal level influence each other in a bidirectional fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213488214">Fujita, Henderson, Eng, Trope, &amp; Liberman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213488214">Liberman, Trope, McCrea, &amp; Sherman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167213488214">Stephan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that people make judgments and decisions differently depending on construal level. Psychological distance is associated with abstract thought and the use of general, holistic processing in various attribution and judgment tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213488214">Henderson, Fujita, Trope, &amp; Liberman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167213488214">Williams &amp; Bargh, 2008</xref>). For example, high-level construal encourages global processing in perceptual tasks, whereas low-level construal encourages local processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213488214">Förster, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167213488214">Liberman &amp; Förster, 2009</xref>). High-level construal also boosts creative solutions more than low-level construal does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213488214">Förster, Friedman, &amp; Liberman, 2004</xref>). Simple priming with words associated with distance, as opposed to closeness, also increases participants’ preference for describing activities regarding their abstract ends rather than concrete means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213488214">Smith &amp; Trope, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213488214">Wakslak et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In decision making, high-level construals lead people to make more self-controlled decisions compared with low-level construals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213488214">Fujita &amp; Han, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213488214">Fujita &amp; Roberts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213488214">Fujita, Trope, Liberman, &amp; Levin-Sagi, 2006</xref>). For example, high-level construal involves thinking about temptations in more negative terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213488214">Fujita et al., 2006</xref>), leads participants to favor advertisements appealing to their desired self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213488214">Freitas, Langsam, Clark, &amp; Moeller, 2008</xref>), and prefer distant to near future options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213488214">Trope and Liberman (2000)</xref> observed participants’ preference changes in future decision making and found that temporal distance increased participants’ tendency to choose based on high-level characteristics. For example, when participants rated the attractiveness of a job offer in the distant future, they focused more on the general description of the job (i.e., how interesting it was) whereas the attractiveness for a near future job was based on the description of specific aspects of the job (i.e., how appealing the training was).</p>
<p>With relevance to the current research, previous work showed that an abstract, high-level mind-set reduces temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213488214">Malkoc, Zauberman, &amp; Bettman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213488214">Rogers &amp; Bazerman, 2008</xref>). For example, Malkoc et al. found that people choose to wait a few days longer to save a delivery fee when consumer products are described in a more abstract manner as opposed to a concrete manner. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213488214">Rogers and Bazerman (2008)</xref> observed that when deciding on a distant future event, people make choices that serve their desired self, whereas focusing on a near future event makes people follow the current self’s need.</p>

<title>Overview of the Current Research</title>
<p>Whereas previous studies have focused on the association of high-level construal with more self-controlled, adaptive decisions, the current research concentrated on the difference or mismatch of construal level in choice alternatives when choosing between two intertemporal options. That is, we propose that temporal discounting is due to two options being represented in a dissimilar manner (i.e., one at a low-level construal and the other at a high-level construal), thus making it difficult to compare intertemporal options directly.</p>
<p>In the present series of studies, we explored whether a similar level of construal might lead to more adaptive financial choices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167213488214">1</xref></sup> Construal differences between two rewards might be responsible for people favoring the immediate reward because “here and now” is likely to be represented concretely, whereas “there and then” is likely to be represented abstractly. Thus, people should be able to compare two intertemporal options more effectively when using similar construals and therefore prefer the larger future reward.</p>
<p>We assume that the more detailed information is available, the more people can construe a future event in a concrete way, corresponding to a low construal level. In contrast, when only brief and general information is provided, the quality of imagination becomes abstract and general, corresponding to a high-level construal. Therefore, by providing detailed information, we should be able to shift people’s perspective from what is in the future to what is here and now. Similarly, by giving abstract and decontextualized information, people’s perspective should change from here and now to a psychologically distant perspective. Thus, we tested whether construal-level change leads to more similar representations of intertemporal rewards, which should result in more rational choices.</p>
<p>In five studies, we manipulated construal-level and associated psychological distance and investigated their influence on intertemporal choices. We hypothesized that when two intertemporal rewards share a similar level of construal, the different options become more comparable, and thus, temporal discounting is reduced. Because inductions of abstract versus concrete processing have been previously shown to influence construal level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213488214">Liberman, Trope, &amp; Stephan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213488214">2010</xref>), Studies 1a, 1b, and 2 consisted of manipulations of construal level, thus following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167213488214">Spencer, Zanna, and Fong’s (2005)</xref> suggestion of a “moderation-of-process” design for situations in which a proposed mediator is difficult to measure but easy to manipulate. In contrast to these tests of the path from construal level, the presumed mediator underlying psychological distance, to temporal discounting, Study 3 then measured, and Study 4 manipulated, psychological distance. In other words, these latter studies investigated the direct path from psychological distance to temporal discounting.</p>

<title>Study 1A: Making the Future More Concrete: Paris Hotels</title>
<p>In Study 1a, we tested temporal discounting after manipulating construals of <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options in hypothetical scenarios so that they were both construed in a relatively concrete way. For the control condition, we used a standard temporal discounting procedure of monetary reward as used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213488214">Critchfield &amp; Kollins, 2001</xref>). The amount of the delayed reward was held constant to be “in 1 year,” whereas the immediate reward decreased in size, such that there was a decision point at which participants switched when the immediate reward was too small to be preferred to the larger, delayed reward. In other words, this decision point identified the current subjective value of the “discounted value,” defined as the magnitude of the immediate reward that generates indifference in choice against the later reward. For this control condition, we expected people to show previously observed temporal discounting, because relative to the immediate reward that is construed concretely, the future reward is construed abstractly. In contrast, for the experimental condition, we intended to make the construal level for the future reward more similar to the immediate reward, by giving participants the opportunity to concretely imagine the future option: Participants were presented with a hypothetical future event, namely a trip to Paris that varied regarding the quality of the included accommodation, with the future option being more desirable than the immediate option. Thus, participants were able to directly compare the features of a specific imagined event in the <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options, thus encouraging more adaptive choices relative to the control condition that dealt with decisions involving two distinct construal levels. In other words, we expected that participants would be more willing to wait for the larger reward when both choices were relatively concrete.</p>

<sec id="section6-0146167213488214">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Seventy participants (33 men; <italic>M</italic> age = 25.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.80) were recruited from the Cambridge central library and the University College London Union area. Participants were approached individually and given a brief paper-and-pencil survey with no monetary compensation. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the control condition, the other half to the experimental condition.</p>

<sec id="section7-0146167213488214">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<sec id="section8-0146167213488214">
<title>Intertemporal choice</title>
<p>To keep the two conditions as similar as possible, each involved a check or voucher that could be exchanged for a reward (i.e., money or a trip to Paris) and could be received either now or in 1 year’s time. Thus, in principle, either condition involved being able to experience the reward immediately or later. For the Control condition, participants made a choice between two options: receiving a £500 check in 1 year or receiving a slightly less valuable check right now, and the <italic>now</italic> options decreased in £40 decrements from £460 to £260. The following instructions were given to participants:<disp-quote>
<p>Imagine somebody were to give you a check and offered you two choices: Either you receive it <italic>right now</italic>, or you receive it in <italic>1 year from now</italic>. Imagine that the check can be cashed at any time once you have received it. Please make this choice for six different scenarios.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the experimental condition, participants made a hypothetical choice between receiving a £500 travel voucher in 1 year or receiving a slightly less valuable travel voucher right now. The following instructions were given to participants:<disp-quote>
<p>Imagine somebody were to give you a travel voucher for a holiday in Paris and offered you two choices: Either you receive it <italic>right now</italic>, or you receive it in <italic>1 year from now</italic>. Imagine that the voucher can be used at any time once you have received it. Please make this choice for six different scenarios.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Vouchers for Paris trips were varied by including accommodation, for example, from five-star hotel suite (for a £500 voucher), five-star hotel (for a £460 voucher), four-star hotel (for a £420 voucher), and so on to a £260 voucher that did not include any accommodation. To help participants actively simulate the future reward, we added color pictures of the accommodation corresponding to the value of each travel voucher.</p>

<sec id="section9-0146167213488214">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Discounted values for receiving £500 in 1 year were computed by averaging the switch point in descending choice sequences for <italic>now</italic> options. For example, if a participant preferred receiving £380 now to receiving £500 in the future, but was unwilling to receive £340 now and decided to wait for £500 in the future, the discounted value was £360. If participants decided to always take <italic>now</italic> options or <italic>later</italic> options, the discounted value was calculated by averaging the lowest (i.e., £260) or highest <italic>now</italic> option (i.e., £460) on the survey with the hypothetically lower (i.e., £220) or higher (£500) option, which resulted in £240 or £480, respectively. Mean discounted values were compared in a one-way ANOVA with condition (control vs. experimental condition) as factor. As expected, there was a significant main effect for condition: Discounted values were higher in the experimental condition (<italic>M</italic> = 395.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 73.10) than the control condition (<italic>M</italic> = 354.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 73.34), <italic>F</italic>(1, 68) = 5.53, <italic>p</italic> = .02, ηp2 = .08, indicating that people were more willing to wait for the larger reward under similar level of construals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167213488214">2</xref></sup> To compare effects across studies, we also calculated the percentage of reduction in discounting by first multiplying the mean difference between conditions by 100, then dividing it by the mean of the experimental condition. This showed that relative to the control condition, the experimental condition showed 10.4 % less temporal discounting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0146167213488214">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, participants were more willing to wait for the larger reward in the future when two intertemporal options were both represented on similarly concrete levels of construal, compared with participants who made choices between dissimilar levels of construal: The average participant in the control condition was willing to accept a reward worth about £350 right now, whereas the average participant in the experimental condition was not willing to accept any less than about £390. Presumably, participants in the experimental condition were able to more clearly imagine what it would be like to spend a holiday at a fancy hotel in Paris in the future due to the concrete construal level. Therefore, participants were able to compare the <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options on a similar type of representation that enabled a more direct comparison, which in turn reduced their temporal discounting.</p>

<title>Study 1B: Making the Future More Concrete: Paris Attractions</title>
<p>Although the results of the first study provided evidence for our hypothesis, there was a potential confound because photos were shown for the holiday condition but not for the control condition. Thus, the use of pictures may have encouraged more concrete imagery, and therefore reduced temporal discounting. We therefore removed the photos in Study 1b. To provide participants with opportunities for concrete construals that were not based on photos, details about a hypothetical trip to Paris were given that described specific tourist attractions (e.g., Eiffel tower, boat trip on the Seine), and different choices included different numbers of attractions. Thus, rather than exposing participants to preexisting stimuli, participants were able to concretely imagine specific events they personally could experience in Paris, and the number of these experiences varied in a linear fashion. Furthermore, we added a manipulation check to measure imagery complexity by asking about detail of the imagery and interest of going on a trip to Paris. Because a concrete mind-set might lead participants to spend more time considering the decision and thus be confounded with construal level, we also asked participants to indicate the time spent on thinking about the given future event.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As found in Study 1a, participants were more willing to wait for the greater reward when <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options were represented on a relatively concrete level of construal. In other words, participants required greater compensation in the present for foregoing a £500 holiday in the future than they required for foregoing a £500 check in the future. In this study, rather than presenting participants with specific pictures to aid mental simulation, they were given the opportunity to come up with subjective concrete construals of future events. Despite this difference, the effect was the same. Furthermore, participants in the experimental condition reported that they thought about the future event in more detail compared with the control group, indicating that we successfully induced a more concrete level of representation.</p>

<title>Study 2: More or Less Concrete Trips to Paris</title>
<p>The findings from the first two studies suggest that when participants formed a relatively concrete representation for <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options, they made more financially beneficial choices than participants who compared <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options on relatively different levels of construal. However, we must consider the possibility that the condition involving the check might have differed in other respects from the condition involving the Paris trip voucher, regardless of construal level. For example, being presented with a potential trip to Paris might have involved positive valence, or induced a positive mood, which in turn could have influenced participants’ decision making. Therefore, Study 2 assessed temporal discounting by comparing two conditions that involved a travel voucher to Paris. The only difference between conditions was the level of detail and concreteness regarding the Paris trip, with the experimental condition being provided with concrete details about the trip, whereas the control condition receiving no such details. We further not only excluded items to check the effectiveness of the manipulation but also included additional items regarding potential confounds, such as interest in going to Paris and enjoyment thinking about it, and participants’ current mood.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 2 ruled out the possibility that the effects regarding temporal discounting that we observed in the earlier studies might have been due to differences in the tasks rather than construal level, or other factors such as interest in going to Paris or the time spent thinking about going there. Participants made more financially advantageous decisions when the tasks were identical across conditions, and only differed in the detail and concreteness of the future experience. Furthermore, positive mood did not differ across conditions, indicating that how happy or excited participants felt while imagining a trip to Paris did not influence their choices.</p>
<p>Although Studies 1a, 1b, and 2 demonstrated that temporal discounting could be reduced by making intertemporal choices more concrete, temporal discounting should also be reduced when intertemporal choices are made less concrete: The same effect should occur when <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options are construed on an abstract level as a consequence of increased psychological distance. Importantly, this would suggest that no type of construal is necessarily preferable, because similarity in construal level should help people make more adaptive choices regardless of whether the two intertemporal options are construed in a concrete or an abstract fashion. Thus, in the next two studies we tested whether increased psychological distance would be associated with reduced temporal discounting, because <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options can be construed on a similarly high construal level.</p>

<title>Study 3: Intertemporal Choices for Strangers</title>
<p>For Study 3, we assumed that with greater psychological distance, intertemporal options should be construed relatively abstractly. We induced a particular dimension of psychological distance, namely social distance, which reflects the subjective closeness toward a target person, and can range from being very close for a very good friend to very distant for a stranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). Similar attitudinal and behavioral consequences of temporal distance and social distance are evident in mounting research of CLT, thus supporting their functional equivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213488214">Pronin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213488214">Pronin &amp; Ross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213488214">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213488214">2010</xref>). In economic decision making, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213488214">Jones and Rachlin (2006)</xref> observed that the closer participants felt to a social contact, the more money they decided to forgo when this person then benefited from that money. Interestingly, the amount of money that people decided to forgo decreased as a hyperbolic function with respect to social closeness, similar to the pattern observed in temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213488214">Jones &amp; Rachlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213488214">Rachlin &amp; Jones, 2008</xref>). Similarly, people were more willing to wait for a reward when the intertemporal choice was on behalf of a group to which participants belonged, compared with making the decision for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213488214">Charlton, Yi, Porter, Carter, Bickel, &amp; Rachlin, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that increased social distance alleviates temporal discounting: Making an intertemporal choice for a psychologically distant target should involve a relatively abstract construal level, compared with a decision for oneself or for a socially close person, such as a best friend. Hence, when making a decision for the close contact, the <italic>now</italic> option should be represented in a relatively concrete way, whereas the <italic>later</italic> option should remain abstract due to the nature of intertemporal choice that entails temporal distance. In contrast, when making a choice for a stranger, the <italic>now</italic> option is no longer represented in a concrete way, due to the increased social distance that leads to representing present and future options in a relatively abstract way. We expected to observe more rational choices when <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options were represented similarly in an abstract fashion, as would be the case when making the choice for a stranger, compared with when the intertemporal options were represented in a dissimilar fashion, as would be the case when making the choice for a friend.</p>
<p>For an initial test of this idea, we conducted a correlational study that related subjective closeness toward a target person to participants’ temporal discounting. We predicted greater willingness to wait for the distant reward with increased social distance.</p>

<p>As predicted, the more distant the target was for whom participants made an intertemporal decision, the less temporal discounting they showed. That is, encouraging participants to form a high-level construal of the target person receiving the rewards encouraged adaptive choices. This study is particularly important for CLT because it shows, as the theory would predict, that manipulating construals on a different domain—social distance—has comparable effects to manipulating features of temporal distance seen in Studies 1a, 1b, and 2.</p>
<p>A limitation of Study 3 was that we used a correlational design so we were only able to demonstrate an association rather than causality. Consequently, in Study 4, we designed a between-subjects study that manipulated social distance experimentally by comparing intertemporal choices for a close versus distant social contact.</p>

<p>Researchers have been fascinated by the conflict between the “want” or “passionate” option and the “should” or “rational” option (for a review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213488214">Milkman, Rogers, &amp; Bazerman, 2008</xref>). A big puzzle emerging from this work has been why people sometimes fail to make optimal economic decisions although they are capable of doing so. However, the field of decision making has often focused on descriptions of erroneous decisions rather than how such errors could be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167213488214">Milkman, Chugh, &amp; Bazerman, 2009</xref>). The current research proposes a potential solution of coping with decision-making errors. We suggest that suboptimal decisions can be improved by changing psychological distance because it modulates construal level: A low construal level involving proximate psychological distance encourages mental simulation to be contextually rich and vivid, whereas a high construal level involving distant psychological distance lacks such characteristics. Dissimilar levels of construal for representing a single situation might lead to supoptimal decisions. For example, intertemporal choices that compare psychologically proximate (i.e., <italic>now</italic>) and psychologically distant (i.e., <italic>later</italic>) options generate discrepancy in mentally representing two alternative scenarios. Consequently, an individual might discount future rewards not because they fail to “do the math” or are risk averse but because they fail to form a concrete representation of the positive future outcome. We considered such a mismatch of representation as the key to improving intertemporal choices, and hypothesized that when <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options are compared on a similar level of construal, participants would make more adaptive decisions, regardless of whether both levels of construal are high or low.</p>
<p>Indeed, the results observed from five studies suggest that it is possible to manipulate intertemporal choice depending on how similar construal levels are when choosing between two alternatives: When two intertemporal options (<italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic>) shared a similar level of construal (either both concrete, or both abstract), people made more financially lucrative decisions across time: When <italic>now</italic> and <italic>later</italic> options were construed concretely (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2) people discounted less. Similarly, when two options were construed abstractly due to increased psychological distance (Studies 3 and 4) people discounted less. In short, our studies support the notion that temporal discounting may be due to the construal level difference of near versus far future options.</p>

<title>Interpreting Intertemporal Choice in the Framework of Psychological Distance</title>
<p>Previous research on intertemporal choice has supported the view that high-level construal helps people make more rational and controlled decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213488214">Malkoc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213488214">Rogers &amp; Bazerman, 2008</xref>). Such studies assume that the value regarding the future or desired self (i.e., “should” self) involves high-level construals, and that representing a given situation under high-level construals leads people to make more future-oriented and adaptive choices. Research supporting this idea stresses characteristic features of optimal decision making that are often associated with high construal level such as patience and rationality, and by priming a high construal level, people are more likely to choose the desirable option corresponding to such values.</p>
<p>In contrast, the current research suggests that a high construal level may not always be beneficial, but comparing choice alternatives using a similar construal level can lead to adaptive choices, because people are able to realize choice consequences more clearly. Indeed, recent research on construal level emphasizes that a low or high construal level is not necessarily better or worse, but that their fit is critical (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213488214">Ledgerwood &amp; Trope, 2010</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that not only goals related to high-level values but also specific behavior guidance under low-level construals can boost task performance because high-level values can be broken down into concrete behavior, which in turn can help people achieve their goals. Such studies highlight the importance of fit rather than the specific level of construal. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213488214">Giacomantonio, De Dreu, Shalvi, Sligte, and Leder (2010)</xref> stressed the role of comparability of construals regarding social motivation. That is, depending on participants’ motivational state (i.e., pro-social or pro-self), cooperative or competitive behavior was observed under low as well as high levels of construal. Thus, people do not always make better choices under high-level construals. This effect is consistent with previous research showing that when a fit exists between mental perspectives, information is processed more fluently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213488214">Lee &amp; Aaker, 2004</xref>). Similarly, a fit between experiential and conceptual affective cues leads to better recall performance than when there is no such fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213488214">Centerbar, Schnall, Clore, &amp; Garvin, 2008</xref>). Therefore, improved intertemporal choice observed in the current study might be partly due to fluency caused by construal fit, enabling people to evaluate alternatives with less bias.</p>
<p>Our research is in line with evidence showing that concreteness in describing a future event can increase its subjective certainty of occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213488214">Gollwitzer &amp; Brandstätter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213488214">Sherman, Zehner, Johnson, &amp; Hirt, 1983</xref>). In Studies 1a, 1b, and 2, we described future events with more concrete and contextualized terms as opposed to describing an abstract sum of money. Our intention was that participants would imagine what they would be missing if they were to choose an immediate reward. That is, a detailed description of the <italic>now</italic> and the <italic>later</italic> options enabled participants to compare them in a more precise and clear way. Indeed, previous research showed that an event that is described in a detailed rather than an abstract way increased subjective likelihood judgments that the event might actually happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213488214">Sherman et al., 1983</xref>). Similarly, future plans that use more concrete terms referring to how, when, and where the activity would take place are more likely to be implemented compared with plans described with abstract and general terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213488214">Gollwitzer &amp; Brandstätter, 1997</xref>). In other words, although temporally distant events are likely to be represented in abstract and general terms, once described in a detailed and contextualized way, these mental representation change as if the event were to take place in the more immediate future. In this way, the <italic>later</italic> option might receive more weight in intertemporal decision making. However, because the future outcomes are often underweighted due to temporal discounting, overweighting the <italic>later</italic> option might help balance the overall decision weighting when deciding between two alternative intertemporal options.</p>
<p>One possible criticism of our work may be that although we hypothesize that construal level and psychological distance were the key variables underlying the observed effects, perhaps confounding variables led to the findings. Although the original effects in Studies 1b and 2 did not change once we took into account potential confounds such as imagery length or mood, it is conceivable that the manipulations of construal level might have also changed variables that we did not measure. However, we believe that although each study might have involved possible confounds, we cannot think of a single variable that could explain the pattern of all the different studies collectively. For example, although it is possible that participants who were in the concrete condition in the first three studies might have thought about their response option more deeply, or engaged with it more, this in itself could have led to <italic>less</italic> temporal discounting. However, such an argument would predict the opposite to what we found in Studies 3 and 4: Because close psychological distance such as thinking about a close friend rather than a distant acquaintance is associated with a relatively concrete representation, one could have equally predicted less temporal discounting, but there actually was <italic>more</italic> discounting for friends than for strangers. The only common mechanism across all studies is psychological distance and associated construal level, and this is indeed the novel contribution of our work.</p>

<title>Psychological Distance and Economic Decision Making</title>
<p>Our findings suggest a possible integration of existing research on intertemporal choice using the framework of CLT. In previous studies, the cause of temporal discounting was that the future had been perceived as uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213488214">Baron, 2000</xref>), detached from the present self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213488214">Bartels &amp; Rips, 2010</xref>), and free from empathetic feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213488214">Loewenstein, Prelec, &amp; Shatto, 1998</xref>). We suggest that such types of representation relate to the consequences of psychological distance. As discussed in the introduction, the future is psychologically distant and induces high-level construals characterized by an abstract, general, and decontextualized mind-set. We argue that because of this high-level construal, future rewards are seen as less certain and detached from one’s currently experiencing self, and as a result, people discount future rewards. Therefore, the notion of psychological distance and corresponding construal level can serve to unify existing findings on temporal discounting.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of such an integrative framework is that psychological distance can be manipulated in various ways. As discussed earlier, psychological distance shares its mechanism across various dimensions such as temporal, social, spatial, and hypothetical distance. Therefore, although one dimension might be fixed, for example, at a specific time, manipulating another dimension, such as social distance, can lead to similar results as if temporal distance had been changed. Indeed, across four experiments, temporal discounting was reduced by 10.40%, 11.21%, and 6.06% for the temporal distance experiments and by 8.94% for the social distance experiment in the experimental conditions compared with the control conditions, suggesting that the findings are comparable when social distance was induced to make two intertemporal points seem distant.</p>
<p>Our theoretical approach suggests that manipulating construal level might also improve various other types of decision making. For example, phenomena observed in behavioral economics such as loss aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213488214">Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1990</xref>) might similarly be influenced by changes in construal level. The fact that people are more sensitive to losing than gaining might depend on how easily they can simulate gainful or costly situations. People might avoid costly events that seem psychologically close more than those that seem distant. Likewise, the value of an object might seem higher once it has been owned compared with when owning it is just imagined, which has been termed the endowment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213488214">Thaler, 1980</xref>). This effect might be due to the fact that direct physical contact helps people actively simulate what it means to own and use the object, which in turn makes the valuable object appear more valuable, relative to merely considering owning and using it. If this were the case, the endowment effect could be counteracted by inducing people to construe the object in abstract terms, similar to the methods used in the current studies. Finally, inducing psychological distance might help achieve greater profits when current emotional feelings get in the way of making economically beneficial choices. For example, in the Ultimatum Game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213488214">Güth, Schmittberger &amp; Schwarze, 1982</xref>), participants reject unfair offers extended by an opponent although this incurs a financial cost. People might be able to reduce such a cost when imagining that the offers were to be given at a later time, or by pretending to make decisions on behalf of another person.</p>
<p>Taken together, we propose that other biases in decision making alongside temporal discounting may stem from consequences of varying psychological distance. Thus, adopting suitable levels of construal could be highly beneficial when implemented in applied contexts.</p>

<p>There was a roughly equal distribution of men and women in each condition in this experiment as well as in subsequent experiments. The same analysis was also conducted with gender as an additional factor. There was no significant effect for gender (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .11), nor for the interaction of gender and condition (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .13). Thus, gender was dropped as a factor. For all subsequent experiments, analyses involving gender were performed as well. However, because none of the effects were significant, they are not reported.</p>
