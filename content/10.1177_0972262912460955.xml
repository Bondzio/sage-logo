<p>Culture, which consists of socially transmitted behaviour, shapes the way a society is defined and is an important means for us to understand how social life develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912460955">Ellwood, 1944</xref>). Leaders in this field face the double-sided challenge of promoting culture, while finding financial and other support to sustain their organizations, be it a museum, art gallery or a cultural organization.</p>
<p><italic>The Cultural Leadership Handbook: How to Run a Creative Organization</italic> by Robert Hewison and John Holden guides creative leaders on how to make the leap from being administrators to cultural entrepreneurs of sorts, in an effort to ensure that their organization remains self sustaining. This book helps to fill a gap for cultural leaders in terms of guidance, given that there are very few training programmes that they can follow or structures that they can fall back on.</p>
<p>The first chapter sets the background by stating that post recession, culture has taken a back seat, with both individuals and donors having less money to give due to a shortage of resources. This rather uncertain environment has led to the creative entrepreneur facing even more challenges, requiring new skills for the leader, particularly greater adaptability.</p>
<p>The second chapter on leadership describes the three main classifications of transactional, transformational and relational leadership, outlining both the strengths and weaknesses of each type. While this is purposed for the leader to be able to understand herself and her values, this chapter is quite a good overview of leadership types in general and so is useful as reference material for scholars studying leadership, or for corporate leaders in general. The chapter ends with a case study of The Royal Shakespeare Company as an example of distributed leadership.</p>
<p>This is followed by a chapter on values in which it is suggested that the leader’s personal values have to match the values of the organization, and that by doing so this synergy will help create cultural value. This section ends with a summation of self assessment and personality testing techniques, such as the Myers-Briggs test.</p>
<p>Chapter four focuses on how to create cultural value in three ways: through activity, through social and/or economic benefits and thirdly through the network that the institution is connected with. This is followed by a section on the creativity of the individual, not so much as an indicator on how to be creative, but more on how to acquire a balance between oneself as a creative individual and the team around you. Creativity is interpreted to be a process of problem solving, and the key is said to be to stay creative individually and also across the organization.</p>
<p>Chapter six is about resources and how to manage both people, in terms of motivation, and money; followed by a section on honing in on skills such as risk management. The last chapter on ‘Challenge: Taking the Lead’ is on moving ahead with the institutional value triangle of creativity, continuity and care.</p>
<p>The use of the word ‘challenges’ in every chapter heading is a little repetitive, in spite of the reason for doing so provided by the authors: ‘Because the conditions in which people in the cultural sector have to work are always challenging—and they are even more challenging at this moment, our book is not written as chapters, but as challenges’ (Introduction, page 2).</p>
<p>This handbook not only describes the challenges for a cultural leader, but is also interspersed with various exercises and caselets for the practitioner to be able to find ways to solve problems in an ever-changing external environment. The details of resources and reading materials at the end of every chapter are particularly useful. They are not written in the usual form of a chapter-end list, but are weaved in with pieces of advice in a freewheeling manner by the authors.</p>
<p>There are some other books in this area, such as <italic>The Creative Community Builder’s Handbook: How to Transform Communities Using Local Assets, Art and Culture</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912460955">Tom Borrup, 2006</xref>, but this one focuses more on leadership in terms of strategy. <italic>The Cultural Leadership Handbook: How to Run a Creative Organization</italic> by Robert Hewison and John Holden stands out in that it guides leaders on how to cope with both internal resources and the external environment. It is a recommended read not only for cultural leaders aspiring to shape society in a sustained and systematic manner, but for aspiring leaders in general.</p>
