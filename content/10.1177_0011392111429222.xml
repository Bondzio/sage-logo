<p>Cette communication se concentre sur la procédure appliquée aux sondages lors de la ‘Réforme’ en Iran (1997–2005). Plutôt que d’exposer les différentes stratégies par lesquelles les sondages manipulent, persuadent ou représentent ‘le peuple’, nous montrons que les modes d’interprétation des sondages donnent plus ou moins de pouvoir à différents types de publics. M’inspirant du cas de l’institut de sondages Ayandeh, je montre que les sondages d’opinion ont été utilisés en Iran comme une stratégie politique sous-tendant le mouvement réformateur. Mon objectif est de souligner, non seulement les macro-mouvements historiques qui président à la pratique des sondages, mais le micro-impact interactionnel des sondages sur les gens dont on sonde l’opinion.</p>

<p>On the morning of 30 October 2002, Iranian state officials broke into the Ayandeh Polling Institute (hereafter API) in Tehran. The institute’s entire personnel were dismissed and subsequently interrogated. Research materials, files and folders, sample questionnaires and survey reports and even the personnel’s personal belongings were confiscated. Consequently, two of the institute’s board members – also prominent figures of the reform movement – were prosecuted based on a 400-page bill of indictment that depicted the polling institute as ‘secretly cooperating with the CIA’ and ‘engaging in western-sponsored psychological war operations’ with the aim of overthrowing the Islamic state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392111429222">1</xref></sup> Later statements issued by the court made it clear that ‘psychological war operations’ referred to the pollsters’ subcontract with the Gallup ‘spying organization’, their involvement in the ‘fabrication of public opinions’ and the propagation of a public that ran counter to the one publicized through the regime’s official channels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392111429222">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The abovementioned incident offers an excellent case for assessing the prospects and problems of combining research and activism. This article focuses on the ways in which opinion polls in Iran were conducted and/or contested in order to discuss the interplay of structural context and the effects of polling. The effect of polling is an empirical matter, embedded in history and contingent on the sociopolitical context that shapes both the role of the professional pollster and the public, whose opinion is being gauged.</p>
<p>The literature on public polling and its implications has developed mostly in the political context of western liberal democracies with their depoliticized mass societies, in which ‘citizens fence themselves into their individual circumstances’ and ‘avoid politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429222">Alejandro, 1993</xref>: 185; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429222">Eliasoph, 1998</xref>). This article, instead, focuses on the effects of polling in a society based on a more authoritarian order, where civil society has been repoliticized in the reform movement and polling has had a very different significance, turning those lost or repressed publics – which I call ‘fluid publics’ – into a counter-public that challenges the homogeneity of the regime’s undifferentiated concept of ‘the people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392111429222">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instead of highlighting the various ways in which polls strategically manipulate, persuade or represent ‘the people’ and ‘public opinion’, I intend to show how the specific modes of interpretation of polls enable certain kinds of ‘publics’, previously hidden in the undifferentiated concept of ‘the people’. Polls, as utilized during the reform movement in Iran, signified the existence of a previously marginalized or repressed public. I intend to highlight not the interests or ideologies that these polls purposely or inadvertently served, but the micro-processes through which they diversified the political field by contributing to the constitution of counter-publics.</p>
<p>Drawing on the case of API, I argue that, far from being a conservative tool aimed at maintaining the status quo and/or masking differences and opposing interests – as is usually the case within western liberal democracies – public polling in Iran during the reform era became a radical tool in the hands of the reformists to draw differences out of the undifferentiated and to engage in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429222">Bourdieu (1984)</xref> calls the ‘classification struggle’. That is, they fought to secure an ‘official’ position within the political field for the counter-public that was partially enabled and constituted by the polls. The API pollsters in this sense turned the practice of polling on its head and made it the backbone of a social movement. Thus, the study of public polling in Iran provides us with an opportunity to assess how and under what circumstances polling both signifies and contributes to the constitution of marginalized/repressed publics, rather than reflecting, distorting or manipulating their opinions.</p>

<title>Theoretical discussion</title>
<p>The collection of statistical information is not a modern practice. Nevertheless, it was only in the 19th century that a new regime of truth – the modern science – came to be founded on the basis of statistics and measurable facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429222">Porter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392111429222">Stigler, 1990</xref>). As Starr and Corson indicate:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As a governmental activity, statistics is centuries old. As a popular interest and amateur form of social research, it dates from the early 1800s and as a profession from the late 1800s. But as a business, it is a phenomenon of the mid-twentieth century. And only with the technological and economic changes of the 1970s did there emerge a substantial industry of private firms selling repackaged public data and privately collected statistics, statistical models, and analytical skills. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392111429222">Starr and Corson, 1987</xref>: 415)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the initial enthusiasm about polling, as the main instrument of collecting statistical information and as a premise for democracy, since the early 20th century polling as an industry has come under attack from different directions. Scholars have, in some form or another, disregarded the fairy tale of a good democratic society that is based on public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429222">Blumer, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429222">Habermas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429222">Mills, 1959</xref>). What counts as an opinion, what counts as <italic>public</italic> opinion, and the ways in which these opinions are interpreted and utilized have been the source of long-term controversies. The critiques of public polling could be clustered and summarized around two main themes: the process of opinion production and the effects and implications of polling.</p>
<p>As early as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429222">1922</xref>, Lippman argued that what democracy requires is a public policy guided by informed opinion. Nevertheless, he found it impossible for an ordinary citizen ever to form an informed opinion. C Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429222">Mills (1959)</xref> and Pierre Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429222">2005</xref>) have a similar concern. They both argue that due to the unequal distribution of means of opinion production (i.e. access to information, education, etc.), not everyone is in a position to produce an opinion. Thus, individual opinions are either uninformed opinions formed only during the interview, or are formed under the influence of the dominant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429222">Mills, 1959</xref>: 76, 194). Echoing Mills, Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">1979</xref>: 125) states that ‘one of the most pernicious effects of the opinion surveys’ is that they ‘put people in a position where they must answer a question they have never thought about’. Moreover, he contends that those who have thought about issues beforehand and have formed an opinion have done so only under the influence of the dominant ideas and ideologies of their time and their society. People, according to Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">1979</xref>: 128), <italic>take</italic> this or that position; they do not <italic>produce</italic> these positions. In other words, public opinion surveys merely reproduce the already-existing positions.</p>
<p>In an often-cited article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">Bourdieu (1979)</xref> offers a dismissive account of polling and states that ‘public opinion does not exist’. He contends that what pollsters present as <italic>public</italic> opinion is nothing but the actual sum of the <italic>individual</italic> opinions and that ‘public opinion’, in order to represent a genuinely collective opinion, must be produced collectively in the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429222">Bourdieu, 2005</xref>). Thus, in his account, publics must precede polls. However – the argument continues – since the public sphere is weakened and there are not enough spaces for individuals to get together and engage in a rational-critical debate, the opinions measured by the public opinion surveys are <italic>individual</italic> opinions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429222">Blumer (1948)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429222">Habermas (1991)</xref> also argue that public opinion is different from the aggregate of individual opinions, and that it should emerge out of a genuine public sphere. Habermas argues that public opinion is an expression of democratic will as long as it is formed rationally and discursively in the public realm. Thus, in western societies – and especially in the US, which is characterized by ‘the loss of a sense of community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429222">Bellah et al., 1985</xref>) and a depoliticized civil society, wherein people ‘avoid politics’ and ‘produce apathy in everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429222">Eliasoph, 1998</xref>) – polls come to replace, and not reflect, public opinion.</p>
<p>Scholars of public polling have also expressed concerns about the effects of polling. Surveys are said to normalize and rationalize opinions and reduce the variety of opinions into several measurable categories, and therefore to present a unanimity that does not exist. This fictitious unanimity ‘conceal[s] the fact that the state of opinion at any given moment is a system of forces, of tensions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>: 125), suppresses the possibility of expressing alternative points of view and pushes the minority into a state of passivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392111429222">Noelle-Neumann, 1993</xref>). Thus, it ultimately serves as ‘the ideological glue that masks social division’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429222">Lewis, 1999</xref>) in order to ‘legitimate a policy, and strengthen the relations of force upon which it is based or make it possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>: 125).</p>
<p>The ‘people’ is one of the things at stake in the struggle between intellectuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429222">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>). What gets lost in these struggles, however, is the ‘people’ itself. In western liberal democracies, public polling – critics contend – promotes corporate, partisan and state interests rather than the interests of the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429222">Champagne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429222">Ginsberg, 1986</xref>). Statistical knowledge has in fact been utilized by the modern state for efficient and optimal regulation of population (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392111429222">Foucault, 2009</xref>). Building on Foucault, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429222">Herbst (1993)</xref> argues that surveys are indeed one of the modern technologies of power that normalize and categorize the population in order to better regulate them.</p>
<p>To sum up, critics argue that polling is used either as an instrument of surveillance and regulation, or abused/misused as a means to reap economic or political benefits. In a most cynical statement about polling, Champagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429222">2005</xref>: 207) states that ‘most often, the results of the polls are distorted to benefit political ends or in the case of political campaigns, they are used to fool the people by telling them what they want to hear’. The polls then are generally viewed as conservative mechanisms that serve to control, discipline, persuade, manipulate or fool the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429222">Beniger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429222">Ginsberg, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The critics of polling make some valid points about the uses and abuses of this method, its shortages and its implications. However, these points have rarely been subject to empirical examination. Most of these accounts revolve around an assessment of either the interests that the polls serve or the ways in which they fall short in representing the people. Nevertheless, by overlooking the social, political and historical processes within which both polling and the interpretation of its results are embedded, critics fail to understand the variation in the meanings that are attached to these practices across time and space. If the publics, as critics claim, are constructed through the practice of polling, then an examination of the sociopolitical environment within which the practice of polling is embedded becomes indispensable to the study of polling and its results. In other words, a study of polling is simultaneously a study of the changing character of polling, the different kinds of ‘publics’ that are constituted by it and the sociopolitical environment within which it is embedded.</p>
<p>In what follows, I shift the scene from the context of western liberal democracies, where civil society is depoliticized, to the Islamic Republic of Iran – that is, to a more authoritarian context, where civil society was repoliticized during the reform era (1997–2005). I intend to highlight the historical processes that have given rise to a particular form of public sphere in Iran, one which is composed of ‘fluid publics’. By presenting a brief historical narrative, I demonstrate that despite claims to the contrary, centuries of authoritarian rule in Iran have not done away with a vibrant public sphere. The repeated attacks on and suppression of the physical representations of Iranian civil society (i.e. NGOs, private research centers, universities and the press), have given way to a ‘fluid’, boundary-less and, at the same time, vibrant public sphere. The public sphere in Iran is ‘everywhere’ and ‘nowhere’. Nevertheless, due to the lack of durable physical spaces, the Iranian ‘publics’, constituted through face-to-face conversations in everyday life settings, are temporary and fluid. The dynamics of these highly politicized yet ‘fluid’ publics are significantly different from the dynamics of the atomized and highly depoliticized masses in the context of western liberal democracies. It is, as I demonstrate, amid these fluid publics that Iranian <italic>public</italic> opinions are formed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the literature on polling fails to examine the micro-interactional impact of polling on the people whose opinions are gauged – it is important to examine the effects of polling on the people on a micro everyday-life level. What does the encounter between the pollster and the interviewee look like? What happens to the individual respondent after the pollster leaves? What effects does the wording of the questions have on the ways in which the respondents perceive the world both during the interview and after? These questions have rarely been asked or responded to.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392111429222">4</xref></sup> By focusing on the micro-interactional impacts of polling in Iran, I intend to demonstrate that in a situation in which access to means of opinion production and opinion expression is limited, polls provided people with the opportunity to think about questions they may have never thought about, and in ways they would never think about. Polls in this particular period helped generate discussions among people both during and after the interviews. Thus, I contend that in Iran opinion measurement provided a venue for opinion expression.</p>
<p>Finally, Bourdieu, among others, contends that, by presenting a unanimous public, polls conceal the tensions among the citizenry and therefore undermine democratic politics. Polls in this sense are mechanisms aimed at maintaining the status quo. I nevertheless illustrate how public polling in Iran assisted a movement on the rise. I demonstrate how the reformists in Iran utilized polling to reveal the tensions among the citizenry and to draw difference out of the undifferentiated. Through signifying the ‘fluid’ publics whose opinions ran counter to the opinion of ‘the people’ – disseminated and propagated by the regime – pollsters framed those ‘fluid’ publics as a counter-public that stood against the public presented through the regime’s official channels. The reformists used poll results to expand the political field first by acknowledging the existence of these fluid publics, second by aggregating their opinions and labeling them, third by transforming these scattered fluid publics into a solid and unified counter-public and finally by giving this counter-public a name and an official position within the political field – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429222">Bourdieu (1984)</xref> refers to as the ‘classification struggle’.</p>
<p>The unanimity of this counter-public was perhaps as fictitious as the unanimity of the official public presented through the official channels of the regime. In other words, this struggle was a struggle between two fictitious publics – one unifying ‘the people’, the other unifying ‘the opposition’; one concealing the differences among ‘the people’, the other revealing the differences but still unifying them under the label ‘reform advocates’.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is an attempt to elaborate the aforementioned points both theoretically and empirically. In what follows I first define and elaborate my notion of ‘fluid public’. I then offer a historical narrative about the status of these fluid publics during the reform movement and the sociopolitical environment within which API pollsters functioned – the micro-processes through which polling data were collected, analyzed and then disseminated. I conclude the article by discussing the implications of my approach for a more thorough understanding of the connection between research and activism.</p>

<title>‘Fluid publics’, counter-publics and the classification struggle</title>
<p>Imagine for a moment the individuals present in the waiting hall of a bus station. This scene would constitute the prototype of an aggregate in, say, an American or European bus station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392111429222">Blumer, 1966</xref>: 46). There are no horizontal bonds between the individuals waiting for the bus: one is listening to songs on his iPod, another is talking on a cell phone; one is reading a newspaper, another is eating a sandwich; all looking at the announcement board. This is clearly an aggregate.</p>
<p>Now, imagine individuals waiting at a bus station in Iran. If you have never visited Iran, it might be difficult to picture it any differently from the scene just described. Nevertheless, in Iran the bus station could very easily turn into a public sphere, within which the individuals awaiting the bus could find themselves amid a heated debate over social, political or economic problems. The ‘public’ that is created dissolves as soon as the bus arrives. Now imagine a different setting: a family gathering, a park, a newspaper stand, a hair salon. The public sphere in Iran is everywhere and nowhere. The public sphere in Iran is a bus, or a taxi, moving from one station to the other. There was a time when some taxi drivers in Iran had a sign on their window reading, ‘No Political Discussion Please!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392111429222">5</xref></sup> The public sphere in Iran is mobile, and the publics comprising it are temporary and fluid. Individuals move in and out of these ‘fluid publics’, and it is within these movements that their opinions are formed, shared and expressed.</p>
<p>The boundary-less public sphere, with its fluid publics that are continuously made and unmade, is not unique to Iran. This seems to be the characteristic of many countries with a long history of authoritarian rule, where politics is so close – yet so far – from the everyday life of the people, and where the institutionalization of the public sphere has constantly been interrupted by the state. For example, writing about the Arab Middle East, Asef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429222">Bayat (2003)</xref> refers to the ‘Arab Street’ as an ‘expression of public opinion and collective sentiment’. He states that the ‘Arab Street’ is a ‘political street’ where ordinary people who are excluded from positions of power craft their politics. ‘[T]he street’, Bayat states, ‘represents a complex entity wherein sentiments and outlooks are formed, spread and expressed in a unique fashion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429222">Bayat, 2003</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>By introducing the term ‘fluid public’, I am situating myself in a dialogue with Hardt and Negri’s <italic>Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire</italic> (2005). By presenting the concept of ‘multitude’, Hardt and Negri attempt to conceptualize a new model of resistance to global capitalism that ironically is enabled by globalization itself. The multitude is composed of a multiplicity of singularities, or of all the diverse figures of social production. What brings these dispersed and ontologically different social subjects together is their common interest in resisting the ‘empire’. Hardt and Negri state that the Internet provides a good model for the multitude because the Internet, too, is composed of a multiplicity of nodes that are dispersed yet connected in the web. The challenge, as they rightly highlight, is ‘for the social multiplicity to manage to communicate and act in common while remaining internally different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429222">Hardt and Negri, 2005</xref>: xiv).</p>
<p>My concept of ‘fluid publics’ resembles Hardt and Negri’s concept of the multitude. However, while the multitude seems to be conscious of its own existence and the commonality of the threat it faces (i.e. the empire), fluid publics are not. Fluid publics are the temporary coming together of singularities. Individuals move in and out of these fluid publics, discuss common problems, share their complaints and offer their explanations, without realizing ‘the web’ that connects them to one another, without realizing that the conversations at the bus station, in taxis, at the hair salon or with the grocer could potentially highlight different aspects of the same thing – their resistance to or frustrations with the (political) power that shapes their lives. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429222">Bayat (2009)</xref> rightly points out, it is not clear how the multitude that is composed of different subjects and subjectivities finds the common ground for its actions. How these different components with their different interests and identities come to act together is not conceptualized.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to move beyond Hardt and Negri’s multitude, I conceptualize polling as one of the ways in which the ‘web’ that connects the different fluid publics could be drawn. Obviously there are many factors that contribute to the formation of this ‘web’ and the coming together of fluid publics. The Internet, social networks, elections, rallies and the media could facilitate the coming together of fluid publics both physically and conceptually. However, here I focus on polling as one such factor. As Jacqueline Urla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429222">1993</xref>: 818) indicates:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the hands of the socially or politically disenfranchised, numbers may also be a language of social contestation, a way that ethnic groups, women and minorities can make themselves visible, articulate their ‘differences’ from the dominant society, and make claims upon the state and its services.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is this possibility for the articulation of differences that could potentially turn public polling into a useful means in the hands of the social movement activists. The question then becomes what role public polling played in the transformation of fluid publics to counter-publics? How were the nodes, the various fluid publics that compose Iranian civil society, connected to one another through polling? What effects did polling results have on the public whose very opinions composed those results?</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the Iranian pollsters, I believe, was to engage in a classification struggle, ‘in the struggles about the meaning of the social world’ that according to Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429222">1984</xref>: 479) is the ‘power over the classificatory schemes and systems which are the basis of the representations of the groups and therefore of their mobilization and demobilization’. In order for a public to be conceived as a public – or even in order for it to conceive of itself as such – it has ‘to get itself recognized’. ‘The imposition of a recognized name’, Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429222">1984</xref>: 480) argues, ‘is an act of recognition of full social existence which transmutes the thing named’. Thus, I illustrate that the ultimate output of the API polls was not a set of raw numbers and statistics. The specific modes of interpretation of the poll data and their dissemination through the reformist press and media underlined certain features of the responses to signify the existence of a counter-public, which was labeled as ‘reform advocates’. This counter-public did not precede the polls, but was constituted by the practice of polling. Following Lewis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429222">1999</xref>: 203), then, I argue that ‘Polls do not so much represent “the public” as signify it within a carefully structured framework.’</p>
<p>In what follows, I contextualize my argument by drawing on the case of API in Iran. In doing so, I also illustrate the processes through which the API pollsters transformed fluid publics into a counter-public, a practice that was not a risk-free endeavor and which led to their imprisonment.</p>

<title>Research methods</title>
<p>API was officially founded in 1996, and I started my work with them as a research coordinator in 1997. This article draws heavily on my own experiences and observations between 1997 and 2001 when I left the job. During this time, I took notes from my many informal conversations with the pollsters, the API staff, the respondents and the journalists and activists who frequently visited the polling institute. In 2005, three years after the government shut down the institution, I interviewed Hossein Ghazian, one of the founding members and the former director of API, about the history of API and the significance of their work. In the same year, I located and conducted interviews with two of the institute’s former research coordinators and a dozen of their interviewers. In order to be able to highlight the sociohistorical processes and the background against which API was formed, and to offer an accurate account of the events that led to the arrest of the pollsters and to follow the aftermath of their imprisonment, I conducted an archival study and collected news items and reports that were published on the case. Drawing on the case of API, I demonstrate how public polling in Iran was used as a resistant strategy to create a counter-public that served as the backbone of the reform movement.</p>

<title>Formation of the Ayandeh Polling Institute</title>
<p>Nearly two years after its establishment in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran called for a Cultural Revolution that led to almost a decade of intense Islamization of the public sphere – with a focus on schools and universities as the most influential institutions in creating new citizens with new mindsets. The Cultural Revolution Committee called for the temporary closure of universities, and demanded the Islamization of existing disciplines and the replacement of unorthodox, ‘westoxicated’ faculty members with more ‘committed’ and ‘pious’ ones. The Cultural Revolution failed to fully achieve either of these goals. Nevertheless, during this time, and also due to the post-revolutionary upheavals and the eight-year war with Iraq, sociology remained dormant.</p>
<p>With the termination of war in 1988 and the coming to power of Hashemi Rafsanjani as president, the postwar reconstruction era (1988–1997) began. During this time, both the developmentalist state and the sociologists made efforts to re-establish sociology, which had suffered from the political climate of the country. In this period, the Iranian Sociological Association was established, sociological texts (mostly American textbooks) were extensively translated and the appeal for empiricism pushed the developmentalist state to establish research centers in different ministries and governmental organizations. Sociology, in general, turned into a discipline whose only function was to employ statistical measures to produce numbers and figures for different organizations and/or ministries. As a result, Iranian sociology was haunted by what C Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429222">Mills (1959)</xref> calls ‘abstracted empiricism’. Abstracted empiricists, according to Mills, are systematically ahistorical and non-comparative; they deal with small-scale areas. Iranian sociology in this period was developing in two dimensions, policy sociology and professional sociology – one serving the needs of the state, the other the needs of the universities, both irrelevant to the problems of the general public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392111429222">6</xref></sup> Moreover, most of the work in these fields took the shape of nicely bound research reports that sat on the bookshelves of the newly established research centers.</p>
<p>With the election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997 and the coming to power of the reformists – former revolutionaries who were shoved aside in the late 1980s – a new era began. The reformist faction that came to power was backed by 20 million popular votes (77%), and therefore promised a more inclusive polity based on popular will. The reformist president was simultaneously the advocate of ‘dialog among civilizations’ abroad, and the promoter of freedom of expression inside the country. The political atmosphere intolerant of critical intellectual opinions was largely alleviated. Sociology was revitalized. Sociologists were asked to give their expert opinions on many governmental projects, and in fact many sociologists nested in governmental research centers, while others were recruited as the advisors to different segments of the reformist government. For example, the first national survey on ‘The Values and Attitudes of Iranians’ was conducted and published by a group of sociologists associated with and based in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.</p>
<p>In the years after the Islamic revolution, the Iranian public sphere had never looked as effervescent and vibrant. It is against this background that the significance of API and the importance of its polling practices should be understood. API was officially founded in 1996. Its founders, coming from across different social science disciplines, were former revolutionaries who had held official positions within the establishment in the early 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011392111429222">7</xref></sup> In the late 1980s, however, a set of ideological changes within the Islamic Republic led to the disintegration of the revolutionary forces. With the developments of the late 1980s, the founders of API, among many others, were shoved aside from the polity, only to reappear as the leading reformist figures in the late 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392111429222">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an interview, Hossein Ghazian explained to me that establishing a research institute was aimed at carving out an autonomous space, which would function as the convergence point of their otherwise-scattered efforts in combining sociological studies with political activism for democratic freedom. Among the members of the institution were several publishers, editors of the chief reformist newspapers, lawyers, university professors and journalists. Thus, API eventually became a venue wherein a variety of intellectual opinions and agendas were produced and then disseminated.</p>
<p>API started its public opinion surveys in the fall of 1996 by gauging public opinion about the ‘Gandhi Street Murder’, which had turned into a huge public concern. The case involved a teenage couple murdering the girl’s younger sibling who had witnessed the couple having intercourse, out of the fear that their ‘illegitimate’ relationship might be revealed. The case became a public controversy. The more conservative faction of the state argued that ‘the people’ believed the incident to have had its roots in the cultural invasion of the West through satellite channels, and therefore demanded banning the satellites. The more liberal faction of the state, along with some civil society activists, argued that ‘the people’ believed the incident to have had its roots in the excessive restrictions imposed on the relationship of boys and girls, and therefore demanded the revision of these restrictive norms and approaches.</p>
<p>Ghazian explained that API’s initial goal in conducting a poll about the case was to provide ‘a realistic image of the public opinion’, and therefore help move away from ‘a culture based on rumor, guesswork and speculation’. Although, taking into account that the reformist faction was pushing for the loosening of social and political regulation, it was obvious that API also aimed to mobilize numbers to resist the efforts of conservatives to ban satellite channels. The poll results were later submitted to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to be used as the proof of ‘what the people <italic>really</italic> think’ about the case.</p>
<p>With the 1997 presidential contest nearing, API started gauging public opinion about the upcoming elections. Ghazian gives two reasons for the institute’s reliance on public opinion surveys rather than other research methods:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>First of all different groups in the society were speaking of and for the people. Each group was presenting itself as the people’s guardian. We were therefore really curious to figure out what people <italic>really</italic> think, to provide content for the vacant concept of ‘the people’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, as he points out, it was also important that API prove the scientific rigor of its claims, in order to make them more appealing and convincing for the academic circles (i.e. professional sociologists) who still considered empirical research as the most (if not the only) valid form of sociological research. The claim to ‘scientificity’ could also postpone repressions by the state, the pollsters hoped.</p>
<p>The performance of API in accurately forecasting the surprising outcome of the 1997 presidential elections to within 0.6% of the final results was an indication to the people – and to policy-makers – of the reliability of the measure. Polling, therefore, became an important aspect of reform government, and poll results were often cited in official reports and speeches. The significance of API’s polls was that, through the newly established reformist press and tribunes, the polls would make their way into the public sphere and steer debates around different issues – from the progression of Iran’s national soccer team to the 1998 World Cup and President Khatami’s interview with the CNN in the same year, to Tehran’s International Book Exhibition and the state’s foreign policies. Polls provided feedback from citizens, and therefore assisted the reformists in their agenda-setting. To invoke Burawoy’s terminology, polling at this particular time in Iran became the convergence point of professional, policy and public sociologies. This was, perhaps, one of the unique features of API, since until that point the conducting of public opinion surveys was either monopolized by state organizations or was conducted merely for academic purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392111429222">9</xref></sup> This was the first time in Iran’s history that public opinion surveys actually became public.</p>
<p>Over the six years of its operation (1996–2002), API conducted public opinion surveys on a variety of social, cultural and political issues. The results of those surveys typically presented a picture of a differentiated society that did not fit the official thesis of national unity, and hence questioned the regime’s claim to represent ‘the people’. API’s reputation and their political and institutional ties did not go unnoticed by the Gallup Organization, which made use of API in the 2002 Gallup Poll of the Islamic World. The project entailed interviews with 10,000 people from nine predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran. For the conservative faction, who were dismayed not only by the polls being conducted but also by the publication of the poll results, the subcontract with the Gallup ‘spying organization’ offered the best opportunity to put an end to the polling practices of API. In 2002, the pollsters were arrested and API was shut down. The closure of API was, as it turned out, the beginning of a process that led to the complete dampening of the reform movement and the coming to power of Ahmadinejad and the conservatives in the 2005 presidential elections.</p>
<p>Implicit in the charges announced against the pollsters was the significant power conferred upon polls – a power that seemingly stemmed from the ability of polls to constitute publics that challenged the regime’s undifferentiated notion of ‘the people’. Ever since its establishment, the Iranian state had prided itself on the support of the overwhelming majority (over 98%) who had voted in favor of the Islamic regime at the point of its inception. The publication of poll results by API constantly challenged the image of an undifferentiated nation in support of the Islamic state. Thus, during the reform era, the media had become a site of contestation between the self-claimed representatives of two publics: the official public that was constituted through the regime’s official channels, and the counter-public that was constituted through polling and the reformist press. The shutting down of API and the arrest of its pollsters, the massive closure of the reformist press, the arrests of the journalists and civil society activists and the targeting of NGOs were all steps by the regime to reverse the process through which fluid publics had been transformed into a counter-public.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392111429222">
<title>Transformation of ‘fluid publics’ into a ‘counter-public’</title>
<p>As I argued earlier, polling offered reformists the means to connect otherwise disconnected fluid publics and transform them into a solid counter-public that could then be continuously invoked and mobilized to legitimize the reform. Polling practices turned fluid publics into a visible entity. The counter-public was made ‘real’ through quantification. Here, I illustrate this process by highlighting the context and explaining the mechanisms through which this goal was attained.</p>
<p>The election of Mohammad Khatami, the reformist candidate, on 23 May 1997 was one of those rare occasions when the importance of ‘fluid publics’ became apparent. In a period of 16 years prior to the 1997 presidential elections, Iran had seen four presidents. The first was impeached and removed from office in less than a year, and the second assassinated in 14 days. Ali Khamenei, the third president, was in office for two consecutive terms up until Ayatollah Khomeini’s death when Khamenei became the Supreme Leader of the country. Akbar Rafsanjani, formerly speaker of the Iranian parliament, subsequently occupied the presidency for two consecutive terms.</p>
<p>Until 1997, then, there was no real competition among the presidential candidates. The winning candidate was always predictable from the outset since there was only one candidate on the list who was influential and well-known across the nation. In the 1997 presidential elections there were two main candidates on the list: Mohammad Khatami and Ali Akbar Nategh Nouri. One was supported by a group of former revolutionaries – the reformists – who had been shoved aside from the polity in the late 1980s. In fact, the candidate of their choice, Mohammad Khatami, had himself resigned from the office of Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance in 1989 in objection to the dominant policies of the time. He had then served as the head of the National Library of Iran for five years and had almost disappeared from the political scene. On the other hand, Nategh Nouri was very well-known as the speaker of the Iranian parliament, and was backed by almost all the hardliners, including the leader and the Guardian Council. The 1997 presidential elections, therefore, looked no different from the previous ones. Everyone was certain that Nategh Nouri would become the fifth president of Iran. The results, however, proved otherwise. Khatami had gradually won the voters’ hearts during the election campaign, and he eventually became the talk of the town. One could hear people discussing him in taxis, at grocery stores, in family gatherings, at banks; everywhere and yet nowhere officially. It was amid these fluid publics that the ‘alternative’ was taking shape.</p>
<p>A few days before the elections, a cartoon that depicted a ballot box with the caption, ‘<italic>Write</italic> Khatami, <italic>Read</italic> Nategh Nouri’ became very popular and was widely distributed. The cartoon referred to the widely shared belief that ‘people’s votes do not count’, and that the outcome of the elections had already been determined from the ‘top’. In the meantime, API was monitoring the movements at the ‘bottom’. On 23 May 1997, the 20 million votes cast in favor of Mohammad Khatami caught everyone, even the reformist candidate himself, by surprise. This feeling of surprise was eventually transformed into a feeling of empowerment. It was through the polls and the voting ballots that the ‘fluid publics’ consolidated as a self-conscious counter-public. People realized the power of their opinions through their votes. Therefore, in the eight years of reform that followed, a hope for change in the execution of political power coupled with people’s boosted confidence contributed to and facilitated the introduction of opinion polls. Moreover, since people have limited access to means of opinion expression, opinion measurement (polling) became a major venue for that expression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392111429222">10</xref></sup> People who until then did not believe in the anonymity of polls – who were concerned about personal safety, who believed that this was ‘just a show’, or ‘would be used for propaganda purposes’ – discovered new potential in the polls. As one of the API pollsters put it, ‘people discovered the power of “one” and we discovered the power of adding up the numbers!’</p>
<p>The majority of API pollsters admit that the overall climate had made polling much easier. The few who had previous experiences with polling or interviewing emphasized that ‘all the talk about freedom of speech and reform had made people believe that their opinions matter and will be listened to, and will be taken into account’. Moreover, as one of the pollsters pointed out, ‘the unexpected landslide victory of Khatami had given people the courage to speak their minds’.</p>
<p>Realizing the importance of fluid publics, API pollsters invested in them further. In order to design their questionnaires they would send their interviewers – most of them young social-science students – to the streets and amid the fluid publics where they would extract the widest possible range of responses to their questions. The fluid publics in this sense did not just <italic>take</italic> the positions, but contributed to the <italic>production</italic> of new positions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429222">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>: 128). For example, one of the questions that the pollsters wanted to put on their questionnaire was about the sources through which people gather the news. Prior to this particular poll, the options were usually limited to ‘TV, Radio, Newspaper, Family, Friends, Colleagues, Other’. The category ‘Other’ usually included ‘irrelevant responses’ or the options that were not officially sanctioned and therefore not ‘measurable’. It was by turning this ‘other’ into ‘measurable’ entities that the API pollsters initiated a classification struggle – the search for a name, a label, a category that could describe this ‘other’.</p>
<p>With a sample questionnaire in hand, API pollsters were sent out to the streets amid the fluid publics to collect and test the possible ‘options’. In a meeting with the project coordinator, the majority of the pollsters mentioned that people in the streets, in taxis, at banks, in the bookstore, at the supermarket would talk about the commentaries they had heard on the satellite channels. Thus, ‘satellite channels’ found its way onto the API’s questionnaire as ‘one of the sources through which people gather the news’. I personally recall that when asked about ‘the sources through which they gather the news’, respondents were most often surprised to see ‘satellite channels’ as one of the options, mainly because satellite channels were ‘officially’ banned in Iran. The respondents were given the opportunity to <italic>reveal</italic> that they watch satellite channels, despite the fact that their satellite receivers on the roof were <italic>concealed</italic> under a thick fabric! Since the satellite receivers were covered, there was no way to determine how many households in Tehran had them. With the publication of the poll results, however, the individual acts of ‘illegality’ were connected to one another to form a counter-public that could be mobilized to oppose the ban on satellite channels.</p>
<p>Moreover, polls usually prompted individuals to engage their neighbors and/or family members in discussions about the questions. The pollsters described several incidents of their questions being followed by or preceding a discussion about the issues. Polling steered a conversation among the respondents. One of the pollsters recalled that ‘an older woman once called out for her son to come and help her answer the questions’. She added that what was supposed to be a Q&amp;A session between the pollster and the respondent ‘turned into a heated debate between the mother and the son’, who would occasionally ask the pollster to support this or that position. It forced them to think about questions they had never thought about, and while Bourdieu considers this to be ‘the most pernicious effect of polling’, I find its impact to be empowering in the Iranian case. It was this aspect of polling that helped lengthen the fluid public’s life span. The moment of the interview would become the convergence point of all the scattered fluid publics that had shaped the individual’s life on that day, week or month. The moment of the interview would become the moment at which the individual would become part of a larger public. The public in this sense was the outcome of the polls.</p>
<p>The most important step in API’s work was the publication of the polls. The reform movement brought with it the establishment of new alternative intellectual spaces (research institutions, discussion groups and so on) and the launching of new media spaces (newspapers, weblogs, etc.). The publication and citation of the results of the polls in media spaces made public opinion public. In other words, it helped transform ‘private opinions’ (opinions we keep to ourselves) into public opinion (opinions shared with others).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011392111429222">11</xref></sup> Prior to this, public opinion surveys, when and if conducted, were privately appropriated by different state organizations. By publicizing the results of polls, the reformist pollsters brought to the foreground the plurality and diversity of ‘the people’ that the state claimed to represent.</p>
<p>The results of the polls, therefore, were distributed both through official channels (newspapers) and through unofficial channels (indirect citations by journalists, lectures and speeches given by political activists, classroom lectures, word of mouth, weblogs and so on).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0011392111429222">12</xref></sup> API also held periodic meetings wherein intellectuals and activists would gather and discuss the results of the surveys, the recent social and political events and the future prospects of the movement. Participants came from different backgrounds and occupations. Among them were publishers, members of different political parties, university professors, journalists, editors-in-chief of the reformist presses, lawyers, members of the Iranian parliament and sometimes even government officials. These people, along with the young social-science students who were working for API as interviewers, were acting as distributive points in the network that formed between the pollsters and the fluid publics. The publication of the polls cracked the image of an undifferentiated nation and made many realize that a ‘public’ other than the one found in the state-owned media was not only possible, but ‘real’, ‘out there’.</p>
<p>One good example is the publication of a poll conducted for the foreign affairs and national security committee of the Iranian parliament at a time when the reformists held the majority. This poll showed that 74% of Iranians favored unfreezing relations with the United States. The results of this poll were disclosed on 22 September 2002 by IRNA (the Islamic Republic’s News Agency), which was headed by Abdollah Ramezanzadeh, a reformist figure. This was in complete contrast to the official image of the public presented by the more conservative apparatuses of the state. In response to the poll, Ayatollah Javadi Amoli – a prominent conservative cleric – in his Friday Prayers sermons stated, ‘The Iranians are insistent in their fight against the Great Satan [the United States] and will not be influenced by some fabricated polls.’ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leader of the Islamic Republic, had also stated that the majority of Iranians were against conducting a dialogue with the United States, and that those who felt otherwise were either ‘ignorant of the abc’s of politics’ or ‘lacked national pride’.</p>
<p>The publication of the polls in September was followed by the arrest of the pollsters in October. In a statement issued by the court, the pollsters were accused of having connections with and selling information to ‘the enemy of the Islamic Republic of Iran’, and ‘receiving financial aid for these activities’. The statement made it clear that the pollsters’ ‘crime’ was that they had conducted a poll for the Gallup Organization, ‘which is affiliated with the US Department of Foreign Affairs’. The poll was defined as a ‘suspicious activity’ because, the statement added, ‘the pollsters had received 400,000,000 Rials [US$40,000] for a survey that only costs 400,000 Rials [US$400]’ (<italic>Afarinesh</italic>, 4 December 2002). A few weeks later, Ayatollah Jannati, preaching in the Friday Prayers, thanked the Judiciary for dealing with ‘the agents behind the opinion polls’, which were, according to him, ‘aimed at weakening the will of the people against the Americans’ (IRNA, 20 December 2002). Jannati referred to the polls as an act of ‘treason’, and added:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The foreigners are after creating a false atmosphere to contribute to tensions in the country, but the agents of the enemy have acknowledged the offenses and have confessed to their ties with the foreign elements and the enemies of the Islamic Revolution.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact of the matter, however, was that the poll on the US–Iran relationship was conducted for the Foreign Affairs and National Security Committee of the Iranian parliament. The poll that was conducted for Gallup was part of a larger project in which 10,000 residents of nine Islamic countries – including Iran – were polled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0011392111429222">13</xref></sup> In the former, 74% of the Iranians questioned had expressed their will to resume ties with the US. In the latter, however, more than 60% of Iranians had expressed their negative views about the US and its actions in the region – something that was immediately picked up and published by the conservative newspaper <italic>Kayhan</italic> (28 February 2002). In a lecture that was delivered on 6 April 2003, Ayatollah Khamenei also cited the Gallup polls to substantiate his claims about the Muslims’ grievances with ‘the West’.</p>
<p>This incident indicates that poll results are susceptible to different interpretations, which in turn, signify different kinds of publics. While the conservatives emphasized the 60% of Iranians who had negative views about the US, the reformists highlighted the 74% who were in favor of unfreezing relations with the United States – one constituting a public, the other a counter-public. This incident also demonstrates that grasping the effects of polling requires an understanding not only of domestic politics, but also of the geopolitics of the day. The propagation of this newly formed counter-public was in line with the political agenda of both the US officials and the reformists. In a series of attempts, both parties had shown interest in unfreezing relations between Iran and the US. Hooshang Amirahmadi, the founder and president of the American Iranian Council, a US-based think tank, refers to some of these attempts: ‘the Iranian media have opened the door to discussing what used to be a taboo subject in Tehran. . . . Five years ago no one dared speak openly and favorably about the US in Iran. Now, entire magazine issues are dedicated to the subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392111429222">Amirahmadi, 1997</xref>). Moreover, in 1998 – almost 20 years after the siege of the US embassy in Tehran – in a symbolic act aimed at reconciliation, Abbas Abdi, one of the founders of API and also one of the students involved in the hostage crisis of 1979, met with Barry Rosen, one of his captives.</p>
<p>The point, then, is not who the ‘true’ representative of the people was, but how two competing factions constituted competing notions of ‘truth’. The polls in this context helped reveal the tensions not only at the domestic level between different factions of the state and among the citizenry, but also at the international level between Iran and the US. And, in this day and age, to invoke C Wright Mills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429222">1959</xref>: 191), the presentation of conflicting definitions of reality itself is liberating.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has shown how, at a particular juncture in Iranian history, polling contributed to the formation of a counter-public that would serve as a legitimizing force for reform. In analysing the polling practices of the Ayandeh Polling Institute, I have wanted to highlight how poll results could do more than just represent, persuade or manipulate public opinion. Poll results could contribute to the production of alternative ‘truths’ – alternative concepts and categories – that could then be invoked to constitute counter-publics. In turning latent opinions into measurable entities, the reformists found a reliable means of documenting dissent and difference. They not only acknowledged and signified the existence of such opinions, but also by repacking and representing them with new terms and labels, brought into being new publics with new subjectivities. The political struggle in this sense became a struggle between competing notions of truth, the power of which depends on its ability to not only resonate with, but also contribute to the constitution and mobilization of these newly formed publics.</p>
<p>I also emphasized that this reading of polling practices and their effects should be contextualized within the broader historical processes that have shaped the Iranian public sphere. Polling and its effects are empirical matters embedded in history and contingent on social and political factors. Thus, the particular reading of polling practices and their effects, which is set forth in this article, may or may not be applicable to other contexts and situations. However, the method for its analysis is: any study that deals with sociology of a particular form of knowledge – here poll results – and its application in political struggles should simultaneously include a study of the broader social, political and historical processes.</p>
<p>This article has highlighted the importance of macro-historical processes in understanding polling practices and in interpreting their effects. Nevertheless, it has also drawn attention to the micro-interactional impacts of polling practices on the pollsters and the publics whose opinions are gauged. The meanings that are attached to polling practices vary across time and space and these different meanings create different dynamics between the pollsters and the publics. To comprehend and analyze these different dynamics, a focus on the micro-interactional processes is required: What are the effects of polling questions and options on the respondents? What goes on between the pollster and the individual respondent at the moment of polling? What meanings do they attach to these practices? What impacts do the dissemination and publication of poll results have on people? These are the questions that the sociology of polling should attend to. The answers to these questions demonstrate that knowledge production is never a neutral process. It is rather contested, conflicted and often embedded in significant struggles over whose research – whose knowledge – is valid and legitimate. In utilizing an academic research method, the reformists in Iran not only participated in the process of (political) knowledge production, but also struggled to secure legitimacy and popularize the (political) knowledge that was produced through opinion polls.</p>

<p>I am utilizing Burawoy’s typology of sociology which divides sociology into four types: professional sociology, policy sociology, critical sociology and public sociology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429222">Burawoy, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>For example, Abbas Abdi, one of the founders of API, was a leading member of the revolutionary student group that had occupied the US embassy in Tehran, on 4. November 1979. He had later joined the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security. And Ghazian, the other founder of the API, used to be the advisor to the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance.</p>

<p>As Keshavarzian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392111429222">2005</xref>: 65) notes, elite cleavages should not be interpreted as ‘an aberration in Iran’s authoritarianism’. Rather, as he rightly argues, they are an essential component of the Iranian regime, which he labels as ‘fragmented authoritarianism’. ‘[T]hus,’ he writes, ‘this constellation of state institutions bends – in order to accommodate rapid swings from more inclusionary to more exclusionary modes of interest representation – without breaking the authoritarian status quo.’</p>

<p>In 1965, the National Radio and Television Organization of Iran started conducting public opinion surveys about the quality and popularity of its programs. In 1966, the organization established the ‘Opinion Measurement Committee’, which was in charge of conducting surveys about a variety of issues at a national level. In the years that followed the 1979 revolution, this committee continued its work. After the revolution, the Ministry of Information and National Security established a couple of survey institutions (i.e. Kherad Polling Institutions). For more information on the history of public opinion surveys in Iran, see <italic>Hamshahri-e Maah</italic> (July 2005).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0011392111429222">
<label>10.</label>
<p>This is due to the fact that the Iranian television and radio are state-owned; publication of books requires prior permission from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance; and the press, although not subject to pre-publication censorship, is closely monitored.</p>

<p>The API pollsters made sure that the message got out through informal channels as well. The founders of API were connected to different networks. For example, Ghazian was an independent researcher, journalist and a member in the advisory committees of different presses. Abdi was a prominent reformist figure, and a member of the editorial board of some of the most influential of reformist newspapers. He was also a member of Mosharekat Party which was founded after the reformists’ victory in 1997 presidential elections. Among the other founders and board members were Alavitabar, who was a member of the editorial board of one of the most influential reformist newspapers, and also taught at the Public Management Educational Center, and Akbari, who was a university professor and advisor to some of the major reformist presses.</p>
