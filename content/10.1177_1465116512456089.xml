<abstract>
<p>This article examines the extent to which individual-, party- and system-level characteristics affect the attitude congruence of voters and candidates for elections to the European Parliament. It examines attitudes towards basic policy packages in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian issue domains and on immigration and European Union integration. The analysis is based on the 2009 European Election Study and European Election Candidate Survey, which covered 27 countries of the European Union (EU), 162 parties and over 11,500 respondents. It shows that the European Parliament suffers from inequalities in representation for different groups of citizens, representing much better the attitudes of educated, middle-class and politically knowledgeable voters. Furthermore, the analysis uncovers significant differences across political parties in how well they match up to voters. We provide tentative evidence suggesting that voters are better represented in open and ordered ballot systems.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1465116512456089" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores factors determining how well voters are represented in the European Parliament (EP). In their quest to explore the quality of representation in democratic elections, many scholars have employed the Responsible Party Model (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1465116512456089">Thomassen, 1994</xref>), which sees political parties as major actors by and through which representation is realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1465116512456089">Sartori, 1968</xref>: 471). Studies based on this model have established that the preconditions for effective representation are largely fulfilled at the European level. Voters in European elections have a choice between a considerable number of parties that are ideologically as distinctive and cohesive as national parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1465116512456089">Schmitt and Thomassen, 1999</xref>). Voters are able to recognize ideological differences between parties and consider them at the ballot box in European elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1465116512456089">Van der Brug and Van der Eijk, 1999</xref>). In addition, the party space in the EP reflects the national political space, with left/right as the major dimension of competition (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1465116512456089">Schmitt and Thomassen, 2000</xref>). When it comes to the left/right dimension, voters, at least those from Western Europe, are well represented in the European Parliament. However, little is known about the quality of representation in the EP beyond left/right, although there are some indications that representation on issues is much poorer than on left/right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1465116512456089">Thomassen and Schmitt, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1465116512456089">1999</xref>). What has also remained unexplored so far is whether the quality of representation in the EP varies for different groups of citizens, parties and countries. These lacunae in our knowledge of representation at the European level led us to enquire which individual-, party- and system-level characteristics influence the quality of the democratic representation of voters on political issues.</p>
<p>This article is based on the delegate model of representation to analyse the quality of the link between voters and their representatives. In the delegate model, representatives are expected to act as the voice of those who are not present in the representative body (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1465116512456089">Pitkin, 1967</xref>: 133). This link between voters and representatives will be effective if political decision makers enter the policy process with the same issue preferences as those who voted for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512456089">Dalton, 2002</xref>: 217). If the attitudes of representatives resemble those of voters, their actions and decisions can be expected to be in line with the political preferences of the citizens they represent (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1465116512456089">Holmberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1465116512456089">Thomassen, 1994</xref>). In order to examine the mass–elite linkage, this article focuses on the congruence of issue attitudes between voters and their representatives in the European Parliament. It focuses on attitude congruence on basic packages of policy opinion in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian issue domains as well as on issues of immigration and EU integration. In doing so, it contributes to an extensive literature on substantive representation, which investigates whether the issue positions of governments, political parties and actors reflect the attitudes of voters (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1465116512456089">Huber and Powell, 1994</xref>). This literature takes a well-established place in research on representation, next to studies that focus on symbolic and descriptive representation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1465116512456089">Pitkin, 1967</xref>), which examine whether the presence of representatives with certain ascriptive characteristics, such as race or gender, affects the attitudes of groups with the same characteristics and the extent to which these representatives represent such groups better than other representatives (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1465116512456089">Childs, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The major aim of this article is to assess which voters are best represented in the European Parliament and which party- and system-level characteristics account for the congruence in positions of voters and parties. So far, our knowledge about determinants of representation in European elections is very limited. The few studies that focus on representation in elections teach us that parties that project clear cues represent their voters better than parties with less clear cues. We also know that representation is better in countries with proportional representation and in countries with a large number of parties (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512456089">Dalton, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1465116512456089">Thomassen and Schmitt, 1997</xref>). However, little is known about the extent to which individual-level characteristics affect representation. Moreover, conclusions reached so far about representation in European elections are limited in scope. They focus on representation in terms of left/right or on issues related to the EU. There are yet other domains that have not been studied. Our analysis of voter–elite congruence in several issue domains shows that citizens with higher levels of education and political knowledge, as well as those belonging to higher social classes, have their attitudes generally better represented in all issue domains. This article also shows that parties with a clear ideological profile represent their voters better than do other parties, and radical right parties represent their voters better on issues of immigration and EU integration. Further, we offer tentative evidence for better representation in open and ordered ballot systems.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1465116512456089"><title>Representation in the European Parliament</title>
<p>The linkage between citizens and political decision makers is one of the most important topics in the study of democratic political systems (for example, Shapiro et al., 2010). Although there are various links in the political chain of democratic command and control, the congruence between the issue attitudes of voters and political elites has been a key topic in studies in representation. In this perspective it is assumed that policy outcomes are likely to reflect citizen preferences if representatives share the opinions of their voters (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1465116512456089">Miller and Stokes, 1963</xref>). The concept of congruence between the issue attitudes of political elites and citizens has been acknowledged as important for analysing the quality of representation (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1465116512456089">Powell, 2000</xref>). In European parliamentary systems, political parties are central to the process of representation (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1465116512456089">Thomassen, 1994</xref>). Therefore, studies of representation in Europe have mostly focused on the voter–party dyad. We follow this approach and examine the congruence between the attitudes of voters and political elites from the party they voted for in the last EP elections. Certainly, policy outcomes may be suboptimal from the perspective of voters even if representatives share issue attitudes with their electorate, because many factors play a role in the process of decision-making. This article will not consider the complex picture of what determines representative policy outcomes, but will simply focus on the congruence between the issue attitudes of voters and political elites as an indicator of representational quality.</p>
<p>We will consider congruence on basic packages of political attitudes that have been important for party competition in all parliamentary systems in both Western and East Central Europe (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512456089">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1465116512456089">1</xref></sup> We distinguish between issues in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains as well as issues related to immigration and EU integration. The socioeconomic domain pertains to topics such as state ownership, the role of private enterprise and state intervention in the economy, and the redistribution of income and wealth, while the libertarian/authoritarian domain includes attitudes towards societal and personal freedoms, such as equal treatment of women and homosexuals. In addition, we conduct separate analyses for attitudes towards immigration and European integration because these issues have gained importance in political discourse in recent years (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512456089">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The congruence of attitudes between voters and representatives may vary across groups of issues. Scholarly literature shows that the attitudes of voters and political elites are structured by at least two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1465116512456089">Thomassen and Schmitt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512456089">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>). Because there is no consensus on whether attitudes towards immigration and European integration are strongly related to these dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512456089">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1465116512456089">Van der Brug and Van Spanje, 2009</xref>), we have decided to treat issues of immigration and EU integration separately from the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains. Because several dimensions structure public opinion, voters may not be equally well represented in all issue domains by the party of their choice. Our cross-country analysis focuses on factors that generally account for better representation in all issue domains, and also includes variables (mostly at the level of parties) that may account for better representation in some issue domains but not in others. In the following, we examine which individual-, party- and system-level characteristics affect the congruence of attitudes between voters and their party on socioeconomic, libertarian/authoritarian issues, immigration and EU integration.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1465116512456089"><title>Individual-level characteristics</title>
<p>There are reasons to expect that candidates running in the EP elections will better represent the more-educated, middle- and higher-class strata of society. Candidates to become a member of the EP are likely to be highly educated, potentially coming from the middle- or upper-class themselves. These candidates are ready to live in a different country and interact at an international level and are less reliant on national identity in their perceptions of political problems (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512456089">Hooghe and Marks, 2008</xref>). Studies show that, after having been elected to the EP, the majority of candidates pursue European careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1465116512456089">Scarrow, 1997</xref>). This might be indicative of a certain self-selection of political candidates given their background and readiness to leave the national political sphere in favour of the European one. There is also evidence that representatives at the local and national level are mostly middle-class and well-educated, which can result in better representation of these particular groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116512456089">Schattschneider, 1975</xref>). Another reason more-educated and higher-class voters may be better represented in European elections could be related to party strategy. Because better-educated and middle-class voters are more likely to turn out in the EP elections (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1465116512456089">Franklin, 2007</xref>), parties and their candidates may strategically ignore less-educated voters. In this case, opinion congruence between EP representatives and voters in each issue domain will be better for more-educated and higher-class voters.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (Education):</italic> Education has a positive effect on attitude congruence between voters and their representatives.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (Social class)</italic>: For voters belonging to the middle and upper classes, attitude congruence between them and their representatives will be better than for voters from the working class.</p></disp-quote>How politically informed voters are may also play a role in attitude congruence. As a process of voter representation, democratic elections will function well if voters are aware of the political stances of candidates and parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1465116512456089">Van der Eijk and Franklin, 1996</xref>). The literature shows that there is considerable variation across individuals in how informed they are about politics (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116512456089">Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996</xref>). Research has shown that the more informed voters are, the more certain they are about their attitudes on political issues and the more likely they are to act upon their attitudes when at the ballot box (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116512456089">Basinger and Lavine, 2005</xref>). Moreover, well-informed voters are better able to recognize which ideological profiles parties have and which positions they take on concrete issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1465116512456089">Van der Brug and Van der Eijk, 1999</xref>). Because politically informed voters are well aware of where parties stand and are most likely to vote upon their attitudes, we can expect them to be most likely to cast an informed choice at the ballot box. This means that the party they choose will reflect their preferences better than parties chosen by less informed voters.</p>
<p>When studying political involvement, scholars distinguish between political knowledge and political interest. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1465116512456089">Luskin (1987)</xref> has shown, these two variables tap into the same latent trait, but measures of political knowledge are less affected by social desirability bias because they are not based on self-reported political interest or involvement. We will therefore examine the effect of political knowledge on the quality of representation.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (Political knowledge)</italic>: Political knowledge has a positive effect on attitude congruence between voters and their representatives.</p></disp-quote>Next to political knowledge, exposure to mobilization efforts in the run-up to the elections may play a role in attitude congruence. Mobilization relates to the persuasive actions of, among others, parties, political candidates and media actors, which stimulate individuals to turn out to vote. As a result of these efforts, voters are provided with information about party stances on issues and about characteristics of candidates that they may find appealing (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116512456089">Rosenstone and Hansen, 1993</xref>). Thus, exposure to mobilization efforts means exposure to politically relevant information. As a result of this exposure, voters acquire certain knowledge. We feel it is important to distinguish between political knowledge and exposure to mobilization efforts, because the former measures voters’ general levels of political information, whereas the latter refers to how much information they are exposed to before the elections.</p>
<p>European elections are less important for voters than national elections because they do not result in government formation, which would directly affect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1465116512456089">Reif and Schmitt, 1980</xref>). Particularly in a second-order election, mobilization efforts are crucial for providing information about parties and convincing voters to turn out to vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1465116512456089">Franklin and Wessels, 2010</xref>). The more voters are exposed to party messages ahead of EP elections, the more we can expect them to be able to assess which party best suits their preferences, which may have consequences for representation.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 4 (Exposure to mobilization efforts)</italic>: More exposure to mobilization efforts leads to more attitude congruence between voters and their representatives.</p></disp-quote>In addition to the four variables for which we have theoretical expectations, we also included the following individual-level control variables for which we do not have such expectations: religion, gender, age and place of residence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1465116512456089"><title>Party-level characteristics</title>
<p>Scholarly literature suggests that sound representation depends partially on the clarity of party positions (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512456089">Dalton, 1985</xref>). Political parties with a clear ideological profile are more likely to provide clear cues that inform voters about their policy positions. The literature so far has assumed that mass parties and non-centrist parties display such ideological clarity (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512456089">Dalton, 1985</xref>). However, from the perspective of voters this may be far from true because they may know the ideological position of some mass or non-centrist parties, but not of others. A significant variation in the ideological clarity of parties can also be expected across party systems. In general, it is less clear for voters in the consolidating democracies of East Central Europe what the ideological profiles of parties are because the party systems are relatively new and fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1465116512456089">Van der Brug et al., 2008</xref>). Given the variation within and across party systems, we conceptualize ideological clarity not with dichotomies but with the extent to which voters in a country agree about the position of political parties in left/right terms. If there is a high level of agreement in a party system where political parties are located on the major dimension of competition (left/right), it is easier for voters to consider which party is closest to their own preferences, so that they are more like to vote for a party that represents their preferences.</p>
<p>We expect variations across issues in how ideological clarity enhances representation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1465116512456089">Van der Brug and Van Spanje (2009)</xref> show that left/right positions of voters are only weakly related to their opinions on immigration and EU integration. Clarity of the ideological profiles of parties’ left/right positions will then not help voters to assess where parties stand on these ‘new’ issues. Yet it will offer information on issues that traditionally belong to this ideological dimension: issues in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 5 (Ideological clarity)</italic>: Greater ideological clarity of a party in left/right terms leads to more attitude congruence between this party and its voters in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains.</p></disp-quote>Irrespective of ideological clarity, some parties may represent their voters better than other parties on some issues. Not all parties in a party system have a clear position on all issues. Whereas older mainstream parties have clear stances on traditional socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian matters, new parties often have a clearer profile on issues that are weakly related to the traditional dimension of competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1465116512456089">Meguid, 2008</xref>). Among the new issue parties, radical right parties have a clear profile on questions such as immigration and EU integration (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512456089">Kitschelt and McGann, 1997</xref>). In turn, green parties strongly stress environmental issues, although these matters remain closely related to economic stances. Moreover, green parties normally take a clear (left-wing) position on socioeconomic issues (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1465116512456089">Burchell, 2002</xref>). Radical left parties take clear stances on a set of issues in the socioeconomic domain. It seems plausible that parties with a particular profile will represent their voters better in related issue domains: radical right parties will better represent their voters on the issue of immigration and EU integration, and radical left parties will better represent voters on socioeconomic issues. Because green parties tend to position themselves clearly on the left side of the socioeconomic dimension (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512456089">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1465116512456089">Van der Brug and Van Spanje, 2009</xref>), we hypothesize that they will represent their voters well on these issues.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 6a (Radical right parties)</italic>: Voters for radical right parties will display high attitude congruence with their parties on issues of immigration and EU integration.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 6b (Green and radical left parties)</italic>: Voters for green and radical left parties will display high attitude congruence with their parties on socioeconomic issues.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1465116512456089"><title>System-level characteristics</title>
<p>Scholarly research has shown that the type of electoral system affects the quality of representation (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1465116512456089">Huber and Powell, 1994</xref>). In 2002, the EU passed legislation establishing Uniform Electoral Procedures for elections to the European Parliament. However, this legislation allows for substantial differences between member states, so that the electoral systems vary with regard to the type of ballot structure (open, ordered or closed) and the average district magnitude (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512456089">Farrell and Scully, 2007</xref>). We can outline two scenarios with regard to how the type of electoral system affects the quality of representation.</p>
<p>In the first scenario we expect closer attitude congruence between voters and their EP representatives in an open ballot system, particularly if the ballot system has large districts. In an open system, candidates campaign more on the basis of their personal reputation than on the basis of the reputation of their party. Such personal vote-seeking increases with the size of the electoral district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512456089">Carey and Shugart, 1995</xref>). In electoral systems with larger districts, candidates have a greater incentive to cultivate personal votes because they need to differentiate themselves from other candidates (of their own party as well as of competing parties). This way of campaigning leads them to provide information to voters about their policy stance on issues, which, in turn, makes it easier for voters to choose a candidate who represents their views well. In closed electoral systems, in contrast, candidates choose between party lists and have little influence on who will be their EP representative.</p>
<p>The increased personal vote-seeking in an open ballot system means that the divergence of attitudes between a candidate and the party may have a positive effect on representation. If candidates stress their own issue positions ahead of the elections, they are more likely to attract voters who share their stances. If voters do not fully agree with some candidates of one party but are attracted by one candidate of this party, the open electoral system allows them to directly choose this candidate. This may have positive effects on representation.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 7a (Electoral system)</italic>: Attitude congruence between voters and their representatives will be better in an open ballot system than in other ballot systems.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 8a (Open ballot system*District magnitude)</italic>: In open ballot systems, attitude congruence between voters and their representatives will be better in a system with larger districts compared with one with smaller districts.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 9a (Open ballot system*Candidate’s deviation from party position)</italic>: In an open ballot system, a candidate’s deviation from his/her party’s position will positively affect attitude congruence.</p></disp-quote>In the second scenario we expect exactly the opposite because the party is the major actor in a political system. Political parties develop distinct policy programmes and compete by mobilizing supporters on the appeal of these programmes. Only internally cohesive parties can send a clear message to the electorate before elections and implement their policy proposals after elections. Since the party as a whole is the major point of reference for both voters and candidates, we can expect that mass–elite congruence will be stronger if candidates campaign on the platform of their political party. Personal vote-seeking in an open ballot system involves taking positions or actions that may not correspond fully with the party platform. This may dilute the programmatic message of the party and introduce personal aspects related to the representative, which may constitute a departure from the cohesive party line. Since incentives for personal vote-seeking increase with the size of electoral districts, the party message becomes more diluted in larger districts. In turn, in a closed ballot system, representatives have the least incentive to pursue personal vote-seeking and care more about party reputation and party programme because their electoral prospects depend on the votes cast for their party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512456089">Carey and Shugart, 1995</xref>). We would thus expect that, in an open ballot system, parties will be less able to send a clear, undiluted signal to voters regarding their stances on a range of issues, and any deviation from the party opinion will affect representation negatively.<disp-quote>

<sec id="sec6-1465116512456089"><title>Operationalization</title>
<p>This study employs the 2009 European Election Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1465116512456089">EES, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1465116512456089">Van Egmond et al., 2010</xref>) and the European Election Candidate Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1465116512456089">EES, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1465116512456089">Giebler et al., 2010</xref>) because the two surveys contain identical questions, which tap respondents’ attitudes on a broad range of basic policy issues. The voter study was fielded immediately after the EP elections in June 2009, with independently drawn samples of over 1000 respondents in each of the EU’s 27 member states. The candidate survey was carried out shortly before and after the EP elections and contains information on representatives from 162 parties, which is over 60 percent of the parties that were contacted in the course of the survey. In order to examine the attitude congruence of voters and their representatives, we combine data from the voter and candidate survey, which yields information on 28 political systems,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1465116512456089">2</xref></sup> 162 parties and over 11,500 respondents in the European Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1465116512456089">3</xref></sup> We create a multilevel data structure, where voters are nested in parties according to their party choice in the last EP elections, and parties are nested in 28 political systems.</p>
<p>Both surveys asked respondents to indicate on a scale from 1 to 5 (Likert scale) how much they disagree or agree with a number of statements. These statements tap into attitudes on a number of socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian issues, as well as immigration and EU integration. Items in the socioeconomic domain are: ‘Private enterprise is the best way to solve your country’s economic problems’ (we call this item <italic>Enterprise</italic>), ‘Major public services and industries ought to be in state ownership’ (<italic>Ownership</italic>), ‘Politics should abstain from intervening in the economy’ (<italic>Intervention</italic>), ‘Income and wealth should be redistributed towards ordinary people’ (<italic>Redistribution</italic>). Issue items in the libertarian/authoritarian domain are: ‘Same-sex marriages should be prohibited by law’ (<italic>Same-sex marriage</italic>), ‘Women should be free to decide on matters of abortion’ (<italic>Abortion</italic>), ‘People who break the law should be given much harsher sentences than they are these days’ (<italic>Law &amp; order</italic>), ‘Schools must teach children to obey authority’ (<italic>Authority</italic>), ‘EU treaty changes should be decided by referendum’ (<italic>Referendum</italic>), ‘A woman should be prepared to cut down on her paid work for the sake of her family’ (<italic>Family</italic>). Attitudes towards immigration are tapped by two questions: ‘Immigrants should be required to adapt to the customs of [country of respondent]’ (<italic>Adaptation of immigrants</italic>) and ‘Immigration to [country of respondent] should be decreased significantly’ (<italic>Decrease of immigration</italic>). Attitudes towards EU integration are measured with the question of whether EU unification should be pushed further or whether it has already gone too far (<italic>EU Integration</italic>).</p>
<p>We measured the congruence between attitudes of voters and the party they voted for in three steps. We first determined the position of each party on each issue by computing the mean position of all EP candidates from each of the parties. So the position of party A on an issue is the mean of the positions of all candidates of party A. In the second step we computed for each respondent for each issue the distance between his/her own position and the position of the party. In the third step, we established congruence in each issue domain by computing for each respondent the average distance between them and the party they voted for across all issues belonging to this domain. In the final step, we took the negative value of this score, where high values indicate that the voter is (on average) well represented in a particular domain, whereas low values (that is, large distances) show that the respondent is not well represented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1465116512456089">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our individual-level explanatory variables are <italic>Education</italic>, <italic>Social class</italic>, <italic>Political knowledge</italic> and <italic>Exposure to mobilization efforts</italic>. For <italic>Education</italic> we employ the cross-country measure included in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1465116512456089">EES 2009a</xref>, which is based on ISCED coding. This measure provides information on the highest level of education completed by respondents and consists of six categories coded as follows: 0 stands for pre-primary education, 1 for primary education or first stage of basic education, 2 for lower secondary or second stage of basic education, 3 for upper secondary education, 4 for post-secondary non-tertiary education, 5 for first-stage of tertiary education and 6 for second-stage of tertiary education. Although the ISCED measure does not capture distinct values of vocational education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1465116512456089">Schneider, 2010</xref>), it is the best measure in the EES 2009 comparing educational attainment across countries.</p>
<p><italic>Social class</italic> is operationalized by occupational categories, which is in line with much recent work in this area. The EES contains a categorization in 11 occupational groups, which match up very closely to categorizations employed in recent work on class voting (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512456089">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1465116512456089">Evans and De Graaf, 2012</xref>). This is the categorization used in our study.</p>
<p><italic>Political knowledge</italic> is measured by the factual correctness of respondents’ answers to seven statements about national and European politics contained in the EES 2009. We coded the correct answers for each question as 1, 0 otherwise. In order to assess whether these questions relate to a single latent dimension, the responses to these items were analysed on a pooled sample of all countries by means of an ordinal IRT (item response theory) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1465116512456089">Mokken, 1971</xref>). Constructing a scale on the basis of all countries allows us to adequately construct an index that measures the same concept across countries. We use an ordinal IRT model because it accounts for various levels of difficulty across items and thus constitutes a more valid dimensionality test than other data reduction methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1465116512456089">Van Schuur, 2003</xref>). We were able to construct a satisfactory political knowledge scale (with Loevinger H coefficient of 0.33) on the basis of three items: whether Switzerland is a member of the EU, whether the EU has 25 member states and whether every country in the EU elects the same number of representatives to the European Parliament. The additive index for <italic>Political knowledge</italic> ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates the lowest and 3 the highest level of political knowledge.</p>
<p>In order to construct <italic>Exposure to mobilization efforts</italic> we performed Mokken scaling for all countries together on questions about how often voters (1) watch a programme about the election on television, (2) read about the election in a newspaper, (3) talk to friends or family about the election, (4) attend a public meeting or rally about the election and (5) visit a website concerned with the election. We have recoded each item so that 1 indicates ‘never’, 2 ‘sometimes’ and 3 ‘always’. A common scale can be constructed for the first four items (with Loevinger H of 0.35). The index we constructed here is the average of responses on all items and ranges from 0 to 3.</p>
<p>At the party level we have four explanatory variables. <italic>Ideological clarity</italic> is a party characteristic that denotes the level of agreement among citizens about where a party stands in ideological (left/right) terms. To measure perceptual agreement among voters, we used a question where respondents were asked to place each political party in their party system on the left/right scale ranging from 0 to 10. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1465116512456089">Van der Eijk (2001)</xref>, we calculated a coefficient of agreement that describes the distribution of these perceptions. The value of this coefficient runs from −1 (maximum disagreement) to +1 (maximum agreement). <italic>Radical right parties</italic> and <italic>green and radical left parties</italic> are distinguished by means of dummy variables, constructed on the basis of the classification of the Comparative Manifesto Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1465116512456089">Volkens et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>At the country level, we create two dummy variables that distinguish between closed, ordered and open ballot systems. <italic>District magnitude</italic> is a continuous variable with the number of districts used for EP elections. We adapted the classification of district magnitude and ballot systems from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512456089">Farrell and Scully (2007)</xref>. In order to test the hypothesis on the effect of district magnitude in open ballot systems, we created an interaction between <italic>District magnitude</italic> and the dummy for <italic>Open ballot system</italic>. <italic>Candidate deviation from party position</italic> has been operationalized as the standard deviation from the mean party position on an issue (domain), where the mean party position is given by the mean positioning of all candidates belonging to a party. Finally, <italic>EU membership</italic> in years stands for the number of years since a country joined the EU.</p>
<p>We employ multilevel analysis because our model has a hierarchical structure: individuals are nested in parties according to their choice in the last EP elections, and parties are nested in political systems. In order to facilitate interpretation of the models, we have centred explanatory variables which do not contain the baseline of 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512456089">Hox, 2010</xref>: 59–63).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1465116512456089">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1465116512456089"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Before we conduct the causal analysis, we will present some descriptive statistics for four outcome variables: congruence in the socioeconomic domain and the libertarian/authoritarian domain, and on the issues of immigration and EU integration (Table 1 in the Web Appendix). The outcome variables range from −5 (the maximum distance between a voter and her/his party on all issues in a domain) and 0 (perfect congruence between party and voter on all issues in the domain). Table 1 reveals that on average the differences in stances of voters and EP representatives are smallest for the socioeconomic domain (mean of −1.14 and minimum of −3.33). In turn, we observe the highest average difference on EU integration (mean of −1.29).</p>
<p>Table 2 in the Web Appendix presents results from multilevel analyses for four outcome variables: congruence in the socioeconomic domain (Model I), the libertarian/authoritarian domain (Model II), immigration (Model III) and EU integration (Model IV).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1465116512456089">6</xref></sup> These model estimates were obtained in analyses that included the following control variables: place of residence, gender and religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1465116512456089">7</xref></sup> Since we have no theoretical expectations about the effects of these individual-level control variables, we decided not to present these effects in this journal article. The full results are available in the Web Appendix in Table 2 Full Results. In each model we present two versions – Model A and Model B – which include different interactions. We tested these interactions with system-level variables in separate models, because the limited number of observations at this level (<italic>N</italic>  =  28) does not give the tests enough power when testing them in one joint model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1465116512456089">8</xref></sup> In all models, a positive coefficient for an explanatory variable indicates that this factor contributes positively to representation.</p>
<p>With regard to individual-level explanatory variables, we see that representation in the European Parliament improves with levels of education. In each issue domain under study – socioeconomic, libertarian/authoritarian, immigration and EU integration – we see a positive coefficient for education in each of the Models A and B.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1465116512456089">9</xref></sup> This confirms <italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>. Table 2 in the Web Appendix reveals that social class matters very little for representation in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains. Yet, on the issues of European integration and especially immigration, workers are less well represented than other groups, even when controlling for education. Since attitude congruence for middle-class voters is higher in two domains than for the working-class, <italic>Hypothesis 2</italic> is partially confirmed.</p>
<p>The level of political knowledge matters for attitude congruence as well. Table 2 in the Web Appendix displays a positive effect of knowledge on congruence in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains and for the issue of immigration. This pattern cannot be confirmed for the issue of EU integration, however. With the exception of EU attitudes, our expectation with regard to the effect of political information on the quality of representation (<italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>) can be confirmed. Surprisingly, voters’ exposure to mobilization efforts does not play a role in attitude congruence. The only significant effects that appear here – those in the libertarian/authoritarian domain – are negative, while effects for other issue domains are positive and non-significant. Here, we have to reject <italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>.</p>
<p>Among party-level variables, ideological clarity plays a role in congruence of issue attitudes. A clearer ideological stance of a party in left/right terms leads to more congruence with its voters in the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains. This is precisely what we expected in our <italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>. Furthermore, radical right parties represent their voters better on immigration and EU integration than do other parties, which confirms <italic>Hypothesis 6a</italic>. However, there is no evidence that green and radical left parties represent their voters better on socioeconomic issues. The effect for radical left parties is negative in several cases. The significant effect for green parties in Model I A is not enough to draw any conclusions on this matter. <italic>Hypothesis 6b</italic> should thus be rejected.</p>
<p>With regard to system-level variables, there is some evidence for more congruence in open and ordered ballot systems than in closed ballot systems in the libertarian/authoritarian domain, where three of the four effects are positive and significant. In all other cases the effects are insignificant, and they are sometimes positive and in other cases negative. These results thus provide only limited evidence for <italic>Hypothesis 7a</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1465116512456089">10</xref></sup> Because the effect of an open ballot system may be conditional on district magnitude, we have introduced an interaction between a dummy for open ballot system and a measure of district magnitude (Model A presents this interaction for every issue domain). The obtained coefficients are positive, suggesting that the higher the district magnitude in an open ballot system, the higher the opinion congruence between voters and EP candidates from the party of their choice. However, these effects do not reach conventional statistical significance. This points us to our <italic>Hypothesis 8a</italic>, but because of the low number of cases we have to be cautious in our conclusions. We remain similarly cautious about how candidates’ deviations from their parties’ positions affect representation in an open ballot system. In three domains the effects are negative and insignificant, but in the case of European integration the effects are positive and significant. Last, but not least, how many years countries have been members of the EU does not play a role in the quality of representation of their citizens in European elections.</p>
<p>The last observations concern the strength of the effects and the variance explained at each level of analysis. The effects of the individual-level variables are not very strong. When comparing the predicted values on the dependent variable between the minimum and maximum scores on each of the independent variables, the difference never exceeds 0.20 on scales with a range of about 3.50 points (see also Table 2 in the Web Appendix). For instance, education ranges between 0 and 6, and the size of the parameter is .03 in the case of immigration (Model III). So, the predicted difference in attitude congruence between the highest- and the lowest-educated citizen is 0.18. This difference is meaningful but rather limited. On EU integration, Model IV B tells us that the predicted difference between professionals (parameter is .03) and semi-skilled workers (parameter is −.13) is .16 points. Other individual-level effects are weaker.</p>
<p>Judging by the size of the parameters, the effects of party- and system-level variables are somewhat larger than those of individual-level variables. Model III B predicts that radical right parties represent their voters much better on the issue of immigration than other parties. The difference is .48, which is a substantial difference on a scale with a range of 4.50 points. Also, the effect of the ideological clarity of parties is substantial. When agreement about the left/right position of a party increases from .25 (low agreement) to .75 (high agreement), the representation of their voters in the socioeconomic and libertarian domains will increase by .12 to .17. The predicted effect of an ordered ballot system versus a closed ballot system is even slightly larger (0.20), but only in the libertarian/authoritarian domain.</p>
<p>Moving to the explained variances, we first of all see that our models are least able to explain individual-level variance. The explained variance ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent depending on the issue domain. Party-level variance can be much better explained. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>’s range from 1 percent to 60 percent. Variance at the system-level can be explained most accurately, with explained variance ranging from 18 percent to 90 percent. Although there are substantial differences in the variance explained across issue domains, there is a general pattern showing that the system-level factors explain most of the variance, whereas individual-level factors do not explain much. So, the extent to which individuals are represented does not depend very much upon their social class, education or political knowledge.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1465116512456089" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has analysed which individual-, party- and system-level characteristics account for the quality of representation in European elections.</p>
<p>The first main finding of our investigation is that citizens with higher levels of education and more political knowledge, and who belong to higher social classes have their views generally better represented than the lesser educated, those with less knowledge and those belonging to the working-class. These results are not new or surprising, but they do show that, like national parliaments, the EP suffers from a bias towards representing the more-educated middle-class citizens (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116512456089">Schattschneider, 1975</xref>). The reasons behind these inequalities in representation can be multiple. Better representation of more-educated middle-class voters can be a natural consequence of the fact that EP candidates are likely to be highly-educated, and themselves belong to the middle-or upper-classes. There may also be strategic reasons involved: EP candidates may ignore less-educated, lower-class voters because these voters are less likely to turn out in EP elections. Finally, the cognitive skills of voters may play a role. More-educated and more-knowledgeable voters may be more aware of the parties’ policies, and hence be in a better position to choose those parties that they agree with the most.</p>
<p>The inequalities in representation of different groups of voters have implications for the democratic character of the EU. With the recent extension of powers to the EP, which took place through the Treaty of Lisbon, an attempt has been made to alleviate the democratic deficit in the EU. The findings of this article highlight the fact that, even if some problems of a lack of democratic accountability are addressed, the European Parliament still suffers from inequalities in representation of various groups of citizens. Inequalities in representation imply that not all EU citizens are able to influence the direction of the policy agenda to the same extent, which is likely to have repercussions for the direction of policies formulated at the EU level. At the same time, we should also emphasize that variations at the individual level cannot be explained very well with these socio-structural variables. This means that the differences within these groups are much larger than the differences between the groups.</p>
<p>The second main finding of this article is that important differences exist between the different domains in how well groups of voters are represented. In the socioeconomic and libertarian/authoritarian domains, better-educated and more knowledgeable voters are better represented, but, when controlling for these variables, social class does not have an additional effect. Yet in the issue areas of immigration and European integration, the working-class is significantly less well represented than other groups. A possible reason could be that working-class citizens tend to vote for left-wing parties, which they agree with on socioeconomic policies but disagree with on the issues of migration and European integration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1465116512456089">Van der Brug and Van Spanje (2009)</xref> pointed to the representation gap at the national level, which stems from the fact that the ideological profile of the ‘authoritarian worker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116512456089">Lipset, 1960</xref>) is not represented in the national party space. Our findings are in line with their idea.</p>
<p>Thirdly, parties with clear ideological profiles present their voters best in the socioeconomic and the libertarian/authoritarian domains. Controlling for ideological clarity, radical left-wing parties represent their voters less well in these domains. Thus, the traditional established parties with clear ideological profiles (mainly social democratic, Christian democratic, conservative and liberal parties) represent their voters best in these domains. However, radical right parties represent their voters on average much better in the fields of immigration and European integration. This speaks to recent literature, which has demonstrated that the issue of further European integration has increasingly become subject to political competition among political parties and increasingly affects voters’ electoral choices (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116512456089">De Vries, 2007</xref>). Our findings show that, even if voters more frequently rely on their attitudes towards EU integration in casting a ballot, the extent to which the party of their choice will represent them on this issue will vary. So, even if considerations regarding EU integration have begun to guide voters in their party choice, putting an end to the period of ‘permissive consensus’, significant differences can be observed with regard to how voters are represented on this issue and, ultimately, in the extent to which their vote can influence the direction of integration.</p>
<p>The last finding of this article suggests that in open and ordered ballot systems there is more attitude congruence between voters and their party in the libertarian/authoritarian domain. Several scholars have hypothesized that representation would work best in open ballot systems, especially when there are large districts (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512456089">Farrell and Scully, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1465116512456089">Hobolt and Høyland (2011)</xref> also expected the quality of candidates to be positively affected by these characteristics of electoral systems, but did not find significant effects. The results from our analyses are mixed, but provide some tentative evidence that attitude congruence increases with district magnitude. In such systems, a candidate’s deviation from his/her party’s position positively affects representation, but only in the field of European integration, where the largest representation gap was noted. These findings extend existing knowledge about ballot systems, since their recent introduction for the EP elections. Our findings offer some tentative evidence for a better voter–candidate congruence of opinions in more open ballot systems. Dependent on their further investigation, these findings have potential policy implications for bringing voter preferences closer to representatives at the European level.</p>

In East Central Europe, the ecologist, agrarian and ethnic/linguistic party families remain underrepresented, with information on 10, 11 and 12 candidates respectively, whereas for each of the remaining party families we have information on 20 candidates at the minimum.
