<abstract>
<p>Multisectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS work has been the leading governance strategy for most sub-Saharan African countries since the early 2000s, institutionalized with national multisectoral coordinating bodies within the central government. This article reveals how such efforts have been practiced in Tanzania. An assessment framework based on theoretical elements from organization theory and elements central to aid coordination/global health coordination policy and strategy literature serves as the basis for data collection and structures the presentation of findings. The article finds that the pattern and challenges to coordination in Tanzania can be summed up as a politics of coordination, with priorities determined by global health initiatives while the national AIDS commission lacks political authority. Together with other factors, such a situation presents severe challenges to multisectoral coordination.</p>
<sec id="sec17-0020852312447060"><title>Point for practitioners</title>
<p>Successful multisectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS/global health in aid-dependent countries requires careful consideration of labour divisions and coordination initiatives among involved actors, including the central government, bilateral/multilateral donors, and NGOs.</p>
<p>Ensuring horizontal-internal and vertical-internal as well as external coordination of a cross-sectoral issue requires the highest office of government to provide continuous political support to the coordinating bodies; otherwise, ministries will not give priority to cross-sectoral issues, resulting in failure. Moreover, understanding the larger political economy of the sector within which coordination takes place is pertinent to explain why multisectoral coordination faces severe challenges in Tanzania.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec1-0020852312447060" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several new global health initiatives (GHIs) have emerged since 2000 that have contributed with substantial funding for global health interventions in low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. GHIs can be defined as ‘a blueprint for financing, resourcing, coordinating and/or implementing disease control across at least several countries in more than one region of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312447060">Brugha, 2008</xref>: 74). HIV/AIDS is the global health issue included in several of these initiatives that have received the most attention and funding. Total available funds for HIV/AIDS increased from US$300 m in 1996 to US$15.9b in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312447060">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>: 149).</p>
<p>Three vertical disease-specific GHIs have constituted the key funders of HIV/AIDS since 2000: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (the Global Fund, an International Financing Institution, with programme aid, established 2002), the World Bank Multi-country AIDS Programme (MAP, a multilateral programme, established 2000, in Tanzania called the T-MAP) and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR, a bilateral programme, established 2003).</p>
<p>In addition, multisectoral coordination structures have been institutionalized at national and local levels, referred to as the so-called Three Ones principles: one National AIDS Commission (NAC), one multisectoral strategic framework and one multisectoral monitoring and evaluation system (M&amp;E system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312447060">UNAIDS/WHO, 2004</xref>). Thus, HIV/AIDS coordination efforts provide a particularly interesting case for analysing and understanding the role of the GHIs at the national level where they meet the recipient countries.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to identify the pattern and challenges to national multisectoral HIV/AIDS coordination and the role and influence of these three GHIs on this coordination. The article also aims to explain why this pattern and the identified challenges have emerged. To identify the pattern and challenges to coordination, the author has developed and used an assessment framework based on organization theory (that is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid’s (2008)</xref> contribution): thus, the article contributes to organization theory by applying it to HIV/AIDS. To explain why this pattern and challenges emerge, the article also applies organization theory (that is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson’s (1982)</xref> contribution). Moreover, the article contributes to the scholarly literature on HIV/AIDS coordination/global health/aid coordination as the assessment framework may be adopted and easily used in other country assessments related to these issues. Finally, the findings in this article provide valuable lessons to be learnt for policy-makers who work on aid-coordination issues – particularly multisectoral issues – as the article demonstrates the politics of coordination that unfolds in the efforts to coordinate in Tanzania.</p>
<p>In discussing national HIV/AIDS coordination, the focus on external development actors is limited to the PEPFAR, the Global Fund and the World Bank T-MAP because they are the main external donors influencing the structural, economic and policy-wise premises for national HIV/AIDS coordination in Tanzania. The PEPFAR is the US Government’s HIV/AIDS programme and the largest bilateral HIV/AIDS programme globally. The Global Fund is an international finance institution and a public–private partnership, to which bilateral and multilateral donors as well as several companies and philanthropic foundations contribute financially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312447060">Hellevik, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The World Bank T-MAP is the Tanzanian part of the World Bank HIV/AIDS programme (MAP) which has contributed with funding to Tanzania and 34 other African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312447060">World Bank, 2011</xref>). The funds have mainly been used to implement and fund national and local government HIV/AIDS coordination structures as well as to fund work by civil society organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312447060">World Bank, 2011</xref>). Structurally, the World Bank T-MAP was therefore decisive in making the Tanzanian government set up its NAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman, 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, the Global Fund influences the structural premises by demanding that countries set up Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs). Countries apply to the Global Fund for funding and the CCMs are to coordinate the application process and to engage in other matters concerning the funding used. In most countries, CCM representatives include government ministries, donors, civil society organizations, academic organizations and the private sector.</p>
<p>Economically, the T-MAP provided funding at an early stage of the coordination process, while the Global Fund and PEPFAR have been the most important actors in recent years, contributing 90 percent of all donor funding for HIV/AIDS in Tanzania in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312447060">TACAIDS, 2010</xref>). Policy-wise these GHIs dominate because their priorities for what services they will fund and what service providers they fund influence HIV/AIDS service delivery in Tanzania. Other GHIs not discussed in this article include for instance the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI Alliance).</p>
<p>The Tanzanian national HIV/AIDS response can be divided into two phases. First, from about 2002–04/05, the construction of the national HIV/AIDS response was initiated with the establishment of the NAC called the Tanzania AIDS Commission (TACAIDS) in 2002. The World Bank was the major donor. Second, from 2004/05 to the present, the scale-up of HIV/AIDS care and anti-retroviral treatments has taken place, with PEPFAR and the Global Fund being the major donors.</p>
<p>In this article, we first present a literature review of HIV/AIDS/global health/aid coordination that shows the earlier literature that this article builds upon. Second, we introduce the theoretical framework applied. Third, we operationalize this framework, introducing what we refer to as the assessment framework. Fourth, we describe the methods used. In the fifth part, we present and discuss the findings, that is, the pattern and challenges to coordination that were found. We argue that the pattern and challenges can be seen to reflect a politics of coordination being played out in Tanzania. We then apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson’s (1982)</xref> theoretical framework on coordination to assist us in interpreting this politics of coordination, that is, why the pattern and challenges that were found have emerged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0020852312447060"><title>Global health/HIV/AIDS coordination and general aid coordination efforts</title>
<p>The Three Ones principles were inspired by the Ugandan and Senegalese battle with HIV/AIDS that was deemed to be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312447060">Putzel, 2004)</xref>, as well as general aid coordination efforts. The multisectoral approach implied that HIV/AIDS was to be approached not just as a health sector issue, but also by other sectors; in addition, both non-governmental actors and the private sector were to be involved.</p>
<p>Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), general budget support and basket funds are examples of other types of aid coordination that have taken place in African countries at the same time that they have made efforts to coordinate HIV/AIDS work. All three forms of coordination imply that donors contribute to a joint pool of funding after having agreed among themselves and with the government on a joint strategy for the use of this funding. Both sector wide approaches and basket funds are usually related to funding for a specific sector, whereas general budget support is funding to the general government budget.</p>
<p>Scholars have argued that little progress has been made on aid coordination since donors and recipient countries committed to the Paris Declaration in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312447060">Hydén, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852312447060">Whitfield and Fraser, 2009</xref>). Some scholarly literature has also discussed the progress on HIV/AIDS and/or GHI coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312447060">Gostin and Mok, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312447060">Hellevik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312447060">Sridhar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312447060">Sundewall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312447060">Walt et al., 2009</xref>). Such literature demonstrates that some progress has been made in coordination among the GHIs at the global level by for instance setting up global implementation-solving teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312447060">Hellevik, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Global Fund and the PEPFAR have made recent adjustments to their programmes to align with HIV/AIDS strategies of recipient countries – the Global Fund by endorsing National Strategy Applications and PEPFAR through partnership frameworks. Furthermore, the Global Fund in particular has made improvements in terms of increased transparency and the inclusion of civil society organizations in its coordination body, the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) that most recipient countries have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, despite these efforts, a seven-country study of GHIs and national coordination recently found that the coordination problems as reported in studies and reviews from 2004–05, still persisted, in African countries with large-scale epidemics as well as in countries outside Africa with low-scale epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>). Other coordination challenges identified in scholarly studies on single countries or comparative studies as well as in reviews/evaluations include parallel reporting, overlapping coordinating institutions, limited country ownership, low capacity of NAC and tensions between these commissions and Ministries of Health (MOHs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312447060">Dickinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312447060">Morah and Ihalainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312447060">Putzel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312447060">Sherry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the wider global health domain – including GHIs other than the ones studied in this article (e.g. GAVI Alliance, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312447060">Gostin and Mok (2009: 12)</xref> concluded that we have not come far in coordination. They characterized the situation as being one with ‘rampant problems of fragmentation and duplication in the sea of funding, programmes, and activities that span the global health domain’. Furthermore, a literature is emerging on the effect of GHIs on country health systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312447060">Biesma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312447060">WHO, 2009</xref>) as well as on GHIs’ influence on national and sub-national HIV/AIDS coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>). However as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al. (2010)</xref> recently concluded, a gap in research still exists regarding how the GHIs influence country-level HIV/AIDS coordination and the HIV/AIDS work in general at the country level. This article contributes to closing this gap by examining the influence of the three selected GHIs on national coordination in Tanzania. None of the previously published articles has attempted to explain why such challenges have emerged by bringing in organization theory on coordination, which we do in this article. By incorporating a theoretical framework and theoretical explanations from organization theory, this article thus contributes to the scholarly literature on HIV/AIDS coordination as well as global health and aid coordination, thereby strengthening our ability to analyse and explain the pattern of coordination, the challenges of coordination, and why the pattern and challenges emerge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0020852312447060"><title>Theoretical approach</title>
<p>By departing from organization theory, this article takes a deductive approach towards analysing multisectoral HIV/AIDS coordination efforts in Tanzania. As the Three Ones principles focus on public sector coordination, it is pertinent to start from a theoretical perspective on public sector coordination. Moreover, the Three Ones focus on formal structural elements for ensuring HIV/AIDS coordination; thus, it is pertinent to use the instrumental-structural perspective within organization theory as this implies that ‘the formal structure of public organizations will channel and influence the models of thought and the actual decision-making behaviours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid, 2008: 101</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that national HIV/AIDS coordination reflects such a perspective because donors and recipient countries anticipated that, by setting up formal structures of coordination such as the NAC, the common multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategy and the common M&amp;E system coordination would be improved. Therefore, we have selected the framework of coordination that Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>) developed based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312447060">Gulick (1937)</xref> to pursue the analysis of coordination practices in Tanzania as this framework focuses on public sector coordination and departs from an instrumental-structural perspective. According to Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>: 97), ‘two sets of variables: specialization and coordination structure most public sector organizations’. Specialization refers to the division of tasks between and/or within an organization. Specialization is linked to coordination because ‘the more specialization in a public organization, the more pressure for increased coordination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid, 2008</xref>: 101). We do not discuss specialization further in this article as we only use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid’s (2008)</xref> framework to identify the pattern and challenges to coordination. Coordination may take one of the following four forms: vertical-external, vertical-internal, horizontal-external, or horizontal-internal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid, 2008</xref>:101; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312447060">Table 1</xref>).

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Horizontal-internal coordination refers to coordination within the central government whereas the vertical-internal coordination involves coordination between the ‘parent ministry and subordinate agencies and bodies in the same sector’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid, 2008</xref>:102). Vertical-external is the coordination between the government and ‘(a) upwards to international organizations or, (b) downwards to local government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid, 2008</xref>: 102). The vertical-external coordination downwards to local government is the coordination that takes place across devolved and/or administrative levels of government. This latter type of coordination is not discussed in this article as it is the theme of another article by this author (Hellevik, 2012).</p>
<p>Finally, horizontal-external coordination refers to coordination between the government and civil society organizations and private sector organizations – although the current article does not include private sector organizations because they are not among the main actors participating in efforts to coordinate in Tanzania.</p>
<p>We use these four forms of coordination of Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>) outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312447060">Table 1</xref> to identify the coordination pattern and the challenges of coordination in Tanzania. These forms of coordination depart from the instrumental-structural perspective in organization theory and the forms thus constitute formal organizational elements of coordination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0020852312447060"><title>The assessment framework</title>
<p>In order to apply the four forms of coordination that have been outlined by Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312447060">Table 1</xref>), we found it pertinent to operationalize them. To operationalize the four forms, we developed an assessment framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312447060">Table 2</xref>). This assessment framework is thus derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid’s (2008)</xref> four forms of coordination.</p>
<p>In addition to the four forms of coordination as outlined by Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312447060">Table 1</xref>), we included elements found by (a) reviewing literature on multisectoral coordination experiences that existed before fieldwork was conducted in 2009 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312447060">Ainsworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312447060">Dickinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312447060">Putzel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312447060">Sherry et al., 2009</xref>); and (b) conducting an extensive review of Tanzanian policy documents to identify the main components of the Tanzanian coordination approach. These policy elements include, for instance, GHIs’ alignment and harmonization and the central government’s alignment.</p>
<p>We found it necessary to include such elements from policy documents as multisectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS work has been little theorized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid’s (2008)</xref> four forms of coordination and our assessment framework that derives from their four forms enable us to identify the pattern of multisectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS work at the national level in Tanzania as well as to identify challenges to such coordination.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0020852312447060"><title>Vertical-internal coordination</title>
<p>According to Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>: 102), vertical-internal coordination is the hierarchical coordination between ‘parent ministry and subordinate agencies and bodies in the same sector’. In the case of national HIV/AIDS coordination in Tanzania, it implies assessing the coordination between TACAIDS and its parent ministry, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) because TACAIDS is an independent department within the PMO. We assess the following elements (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312447060">Table 2</xref>):

<p>The horizontal-internal coordination is the coordination among ministries, according to Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>). Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312447060">Table 1</xref>) include agencies and directorates, but we have left these out in our assessment framework in order to delimit the analysis. We focus on the responsibilities and organizational elements that the ministries have been asked to establish with regard to HIV/AIDS as outlined in Tanzanian government documents. These responsibilities and organizational elements include (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312447060">Table 2</xref>):

<p>Regarding the vertical-external coordination, Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>) include both central government’s coordination with international organizations as well as with local governments. Our assessment framework includes only the coordination between the central government and international organizations. This implies that we assess the coordination between the government of Tanzania and the three selected GHIs: PEPFAR, the Global Fund and the T-MAP. The following elements are assessed as these are central in policy documents outlining how these actors are to coordinate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312447060">Table 2</xref>):

<p>In this article, horizontal-external coordination involves the coordination of TACAIDS with Tanzanian civil society organizations. The elements assessed concern civil society’s involvement in coordination (including national and local NGOs) as the Three Ones principles anticipate that civil society’s participation in various forums will ensure national multisectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS.

<sec id="sec9-0020852312447060"><title>Data and methods</title>
<p>Tanzania represents a good case to study national HIV/AIDS coordination because donors regard it as effectively performing aid coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312447060">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>: 271). The findings in this article emanate from a larger research project, presented elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312447060">Hellevik, 2009</xref>, forthcoming), that involves studies of multilevel coordination and local-level coordination. The author has done all the data collection and acquired research and work permits from the Tanzanian authorities. The findings are based on the triangulation of different data sources. First, an extensive literature review was undertaken of scholarly and evaluation literature on GHIs and HIV/AIDS coordination globally, as well as on Tanzania, including government policies, plans, and strategies on HIV/AIDS, health and related issues.</p>
<p>This literature review formed the basis for selecting the elements of the assessment framework, which was used to structure the questions for the semi-structured interviews that the author conducted with 59 people in Tanzania. Three different phases of fieldwork made it possible to follow up on issues with interviewees over time; as a result, several of the interviewees have thus been interviewed more than once, although all such interviews were counted as only one interview. The author is an independent trained researcher from a research institution outside Tanzania with no affiliation or previous working history with interviewees.</p>
<p>Interviewees included key stakeholders working on national HIV/AIDS coordination in Tanzania, including present and former staff of TACAIDS, MOH, PMO, PEPFAR, the World Bank, other bilateral and multilateral donors, philanthropic foundations, NGO networks, local and international NGOs receiving funding from the Global Fund, PEPFAR, or the T-MAP and Tanzania National Coordinating Mechanism’s (TNCM) board members. TNCM is the CCM in Tanzania and is to handle all Global Fund-related work.</p>
<p>All interviewees received an introductory letter. The author sought consent from all interviewees to use the information they provided by referring to them in general terms (‘donor’, ‘government employee’, etc.) in the text to protect their identity. Confidentiality was thereby maintained. The interviews were not recorded, but in addition to the author taking notes, another person took part in all interviews to take notes to ensure that all information provided by the interviewees was noted. In about two-thirds of the interviews, a research assistant participated and took notes in addition to the author. In the remaining interviews, the senior researcher who participated in the multilevel part of the project was present. Interview notes were subsequently compared and discussed.</p>
<p>All interview transcripts were read and discussed with the senior researcher. The author also retrieved several Tanzanian government documents, including budget data, unpublished reports on coordination, minutes from meetings, as well as several reports on T-MAP and the Global Fund. To accommodate potential bias or other limitations of the study, drafts of the article have been presented in various forums to researchers who know Tanzania and/or HIV/AIDS coordination.</p>
<p>Limitations include the absence of any end-of-programme evaluation of the T-MAP, which – to the author’s knowledge – has not yet been produced. However, several progress reports and brief reviews of the T-MAP were obtained. Another limitation is the lack of access to minutes from the TNCM board meetings, although the author has obtained extensive documentation to compensate for this limitation, including interviews with several TNCM board members, several reports (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312447060">Foster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312447060">TACAIDS, 2010</xref>), and all grants’ progress reports.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0020852312447060"><title>Vertical-internal coordination</title>
<p>Regarding the first element, TACAIDS is an independent department within the PMO, but it has not succeeded in regulating and controlling its own affairs because it has too few competent staff, has too many roles to fill as it implement projects as well, and has little capacity to coordinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312447060">Berlin, 2008</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312447060">Mutembei, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>One donor representative said: ‘One of the shortcomings of TACAIDS is conflict in the role of implementation and strategic coordination. They have been trying to run around and conduct workshops and meetings all around the country – that’s the problem.’ However, a senior-level person in TACAIDS refuted the claim that TACAIDS has an implementation role: ‘We don’t implement, we are not supposed to implement.’ But most interviewees, reports and some scholarly literature confirm that TACAIDS has been involved in implementation (interviews; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312447060">Foster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman, 2009</xref>). Ultimately, TACAIDS has an unclear mandate and has taken on many more tasks than was intended with the Three Ones principles, such as implementing projects and managing Global Fund grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The acts establishing TACAIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312447060">GOT, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312447060">2001b</xref>) did not stipulate how it was to coordinate, leaving it with considerable freedom to define its role. In theory, TACAIDS could also define the division of labour between itself and other ministries as it is an independent department within the PMO, placing it hierarchically above other ministries. In practice, TACAIDS has not been able to take advantage of its position because it has not been allocated the necessary powers that an elevated position in a hierarchy is anticipated to have – namely, the legal mandate to supervise or monitor policies in other ministries and agencies (interviews). In addition, ministries and agencies are not obliged to report to TACAIDS, which TACAIDS perceives as a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312447060">Mutembei, 2008: 6, 18</xref>).</p>
<p>The second element to assess is the reporting relationship and feedback from the PMO. According to interviewees in both TACAIDS and the PMO, TACAIDS regularly reports to the PMO, but receives no feedback on its reports. One donor representative said that ‘TACAIDS lacks political leadership and authority … I don’t think the PM is giving support.’</p>
<p>The PMO’s participation in the TNCM where it has the chair, is the third element of our assessment framework with regard to vertical-internal coordination. The Permanent Secretary of the PMO is the chair of the TNCM Board; however, the chair has failed to address the low attendance by Permanent Secretaries of other ministries who are board members in these meetings. As one TNCM member noted: ‘The level of representation is very low, it is not just the PM’s office that is not represented, but all.’ Another TNCM member said: ‘But they don’t necessarily attend the TNCM meetings; they send a junior person and within the government system a junior has less influence and information from the meeting may not reach the TNCM member. We have said in meetings that things should happen, but nothing has happened. Concrete decisions are not acted upon. When you press hard, the PS [Permament Secretaries] come to the next meeting.’</p>
<p>Based on the three elements assessed, we can guage the political commitment to national HIV/AIDS coordination from the Tanzanian government. TACAIDS’ unclear mandate, the limited contact between TACAIDS and the PMO, and the participation of junior ministers in the TNCM are all factors that together show weak political commitment from the central government to coordinate HIV/AIDS. This weak political commitment is also exemplified by the slow transfer of Global Fund grants from the Ministry of Finance to the various implementing organizations, as documented by reports and interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312447060">Foster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312447060">TACAIDS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The TNCM is responsible for grant oversight, and the PMO heads the TNCM; thus, it has a particular responsibility for this low political commitment in practice. These challenges of vertical-internal coordination – namely, TACAIDS’ unclear mandate, the weak relationships between TACAIDS and the PMO, etc. – represent examples of a politics of coordination related to HIV/AIDS pursued in Tanzania.</p>
<p>The weak political commitment from the PMO in assuring TACAIDS’ formal position to coordinate is a sign of this politics of coordination which undermines TACAIDS’ position as the main HIV/AIDS coordinating body. As a former TACAIDS staff member commented: ‘There is lip-service on HIV/AIDS – a lot of politicians don’t want to talk about HIV. We have not mainstreamed HIV/AIDS.’</p>
<p>The low status of TACAIDS in coordinating negatively affects horizontal-internal coordination, as the next section shows, because without the backing of the PMO, TACAIDS has no authority to enforce ministries’ integration and compliance with the multisectoral approach – a problem seen in several other African countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312447060">Morah and Ihalainen, 2009</xref>). The GHIs have contributed to these vertical-internal coordination challenges as the TNCM’s and TACAIDS’ organizational designs are based on conditionalities required by the GHIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0020852312447060"><title>Horizontal-internal coordination</title>
<p>Regarding the first element, we find that most ministries have a focal point for HIV/AIDS and a strategy and have implemented activities funded by the T-MAP within their ministry – mostly for workplace programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312447060">Mutembei, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312447060">TACAIDS, 2010</xref>; interviews). Although focal points exist in several ministries, these do not seem to be able to fulfil their role or have been consolidated in practice as they have low status within the ministries due to being junior staff (interviews). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312447060">Mulford and Rogers (1982: 22)</xref> argued that ‘the type of actor involved usually corresponds with the level of commitment being made to an interorganizational system’; this seems an appropriate description of what takes place in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the focal points also lack competence with HIV/AIDS, and have other tasks; while a rapid turnover of focal points is common, making it difficult to consolidate this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312447060">Berlin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312447060">GOT, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312447060">Mutembei, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312447060">TACAIDS, 2010</xref>). One donor representative stated: ‘The problem is, however, that you have the workshops, seminars, and initial commitment by management. They have focal points, then it fades away.’ It has also been shown that ministries in other countries were not very active in HIV/AIDS work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312447060">Morah and Ihalainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The second element is whether the ministries use one monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system – which they do not – as the system is not yet functional. As one donor said: ‘The GAMET [a World Bank technical assistance mechanism] provided technical assistance for the M&amp;E system. They created something that is too complex.’ The Global Fund and PEPFAR require separate reporting alongside other donors, creating a significant burden for government staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312447060">TACAIDS, 2010</xref>; interviews).</p>
<p>The third element assessing horizontal-internal coordination is whether the Ministry of Health – particularly staff from the National AIDS Control Programme – participates in meetings TACAIDS calls. In most instances, they do not according to interviewees. A former Ministry of Health staff member stated: ‘No, Ministry of Health don’t show up at meetings called by TACAIDS, they can go without.’ Furthermore, a donor representative said: ‘Over the years, the old problem between Ministry of Health and TACAIDS has persisted. It has become worse, because there is more and more going on in Ministry of Health. Tension is seen in the working relations between them.’ Such tension is evident in other African countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312447060">Morah and Ihalainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth element is whether one policy approach towards HIV/AIDS exists. With over 135 strategies included in the multisectoral strategic framework, most actors fit into this policy. In theory, therefore, the health sector HIV/AIDS strategy is anchored within this framework. However, in practice, two separate policy approaches exist between TACAIDS and the Ministry of Health because (a) TACAIDS and the MOH have not managed to create a division of labour for the multisectoral components that they both act on (e.g. prevention), and (b) PEPFAR’s and the Global Fund’s priorities and funding are directed towards the health sector’s anti-retroviral treatment services, giving MOH a more important role in HIV/AIDS work than TACAIDS.</p>
<p>As a result of these two policy approaches, ‘there is a lot of duplication between the health sector and the multisectoral approach’ (former Ministry of Health staff). However, a few interviewees would not admit that a problem persisted between TACAIDS and the MOH: ‘Initially when TACAIDS was established there was some confusion on who was to be in charge of what, but this was solved, immediately after, in 2002 or 2003’ (Ministry of Health staff). The TACAIDS–MOH tension described herein explains why these two policy approaches have come about. In addition, the PEPFAR and Global Fund funding, which make up the majority of funding, is mainly directed towards the health sector HIV/AIDS work, which also explains the tension as this funding makes it possible to maintain this separation in practice. As such, the priorities and services funded by the Global Fund and PEPFAR fund contribute to separating TACAIDS and MOH/NACP because these two programmes support both policies.</p>
<p>As they support both policies, these programmes exercise a dual politics of coordination in practice. The dual politics is evident through their support for multisectoral coordination policies on the one hand, while on the other hand they prioritize the health sector policy approach by channelling the majority of the funding into health sector-related HIV/AIDS services, making the MOH more important in the actual coordination of HIV/AIDS work than TACAIDS. As one TACAIDS interviewee stated: ‘With the Global Fund money going to health – the link – the coordination is much in health.’</p>
<p>This situation seems to have contributed to maintaining the tension between TACAIDS and the Ministry of Health as one PEPFAR implementing partner commented: ‘Always TACAIDS is complaining that they don’t know what PEPFAR is doing and they don’t know the difference between PEPFAR and ICAP [that is a PEPFAR recipient] for example. The reason for not knowing: They don’t want to collaborate with the NACP. They should have meetings … A coordinating body would work hand in hand with the technical people. They are blaming NACP.’</p>
<p>GHIs’ priority-setting creates conditions for HIV/AIDS funding, as documented in several countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312447060">Brugha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312447060">Morah and Ihalainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al., 2010</xref>). The politics of coordination that results, as is evident in the tension between the MOH and TACAIDS, is further assisted by the Global Fund’s and PEPFAR’s priorities towards health sector funding, thereby demonstrating that these GHIs make it difficult for TACAIDS to serve as the main coordinating body. Furthermore, as Christensen and Lægreid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">2008</xref>) indicated, cross-sectoral coordination is the most difficult coordination as it is hard to ensure an adequate division of labour. The overlap and lack of division of labour stems from TACAIDS’ unclear mandate and its many tasks resulting from this unclear mandate, as the section on vertical-internal coordination unveiled.</p>
<p>In conclusion, horizontal-internal coordination is low. The scale-up of care and treatment in recent years has strengthened the health sector, but has made coordination even more challenging for TACAIDS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0020852312447060"><title>Vertical-external coordination: donors’ commitment to national coordination</title>
<p>Regarding alignment – the first element assessed – the three GHIs have different records. The World Bank T-MAP is aligned in regard to being included in the government budget. However, in regard to priorities for which types of actors should receive its funding and organizational modalities for channelling the funding, Tanzania has to follow the World Bank policies, which has implied that one part of the funding has been reserved for community-based organizations, and regional facilitating agencies outside regional government structures have been set up to channel this funding and determine which organizations should receive it.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Global Fund, stakeholders in Tanzania see Global Fund- supported activities as being more or less in line with government priorities (interviews; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312447060">Foster et al., 2008</xref>). However, the Global Fund has not been aligned with the national budget due to insufficient and delayed reporting from Tanzanian recipient organizations, thereby causing the Global Fund to delay its funding as it is performance-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>; interviews). This last factor brings us to the assessment of the second element – that is, how the three donors’ programme designs and earmarks influence vertical-external coordination. The delays in funding demonstrate that the design of the Global Fund programme in practice hinders vertical-external coordination.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PEPFAR – in Tanzania as well as in most other countries in which it operates – is seen as the worst in alignment of the three donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312447060">Oomman et al., 2010</xref>). It is not on the budget and has revealed few details about its funding. To improve alignment, PEPFAR recently signed partnership frameworks with a number of African governments, including the Tanzanian government, to outline a common plan with the recipient government.</p>
<p>This weak horizontal-internal coordination – namely, ministries have not developed plans into budgets from the national strategic framework – has hindered donors’ alignment to the budget. As a PEPFAR staff member commented: ‘If we could get a costed annual planning process [plan with budget and priorities], it could provide transparency and access between us and benchmarks with government.’</p>
<p>However, PEPFAR still has to follow the overall earmarks for its funding as dictated by the US Congress, meaning alignment is limited. This concerns the second element – earmarks and priorities – as well. An additional component that falls within this second element is the prioritization of treatment from both the Global Fund and PEPFAR, which makes ministries of health more important in coordination than the NACs in all countries where they have the same funding levels as in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Although ministries of health in African countries seem to have feared becoming sidelined with the establishment of the NACs in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312447060">Ainsworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312447060">Putzel, 2004</xref>), the situation has apparently turned around in Tanzania: TACAIDS has been sidelined. As one donor representative observed: ‘Ministry of Health gains with care and treatment – it is clear.’ This is likely to have occurred in several other countries as well since the funding priorities have been the same, as documented in a recent UNAIDS report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312447060">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>). The TNCM – another GHI programme design factor – has further hindered coordination.</p>
<p>Although the management of the Global Fund funding has improved over years, serious problems still exist regarding the supervision of these funds and application processes as interviewees as well as recent reports have indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312447060">OIG, 2009</xref>; interviews). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al.’s (2010: 8)</xref> finding of the CCM in other countries – namely, ‘they primarily existed to agree and sign Global Fund proposals’ – seems descriptive of the TNCM as well.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of TNCM overlapping TACAIDS – a theme discussed in several earlier reviews of coordination in African countries as well as outside Africa – opinions are divided in Tanzania. Some TACAIDS staff members think that TNCM avoids duplicating TACAIDS since TACAIDS constitutes the TNCM secretariat (interviews). A donor representative said that ‘it’s not duplicative, because none of the other structures deals with the Global Fund’. However, by design TNCM duplicates TACAIDS as TACAIDS also coordinates HIV/AIDS work in the country, including the Global Fund funding. As one interviewee stated: ‘They [TACAIDS] don’t have any plans for getting the TNCM into the TACAIDS structure. To me, the TNCM is a parallel structure. TACAIDS doesn’t have the capacity to take over the TNCM.’</p>
<p>Some TNCM board members described TACAIDS’ poor management of the TNCM. One board member said: ‘The preparation for the meeting is very bad. We get the documents the day before meetings.’ Another member, discussing one of the Global Fund rounds of application, stated: ‘We got the proposals in the TNCM board about 36 hours [over the weekend] before the Global Fund deadline, and we didn’t review the proposal then – there is a big gap in information.’</p>
<p>In conclusion, vertical-external coordination faces substantial challenges, particularly with regard to the Global Fund and PEPFAR as these programmes have not adequately aligned and harmonized their programmes to country priorities. TACAIDS’ weak horizontal-internal coordination also makes it difficult for these programmes to align.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0020852312447060"><title>Horizontal-external coordination with civil society organizations</title>
<p>As to the first dimension – civil society–government relations – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman (2009: 359)</xref> demonstrated that TACAIDS has been ‘directly competing for funds with the project’s traditional implementation partners – the CSOs’ (CSOs = civil society organizations). Several scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312447060">Hydén, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312447060">Mercer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312447060">Shivji, 2004</xref>) have described a tension between the government and civil society in general, arguing that civil society is weak compared to the Tanzanian government.</p>
<p>Considering the second dimension, TACAIDS has involved civil society organizations in planning the national strategic framework; however, these organizations do not seem to be representative of larger networks. As one interviewee said: ‘There is a need to revisit the membership of CSOs. It is random which NGOs are involved or not in TACAIDS work.’ Several HIV/AIDS networks exist, but none of them represents any strong national network (interviews; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312447060">Kelly and Birdsall, 2008</xref>). Another interviewee stated: ‘CSOs are not well coordinated. If they were, they would have some standardized way of working.’</p>
<p>Furthermore, organizations compete with one another over funds from donors and thus have little incentive for cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312447060">Kelly and Birdsall, 2008</xref>). One TNCM board member further described this competition in a Global Fund application process: ‘When it came to the decision among civil society organizations over who was to be represented there was a fight among the civil society organizations on who should participate. The meeting ended up as one with 150 representatives.’ In conclusion, the horizontal-external coordination between the government and civil society organizations in Tanzania is weak.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0020852312447060"><title>Interpreting the politics of coordination in Tanzania</title>
<p>This section presents several theoretical propositions that we apply to interpret the politics of coordination in Tanzania as revealed thus far in this article. The politics of coordination can be summed up in two paradoxes emanating from the efforts towards coordination:
<list id="list5-0020852312447060" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>High formalization of coordination in institutional terms (with TACAIDS placed in the PMO) → low formalization of coordination in practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Donors’ parallel support of a multisectoral approach and scaling up of funding towards anti-retroviral treatment and related health sector services has led to the health sector’s approach being strengthened over the multisectoral approach.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>To address these two paradoxes, we turn to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson’s (1982: 147)</xref> theoretical framework, called ‘the policy sector as an interorganizational political economy’. This framework also belongs to the instrumental-structural perspective within organization theory. However, Benson applies a perspective that focuses on the broader context in which coordination takes place; within the policy sector and its interorganizational political economy.</p>
<p>As the identification of the pattern of coordination and its challenges in the previous section demonstrated that the political economy of HIV/AIDS policy sector was important for pattern and challenges, we found it relevant to apply Benson’s propositions in this article. Benson defined the policy sector as ‘a cluster or complex of organizations connected to each other by resource dependencies and distinguished from other clusters or complexes by breaks in the structure of resource dependencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson, 1982</xref>: 148). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson (1982)</xref> included the following elements as part of a policy sector: the policy paradigm employed, administrative arrangements/division of labour, interorganizational dependencies among organizations participating in coordination, the structured interests of various organizations, and rules of structure formation. The rules of structure formation are omitted from the current discussion as it is beyond the scope of this article. The discussion of the administrative arrangements is also omitted as they have already been outlined using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid’s (2008)</xref> framework, which provides a more nuanced view of the possible forms of coordination.</p>
<p>The interorganizational dependencies and the structured interests of the various organizations involved ‘constitute power structures in place, which constrict the range of potential paradigms and administrative structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson, 1982</xref>: 151). Thus, to break interdependence and existing power structures, reorganizations are often attempted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson (1982)</xref> identified interest power structures by grouping interests into ‘demand groups’, ‘support groups’, ‘administrative groups’, ‘provider groups’, and ‘coordinating groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson, 1982</xref>: 154–160).</p>
<p>Applied to Tanzania, the relevant groups are the support groups, the administrative groups, and the coordinating groups. The demand groups (that is, those who demand services) and the provider groups (that is, those who provide the services) are not discussed in this article because the focus is not on service delivery. Support groups include the donors because they are the ones who ‘provide resources – financial and political – for the organizations in the policy sector’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson, 1982</xref>: 155). Donors would not see themselves as playing a political role. However, as they provide most of the resources for HIV/AIDS work in the country, their priority-setting – deemed as what sectors and types of services they consider eligible for funding – constitute political priorities/resources in practice.</p>
<p>Given that donor priorities dominate, it becomes apparent that ministries and civil society organizations engaged in HIV/AIDS work are administrative groups. TACAIDS and the Tanzania National Coordinating Mechanism (TNCM) are the coordinating groups. The National AIDS Control Programme – which used to be the coordinating group dominating the interorganizational interdependence among central government organizations working on HIV/AIDS before TACAIDS was established – has continued as a coordinating group as the health sector approach dominates in HIV/AIDS work.</p>
<p>Donors acknowledged the previously existing interorganizational interdependence as described above and convinced the Tanzanian government of the need to move from the existing health sector approach to a broader multisectoral approach. Such a move was expected to engage government ministries, as well as civil society organizations more in HIV/AIDS work. Moving from a health sector approach to a multisectoral approach involved the creation of TACAIDS. This move may have been an attempt to reorganize a policy sector, by setting up a broader multisectoral coordinating body and formulating one multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategy.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson (1982)</xref>, governments often attempt to reorganize policy sectors when one policy paradigm dominates and the interdependence relation is skewed towards one or a few dominating organizations. However, in many instances, reorganization processes do not lead to change, but ‘simply reproduce the dominance of these units in new forms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson, 1982</xref>: 152). Such reproduction of an existing policy paradigm and interdependence relations seems to have occurred in Tanzania, due to the scaling up of anti-retroviral treatment and related services that took place at the same time that TACAIDS tried to ensure a multisectoral, coordinated approach towards HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.</p>
<p>The reproduction seems to have taken place as PEPFAR and the Global Fund strengthened the health sector work on HIV/AIDS with a major increase in funding. Thus, the larger political economy of the policy sector made the politics of coordination possible in addition to the challenges we have identified.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0020852312447060" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has described and discussed national multisectoral HIV/AIDS coordination in Tanzania. We applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312447060">Christensen and Lægreid’s (2008)</xref> theoretical framework, which distinguishes four different forms of coordination, and used this framework to identify the pattern and challenges to multisectoral HIV/AIDS coordination in Tanzania. An assessment framework that operationalized these four forms of coordination structured the data collection and presentation of findings.</p>
<p>We summed up the pattern and challenges related to multisectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS as representing an ongoing politics of coordination taking place in Tanzania. Two paradoxes describe this politics of coordination: (1) high formalization of coordination by having set up TACAIDS – a coordinating unit within the PMO – but low formalization in practice as few efforts have been made to coordinate in Tanzania, and (2) donors’ promotion of the reorganization of the HIV/AIDS work through the multisectoral approach while also reinforcing the existing health sector approach by channelling the majority of their funds to the health sector’s anti-retroviral treatment services.</p>
<p>We then used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson’s (1982)</xref> theoretical framework to interpret these paradoxes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312447060">Benson (1982)</xref> has suggested that coordination efforts have to be analysed within the broader context in which they take place – namely, within the policy sector and its interorganizational political economy. From this perspective, multisectoral coordination has remained low as the policy paradigm that prevailed in work on HIV/AIDS before TACAIDS and the multisectoral approach were introduced; in other words, the health sector approach continued as the dominant policy paradigm. The larger political economy of HIV/AIDS as represented by the health sector receiving a majority of the funding contributed to this politics of coordination and the subsequent pattern of weak multisectoral coordination in Tanzania.</p>
<p>How has the Tanzanian government attempted to ensure domestic accountability in the midst of GHIs’ priority-setting and funding? In a situation where approximately 98 percent of the funds are provided by external donors, the question of domestic accountability becomes paramount. The challenges to horizontal-internal coordination (that is, within the central government) lead to two domestic accountability problems. First, ministries are not in practice accountable to the population as they do not fulfil their part of the multisectoral work on HIV/AIDS. Second, TACAIDS has little political authority within the central government to make it fulfil their responsibility – a problem documented in other African countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312447060">Morah and Ihalainen, 2009</xref>: 186). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312447060">Harman (2009: 360)</xref> concluded that the NACs in Africa have ‘undermined the position and capacity of traditional state agencies, most notably Ministries of Health’, the situation after the scaling up of care and treatment seems to have contributed to strengthening the Ministry of Health’s position internally in the Tanzanian government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sridhar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312447060">2009:</xref> 1370) pointed to the fact that coordination efforts may actually ‘decrease the policy space of developing countries by shifting the balance of power towards the “consortium of donors acting in unison”, and thus there could be an inherent contradiction in the partnership’. This contradiction is revealed in the case of multisectoral national HIV/AIDS coordination in Tanzania, as discussed in this article. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312447060">Spicer et al. (2010: 10)</xref> pointed to the contradiction between adherence to coordination as the strategy and actual practice of the GHIs in Zambia and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Through the findings presented in this article, we contribute to the existing literature on HIV/AIDS coordination/global health coordination/aid coordination. A particular contribution of this article is that it applies theoretical elements from organization theory, which is otherwise absent in the existing literature. Scholars and policy-makers may adapt and use the four forms of coordination as well as the operationalized framework presented herein in the studies of global health/HIV/AIDS/other issues and on aid coordination. The article also contributes to organization theory by applying this theory to a new empirical field.</p>
