<title>Fatal Hemolysis in Infant</title>
<p>A newborn male preterm infant (30 weeks gestational age) with respiratory distress syndrome developed hemolytic anemia possibly related to rasburicase administration. Concurrent medications included intravenous gentamicin (10 mg every 24 hours) and ampicillin (100 mg every 12 hours). Because of a high uric acid level (6.67 mg/dL), a single dose of rasburicase was administered in the 33rd hour of life. By the 64th hour, bilirubin levels suddenly increased, which were subsequently treated with phototherapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. Bilirubin levels remain at 18.3 mg% for 7 hours. Hematocrit levels dropped to 28% in the 79th hour and to 22% in the 83rd hour. Vercuronium was administered and high-frequency ventilation was initiated. Dopamine and dobutamine were also introduced into treatment. Nursing notes recorded bronze skin coloring and dark urine, suggestive of urine hemoglobin. Despite treatment efforts, the infant died. A postmortem blood sample revealed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this infant possibly developed hemolytic anemia related to rasburicase administration. They noted that the administration of this agent is contraindicated in the presence of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.</p>

<title>Prolonged Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time</title>
<p>A 77-year-old male patient developed hematomas, easy bruising, and a conjunctival hemorrhage after 12 months of receiving dabigatran (75 mg twice daily) therapy for chronic atrial fibrillation. Concurrent medications included metoprolol, spironolactone, torasemide, metformin, and digoxin. Symptoms occurred 7 days prior to admission and prompted self-discontinuation of dabigatran. Increased dyspnea and lower extremity edema related to heart failure exacerbation caused hospital admission. Significant laboratory values included a prolonged activated partial prothrombin time of 71.4 seconds, slightly elevated prothrombin time, and markedly reduced factor VIII activity (&lt;5 international units/dL). Treatment included optimization of diuretic therapy leading to resolution of heart failure exacerbation symptoms. The continued development of new hematomas triggered further evaluation. Additional coagulation parameters including prothrombin time, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, platelet count, platelet function, factors IX, X were within normal range, and there was a slight reduction in factor XII activity (53 international units/dL). The presence of an acquired factor VIII inhibitor was confirmed with activated partial prothrombin time–based plasma-mixing studies. Treatment included prednisolone (1.5 mg/kg tapered to 5 mg daily) and a single cyclophosphamide dose (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) leading to decreased inhibitor titer levels and complete remission. Dabigatran was not reintroduced.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the prolonged activated partial prothrombin time was likely caused by an acquired factor VIII inhibitor. The proposed mechanism was binding of auto- or alloantibodies to factor VIII thus inhibiting clotting activity. The authors claimed it was unlikely dabigatran was the cause.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert: Serious Skin Reactions</title>
<p>On December 19, 2012, the US FDA notified health care professionals regarding reports of serious skin reactions, some fatal, associated with telaprevir in combination with peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin. Based on these data, the FDA is adding a boxed warning to the telaprevir labeling regarding discontinuation in patients experiencing a rash with systemic symptoms or a progressive severe rash. In addition to reports received in the United States, the FDA also received 2 reports from Japan of toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with telaprevir in combination with peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin. In the fatal case, the patient continued the combination regimen for a period of time after symptoms developed.</p>

<title>Fatal Cardiac Arrest (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013475374">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 24-year-old female experienced cardiac arrest after ingesting an unknown quantity of magic mushrooms. No concurrent medications were reported. Past medical history included heart transplant for end-stage rheumatic heart disease 10 years prior. Symptoms began 2 to 3 hours after magic mushroom consumption. While awaiting treatment, cyanosis and a pulseless state occurred. Treatment included cardiopulmonary resuscitation with intermittent return of spontaneous circulation interspersed with ventricular fibrillation, tachycardias, and bradyarrhythmias. Resuscitation continued for 100 minutes after which time a deceased state was declared. Autopsy verified a healthy cardiac allograft. Plasma toxicology revealed a psilocin level of 30 µg/L, consistent with magic mushroom toxicity, and a tetrahydrocannabinol level of 4 µg/L. The cause of death was determined to be psilocin toxicity.</p>
<p>The authors determined that this was the first reported death from cardiac arrest due to ingestion of psilocybe mushrooms. The proposed mechanism of action was enhanced cardiac adrenergic receptor sensitivity following cardiac transplantation leading to excessive sympathetic stimulation by psilocybin and fatal ventricular arrhythmias.</p>

<title>Urinary Incontinence (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013475374">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 71-year-old female developed urinary incontinence after initiating hydroxychloroquine (250 mg daily) for rheumatoid arthritis. Concurrent medications included atorvastatin, isosorbide mononitrate, diltiazem, methylprednisolone, pantoprazole, and vitamin D. Serum analysis revealed no abnormalities, and predisposing risk factors were absent. Pelvic echography demonstrated urinary bladder distension. Treatment included discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine resulting in remission of symptoms within 1 day. Hydroxychloroquine was reintroduced 5 days later with recurrence of urinary incontinence within 2 days. Permanent discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine resulted in resolution of symptoms.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this was the first report of urinary incontinence due to hydroxychloroquine. Through analysis via the Naranjo’s adverse drug reaction causality algorithm, they determined that hydroxychloroquine was the probable cause of the urinary incontinence experienced by this patient. The proposed mechanism was that hydroxychloroquine induced increased expression of endothelin-1 and interleukin-6 release resulting in enhanced bladder detrusor smooth muscle contractility.</p>

<title>Fulminant Hepatic Failure</title>
<p>A 59-year-old woman developed nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain while being treated with quetiapine for hallucinations related to previous pramipexole therapy. Concurrent medications included oxazepam and carbidopa-levodopa. A general unwell feeling began 3 weeks after initiating quetiapine and was present for 3 weeks. Significant findings on physical exam included bilateral icterus and abdominal distention with tenderness of the right upper quadrant. Significant laboratory results included elevations in alanine aminotransferase (71 international units/L), aspartate aminotransferase (740 international units/L), lactate dehydrogenase (737 international units/L), γ-glutamyl transferase (509 international units/L), alkaline phosphatase (196 international units/L), total bilirubin (244 µmol/L), and international normalized ratio (2.7). A vasculitic screen revealed an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:1600 and positive anti–double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid results. Tests for antineutrophil antibodies and immunoglobulins were normal but were equivocal for anti–proteinase 3. Additional analyses for alcohol levels, viral hepatitis, metabolic disorders, and vascular diseases were negative. The overall histopathological picture was suggestive of acute hepatitis with confluent bridging necrosis, indicative of drug-induced liver injury. Initial treatment included discontinuation of quetiapine and supportive measures. Within the next 48 hours, encephalopathy and ascites developed. Additional treatment included lactulose, spironolactone, furosemide, and intravenous methylprednisolone (20 mg) tapered to an oral prednisolone regimen. Clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters gradually improved until a stable condition was achieved, and discharge occurred 6 weeks after initial admission. Follow-up serum analysis 8 weeks after discharge revealed persistent mild elevations in liver enzymes.</p>
<p>The authors determined, through the Roussel Ucalf Causality Assessment Method/Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scoring system, that quetiapine was the probable cause of fulminant hepatic failure experienced by this patient. They concluded that the temporal relationship between quetiapine initiation and onset of symptoms indicated the possibility of quetiapine as causative agent.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert: Increased Adverse Events in Patients With Prosthetic Heart Valves</title>
<p>On December 19, 2012, the US FDA notified health care professionals that dabigatran etexilate mesylate should not be used to prevent stroke or major thromboembolic events in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Recently, the RE-ALIGN European trial was stopped because patients taking this drug were more likely to experience strokes, heart attacks, and blood clots forming on the mechanical heart valves than were users of warfarin. There was also more bleeding after valve surgery in the dabigatran users than in the warfarin users.</p>

<title>Allergies and Immunological Reactions</title>
<p>An analysis on 474 reports of adverse drug effects over 125 921 hospital admissions in a teaching- hospital-based pharmacovigilance network was performed to identify the drugs most frequently associated with allergies and the types of immunological reactions reported. Of the 474 reports, 177 (37.3%) were immune-mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions. The most common presentation of drug allergies was cutaneous eruptions (67%), the majority being maculopapular eruption. Anti-infective agents (33%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (13%), and anti-epileptics (10%) were the categories most frequently accounting for drug allergies. Anti-epileptic agents (29.4%), antibiotics other than β-lactams (23.5%), and vaccines (17.6%) were the drugs most commonly involved in allergic reactions. Severe drug hypersensitivity occurred in 15 patients. Eleven of these progressed to Stevens–Johnson syndrome (5 related to anti-epileptics, 3 to anti-infective agents, 1 to allopurinol, and 2 to multiple drugs). Three cases of drug eruption with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and 1 case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (related to amoxicillin and ibuprofen) were reported. A total of 25 (15%) reactions were true immunoglobulin E–mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions. Of all the reactions reported, 12 (7%) were pseudoallergic reactions, with the majority resulting from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the medications most frequently associated with immunologically mediated reactions in this analysis were anti-infective agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anti-epileptic agents. Antibiotics were the primary cause of iatrogenic anaphylaxis, and anti-epileptic agents caused the most severe drug hypersensitivity syndromes.</p>

<title>Drug-Induced Parotitis</title>
<p>A review of the English-language medical literature using MEDLINE/PubMed identified review articles, clinical trials, background data, and case reports of drug-induced parotitis, which were assessed for causality with medications employing a modified Naranjo probability scale. Approximately 84 case reports of drug-induced parotitis associated with 40 different drugs were identified and reviewed. The review indicated that parotitis has been linked to numerous medications with limited evidence. The criteria for determining causality in this publication was at least 5 case reports from at least 3 separate investigators with a minimum of 1 case indicating a “probable” causality according to the Naranjo scale. Medications meeting these criteria included L-asparaginase, clozapine, and phenylbutazone. Other drugs have been associated with qualitative evidence that supports probable cause. In most cases, it was noted that the parotitis resolved with discontinuation of the suspected agent.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that drug-induced parotitis is not a common adverse drug reaction. Based on both quantitative and qualitative evidence from the published medical literature, it appears that the most commonly associated medications include L-asparaginase, clozapine, and phenylbutazone.</p>

<title>Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Neonates</title>
<p>In a case–control study using the Canadian Neonatal Network database of admission to neonatal intensive care units between 2003 and 2008, 927 cases of necrotizing enterocolitis were matched with 2781 controls. Cases were matched to controls by gestation age at birth. Exposure to transfusion within 2 days of the index case of necrotizing enterocolitis was determined. Transfusions of red blood cells within the previous 2 days were significantly higher in the case group than in controls (15.5% vs 7.7%). All necrotizing enterocolitis patients were separated into transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis (144 infants) and non–transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis patients (783 infants). After adjustment for confounders, there were no differences between these 2 groups for mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.28), severe retinopathy (adjusted odds ratio = 1.15), or severe neurological injury (adjusted odds ratio = 0.83).</p>

<title>Risk of Asthma in Adults</title>
<p>In a retrospective case–control study using commercial claims data, 28 892 cases of at least 1-incident claim of asthma were identified. These were matched 3:1 with control for age, sex, and region. Both cases and controls were analyzed for prescription acetaminophen exposure, dose, and duration in the 7-day and 30-day (recent) and 1-year (chronic) periods. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to estimate the risk of asthma associated with acetaminophen use. The mean age in both groups was 42.8 years, with 37.7% being male. Approximately 23% of the cases and 18% of the controls had acetaminophen exposure within the previous year. Mean cumulative doses were 78.7 g and 59.8 g, respectively. The mean number of total days of acetaminophen use was significantly greater among the cases (32.2 days) compared with the controls (24.7 days). More than 90% of the prescriptions used by both cases and controls were for opioid/acetaminophen combinations. The use of drugs and presence of comorbidities that increase asthma risk were significantly higher in the case groups when compared with controls. Cumulative acetaminophen dose in the pre-index year increased the risk of asthma by 10% to 60% compared with non–acetaminophen users. Doses less than or equal to 1 kg were associated with an odds ratio of 1.09 compared with doses greater than 1 kg with an odds ratio of 1.60. Acetaminophen use greater than 30 days was associated with an elevated asthma risk (odds ratio = 1.39).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that chronic prescription-acquired acetaminophen use was associated with an increased risk of asthma but recent use was not. It was noted that nonprescription acetaminophen use was not collected in this trial.</p>

<title>Drug Reactions With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Syndrome</title>
<p>A 19-year-old Asian female patient developed a cascade of symptoms approximately 4 days after receiving an H1N1 influenza vaccination. Symptoms included lethargy, fever, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, pruritic maculopapular rash, and petechiae. Concurrent medications included sulfasalazine (no dosage provided) for 12 months in the treatment of seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. Abnormal laboratory values included elevated liver function tests, which peaked at 265 U/L for alkaline phosphatase, 316 U/L for γ-glutamyl transferase, 4419 U/L for alanine aminotransferase, and 2906 I/U for aspartate aminotransferase. Additional abnormal tests included bilirubin (186 U/L), hemoglobin (33 g/L), platelets (40 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), eosinophils (1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and lymphocytes (13.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Punch biopsies of the skin lesions indicated results consistent with drug-induced eruptions. Serology for human herpes virus 6 was positive. Recovery was complicated by pneumonia, hemolytic anemia, intravascular coagulation, and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> septicemia related to a peripherally inserted central catheter. The diagnosis of drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms was confirmed.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient developed drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome probably associated with H1N1 vaccination.

<title>Lung Injury</title>
<p>Four cases of statin-induced lung injury were described associated with rosuvastatin (dose = 5-10 mg daily; n = 3) and atorvastatin (dose = 5 mg; n = 1) therapy. All patients were male (age range = 41-85 years) and developed new pulmonary lesions after a mean duration of 4.0 months of statin treatment (range = 0.33-12 months). In all patients, the exclusion of other clinical causes was evaluated and improvement occurred after the statins were discontinued. Initial symptoms included dyspnea, fever, and cough. Foamy aveolar macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were noted in all patients. All patients were also treated with steroids (eg, 0.5 mg/kg/daily prednisolone or methylprednisolone equivalent) with resolution of symptoms. Marked resolution of lung lesions as evidenced by chest x-ray was found in 2 patients at 1 month, in 1 patient at 2.5 months, and at 9 months in the other patient. Rechallenge with statins were not performed because of the severity of the lung injury, but in 1 case, the patient experienced increased dyspnea within 1 week after the inadvertent readministration of rosuvastatin.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced statin-induced lung injury. The authors noted that phospholipids in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may be helpful in diagnosis. These patients were compared with 16 other cases identified in the published literature.</p>

<title>Trends in Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</title>
<p>In a retrospective study, observational characteristics of adverse drug reactions related to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole use in children between 2000 and 2009 were identified via ICD-9 codes in a single children’s hospital. A total of 109 children were diagnosed with a trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reaction, of which 5 cases occurred from 2000 to 2004 and the remaining 104 cases from 2005 to 2009. More than half (58%) had been treated with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for a skin and soft tissue infection, followed by 21% treated for a urinary tract infection. More than one third (37%) of patients with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reactions were hospitalized. When compared with patients who were evaluated in the emergency department, hospitalized patients more frequently had reactions that involved the mucous membranes and had documented fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. The mean age of those patients being evaluated in the emergency department (n = 69) was 8.36 years compared with 9.41 years for those hospitalized (n = 40). Approximately 30% and 48% were male, respectively. In emergency department–evaluated patients, the most common laboratory findings included white blood cells less than 4.5 (57%) and a platelet count less than 150 (14%). In contrast, patients who were hospitalized had abnormal laboratory findings, which included white blood cells less than 4.5 (29%), a platelet count less than 150 (29%), a hemoglobin level less than 10.5, and an alanine aminotransferase greater than 100 (29%). When compared with national statistics, a total of 943 trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reaction cases occurred in children hospitals between 2004 and 2009. The incidence of these reactions more than doubled in this 5-year period, increasing from 5 cases/100 000 admissions to 13 cases/100 000 admissions. National data also revealed that trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was prescribed in an estimated mean of 2.2 million ambulatory pediatric patient visits per year during this same time period. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was prescribed in 1% of ambulatory pediatric patient visits during this time period. Skin and soft tissue infections were diagnosed in 13% of the visits in which trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was prescribed, and the frequency of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole prescribing for this indication increased during the study period. It was noted that trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was prescribed in 0% to 2% of skin and soft tissue infection visits before 2005 but in 17% for skin and soft tissue infection visits in 2009.</p>
<p>The authors noted that these data revealed that there was a significant increase in the number of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reactions over a 10-year period in a children’s hospital. Of particular note was the fact that there was a 20-fold increase in the number of cases of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reactions diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 compared with those diagnosed between 2005 and 2009. The majority of these prescriptions were for skin and soft tissue infections as outpatient therapy.</p>

<title>Compounding Error, Malpractice Settlement</title>
<p>A 5-year-old patient developed seizures approximately 30 minutes after taking a compounded clonidine suspension from a local pharmacy. The child was hospitalized and intubated allegedly related to a clonidine overdose. The child was discharged after 11 days without subsequent effects. Analysis of the prepared product demonstrated a concentration that was 10-fold than the intended amount noted on the prescription label. A compounding error was thought to have contributed to the overdose. A $240 000 settlement was reached.</p>
