<p>Low-frequency noise radiated from bridge vibrations has been reported as an environmental noise problem in many countries. In order to investigate the mechanism of low-frequency noise radiated from bridge vibration, a steel bridge with a double-box is adopted for study. Modal parameters of the bridge, including natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shape, are identified from field tests by a combination of Eigensystem Realization Algorithm and Fast Fourier Transformation. Then the grillage model of the bridge is established and physics parameters of the model are updated by genetic algorithm according to identified natural frequencies. The dynamic response of the bridge by the action of a moving vehicle is calculated and assumed as the sound source of low-frequency noise. Then low-frequency noise due to bridge vibration is estimated according to sound wave propagation theories. The validity of the numerical method is verified through comparison with experimental results. Furthermore, noise reduction methods are proposed and corresponding effects are discussed. Results show that numerical simulation is feasible in assessing low-frequency noise due to traffic induced vibration of a bridge, which offers a possible way for environmental assessment as well as being a good reference for noise reduction design of bridges. The deck plate of the bridge is the primary source of low-frequency noise. Hence, increasing the stiffness of a deck plate is effective for noise control. Improving the road roughness can also reduce low-frequency noise.</p>

<p>There are many sources generating low-frequency noise, such as pumps, diesel engines, aircrafts, shipping vehicles, air turbulence, wind, fans, etc. Bridge vibration is also a kind of low-frequency noise source, which has been reported as one of the environmental problems to the residents living close to bridges. Especially for some steel bridges, because of their light weight and low stiffness, low-frequency noise problems are more likely to happen to the residents nearby.</p>
<p>A lot of research has been conducted analytically and experimentally to investigate the low-frequency noise radiation problem of bridges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311411060">Chanpheng et al.

<p>This paper investigates the low-frequency noise radiated from traffic-induced vibration of a steel double box girder bridge by means of field test and numerical analysis. A field test is performed to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the bridge and the low-frequency noise around the bridge. In numerical analysis, a grillage model of the bridge was developed and physical properties were updated through a genetic algorithm (GA) to fit the modal parameters identified from the field test. From vehicleâbridge coupling vibration analysis the dynamic responses of the bridge were calculated as a sound source. Then low-frequency noise radiated from bridge vibration was estimated based on sound propagation theory. Furthermore, based on the numerical analysis the radiation property of low-frequency noise is obtained, and noise reduction methods are proposed with the corresponding effectiveness assessed through comparative analysis.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1077546311411060"><title>2.1. Bridge description and field test</title>
<p>A three-span continuous steel double box girder bridge is adopted for study. The span arrangement is 54.6âmâ+â73.0âmâ+â54.6âm. The general layout and cross-section of the bridge are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311411060">Figure 1</xref>. It is seen from the figure that the bridge superstructure is constituted of two separate steel box girders and an orthotropic steel deck-plate lying under the bottom of the two box girders. In addition, a cantilever sidewalk is at each side of the midspan as denoted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311411060">Figure 1</xref>. Two supports are located under each girder to resist the torsional displacement.
<fig id="fig1-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sketch of bridge.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A field test is conducted to investigate the dynamic and low-frequency noise radiation characteristics of the bridge. The test has two parts: the dynamic vibration test, which records the acceleration responses of bridge girders and deck plate, and the low-frequency noise test for measuring the low-frequency sound pressure level (SPL) from the bridge vibration.</p>
<p>In the vibration test, acceleration sensors, data recorder and FFT analyzer are used to record the dynamic acceleration response of girders and the deck plate. The arrangement of acceleration sensors is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2</xref>. Eight accelerator sensors (B1â¼B8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2(a)</xref>) are installed on the bottom flanges of two box girders to measure the vertical vibration of girders. Nine accelerator sensors (D1â¼D9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2(b)</xref>) are fixed at the middle of the side span to measure the local vibration of the deck plate. The test was performed under two load conditions separately: ambient excitation (traffic free) and a certain traffic load. The sampling frequency was 100âHz, a value that is much higher than necessary in the test of the bridge.
<fig id="fig2-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Arrangement of accelerator and sound pressure sensors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the low-frequency noise test, the low-frequency SPL was measured by the sound sensors (frequency coverage 1â1âkHz, SPL coverage 53â147âdB). Three sound sensors are used in the test, where two (L2-L3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2(a)</xref>) are located near the abutment and one (L1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2(a)</xref>) at the midspan. Considering the influence of sound wave reflection from the abutment and buildings, only the sensor at midspan (L1) is adopted to extract the characteristics of low-frequency noise. The sensor L1 is 1.2âm above the ground and 4.5âm beneath the bottom of the bridge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The excitation condition is the same with the vibration test, while the ambient condition is applied to indicate that other noise besides the vehicle-induced vibration noise is negligible during the test. For traffic load conditions, in order to obtain the frequency components of low-frequency noise when heavy vehicles move through, 1/3 octave analysis is performed on the time series of SPL. The analysis is conducted through 1/3 octave analyzer and the result is recorded by data recorder. Note that only the period with thecorresponding SPL falls between peak value and (peak-5) value is used for analysis. Through 1/3 octave analysis the amplitude of SPL corresponding to each frequency band is obtained. The frequency coverage is 1â80âHz in analysis, which has included the frequency concerned.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1077546311411060"><title>2.2. Modal parameter identification</title>
<p>From Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis the acceleration response spectra of girder and deck plate under ambient excitation (traffic free) are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311411060">Figure 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311411060">Figure 3(a)</xref> shows the vibration of box girders. It is seen that the vibration of the box girder is dominated by frequencies at 1.20âHz, 1.95âHz, 2.30âHz, 3.60âHz and 3.80âHz. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311411060">Figure 3(b)</xref> shows the vibration of the deck plate, it contains local vibration with predominant frequencies at 9.85âHz and 13.9âHz, except for the same predominant frequencies as in box girder.
<fig id="fig3-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Acceleration response spectra of the bridge due to micro-tremor.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In order to obtain the natural frequency, mode shape and damping ratio of the bridge, the ERA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311411060">Juang and Pappa, 1985</xref>) is adopted to analyze the acceleration responses of the bridge. The data used in ERA is a free decaying response after the vehicle passes through the bridge. To exclude the causal factors in experiment, measurements are performed several times to form enough sample sets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311411060">Figure 4</xref> gives an example of the free decaying responses of the box girder and the deck plate.
<fig id="fig4-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Example of free decaying acceleration response.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Modal amplitude coherence (MAC), an index indicating the similarity between measured response and the identified model's response, can be used to extract physical modes from vibration signals. When the MAC of mode tends to 1, the corresponding mode is considered to be a physical mode. However, it is found that MAC alone can barely identify the physical and noise mode, because some MAC value of the noise mode is also close to 1. To exclude the influence of noise modes, a de-noising technique and FFT are used together with ERA in this paper to identify modal parameters. The modal parameter identification is conducted based on the following procedure:
<list id="list1-1077546311411060" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Firstly, the measured signal is de-noised using Daubechies-8 type wavelet filter;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Then, ERA is applied to the de-noised signal to extract model parameters, including natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shape. Note that adopted modal parameters must be stable for models of increasing orders. Modes that exist in most of these models with consistent frequency, damping ratio and mode shape are considered stable and are likely to be physical;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The natural frequency extracted from ERA method (step 2) is compared with the result of FFT. If it exists in both ERA and FFT results, the frequency and corresponding mode shape are reserved. If the frequency exists in the ERA results but not in the FFT results, it is considered as noise mode and discarded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Steps (1)â(3) are performed repetitively with multiple datasets. Only the mode with stable parameters (including frequency and mode shape) in different datasets is taken as the physical mode.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The above procedure is firstly applied to the vibration signal of a box girder. The modal parameters obtained are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311411060">Table 1</xref>. In the table, B1-B8 corresponds to the locations of acceleration meters on the box girder, and the dotted line represents the original shape of the structure. The dominant modes of the bridge are: 1) The first order symmetric vertical bending: fâ=â1.199âHz; 2) The first order asymmetric vertical bending: fâ=â1.946âHz; 3) The second order symmetric vertical bending: fâ=â5.72âHz; 4) The torsion modes: fâ=â3.603âHz and fâ=â3.763âHz; 5) The bending-torsion coupling mode: fâ=â2.299âHz. The damping ratio of the bridge is around 0.5%, which is a typical value for steel bridges.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>The same procedure is then applied to the vibration signal of the deck plate. As discussed before, local vibration with the frequency range of 10â15âHz is remarkable in the vibration of the deck plate. However, because the frequency distribution of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311411060">Figure 3(b)</xref> is dense in this frequency range, direct comparison between the frequencies from ERA and FFT in this range is difficult. As an alternative, frequencies stable in most datasets are taken as predominant frequencies of deck plate in local vibration. However, this may lead to lower accuracy in the identification of deck plate parameters.</p>
<p>Vibration of the deck plate can be classified into two groups: global vibration and local vibration. The global vibration with the frequency below 9âHz is observed both at the vibration of the box girder and the deck plate and the corresponding modal parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311411060">Table 1</xref>, while the local vibration with the frequency range of 10â¼15âHz only exists at the vibration of the deck plate and the obtained modal parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311411060">Table 2</xref>. The local vibration of the deck plate is independent of the vibration of the box girder. The largest damping ratio is 1.75% for the frequency of 15.029âHz, while most of modal damping ratios are around 0.5%.

<sec id="sec5-1077546311411060"><title>2.3. Analytical model of the bridge and model updating</title>
<p>In order to consider the effect of local vibration of the deck plate, a grillage model is applied for analysis. The plan view and cross-sectional view of the grillage model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311411060">Figure 5</xref>. In this figure the stiffness of a longitudinal beam considers contributions from longitudinal ribs and the deck plate, while the stiffness of a transverse beam comes from that of cross ribs and the deck plate. The stiffness of the sidewalk in the midspan is neglected in the model, while the corresponding self weight is included by adding its mass to adjacent box girder element. The boundary conditions are considered according to the arrangement of supports.
<fig id="fig5-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Grillage model of the bridge.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The natural frequencies of the bridge from the grillage model are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077546311411060">Table 3</xref>, together with the frequencies identified from Section 2.2. Some differences exist between the analytical and experimental results, which are caused by inaccuracy in material properties, geometry dimensions and boundary conditions. To minimize these differences, model updating is carried out through genetic algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311411060">Goldberg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311411060">Mitchell, 1998</xref>). GA is a stochastic global search technique for optimization problems. Based on the mechanics of natural evolution, it uses techniques such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover to let individuals evolve toward better ones. The algorithms usually have the following steps: 1) Randomly generate an initial population; 2) Calculate the fitness for each individual in the current population; 3) Define selection probabilities for each individual; 4) Generate offspring by probabilistically selecting individuals from the previous generation via genetic operators; 5) Repeat step 2) until the solution is satisfactory.

<p>In the model updating part of this paper, natural frequencies of the first four modal shapes are adopted as objective function, and the stiffness and mass of the grillage model are debugged until they achieve sufficient fitness, while the boundary conditions remain unchanged. In order to let the obtained physical properties fall within an acceptable and realistic range, the maximum variation range of stiffness and mass is 7% of the initial value in this model updating procedure. In addition, the modes of local vibration have not been used in the updating process, because the modes of local vibration are so complicated that direct comparison of local vibration is unfeasible. The natural frequencies from the experiment, the original model and the updated model are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077546311411060">Table 3</xref>. It can be seen that the difference of every mode between the experiment and athe analytical model decreases, indicating that the precision of the model is improved after model updating. The updated model will be used in the following analysis.</p></sec>

<p>The SPL can be calculated by its definition once the sound pressure is obtained from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1077546311411060">equation (1)</xref>. To verify the calculation method, the contrast between experimental and analytical SPL at point L1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311411060">Figure 2(a)</xref>) is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref>. The analytical result is calculated under the condition introduced in Section 2.4. The experimental results are obtained under the traffic load conditions as described previously. The experiment was repeated several times to check the repeatability. The repeating experimental SPL are represented by multiple sets of thin lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref>, while the analytical SPL is represented by the dark red line. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref> the vertical and horizontal axes denote the SPL in dB and 1/3 octave band frequency, respectively.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref>, experimental and analytical SPL accord quite well with each other, especially at the frequency below 5âHz. The difference at the frequency range of 5â16âHz appears larger. This is possibly because the grillage model is only updated according to the global modes of the bridge, of which the natural frequencies are all below 5âHz. The good agreement between experimental and analytical results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref> demonstrated that it is feasible to calculate SPL using the applied method, as long as the bridge model can represent the vibration characteristics of the real bridge.</p>
<p>It is also observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref> that there are three peaks in the SPL spectrum, and the corresponding 1/3-octave band center frequencies are 1.25âHz, 2.5âHz and 8â16âHz respectively. The predominant frequencies 1.25âHz and 2.5âHz are mainly caused by the vibration of the first three modes of the bridge, which are 1.2âHz, 2.1âHz and 2.3âHz in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311411060">Table 2</xref>, respectively. The SPL in the frequency range of 8â16âHz is more remarkable than that of the first two predominant frequencies. Back to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311411060">Figure 3</xref>, it is found that the vibration with the frequency range of 8â16 Hz only exists in the local vibration of deck plate, i.e. the SPL at the third peak (8â16âHz) is mainly generated from the local vibration of deck plate. Thus, it is concluded that the most important source of low-frequency noise radiated from bridge vibration is the local vibration of the deck plate.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1077546311411060"><title>3.2. Sound power from bridge vibration</title>
<p>Sound power <italic>W</italic> is a measure of sonic energy transferred by the sound source in unit time. <italic>It is measured in watts or the product of sound intensity I and area A. It is neither space dependent nor distance dependent, but belongs strictly to the sound source</italic> (Wikipedia). In this paper the sound power of the bridge under traffic vibration is estimated by the following equation,
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1077546311411060"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Where the notations have the same meaning as those of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1077546311411060">equation (1)</xref>.</p>
<p>The vibration response of the bridge under a 200âkN moving vehicle with a speed of 40âkm/h is adopted in the calculation of sound power. The variation of sound power against the position of the vehicle is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1077546311411060">Figure 11</xref>, with the vertical axis representing the sound power of the bridge and the horizontal axis representing the location of the vehicle. When the vehicle moves around the midpoint of each span, the sound power tends to be larger and dominated by lower frequency components, compared with the vehicle near the abutment or pier. This is because, when the vehicle is at the middle of each span, the amplitude of the bridge vibration is larger and vibration components with low frequencies become more predominant.
<fig id="fig11-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>The sound power of bridge under moving vehicle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Considering that the sound power is dependent on the velocity of the structure and that the vibration around the midpoint of each span is the main source generating the low-frequency noise, the velocities at the center of each span along the bridge centerline are analyzed to get insight into the low-frequency noise radiated from the bridge. On the other hand, in order to investigate the effect of vehicle location on the frequency component of the vibration around the midpoint of each span, wavelet transformation is performed on the velocity response of the concerned point. The velocity responses of the three points and their corresponding wavelet transformations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1077546311411060">Figure 12</xref>. In the wavelet transformation, Morlet wavelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077546311411060">Ruzzene et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077546311411060">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>) is adopted. It is observed that the local vibration of the point (vibration in the frequency range of 8â16âHz) is most prominent only when the vehicle is close to the point. However, the global vibration (with frequency below 5âHz) is consistently prominent during the whole process. That is, the local vibration of the deck plate only exists in the vicinity of moving vehicles.

<sec id="sec12-1077546311411060"><title>4.2. Comparative analysis of noise reduction methods</title>
<p>The effectiveness of noise reduction methods is assessed by comparing the SPL and sound power of the five cases. The SPL at point L1 for all cases is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1077546311411060">Figure 13</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1077546311411060">Figure 13</xref>, it is concluded that: 1) vehicle speed only has effect on the noise below 5âHz, and the SPL value increases with the increase of vehicle speed in this frequency range; 2) road surface roughness has an effect on the noise in all frequency components, more roughness leads to larger SPL at whole frequency range; 3) the effect of crossbeam stiffness is most obvious in the frequency range of 10â¼20âHz, which is the range of local vibration of the deck plate; 4) increasing the stiffness of box girders only reduces the SPL below 3âHz, which is the frequency range of the global vibration of the bridge. Because the low-frequency noise in the frequency range of 10â20âHz is most remarkable from the field test, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311411060">Figure 10</xref>, increasing the stiffness of crossbeams is the most effective measure in reducing low-frequency noise. Moreover, improving the road surface roughness is also useful in low-frequency noise control.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1077546311411060">Figure 14</xref> shows the variation of sound power against vehicle position <italic>x</italic> for the cases with the vehicle speed at 40âkm/h. It is shown that road surface roughness has a significant effect on the sound power. The sound power rises remarkably with an increase in road surface roughness, and the stiffness of the box girder also influences the sound power.
<fig id="fig14-1077546311411060" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Sound power of the bridge under Cases 1, 3, 4 and 5.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311411060-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From the above discussion, it can be seen that pavement roughness has a great effect on the low-frequency noise radiated from bridge vibration. To further investigate the effect of pavement roughness, the SPL spectra under four different roughness conditions are analyzed and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311411060">Figure 15</xref>. The legend in the figure represents the amplification factor of road surface roughness shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311411060">Figure 7</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311411060">Figure 15</xref> shows that the SPL can be reduced by more than 10âdB if the pavement roughness is decreased from two times the base condition to one half. This demonstrates the importance of bridge structures to keep good surface conditions.

<sec id="sec13-1077546311411060"><title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>In this paper, a steel continuous bridge with two separate box girders is employed to investigate the mechanism of low-frequency noise radiated from traffic-induced vibration of a bridge. A grillage model of the bridge is firstly established and then updated using a genetic algorithm to fit the modal parameters from a field test. Based on the dynamic response of the bridge, sound pressure level and sound power are calculated according to sound propagation theories. Moreover, different noise reduction methods are proposed and corresponding effects are compared. In summary, the following conclusions are drawn:
<list id="list2-1077546311411060" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The numerical method, including the vehicleâbridge coupling vibration analysis and point source superposition method, is feasible in the calculation of low-frequency noise radiated from bridge structures;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The local vibration of the deck plate in the frequency range of 10â20âHz is the primary source of low-frequency noise for this type of bridge structure. Thus increasing the stiffness of crossbeams appears an effective way of solving the low-frequency noise problem. On the other hand, improving the surface condition is considered as an alternative noise reduction method due to its significant effect on reducing the noise in overall frequency range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limiting the vehicle speed and increasing the box girder stiffness are not very effective in terms of noise reduction, though they can help reduce noise with a frequency below 5âHz.</p></list-item>
