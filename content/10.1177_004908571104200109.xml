<p>Dr Ramdayal Munda is no more with us. His absence will be felt by all and especially by the social movements in India for a long time. It was not easy for a person like Dr Munda to touch the horizon in the way he did in his life time. From childhood, his life was a continuous struggle. Born in a tribal society, Dr Munda worked and dedicated his life for the realisation of the rights of indigenous and disadvantaged groups. He proved to the world that in tribal societies there is enough intellectual power and wisdom to counter the onslaught of dominant powers.</p>
<p>Dr Munda was an enlightened thinker, anthropologist, social worker, singer, playwright, researcher, musician, professor, social educator and activist. He embodied some of the greatest treasures of the world in himself. I visited him few weeks before his death on 12 September 2011 in Ranchi with Vasavi Kiro, a leading activist, journalist and member of the Jharkhand Womens’ Commission. His physical condition was not good but his mind was alert. He had many dreams for the emancipation of tribal societies. Just one and a half years ago he had been nominated as member of Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament) and a few months before that he was also appointed as Member of National Advisory Committee formed by the ruling United Progressive Alliance (II) government. Through these two powerful posts he was hoping to do quite a lot for the tribal people of this country. We met and discussed these issues with him at his residence in Delhi. Even in his worsening condition his only concern was to work for tribes at the national level. He wanted to build one big cultural institution for tribal society of diverse cultures in Ranchi and wanted to give it an international status. He was concerned about how effectively he would spend the amount for the poor that was allotted to him as a member of the Rajya Sabha. It was heartening to see Dr Ramdayal Munda praying to God, in our presence for surviving at least another five years till he could achieve his objectives. He knew that his days were numbered but till his last breath he had deep concern for tribal societies and their upliftment. He discussed in great detail the work to be done at the national and state level for tribal peoples with Vasavi Kiro. He also discussed the discrimination being practiced by the Indian state by not recognising the tribes as Scheduled Tribes in various states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam. He talked about the formation of the tribal council in Madhya Pradesh so that the tribes who did not get the Scheduled Tribe status were at least represented in such councils. This was the last we saw him. He left this world on 30 September 2011.</p>
<p>Dr Munda had a dynamic personality. He worked at the grass-roots level and at the same time his thinking was not only national but also global. Just a few months before his death, on 29–31 March 2011, he organised a big conference on the critical issues affecting tribal society. Issues such as displacement, discrimination, violence, non-implementation of Forest Rights Act, various issues relating to inequality in the development paradigm in the tribal regions and the non-implementation of Panchayat Extension Scheduled Area Act (PESA) were the main focus of attention at the conference in which tribal representatives from 16 states participated. It was a very vibrant programme that brought the attention of government, policy makers, scholars, activists and researchers.</p>
<p>Dr Munda’s health had begun to deteriorate several days before the conference. Vasavi Kiro was constantly involved in organising the programme, with him in Delhi. In the context of the programme, my colleague Ashok Chowdhury and I met him many times in Delhi to discuss future strategies. His appetite was decreasing day by day so was his weight. Everyone was quite worried about his health. Just after the conference, he was rushed to the All India Medical Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi where he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was flown to the US for the further treatment but it was too late. Cancer had spread throughout the body. He had to come back to Ranchi and at his residence he was given treatment through chemotherapy.</p>
<p>On 14–15 September 2011 we organised a big consultation on the issue of ‘Women and Forest Rights’ and had gone to invite him for this programme on 12 September. But seeing his condition we could not do so and during our programme on 14t September he himself called Vasavi Kiro to tell her that he was being admitted in Apollo hospital; his voice was shaking yet he wished us all success. He had always wished that tribal women should be in the forefront and had always encouraged them to come forward.</p>
<p>His most important contribution was in the field of culture where he worked on tribal language, dance, singing and art. We remember many protests and marches where Dr Munda would himself dance and play drums, singing and playing for hours. He was a lyricist too and wrote many songs and was a very good singer. In any meeting, before speaking he would start with singing a Mundari song (Munda tribal song).</p>
<p>His political career was not very long. He contested elections but was not successful. But he played a very important role and participated in agitations for the formation of the new state of Jharkhand. He contributed in his own way to the political process. He was never active with any political party nor did he form any political organisation. So it is difficult to evaluate him politically. However, after the formation of the new Jharkhand state, there was a vacuum among the social and political movements; they were disoriented and scattered, resulting in disillusionment among the Adivasis. The older leadership did not have the capacity to start a new political process and the younger generation was yet to emerge to form a new process. In this vacuum, there was a special role that Dr Munda could have played—had time permitted—to bring all these social and political movements together and to start a new political process. This task remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted that Dr Munda played a crucial role in the formation of the National Forum of Forest People and Forest Workers (NFFPFW) that was formed in Ranchi in the year 1998. He was associated with the NFFPFW right from the beginning along with well-known anthropologist Dr B. K. Roy Burman (who worked on the definition of forest people and forest workers and this definition was adopted by the 2nd Labour Commission Report also). He helped in building up this forum from time to time and remained in an advisory capacity. Dr Munda’s loss is an immense loss for NFFPFW that is itself passing through a crucial time at present.</p>
<p>We salute Dr Munda for his invaluable contribution and his consistent fight for the disempowered section of society.</p>
<p>Long live Ramdayal Munda! Long live the Adivasi struggle!</p>
