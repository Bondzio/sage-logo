<abstract>
<p>In this study, experiments are carried out to assess the influence of igniter location on the ignition characteristics of horizontally oriented and vertically oriented polymethylmethacrylate. Some new and significant conclusions are drawn from the study, including the linear relation between ignition time and the height of igniter and the U-shape curve of mass flux at ignition when the specimen is horizontally oriented. On the other hand, compared with the horizontally oriented condition, the mass flux at ignition of the vertically oriented specimen is larger. As the pilot igniter is moved perpendicularly with respect to the vertically oriented polymethylmethacrylate, its position, together with heat flux and solid boundary, influence the ignition time. The position of shortest ignition time is experimentally observed and as the igniter is moved horizontally, ignition time increases with increasing distance between the igniter and the surface of the vertically oriented specimen. The distance for nonignition also increases with increasing heat flux.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pilot ignition of combustible solids by radiation is ignition where combustible solids are subjected to a high enough incident heat flux to decompose and produce volatile species, which then mix with air and are ignited by the pilot for premixed flame propagating to the surface. The process has been studied in numerous papers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112447598">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734904112447598"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734904112447598"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112447598">4</xref></sup> and several excellent reviews have been presented by Babrauskas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112447598">5</xref></sup>, Janssens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112447598">6</xref></sup> and Drysdale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734904112447598">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Less attention has been paid to the effects led by the pilot location, which does make difference to characteristics of piloted ignition. Simms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734904112447598">8</xref></sup> studied the influence of the position of pilot flame. In his experiments, pine sample was vertically oriented, and the distance of the gas pilot in front of the surface varied horizontally. His results revealed that the distance had obvious effect on the ignition time. On the other hand, in Muir’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734904112447598">9</xref></sup> research, he did not change the distance between the pilot and the specimen but varied the height above the sample vertically, and he found that the effect on ignition time was small, until sizable heights (75–100 mm) above the top were reached. However, during a similar experiment with Muir’s, we found that the height was not the single contributing factor, and the results depended on the experimental condition. Both Simms and Muir conducted their investigations with vertically oriented specimens. Tzeng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734904112447598">10</xref></sup> studied the difference between two positions of the pilot when the specimen was horizontal and pointed out that the position of pilot partially affected the surface temperature and critical fuel flow rate. But there are limits in his simulation study. Existing research is far from enough. In this article, for the sake of comprehensive analysis, a systematic experimental study was carried out. We explore the impacts of pilot locations with two kinds of orientations of the specimen, which are defined as the horizontal and the vertical. Some main characteristics of piloted ignition, including the mass flux at ignition and ignition time, are investigated.</p>

<title>Experiment method</title>
<p>All experiments are conducted in the movable radiation platform, which is developed to test the characteristics of radiation ignition of materials. The experimental apparatus, in which both the orientation of specimen and the position of pilot can be adjusted, is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112447598">Figure 1</xref>. The radiation source is made of six silicon–carbide bars, which can supply a uniform radiation heat flux of 0–50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. The heat flux at the surface of specimen is measured by a water-cooled heat flux metre. The distance between the specimen and the surface of radiation source is 100 mm. Ignition is induced with a spark, which is widely used in present experiments.</p>

<p>Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is used as the specimen because of its homogeneous composition. All specimens are 16 mm thick and are cut to 50 × 50 mm surface size. In order to ensure insulation conditions on the sides, except the upper surface that is exposed to radiation, the other sides of the specimens are wrapped in asbestos, with an aluminium foil outermost layer.</p>
<p>A number of PMMA are subjected to a range of radiant heat fluxes between 17.4 and 25.2 kW/m<sup>2</sup> at the surface of specimen. Three series of experiments are carried out and the effects of the positions of the pilot are examined carefully and comprehensively. In series 1, the specimen is horizontally oriented and the pilot spark is placed in eight different positions 6, 13, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 mm above the centre of the specimen as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112447598">Figure 2(a)</xref>. In series 2, which can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112447598">Figure 2(b)</xref>, the specimen is vertical, and the pilot spark is located 6 mm from the front of specimen face and at positions that are 0, 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, 52, 69 and 103 mm above the centre of the specimen. Finally, in series 3, the specimen is vertical as in series 2; however, the position of the pilot varies along horizontal direction, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112447598">Figure 2(c)</xref>. The pilot spark is set 35 mm above the centre of the specimen and at positions that are 6, 13, 20, 27 and 34 mm separately away from the specimen exposure surface.</p>

<title>Results and discussions</title>
<p>From an experimental point of view, this article mainly focuses on the variation of ignition characteristics as a consequence of changing the pilot spark location. This relation does have importance for obtaining ignition time and mass flux at ignition. The ignition time here is defined as the duration time from when the sample is first exposed to the incident radiation heat flux to the time when a visible flame is observed.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112447598">Figure 3</xref> shows the relationship between ignition time and height of spark above the centre of the specimen exposed to heat fluxes of 17.8, 21.5 and 25.2 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. Each point of ignition time is the mean number of six observations. Ignition is fastest at a height as low as 6 mm. It could be found that ignition time increases with the increase in height under the three heat fluxes, and the trend can be fitted into a straight line. The variation in ignition time with position of pilot spark shows that the concentration of pyrolysis gas in the air is not constant, which implies that the raising process of pyrolysis gas and process of air entrainment cause concentration gradient throughout the plume height.</p>
<p>The mass flux at ignition has been employed as an ignition critical condition by many researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734904112447598">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112447598"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112447598">14</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112447598">Figure 4</xref> gives the mass flux at ignition as a function of the spark height. The mass flux at ignition reduces obviously, when the spark is moved towards the specimen surface from the height of 70 mm, which is the 70% of the total distance from the specimen surface to the heat resource. Interestingly, when the spark approaches further, below 13 mm in the experiments, a slight increase of the mass flux at ignition can be observed. The reason explaining this needs to be explored further. It indicates there is an optimal location for pilot where the mass flux at ignition is at a minimum. The experimental results show that the minimum of mass flux at ignition is approximately 2.4 g/m<sup>2</sup> s, and the mass fluxes measured at the height of 70 mm are nearly doubled to 4.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> s with a heat flux of 25.2 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, 4.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> s with a heat flux of 21.5 kW/m<sup>2</sup> and 3.7 g/m<sup>2</sup> s with a heat flux of 17.4 kW/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>In order to know how the position of pilot spark affects the ignition characteristics for vertically oriented specimen, experiments that are described above as series 2 and series 3 were performed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112447598">Figure 5</xref> displays the ignition time in series 2 condition. It can be seen from this figure that all the shortest ignition times with the three given heat fluxes appear at the position near 26 mm above the centre of the specimen, which is the upper edge of the PMMA. The concentration of pyrolysis gas is determined by the progress of gathering and diffusion. It indicates that the top edge of the specimen is the position of peak concentration, and hence the best location of pilot spark for curtailing ignition time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112447598">Figure 5</xref>, the ignition time reduces with increase in spark height until the height reaches 26 mm, after which it reverses. This trend is presented more dramatically when the heat flux is 17.8 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. It means that the influence taken by the height of pilot spark is more noticeable when the heat flux is lower. This is because it is much faster for a higher heat flux to generate enough pyrolysis gas to reach the low flammability limit. The height of the pilot spark does not bring much difference with the heat flux of 21.5 and 25.8 kW/m<sup>2</sup> until it reaches 69 mm, which is just the top edge of the holder. By affecting the progress of gathering and diffusing of the pyrolysis gas, the solid boundary contributes to the influence of the pilot spark. This means that the position the pilot spark together with heat flux and solid boundary influence the ignition time. When we come to mass flux at ignition, which can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734904112447598">Figure 6</xref>, a similar trend is observed. It is noteworthy that the minimum of mass flux at ignition is nearly 4.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> s, which is almost bigger than the maximum mass flux at ignition in the horizontally oriented specimen.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734904112447598">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734904112447598">8</xref> give the results of series 3, which aim to explore the effects of distance between the specimen and the spark on the ignition time and mass flux at ignition. The pilot spark is located at the height of 35 mm above the centre of specimen. According to the results of series 2, this position is easy for ignition and experimental operation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734904112447598">Figure 7</xref> reveals that with increase in distance, ignition time has an ascending trend, which can be fitted into a quadratic curve. This is caused by the concentration gradient of pyrolysis gas in the air stream. If 900 s is used as the criterion for nonignition, it cannot be ignited by pilot spark when the distance between the specimen and the spark is over 32 mm with the heat flux of 17.4 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, 35 mm with the heat flux of 21.5 kW/m<sup>2</sup> or 38 mm with the heat flux of 25.2 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. It shows that the distance of nonignition increases with increase in heat flux. These data can offer some significant reference for calculating the boundary layer and the concentration of pyrolysis gas with the vertically oriented specimen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734904112447598">Figure 8</xref> gives the data of mass flux of ignition.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Clearly, the pilot is important in determining when sustained piloted ignition will occur, which has been observed experimentally in this article. Ignition time and mass flux at ignition as a function of igniter location have been measured and analysed for PMMA through experiments with horizontally oriented and vertically oriented specimens.</p>
<p>The main conclusions are as below:</p>
<list id="list1-0734904112447598" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Ignition time of horizontally oriented PMMA is positively linear with the height of the pilot spark. The minimum mass flux at ignition is observed to be 2.4 g/m<sup>2</sup> s, and with increase in height, the mass flux at ignition has a slight reduction and then it goes up markedly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In order to test how the position of the pilot spark affects the ignition characteristics of the vertically oriented specimen, the position of the pilot spark was varied both vertically and horizontally. When the position of pilot spark varies in the vertical direction, the shortest ignition time appears at the upper edge of the PMMA. The position of pilot spark, coupled with heat flux and solid boundary, influence ignition time. It is notable that the minimum of mass flux at ignition with the vertically oriented specimen is nearly 4.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> s, which is almost bigger than the maximum for the horizontally oriented specimen. This means that the value of mass flux at ignition practically measured in experiments for vertically oriented specimens is larger than that for the horizontally oriented condition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Due to the concentration gradient of pyrolysis gas in the air stream, ignition time shows an upward trend, which can be fitted to a quadratic curve with an increase in the distance when the position of pilot spark varies along the horizontal direction. The distance for nonignition also increases with increasing heat flux.</p></list-item>
