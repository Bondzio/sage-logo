<abstract>
<p>Extended shelf life milk is a relatively new kind of fluid milk, generally manufactured by high-temperature treatment and/or micro-filtration. Being advertised as ‘pasteurized milk with an extended shelf life’, its flavour, compositional quality and labelling was questioned. Extended shelf life (high-temperature treatment), pasteurized (‘traditionally produced’) and ultrahigh-temperature milk were, therefore, compared at the beginning and end of shelf life. In triangle tests, panellists distinguished clearly between all products. High-temperature treatment milk’s flavour was closer to ultrahigh-temperature and traditionally produced milk in the beginning and at the end of shelf life, respectively. Physicochemically and bacteriologically, all three types could be distinguished. Since ‘extended shelf life’ comprises many process varieties (each affecting flavour differently), consumer information and appropriate package labelling beyond ‘long-lasting’ is necessary, e.g. by mentioning the heat treatment applied.</p>

<p>Treating foodstuffs thermally is an established method to reduce the counts of both pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, but usually at the cost of changing the composition and flavour. Different temperature/time profiles usually affect these two parameters individually.</p>
<p>European dairies have established many different heat treatments (i.e. temperature/time profiles) according to regulation [EC] 853/2004) for fluid milk types so far, being pasteurization and ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) processing the most frequent ones. Approximately 50 years ago, extended shelf life (ESL) technology was developed, but only recently introduced on an industrial basis. Unlike pasteurization and UHT procedures, ESL techniques lack an official definition. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212442200">Rysstad and Kolstad (2006)</xref>, ESL products can be defined as ‘…products that have been treated in a manner to reduce the microbial count beyond normal pasteurization, packaged under extreme hygienic conditions, and which have a defined prolonged shelf life under refrigerated conditions’, highlighting that bacteria reduction via ESL is achieved only by combining a given temperature/time profile (eventually accompanied by a filtration step) with hygienic packaging.</p>
<p>Since the same conditions may be achieved by different temperature/time-profiles, ‘ESL’ is an umbrella term for many different types of milk which also vary with regard to composition and flavour.</p>
<p>At present, two major ESL milk types prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442200">Gallmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442200">Kaufmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212442200">Rysstad and Kolstad, 2006</xref>):
<list id="list1-1082013212442200" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>purely high-temperature-treated (HTT) ESL milk which is subjected to 120–127 °C for 1–4 s (or 135 °C for 0.5 s) by applying direct heat as steam either via injection or infusion (falling stream heater) or indirect heat (plates), e.g. at 125 °C for 2 s.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>filtrated ESL milk in which the separated cream is also treated with high temperature while the skim milk becomes filtrated (micro-filtration or deep bed filtration) and afterwards pasteurized.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Labelling of ESL milk is not standardized and terms such as ‘fresh’, ‘maximum fresh’, ‘fresh for a longer period’ or ‘long-lasting’ are used in German ESL products. These could be interpreted as misleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212442200">Kaufmann et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442200">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Data on differences and similarities between ESL and other types of milk are contradictory, as in the case of the vitamin content. Some studies deal with microbiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442200">Gallmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212442200">Rysstad and Kolstad, 2006</xref>); physicochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212442200">Cano Ruiz and Richter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442200">Gallmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212442200">Hoffmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442200">Kaufmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212442200">Vázquez-Landaverde et al., 2006</xref>) and sensory characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442200">Kaufmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442200">Rademacher and Hülsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212442200">Santos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212442200">Van Aardt et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, traditionally produced (TP), ESL and UHT milk from one single manufacturer were directly compared at the beginning and end of the corresponding shelf lives, using a series of bacteriological, physicochemical and sensory analyses to evaluate the quality of fluid milk products.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1082013212442200" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<p>Commercially produced fluid milk products (TP, ESL, UHT) presented in packages of 1 L were purchased on the day of production from a German dairy that trades all three types regularly. The production process of the different milk types was as follows.</p>
<p>Pasteurized milk (TP) was treated with short-time pasteurization for 15–30 s at 72–7 °C. ESL milk has underwent high pasteurization at 125–127 °C at 2–4 s (HTT type). UHT milk was processed by treatment with temperatures up to 143 °C for a few seconds and cooling immediately afterwards to 4–5 °C. Storage times for TP, ESL and UHT milk products were 5–7 days, 12–40 days and 3–6 months, respectively.</p>
<p>Storage was at 4 °C (TP, ESL) and ambient temperature (UHT). Analysis started the day after purchase. Milk samples were evaluated using sensory, chemical, cytological and microbiological methods.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1082013212442200"><title>Study design</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212442200">Figure 1</xref> details the study design. Sampling was done at the beginning (i.e. the day after manufacture) and end (i.e. the last day) of shelf life. As the products’ shelf lives lasted differently, a complementary set of TP and ESL of the same dairy factory had to be purchased. Their shelf lives ended at the same time as the shelf life of the UHT samples’. Sensory analysis was performed: (a) at the beginning of the trial with all initial milk products and (b) the end of the trial using the initial UHT and complementary ESL and TP milk. Microbiological and chemical analyses were solely performed with the initial milk samples.

<sec id="sec4-1082013212442200"><title>Sensory analysis</title>
<p>For this investigation, the triangle test as established in the international standard EN ISO 4120:2007 was chosen. This test provides results that are rated unbiased (unlike affective tests) and statistically more reliable in comparison to other sensory tests. Based on a forced choice principle, this test focuses on detecting the one sample out of three which tastes differently. Therefore, ‘quality’ was not assessed in these trials.</p>
<p>The panel consisted of volunteering employees of the authors’ institution and students of veterinary medicine (male and female) alike. Age ranged between about 20 and 50 years, and panellists claimed to have little or no experience in performing sensory trials with fluid milk. Following appendix A of ISO 4120, <italic>n</italic> = 30 panellists were admitted for each trial. No panellist was eliminated from the trial. After the test, each panellist was offered a reward (sweets). While samples were prepared in a kitchen facility, tests were carried out in an adjacent laboratory equipped specifically for sensory analysis (i.e. five cabins and neutral furniture) in the late morning. Milk packages were permitted to acquire ambient temperature and samples of 100 mL each were poured into white disposable vending cups (0.2 L). Each vending cup was marked with a three-digit code.</p>
<p>In the cabins, each participant was offered the same combination of three samples (i.e. TP/ESL, TP/UHT and UHT/ESL, in a fixed order of presentation) along with the scorecard (in paper) as indicated by ISO 4120, a pen, a written instruction, white bread (for toasting) and mineral water. Each panellist was briefly instructed and left alone to perform the test on his own. Samples were swallowed and bread and/or water consumed between samples. Once the panellist completed one cycle of sampling and filled out the scorecard, he was forwarded the next tray with samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013212442200"><title>Physicochemical and microbiological variables</title>
<p>Milk samples were tested for a series of non-sensory parameters. Whenever possible, official methods were used, i.e. EN ISO standards, the methods defined by §64 of the German ‘Code for Foods, Commodities and Feeds’ (total bacterial count (TBC), somatic cell count, <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and density). They were applied for titratable acidity (Soxhlet–Henkel (SH) value), although the method predescribed in §64 was modified insofar as the test (SH method) was made with 25 mL (rather than 100 mL) of sample, and results were multiplied by 4. Protein, fat and lactose contents as well as freezing point were evaluated using infrared spectroscopy. Dry matter and dry matter free of fat were calculated according to ISO methods 4833 (EN/ISO), 13366-1 and 21528-2, respectively. Heat treatment was determined using enzyme reactions in commercial kits, i.e. alkaline phosphatase (Lactognost Heyl®) and peroxidase (Traventol®). Finally, calcium content was measured via complexometry.</p>
<p>Microbiological analysis along with additional quality parameters and calcium determination were done at the authors’ institute, while fat, protein, freezing point and lactose were measured at an official dairy herd improvement laboratory (Milchwirtschaftlicher Kontrollverband Mittelweser, Rehburg-Loccum, Lower Saxony, Germany).</p>
<p>For every milk type, <italic>n</italic> = 5 packages were sampled. From each package, two samples were drawn for microbiological and chemical analyses; in the case of pH, each sample was measured twice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013212442200"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Sensory evaluation was analysed according to the tables presented in appendix A of ISO 4120 and expressed in percentage of correct answers and the level of significance (<italic>α</italic>).</p>
<p>The other variables were analysed for normal distribution and eventually transformed into common logarithms. Influences by the factors ‘time’ and ‘milk type’ were calculated by bifactorial analyses of variance. Standard statistical description comprised means (×), i.e. <italic>x</italic><sub>a</sub>, SD and sample size (<italic>n</italic>). The level of significance was set to <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. As analyses at the onset and the end of shelf life were made with different packages, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1082013212442200"><title>Triangle test</title>
<p>Two triangle tests were conducted: one at the beginning and the other at the end of the shelf life of the UHT milk. Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212442200">Table 1</xref>. At the beginning of shelf life, panellists distinguished clearly between the different milk types. The difference between TP and ESL was detected most frequently, while less than two-third of panellists could differentiate ESL from UHT milk.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>At the end of shelf life, however, differences between TP and ESL faded and only a third of the panellists could distinguish between the two milk types.</p>
<p>Flavour and flavour changes in processed milk are the result of a complex interaction of the milk components among themselves and with their environment. Heat treatment and storage time induced changes include caramelization and hydroxymethylfurfural production in lactose, Maillard reaction and ‘cooking flavour’ in proteins as well as liberation of free fatty acids, lipolysis and rancid flavours in milk fat. Some off-flavours occur intrinsically, others are mediated by the presence of light and/or oxygen. Besides that, other process steps (e.g. pressure application) may also change the sensory experience by promoting the formation of volatile components such as hydrogen sulphide or aldehydes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212442200">Santos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212442200">Van Aardt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212442200">Vázquez-Landaverde et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of these changes occur during heat treatment (i.e. they are present from the beginning of shelf life) and some develop with progressing deterioration. The longer extended a shelf life is, the more pronounced these changes may become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212442200">Van Aardt et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier studies revealed no or little differences in taste between TP and ESL milk products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212442200">Kaufmann et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442200">2010</xref>). Results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212442200">Table 1</xref>, however, showed that panellists were capable of differentiating between TP, ESL and UHT milk. However, at the beginning of shelf life, ESL milk resembled UHT milk rather than TP milk. At the end of shelf life, ESL was more similar in taste to TP milk.</p>
<p>These differences to earlier studies may be explained by the fact that ESL milk can be manufactured in different ways, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442200">Rademacher and Hülsen (2005)</xref> found that sensory results varied with the kind of ESL process. Regarding taste and flavour, ESL milk products are grouped into filtration/pasteurization-type milk products and HTT-type milk products; they can be differentiated by the peroxidase test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442200">Gallmann et al., 2001</xref>) which in our trial resulted negative, confirming that the ESL milk used for this trial was from the HTT type. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442200">Gallmann et al. (2001)</xref> showed that consumers can hardly differentiate TP from ESL milk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442200">Rademacher and Hülsen (2005)</xref> found that the taste of HTT milk was closer to that of UHT than it was to that of TP milk. This corresponds to the lower number of panellists that correctly differentiated ESL from UHT milk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212442200">Table 1</xref>). Micro-filtrated ESL milk products are reported to taste similar to TP milk, although in some process varieties, this milk tends to absorb a papery taste from the package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442200">Rademacher and Hülsen, 2005</xref>). The authors, however, used a different sensory test (a modified version of IDF standard 99C:1997), served the milk at approximately 15 °C and omitted TP and UHT milk at the end of shelf life. ESL milk types were tested in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442200">Rademacher and Hülsen (2005)</xref> at the beginning and within the final half of shelf life. Therefore, data are not comparable to the present survey. Still, they found that the occurrence of the cooking taste varied with the ESL technique and was sometimes more prominent at the beginning, sometimes more frequent at the middle of shelf life, since ESL milk at the end of its shelf life was closer in taste to TP milk.</p>

<p>No sample contained <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. TBC was the primary factor affected by milk type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212442200">Table 2</xref>), as TBC in TP milk ranged between 170 and 32,000 cfu/mL, while counts of 1 or 2 cfu/mL were found in two ESL milk packages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212442200">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212442200">Mayr et al. (2004)</xref> found Gram-positive non-spore forming recontaminants in HTT ESL milk products that grew slowly at low temperatures, stressing the need of maximum hygiene at milk processing. The different ESL process techniques yield specific rates of microbial inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442200">Gallmann et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013212442200"><title>Chemical composition and freezing point</title>
<p>Lactose content and acidity (pH and SH) are the variables affected most strongly by milk type and/or storage, and while all other variables were affected by at least one factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212442200">Table 2</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> content remained generally constant (0.12–0.14%; Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212442200">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212442200">4</xref>). In fact, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to be a very stable milk ingredient in fluid milk once it has been heated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212442200">El-Deeb, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>All products started with the same density and SH values, while calcium and pH were similar in pasteurized and ESL milk. For the other parameters, significant differences occurred (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212442200">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Protein and density remained unchanged during the entire shelf life in all milk types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212442200">Table 4</xref>). In the other cases, parameters tended to maintain initial levels in at least one milk type, but changed in the other ones towards the end of shelf life. Fat, freezing point, dry matter and lactose values decreased, while dry matter free of fat, pH and SH levels either decreased or increased in relation to the milk type.</p>
<p>The acidity parameters (pH and SH) usually react complementarily; based on low initial TBC, bacteria usually acidify the milk during storage leading to a decreased pH and increased SH values. This is seen markedly in the UHT milk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212442200">Table 4</xref>). However, changes in SH were much stronger than those in pH. In the case of TP, shelf life was too short to affect SH values significantly.</p>
<p>Many ESL milk products are produced via infusion with culinary steam, a procedure to eliminate more gas from the milk. This method is a direct heating procedure rather than an indirect one (e.g. by a plate heater), and if the latter is the case, SH values resemble those of UHT milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212442200">Sepúlveda et al., 2005</xref>). ESL acidity data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212442200">Table 4</xref> did not resemble those for UHT, which most probably was due to technological reasons.</p>
<p>In general, all variables did not show any major deviations from quality parameters.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1082013212442200" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Nowadays, criteria of quality for the consumer include sensory properties, practical value (shelf life and manageability), composition and nutritional value, food safety, ecological impact, freshness (e.g. condition at the moment of purchase) and other variables, e.g. origin and price of the food. This study showed that although composition and microbiology of TP, ESL (HTT) and UHT milk met all standards, ESL milk was considered a product which was ‘different’ from the other milk types, especially from the TP. Since the flavours of ESL milk vary with the processing technique, the introduction of a flavour-based declaration on the packages would improve clarity for the consumers.</p>
