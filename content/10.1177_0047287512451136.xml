<abstract>
<p>In the United States, an objective of coastal states is providing sufficient access to coastal resources. To better utilize public resources for such projects, decision makers would benefit from possessing reliable estimates of economic values coastal residents and tourists place on public beach access. This study’s purpose is to estimate the economic values coastal residents and tourists assign to public beach access, and provide options for financing such projects. Estimates of these values were calculated using the doubled-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation technique. Results indicated that coastal residents were willing to pay $2.46 for additional public beach access, while coastal tourists’ mean willingness to pay was $6.33. Findings suggest additional public beach access locations are desirable to both coastal residents and tourists. Supplying coastal resource managers with these values can assist in justifying the use of public resources on beach access projects, as well as in the development of long-term policies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coastal destinations are experiencing increases in population and tourism demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512451136">Granek et al. 2005</xref>). Many constituents in these areas recognize the economic importance of coastal resources to local economies through activities related to tourism and outdoor recreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512451136">Kriesel, Landry, and Keeler 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451136">Pogue and Lee 1999</xref>). However, as the population in coastal communities continues to increase, coupled with development associated with tourism and recreation, the availability of land used for public access to coastal resources becomes scarcer. The potential consequence of this anticipated growth of coastal communities is development that either intentionally or unintentionally inhibits public access to coastal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451136">Pogue and Lee 1999</xref>). As a result, the quality of the coastal experience of residents and tourists will diminish unless adequate access to coastal resources are provided and maintained.</p>
<p>The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 indicates it is the government’s responsibility to provide “public access to the coasts for recreation purposes” (p. 4). The CZMA is a United States federal policy, but individual coastal states are responsible for providing and maintaining access to the coast. Similarly, one of the goals of coastal states is providing and improving public access to coastal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451136">Pogue and Lee 1999</xref>). However, local management agencies responsible for implementing this task recognize the difficulty due to increased development and reduced funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512451136">Mongeau 2001</xref>). As the scarcity of land increases, the expenditures related to acquiring and developing land for public beach access becomes more expensive. Therefore, justifying public expenditures on land for beach access requires decision makers to possess reliable estimates of the economic value coastal residents and tourists place on public beach access and related amenities.</p>
<p>Estimating the economic values coastal residents and tourists place on public beach access is essential for decision makers when comparing the costs and benefits of various projects in the policy evaluation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512451136">Freeman 2003</xref>). Using a cost–benefit analysis is important to aid decision makers in identifying effective methods of purchasing and/or maintaining land and property used to provide public beach access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512451136">Oh et al. 2008</xref>). However, a major obstacle confronting public agencies assigned to provide and maintain beach access is acquiring reliable estimates of the economic value coastal residents and tourists place on public beach access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512451136">Bin et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512451136">Freeman 1995</xref>). Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the economic values coastal residents and tourists assign to public beach access.</p>
<p>A study commissioned by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512451136">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2006)</xref> indicates the ability of management agencies to provide and maintain public beach access is a difficult task. First, the increase in development and population growth of coastal areas has decreased the availability of land, resulting in higher land values. Second, most public agencies have seen a reduction in funding, making the acquisition of land for beach access less feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512451136">Mongeau 2001</xref>). An additional issue complicating the matter is the divergent demands for public beach access and related amenities from both coastal residents’ and tourists’ use of coastal resources for recreational purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512451136">Brower and Dreyfoos 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Many individuals reside in coastal areas for the increased opportunity to utilize local beaches, while these same regions rely on coastal resources to attract large numbers of tourists that stimulate local economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451136">Pogue and Lee 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512451136">Kriesel, Landry, and Keeler 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512451136">Lindberg and Johnson (1997)</xref> suggest coastal residents’ perceptions of tourism are likely to diverge considerably, especially among residents not directly benefiting from the local tourism industry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512451136">McCool and Martin (1994)</xref> indicate that the tourism industry can alter the local community by disrupting “residents’ lives due to increased population during the tourist season, increases in crime, displacement of residents by new developments, conflict in values, and impacts on the local culture” (p. 29). Considering public services, such as public beach access, perceived competition between coastal residents and tourists for coastal resources typically diminishes coastal residents’ support for tourism development because of concerns related to crowding, congestion, and environmental impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512451136">Ellis and Vogelsong 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512451136">McCool and Martin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512451136">Lankford and Howard 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of public beach access is not only limited to the challenge of providing and maintaining this access but also to balancing the needs of both coastal residents and tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451136">Pogue and Lee 1999</xref>). Developing more public beach access sites (and related facilities and services) for the purpose of tourism development may conflict with residents’ interests while simultaneously improving tourists’ coastal experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512451136">Harrill (2004)</xref> indicates that management agencies responsible for planning tourism development projects need to acquire input from both residents and tourists. Regarding public beach access, including residents in the planning process provides an avenue for the expression of values placed on coastal resources, in addition to articulating concern for “protecting the locality’s quality of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512451136">Harrill 2004</xref>, p. 264). Incorporating tourists’ opinions and preferences in the planning process supplies decision makers with knowledge related to infrastructure and access demands of these individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512451136">Lindberg and Johnson 1997</xref>). In addition, integrating information from tourists in the planning process is essential because of the contribution that tourism provides local economies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512451136">Brower and Dreyfoos (1979)</xref> suggest that the coastal zone management program for each coastal state should include a comprehensive plan for public access to beaches. During the planning process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512451136">Loomis and Walsh (1997)</xref> indicate that cost–benefit analysis is a valuable tool that assists in making better decisions regarding optimal program size, as well as identifying the most beneficial of available alternatives. Considering both coastal residents and tourists use public beach access to reach coastal resources for recreational opportunities, an estimate of the economic values both place on this type of access seems a necessary component of an area’s comprehensive coastal management plan.</p>
<p>Supplying decision makers with an economic value of beach access for coastal residents and tourists allows more realistic comparisons between policies and management options during the evaluation process. Techniques employing non-market valuation models are useful for estimating market-equivalent values for goods and services like public beach access (and related facilities and services) not customarily traded in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512451136">Loomis and Walsh 1997</xref>). Such valuations provide vital information to agencies responsible for implementing long-term policy and planning decisions regarding public beach access.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Approaches employed to estimate values of nonmarket goods include the travel cost method (TCM) and contingent valuation method (CVM). TCM is a revealed preference technique that uses actual trip expenditures to derive a demand curve for estimating benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512451136">Fix and Loomis 1998</xref>). A criticism of the TCM is its inability to measure the total value of a recreational opportunity or resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512451136">Parsons 2003</xref>). The total value of a recreational opportunity or resources is composed of its use and nonuse value. TCM is only applicable to estimating a portion of the on-site use value of a recreational opportunity or resource. CVM is referred to as a stated preference technique due to the utilization of hypothetical situations to obtain an individual’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512451136">Freeman 2003</xref>). Utilizing CVM to measure an individual’s WTP allows researchers to estimate use and nonuse values of recreational opportunities or resources. When modifying the provision of a recreational resource, such as public beach access, CVM is an appropriate method to estimate the value of benefits for current and future users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512451136">Loomis and Walsh 1997</xref>). Although CVM has been criticized for its hypothetical nature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512451136">Mitchell and Carson (1989)</xref> indicate WTP estimates of well-designed CVM studies are regarded as reliable for policy evaluation.</p>
<p>Several authors have acknowledged a deficiency in the number of studies estimating the value of public beach access (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512451136">Bin et al. 2005</xref>; Kline and Swallow 1986). The majority of previous research on coastal regions has concentrated on the valuation of coastal tourism and recreation, while the specific valuation of beach access has been neglected (Kline and Swallow 1986). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512451136">Bin et al. (2005)</xref> measured the consumer surplus of day trippers and overnight tourists to North Carolina beaches. The authors reported the net benefits of a beach day for day trippers was between $11 and $80 compared to net benefits between $11 and $41 for overnight tourists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512451136">Bell (1986)</xref> indicated that Florida coastal residents were willing to pay between $1.41 and $1.71 per beach day for the privilege to use local beaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512451136">Bell and Leeworthy (1990)</xref> showed that coastal tourists traveling more than 1,000 miles were willing to pay $34 for a beach day in Florida. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512451136">Lew and Larson (2005)</xref> conducted a study estimating the economic value of a beach day for San Diego County residents. Findings from the study revealed that San Diego County residents valued a beach day at $28.27. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512451136">Blakemore and Williams (2008)</xref> calculated the economic value British tourists derived from beach experiences at a prime tourist location in Turkey, using revealed and stated preference techniques. The revealed and stated preference models yielded similar estimates of £1.11 and £0.90 per adult per visit, respectively. These authors used a per-visit user fee because most of the tourists reported not renting cars during their vacation.</p>
<p>The limited number of studies valuing public beach access has estimated this value in conjunction with other beach attributes or access to the coastal destination. For instance, Kline and Swallow (1986) reported that tourists to Gooseberry Island, Massachusetts, were willing to pay $3.06 on weekdays and $4.18 on weekends to use the public coastal access causeway. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512451136">Whitehead et al. (2006)</xref> estimated the value of public beach access and beach width of southeastern North Carolina beaches, suggesting tourists were willing to pay $25 per trip for improved access. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512451136">Landry and Liu (2009)</xref> analyzed data on recreation demand for 17 beaches in southeastern North Carolina. One purpose of their study was to determine how hypothetical improvements in parking/access points and beach width would affect coastal tourists’ future beach visitation. Data were collected from North Carolina counties within 120 miles of the study area. The authors indicated that the economic welfare derived from improved access was $1,275 per year with an average of 17 trips per year.</p>
<p>Management agencies responsible for providing and maintaining public access to the coast for tourism and recreation purposes require the values coastal residents and tourists place on public beach access. These values are essential for decision makers in the policy-formulation process to justify the utilization of public resources on such access. For this reason, the objective of this study is to estimate the economic values coastal residents and tourists assign to public beach access. More specifically, the purpose is to determine coastal residents’ and tourists’ willingness to pay for additional public beach access and related facilities, and provide recommendations for financing options of such projects. The study also segments residents and tourists each into two groups to compare the four resulting groups’ willingness-to-pay for beach access. The resident groups include a group residing close to the beach, namely, coastal residents and those residing adjacent to the coastal counties, inland residents. Tourists were grouped into day trippers and overnight tourists. The purpose of further segmenting residents and tourists is that each group potentially has different needs when visiting beach destinations, possibly resulting in varying willingness to pay.</p>
<p>The distinguishing difference between this study and previous research is the focus on estimating and comparing the economic values that coastal residents and tourists place on additional public beach access. Previous research has assessed the economic values of tourists and residents independently, but to the authors’ knowledge no study has compared the values of these segments at the same destinations. In addition, this study attempts to address the concerns of several researchers regarding the inadequate amount of research providing estimates of the value of access to coastal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512451136">Bin et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512451136">Freeman 1995</xref>; Kline and Swallow 1986).</p>

<title>Sampling Frames and Data Collection</title>
<p>Two phases of data collection were conducted to complete this study to represent both tourists and residents who visit beaches in South Carolina. First, in the spring and early summer of 2006 tourists were intercepted at three beach destinations (i.e., Beaufort, Charleston, and Horry County) in South Carolina. Each beach was visited multiple times and visitors on the beach were asked if they resided in the respective county. If they were residents of the county, they were not included in the tourist portion of the study. Beach visitors not living in the respective county were informed of the study and asked to provide a name and address for a follow-up self-administered mail survey. A total of 925 names and addresses were collected from tourists intercepted on the beaches.</p>
<p>Second, a stratified random sample of residents of the same three coastal counties was purchased to survey coastal residents in the fall of 2007. The total number of residents or households purchased was 3,000. The stratified random sample strategy was designed to oversample counties with more residents and zip codes in each county that are closer to the beach. The purpose of this strategy was that residents living closer to the beach were more likely to use the beach. Of the 3,000 resident listings purchased, 50% were from Charleston, 30% Horry, and 20% Beaufort County. Within each county, 65% of the list was from zip codes in proximity to the beach and the remaining 35% from each county’s remaining zip codes.</p>
<p>A modified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512451136">Dillman (2007)</xref> mail survey technique was used to send questionnaires to the respective groups, tourists and residents, included in the study. Each group initially received a cover letter, questionnaire, and business reply envelope to return the completed questionnaire. The second mailing consisted of a reminder/thank-you postcard. The third and final contact was sent to those who had not responded and the mailing included a cover letter, replacement questionnaire, and business reply envelope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047287512451136">
<title>Double-Bounded Dichotomous Choice Contingent Valuation Method</title>
<p>The questionnaire included a contingent valuation method (CVM) section to assess residents’ and tourists’ net willingness-to-pay (hereafter WTP) for additional beach access points. A dichotomous choice format that requires respondents to provide a <italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic> answer was used. The key advantage is that respondents’ choice of “take it or leave it” is similar to the price taking behavior that individuals frequently face in market transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512451136">Boyle 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, this format has also been criticized in that researchers can have limited information of whether the WTP is above the proposed bid amount threshold when a respondent answers yes or the WTP is below the proposed bid amount threshold when a respondent answers no. As a result, WTP estimates can be inefficient and the dichotomous choice CVM requires a large sample to increase the precision of the WTP estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512451136">Cameron and Huppert 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512451136">Hanemann, Loomis, and Kanninen 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The double-bounded dichotomous choice (DB) CVM was proposed as an effective alternative to improve statistical efficiency with a follow-up dichotomous choice question for a second answer to obtain more information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512451136">Hanemann, Loomis, and Kanninen 1991</xref>). If a respondent’s answer is yes to the first dichotomous choice question for a price of $X, the respondent is asked if they are willing to pay a price of $X + $Y in the follow-up question. If a respondent answers no, the follow-up question is provided to determine whether they are willing to pay a price of $X – $Y. The sequence of questions may increase the complexity of the model because the second question depends on the first question. However, the insertion of an additional question helps to produce more precise WTP estimates by obtaining more information from each respondent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512451136">Cameron and Huppert 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512451136">Haab and McConnell 2002</xref>). To estimate residents’ and tourists’ WTP for increased utility as a result of additional beach access points and related facilities, the DB-CVM questions were used in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0047287512451136">
<title>Contingent Valuation Survey Design</title>
<p>The DB-CVM questions were carefully developed in collaboration with staff of the state coastal management agency. To ensure the DB-CVM questions were clear, several revisions were made as a result of pretests with beach tourists. To better simulate the price taking behavior of respondents, parking fees were selected as a payment vehicle because they have been popularly adopted in many beach area parking lots. The exact wording of the first DB-CVM question was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>South Carolina state and local management programs are considering improving the current access situations by adding additional beach access points. The current plan is directed towards less developed destinations. Development and maintenance of additional beach access points with parking spaces and other preferred facilities requires funds. If the number of public beach access points increased from one central location with inadequate parking to two locations with sufficient parking in less developed destinations, would you be willing to pay $ _______ more in addition to your typical parking fees per day for the additional beach access point and parking?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Then, the second question was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>If the number of public beach access points increased from one central location with inadequate parking to two locations with sufficient parking in less developed destinations, would you be willing to pay $ _______ more in addition to your typical parking fees per day for the additional beach access point and parking?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since parking fees were posed to solicit the willingness to pay for additional beach access and related amenities, it is important to provide the current access situation. Access to public beaches in South Carolina is free. In other words, residents and tourists who use the beach do not pay a user or entrance fee. However, those who drive typically have to pay for parking at metered spots. For example, in Myrtle Beach, users who pay for parking typically pay $0.25 for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>For the first DB-CVM question, 10 different fee prices ranging from $1 to $40 were chosen after adjustments based on pretests of the questionnaire. If a respondent answered no to the first question, a lower price was presented. The lower prices ranged from $0.5 to $26. Likewise, if the answer to the first one was yes, a higher follow-up price ranging from $2 to $65 was presented. To minimize concerns about strategic behavior on the second question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512451136">Haab and McConnell 2002</xref>), it was deliberately designed with multiple fee amounts. For example, a respondent was presented a $7 fee in the first CVM question and asked whether they were willing to pay this fee. If he or she answered yes to the first question, a second CVM question was presented to the respondent with a higher bid between $11 and $22. However, if the respondent answered no to the first CVM question, the second CVM question presented the respondent with a lower bid between $2 and $6. Finally, respondents who answered no to both DB-CVM questions were asked a question to examine protest behavior (i.e., placing zero value on the proposed plan, cannot afford higher trip costs, the government should pay without increasing fees, not thinking the plan would work, and others).</p>

<p>The equation above indicates the utility associated with the change in the state of nature and paying the price amount is greater than the utility associated with the status quo given no change in income. However, because the random component is unobservable to the researchers, only WTP probability statements about yes or no can possibly be accomplished.</p>
<p>As a result of the DB-CVM question format, each respondent is requested to answer two dichotomous choice questions, yielding four possible response sets based on the two sequential prices, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> : (1) both answers are yes (yes–yes; YY); (2) both answers are no (no–no; NN); (3) no is followed by yes (no–yes; NY); and yes is followed by no (yes–no; YN). The general form of the DB-CVM can be formulated as follows:</p>

<p>To interpret these outcomes, consider a response sequence of yes–no. The WTP is greater than the initial bid, <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> , as indicated by the yes response, but less than the follow-up bid, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, as indicated by the no response. As another response sequence of no–no, the respondent’s WTP is less than the smallest price amount, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>. The other two outcomes have similar interpretations. In summary, the second DB-CVM question allows researchers to identify an upper and a lower bound of the WTP for the yes–no and no–yes responses and to sharpen an upper and a lower bound for the yes–yes and no–no responses, respectively.</p>
<p>Because the error component in the WTP function is unobservable, only probability statements about the WTP can be made. Let WTP<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> denote the WTP for respondent <italic>j</italic> and price <italic>i</italic>. The likelihood function of the four possible sets is as follows:</p>

In the bivariate probit models, the following explanatory variables were included: proposed bid amount (BID), gender (GENDER), level of education (EDU), age (AGE) and importance of the value for the parking fee (VPARK).

<p>The effect of each explanatory variable on the probability of accepting a proposed fee is hypothesized and represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512451136">Table 1</xref>. According to economic theory, the higher the price, the less likely an individual is to purchase a service provided with all other factors remaining the same (i.e., ceteris paribus). Thus, the higher the price amount, the less likely an individual takes a beach trip, resulting in a negative coefficient sign. An individual’s socioeconomic characteristics also have an impact on WTP as additional determinants. Typically, an older individual with more education is willing to pay higher parking fees; positive coefficients are expected. Likewise, individuals who place more importance on the value for the parking fees are less likely to accept proposed fee amounts (i.e., negative expected coefficient).</p>

<title>Response Rates and Demographics</title>
<p>For the tourist part of the study, 423 questionnaires were returned. Once undeliverable addresses were removed from the total sampling frame of 925, the effective response rate was 45.7%. Of the 3,000 residents included in the study, a total of 697 questionnaires were returned for an effective response rate of 27.6% once undeliverable addresses were deleted from the total mailed. Respondents who did not answer items included in the model were deleted, resulting in a total of 304 tourists and 463 residents. The two tourist segments consisted of 252 overnight tourists and 48 day trippers. Four tourists did not indicate if their most recent visit was a day or overnight trip and were excluded from data analysis. The subgroups for residents consisted of 308 coastal residents and 155 inland residents.</p>
<p>In brief, predictor variables included in the model were examined for differences between residents and tourists. More male residents (56.3%) completed the questionnaire than females (43.8%), but in the tourist portion of the study more females (65.1%) responded. With an average age of just over 56, residents were older than tourists, whose average age was 41. Regarding education attainment, resident and tourist respondents were not significantly different in terms of highest level of education completed. Finally, residents and tourists did not differ on their rating of the importance of the value for the parking fee.</p>

<title>Estimation Results</title>
<p>Estimation of the bivariate probit model was performed using Stata 11 and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287512451136">Table 2</xref>. The bivariate-probit model generates two different sets of estimated parameters obtained from the first and second dichotomous choice responses. For simplicity, a single set of the parameter estimates is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287512451136">Table 2</xref> (contact the second author for the complete analyses). A goodness-of-fit measure using McFadden’s r<sup>2</sup> was 0.11 for residents and 0.16 for tourists, which is a goodness-of-fit measure analogous to <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> in a conventional regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512451136">Greene 2000</xref>). In this study, the tourist model resulted in a better fit than the resident model. Thus, a greater portion of the variation in the WTP probability of a yes response (i.e., an individual accepts the proposed fee amount) was explained by those explanatory variables included in the tourists model, compared to the resident model.</p>

<p>Across the two models, all of the parameter estimates corresponded with a priori expectations. However, the explanatory variables that were significant in each model differed. The predictor variables of Charleston, Hilton Head, and BID were significant in the resident model and the BID, EDU, and VPARK variables were significant in the tourist model. As expected, the negative coefficients of the BID variable suggests that individuals were less willing to respond yes as the proposed fee amount increased. The positive coefficient of EDU shows that respondents who had higher education were more likely to accept proposed fee amounts. The negative coefficient of VPARK suggests that as tourists place more importance on the value of parking fees, the lower the probability they accept proposed fee amounts in the tourist model. Likewise, the positive coefficients of two dummy variables (Charleston and Hilton Head) in the resident model indicate respondents who live in Charleston and Hilton Head Island were more willing to respond yes to the proposed bid amounts.</p>
<p>To account for within-group diversity, four different segmented subgroups were further identified: coastal residents and inland residents as well as day trippers and overnight tourists. A goodness-of-fit measure (McFadden’s <sup>2</sup> ) indicated that there was generally a better fit for the two tourists models (0.182 for day trippers and 0.177 for overnight tourists) than the residents models (0.100 for coastal residents and 0.164 for inland residents). As expected, the BID variable in each individual model was highly significant as an important explanatory variable in the CVM estimation. However, slightly different patterns of significant variables in each segmented model are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287512451136">Table 3</xref>. For example, whereas the variables of EDU and VPARK were significant for overnight tourists, only GENDER was significant for day trippers at the 0.05 level.</p>

<p>where <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>fee</italic></sub> is the parameter estimate of the fee amount. Assuming the mean values for the explanatory variables besides BID, the estimated net WTPs for additional beach access points, which included the three separate beach destinations, were $2.46 for residents and $6.33 for tourists. Confidence intervals allow the variability in the WTP estimates to be examined more rigorously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512451136">Park, Loomis, and Creel 1991</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512451136">Hole (2007)</xref>, all of the methods including the delta, Krinsky and Robb, bootstrapping approaches generate reasonably accurate confidence intervals for the WTPs. In this study, the delta method was used based on its computational simplicity. The 95% confidence intervals constructed were between −$1.03 and $5.94 for the resident model and between $3.78 and $8.87 for the tourist model.</p>
<p>To estimate the total WTPs at the population level, the mean WTPs for both residents and tourists were multiplied by the estimated total number of coastal county residents and tourists, respectively. For the resident model, the estimated total number of coastal county residents visiting a South Carolina beach during the study year was 521,620 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512451136">Draper, Dixon, and Oh 2008</xref>). The WTP of $2.46 multiplied by total number of coastal county residents results in residents deriving economic benefits of $1,283,185 from additional public beach access points. This value is a conservative estimate because it does not account for the multiple trips taken by residents to the beach. For the tourist model, the estimated total number of out-of-county tourists visiting a South Carolina beach during the study year was 7,028,275 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512451136">Draper, Dixon, and Oh 2008</xref>). Multiplying the WTP of $6.33 by estimated number of tourists indicates tourists derived $44,488,980 in economic benefits from additional public beach access points.</p>
<p>To reflect site-specific nature in each beach destination with a different degree of access availability, WTPs for the three beach destinations were also calculated. The estimated WTPs for resident models were –$3.31 for Myrtle Beach, $0.73 for Charleston residents, and –$1.57 for Hilton Head Island residents. Furthermore, while coastal residents reported their WTP of $1.70, the estimated WTP of $3.92 was higher for inland residents. For the tourist model, the estimated WTPs were $5.03 for Myrtle Beach tourists, $5.90 for Charleston tourists, and $5.46 for Hilton Head Island tourists. Evaluating the tourists also indicated that the estimated WTPs were $5.38 for day trippers and $7.24 for overnight tourists, suggesting overnight tourists placed a higher value on public beach access.</p>
<p>Standard errors of the WTPs for the resident and tourist models as well as the segmented models are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287512451136">Table 4</xref> for the calculation of confidence intervals. Different views exist on negative WTPs but the exclusion of negative WTPs may lead to considerable overestimation of social benefits derived from proposed policy changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512451136">Hanley et al. 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512451136">Hanley et al. (2009)</xref> suggest valuation studies need to account for the existence of negative WTPs in data analyses and to report these values.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With growth in coastal populations and infrastructure that serves both residents and tourists, the ability to provide public beach access is becoming increasingly difficult and costly. As a result, agencies responsible for providing public beach access benefit from knowledge of what tourists and residents are willing to pay for access. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512451136">Lew and Larson (2005)</xref> suggest that coastal managers and policy decision makers require data on the economic value of various coastal amenities to develop efficient and effective policies. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the economic values residents and tourists assign to additional public beach access and determine site-specific values at three destinations with varying degrees of beach access, utilizing the contingent valuation method. The information derived from the economic values provides decision makers with suggestions regarding the financing options for acquisition and maintenance of public beach access.</p>
<p>Mean WTP for additional public beach access points and related facilities was estimated for coastal residents and tourists to South Carolina beaches. In addition, residents and tourists were segmented into two groups for each category. Residents were separated by those living in counties on the coast and individuals residing in counties adjacent to coastal counties, while tourists were divided into day trippers and overnight tourists. These segments were created in order to evaluate whether varying needs of these four groups would result in diverse WTP estimates. For example, inland residents are more likely than coastal residents to drive and require parking and other amenities, resulting in an increased need for access. Similarly, it is expected that day trippers to coastal destinations require parking and increased access compared to overnight tourists, especially for overnight visitors who stay in accommodations close to or on the beach.</p>
<p>Coastal residents indicated a willingness to pay $2.46 for additional public beach access points and related facilities, while coastal tourists’ mean WTP was $6.33. As expected, tourists were more willing to pay for public beach access than local residents. Several reasons may explain this variation between residents and tourists. First, local residents feel that paying local taxes should exempt them from paying for access to local resources or recreation areas and may view the fee as a duplicate tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512451136">Winter, Palucki, and Burkhardt 1999</xref>). Second, many local residents have knowledge of parking areas and beaches that do not require a parking fee. Third, local residents have a strong attachment to the local area and can feel as though they “own” the local resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512451136">Ellis and Vogelsong 2005</xref>). Furthermore, residents’ proximity to the beach may result in fewer demands in terms of beach access and amenities compared to other user groups. As a result, residents may feel as though they should not pay beyond the property taxes already assessed. Regardless, coastal residents and tourists demand adequate access to coastal resources and results from this study suggest both are willing to pay for this access.</p>
<p>Regarding residents’ willingness to pay, individuals residing in counties on the coast were less willing to pay for additional beach access ($1.70) compared to residents of counties adjacent to these coastal counties ($3.92). Individuals residing on the coast are less likely to require parking and related amenities because of the proximity of their residence to the beach. In addition, these residents are likely to be familiar with beach areas where parking is free but this kind of information is less known by tourists. Conversely, inland residents’ willingness to pay may be associated with the desire for ease and convenience. These inland residents may be willing to pay for additional beach access because they desire the ability to visit beach areas without the annoyance of locating available parking and related facilities.</p>
<p>Both resident segments were significantly less willing to pay than the tourist segments. Surprisingly, day trippers’ estimated willingness to pay for additional beach access was lower ($5.38) than overnight tourists ($7.24). Higher willingness to pay estimates for overnight tourists could be derived from the fact that a number of those visitors may stay in accommodations not directly on the beach. Two of the beach destinations (i.e., Charleston and Hilton Head Island) analyzed in this study have fewer accommodation facilities located directly on the beach. If the overnight tourists’ accommodations were not located on the beach, this could explain their willingness to pay more for additional access. Another explanation may be overnight tourists had factored access fees and parking costs into their travel budgets. On the other hand, day trippers’ lower willingness to pay estimate may be related to their awareness of beach areas where parking is free or less of an issue. Day trippers are likely to live closer to beach destinations, which may result in more frequent visits and knowledge about various beach areas.</p>
<p>Although these mean WTP values for coastal residents and tourists are vital information for resource managers and policy makers, site-specific WTP values for public beach access may provide more useful information to decision makers. When comparing coastal residents’ and tourists’ willingness to pay for public beach access in Myrtle Beach, residents required a payment of $3.31 while tourists were willing to pay $5.03. The disparity between residents’ and tourists’ WTP values was expected a priori because Myrtle Beach has comparatively sufficient access points and local officials expressed minor concerns regarding a lack of parking and related facilities. In particular, the negative WTP estimate (i.e., –$3.31) of residents supports the statements made by officials in Myrtle Beach regarding the need of additional beach access points. One reason tourists may be willing to pay a significant amount for public beach access is that parking at most of the popular beaches becomes very limited as the day progresses. On the other hand, many residents try to avoid these popular beaches and spend their time at less known beaches in the area where parking space is not an issue.</p>
<p>Charleston and Hilton Head Island have larger concerns regarding public beach access and related facilities. Residents of Charleston indicated a willingness to pay of $0.73 for additional public beach access compared to $5.90 for tourists visiting Charleston beaches. The difference in WTP values demonstrates tourists’ frustration with a lack of public beach access and parking at this destination. In one beach area where this study was conducted, the beach has only one main public beach access with parking and related facilities (e.g., showers, restrooms). Other public beach access points at this beach do not have parking associated with the access point. Conversations with coastal residents revealed these individuals visit the beach later in the day to avoid the congestion created by tourists. In addition, residents suggested the Charleston area has some beaches tourists are not familiar with that residents can visit if their particular beach becomes overcrowded with tourists.</p>
<p>In Hilton Head Island, residents reported a willingness to pay of –$1.57 for additional public beach access and related facilities, whereas tourists’ willingness to pay was estimated to be $5.46. Hilton Head Island residents’ negative willingness to pay may be explained by the fact that the local government decided to discontinue the practice of charging for public beach access during the time of data collection. However, the limited number of public beach access locations at this destination (approximately 4) combined with the new access policy may cause resentment between residents and tourists. This resentment may be due to the fact that residents are likely to have difficulty recreating on local beaches because of inadequate beach access and parking.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, results from this study suggest that coastal residents and tourists place a significant value on public beach access. If coastal residents and tourists are willing to pay for additional public beach access, this could be an implicit indication that more public beach access locations are desired. With the concurrent goals of the CZMA and coastal states to provide public access to coastal resources for recreation, local management agencies can utilize estimates of the value coastal residents and tourists place on public beach access to determine the appropriate number and location of additional access points. Furthermore, other coastal destinations may find the results of this study useful because the three specific sites selected vary in the number and type of public beach access provided.</p>
<sec id="section13-0047287512451136">
<title>Management Implications</title>
<p>The importance of supplying coastal resource managers with an estimate of the willingness to pay for public beach access for both coastal residents and tourists is to assist in the development of policies regarding the financing options for acquisition and maintenance of such projects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512451136">Black, Donnelly, and Settle (1990)</xref> suggested that an appropriate method for financing the acquisition and maintenance of beach access is a user/access fee. In the current study, the payment option presented to respondents was a parking fee that closely resembles the user/access fee approach. For tourists, the option of a parking fee is highly target effective and feasible because tourists are more likely to require parking at coastal destinations. However, some tourists may stay in accommodations close to the beach and not require parking, and consequently not pay a parking fee (unless paid to the hotel or accommodations). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512451136">Bonham et al. (1992)</xref> indicate accommodations taxes are regularly assessed in tourism destinations, a countywide assessment may not be target effective for beach access projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512451136">Black, Donnelly, and Settle 1990</xref>). The countywide assessment may not be target effective since some hotels will be farther from the beach and potential guests may not be beach users. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512451136">Black, Donnelly, and Settle (1990)</xref> indicate that a special district accommodations tax for properties close to the beach is target effective.</p>
<p>Residents who use the beach pose different challenges of capturing a fee in order to pay for providing beach access and related maintenance. One challenge is that residents who reside within walking distance of the beach require much less than other users in terms of access and amenities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512451136">Brower 1978</xref>). A second challenge to assessing a fee for residents is the purpose or use of the fee for beach improvement. While property taxes are target effective for improvement projects such as beach nourishment where residents benefit the most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512451136">Black, Donnelly, and Settle 1990</xref>), they are not for projects such as providing beach access points since residents might have access from their property.</p>
<p>There are a few options to acquire and provide public beach access once fees are collected. First, a fee-simple approach can be used to purchase undeveloped land, but there is also the issue of “the cost and means of financing acquisitions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512451136">Beatley, Brower, and Schwab 1994</xref>, p. 166). Inherently, outright purchase of coastal land is expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512451136">Beatley, Brower, and Schwab 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512451136">Brower and Dreyfoos 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512451136">Crompton 1999</xref>). A potentially less expensive option can be less-than-fee-simple, where the rights to pass over someone’s land is purchased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512451136">Beatley, Brower, and Schwab 1994</xref>). A third option is when there is no willing seller(s) of land. In such instances, eminent domain provides the government the ability to acquire land from unwilling sellers by paying for the land at its appraised value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512451136">Crompton 1999</xref>). However, this is often seen as a last resort because of the potential opposition.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451136">Pogue and Lee (1999)</xref> imply coastal resource managers have a difficult task because of the conflict of interests between coastal residents and tourists, as well as the issue of limited funding. Individuals residing in coastal areas are likely to have heterogeneous interests in coastal resources and tourism based on their dependence on the local industry dependent on their relationship with tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512451136">Ellis and Vogelsong 2005</xref>). In addition, coastal residents and tourists might have opposing interests in the management and preservation of coastal resources. However, the majority of previous studies estimating the value individuals place on beach recreation and/or resources have focused on tourists. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512451136">Harrill (2004)</xref> suggests, decision makers responsible for the planning and development of tourism-related projects should examine the viewpoint from both local residents and tourists. Coastal residents’ opinions toward coastal resources may focus more on preservation, as well as minimizing the congestion on beaches because of an increasing number of tourists. Determining the economic value coastal residents place on coastal resources, such as public beach access and related facilities will provide coastal resource managers with a vital piece of information required in the development of long-term policies. Furthermore, combining the value coastal residents and tourists assign to public beach access and related facilities may assist coastal resource managers in justifying the utilization of public funds to acquire and maintain these resources.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, the investigation was limited to coastal sites in South Carolina. Future research should replicate this type of study at various destinations in order to further test the findings that coastal residents and tourists have varying values for public beach access and related facilities. Second, CVM is widely utilized in estimating the value of nonmarket goods and services, but the hypothetical nature of the technique has been one of the main criticisms because of concerns about hypothetical bias. Recently, to solve the problem, joint estimation methods using combined stated preference and revealed preference data has been proposed as an effective alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512451136">Whitehead et al. 2008</xref>). Third, the day tripper sample used in the analysis was relatively small. Results related to the analysis of this group should be viewed with caution. Finally, those individuals who own a vacation home or time share were not included in the analysis. It is expected that the willingness to pay of these groups may differ from the other four groups used in the analysis.</p>
<p>In summary, for management agencies responsible for providing and maintaining access to the coast this study demonstrates that both coastal residents and tourists are willing to pay fairly sizable amounts for public beach access. Although residents were willing to pay less than tourists, the study findings suggest both groups are likely to gain sizeable benefits from the provision and maintenance of adequate public beach access.</p>
