<title>Methods</title>
<p>Two hundred thirty-seven untreated patients, 125 healthy individuals, and 104 individuals with oral premalignant lesions were enrolled. Interleukin-6 serum concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599813478573">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Serum concentrations of interleukin-6 were significantly higher in patients compared with the levels in healthy individuals and the subjects with oral premalignant lesions. Serum interleukin-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with higher pT status (from pT1 to pT4, median values in pg/mL = 0, 0, 1.3, and 5.0, respectively, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), higher pathological stages (from stage I to IV, median values = 0, 0, 1.3, and 3.6, respectively, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), positive bone invasion (5.0 vs 0, 1.4 vs 0; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and higher tumor depths (1.4 vs 0; <italic>P</italic> = .005). Patients with higher pretreatment levels of interleukin-6 (&gt;1.35 pg/mL, median level) had worse prognoses for 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival despite treatment (75.7% vs 54.9% and 79.1% vs 59.8%; <italic>P</italic> = .001 and .003, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analyses also indicated that higher interleukin-6 serum levels were an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.417 and 2.364; <italic>P</italic> = .009 and .017, respectively).</p>

<p>Cytokines play important roles in regulating processes critical to tumor progression, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813478573">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813478573"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813478573">3</xref></sup> As oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) carcinogenesis is considered to be highly associated with a local chronic inflammatory process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813478573">4</xref></sup> we speculated that levels of the tumor-related cytokines will be dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation and that they might be associated with certain tumor behaviors. In our previous study, we used the multiplex suspension array system, a high-throughput proteomic platform, to measure 48 different cytokines/chemokines simultaneously and discovered that circulating plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly elevated in patients with OSCC. However, the clinical roles and applications of IL-6 serum levels in OSCC patients still remain unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813478573">5</xref></sup> IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced at inflammatory sites and secreted into the blood, thereby initiating an inflammatory reaction, but studies addressing the clinical role of IL-6 on OSCC are quite limited. Until now, there has been no evidence on the carcinogenesis of IL-6 on OSCC or whether targeting this specific pathway would be helpful on OSCC management. Although serum IL-6 levels were elevated in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a preliminary report derived from sera of only 19 patients, the association of circulating IL-6 levels and the clinicopathological manifestations and prognosis of OSCC patients still remains to be elucidated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813478573">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To further investigate potential clinical roles of IL-6 serum levels in the development and/or progression of OSCC, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, a highly accessible method used in most laboratories worldwide. We measured the IL-6 serum levels in 3 different groups of participants: previously untreated patients with OSCC, healthy individuals, and individuals with oral premalignant lesions (OPLs), including oral leukoplakia and/or erythroplakia. By analyzing the association between the clinicopathologic manifestations and the IL-6 serum levels in patients with OSCC, we evaluated the potential clinicopathologic relevance of IL-6 serum levels in our OSCC patients. Finally, we evaluated their potential role as prognostic indicators.</p>

<title>Patients, Clinical Staging Protocol, Oncologic Treatment, and Clinical Outcome Assessment</title>
<p>The study population was a cohort of 237 consecutively and newly identified patients with OSCC, 104 individuals with OPLs (leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and erythroleukoplakia in 85, 5, and 14 individuals, respectively), and 125 healthy individuals seen in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Lin-Kou, from January 2005 to July 2010. The healthy individuals were all volunteers undergoing routine health examinations or individuals presenting with other otolaryngological-related, nonneoplastic diseases. Patients with inoperable disease, synchronous cancers, recurrent cancers, distant metastasis, or a history of another malignancy were excluded from the analyses. All subjects provided written informed consent before participating in the study. A questionnaire was used to gather detailed information on general demography as well as current and past cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel nut–chewing habits. Patients who had ever smoked cigarettes, chewed betel nuts, and drank alcohol on a regular basis (at least once per week for 1 year) were classified as tobacco, betel nut, and alcohol users, respectively. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>OSCC patients in the study underwent standard preoperative workups according to institutional guidelines, including a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck, chest radiographs, bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound. Primary tumors were excised with adequate margins guided by intraoperative frozen section to confirm adequacy. Surgical defects were immediately reconstructed, if necessary, with a free flap or local rotational flap by plastic surgeons. After surgical treatment, the pathologic and nodal stages of all tumors were established according to the <italic>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</italic> (sixth edition). In our pathological examination, both cortical erosion and through-and-through bone erosion were considered as bone invasion. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered to patients with pathologic T4 tumors and positive lymph nodes within 6 weeks after surgery. Patients with pathologic multiple neck lymph node metastasis, extracapsular spread, and/or positive surgical margins received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy was a cisplatin-based regimen. Total radiation dose was 66 Gy, which was delivered at 1.8 to 2 Gy per day, 5 days per week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813478573">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813478573"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813478573"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813478573"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813478573">11</xref></sup> After discharge, all patients had regular follow-up visits every 2 months for the first year, every 3 months for the second year, and every 6 months thereafter.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599813478573">
<title>Collection of Blood and Storage of Serum</title>
<p>Ten-milliliter samples of peripheral blood were drawn once from participants, with standardized phlebotomy procedures, within 1 week before OSCC tumor resection. Blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000<italic>g</italic>. Serum was immediately aliquoted, transferred into plain polypropylene tubes, and stored in a dedicated freezer at −80°C. No more than 1 freeze-thaw cycle was allowed for each serum sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599813478573">
<title>ELISA</title>
<p>IL-6 serum concentrations in the tested samples were determined by using the human IL-6 ELISA kit II (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the following modifications. Human recombinant IL-6 was diluted and used as the standard. Briefly, 50 µL of ELISA diluents was pipetted into each well, and then 100 µL of serum samples or standard was added to the 96-well microtiter plates coated with a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6. After a 2-hour incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed 5 times. A biotinylated monoclonal antibody was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed 7 times, and 100 µL of substrate reagents containing tetramethylbenzidine were added for color development at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 M sulfuric acid, and the color intensity in each well was measured as the optical density using a microplate reader set to 450 nm. A standard curve was constructed by plotting the optical value of the standards, and the amounts of IL-6 in individual samples were calculated from this standard curve. The measurements were performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical data are expressed as medians (with 75% percentiles, 25% percentiles). Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to examine significance. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed by plotting sensitivity versus (1-specificity), and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were analyzed with the Hanley and McNeil method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813478573">12</xref></sup> All OSCC patients received follow-up evaluations at our outpatient clinic until March 2012 or until their death. Kaplan-Meier plots were used for survival analysis, with statistical significance measured by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to define specific risk factors for overall survival and disease-specific survival (DSS). All statistical tests were 2 sided, and a <italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Profiles of IL-6 Serum Concentrations in Study Subjects</title>
<p>The IL-6 serum levels (median [75% percentile, 25% percentile]) were found to be significantly different between patients with OSCC and healthy individuals (1.3 [6.8, 0] vs 0 [2.5, 0] pg/mL, <italic>P</italic> = .0002) as well as between patients with OSCC and the OPL group (1.3 [6.8, 0] vs 0 [1.1, 0] pg/mL, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In contrast, IL-6 serum levels did not differ between the OPL group and healthy individuals (0 [1.1, 0] vs 0 [2.5, 0] pg/mL, <italic>P</italic> = .853). To determine the value of the IL-6 serum levels as a potential marker for distinguishing patients with OSCC from healthy individuals and the patients with OPL, ROC curves were plotted. The AUC values that compared the IL-6 levels of the OSCC group and healthy individuals were 0.61 (0.55-0.67, 95% confidence interval). Similarly, the AUC value for comparing the IL-6 levels of OSCC and OPL groups was 0.63 (0.57-0.69, 95% confidence interval). These results indicate that the IL-6 serum levels probably could not be used effectively as a diagnostic marker for the detection of OSCC tumors despite significantly higher IL-6 serum levels in OSCC patients compared with the other 2 groups.</p>

<title>Association between OSCC Clinicopathologic Manifestations and IL-6 Serum Concentrations</title>

However, IL-6 serum concentrations in the OSCC patients prior to treatment were not significantly associated with pN status, perineural invasion, and degree of histological cell differentiation, although there was a trend in the association between IL-6 levels and perineural invasion (<italic>P</italic> = .097; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813478573"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The prevalence of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel quid chewing in OSCC patients was 59.1%, 82.0%, and 83.2%, respectively. There was also no significant association between IL-6 serum levels and alcohol consumption (<italic>P</italic> = .256), betel quid chewing (<italic>P</italic> = .360), and smoking (<italic>P</italic> = .625).</p>

<title>Correlation of IL-6 Serum Levels with OSCC Patient Overall Survival</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the IL-6 serum levels were associated with patient survival, we analyzed 149 consecutive OSCC patients who finished our standardized treatment for at least 3 years. Five-year overall survival for patient subgroups stratified by the higher (n = 74) versus lower (n = 75) levels of serum IL-6 were 75.7% versus 54.9, when compared using a log-rank test (<italic>P</italic> = .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813478573"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). To determine whether IL-6 overexpression was an independent predictor of overall survival, a multivariate analysis was performed with age, gender, tumor stage, nodal stage, degree of cell differentiation, bone invasion, perineural invasion, tumor depth, and IL-6 serum levels as parameters. Only positive nodal stage and IL-6 serum concentrations were independent predictors of overall survival (<italic>P</italic> = .008 and .009, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813478573"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). These results indicated that IL-6 serum concentrations may play a role in predicting overall survival in OSCC patients.</p>

<title>Correlation of IL-6 Serum Concentrations with OSCC Patient DSS</title>
<p>Similarly, we evaluated whether the IL-6 serum levels were correlated with patient DSS. OSCC patient subgroups stratified by the higher (n = 74) versus lower (n = 75) levels of serum IL-6 had significantly different 5-year DSS rates of 79.1% versus 59.8%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813478573"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). To determine whether IL-6 overexpression was an independent predictor of DSS, a multivariate analysis (with the same parameters as before was performed) examined age, gender, tumor stage, nodal stage, cell differentiation, bone invasion, perineural invasion, tumor depth, and IL-6 serum levels as parameters. Three factors, positive nodal stage, positive perinerual invasion, and IL-6 serum concentrations, were independent predictors of DSS (<italic>P</italic> = .009, .032, and .017, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813478573"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>), but the remaining factors were not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813478573"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). These results again indicated that IL-6 serum levels could be useful as a blood marker for predicting DSS in OSCC patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although we have previously demonstrated that circulating plasma IL-6 levels were differentially elevated in both groups of patients with OSCC and nasopharyngeal carcinoma by the multiplex suspension array system, the clinicopathological associations and clinical utilities of IL-6 serum levels in OSCC patients still remain unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813478573">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813478573">13</xref></sup> This study is the first to use the ELISA method to measure the IL-6 serum levels from the blood samples of patients with exclusively OSCC, patients with OPLs, and healthy individuals to elucidate an association between IL-6 serum profiles and OSCC tumors. Although one previous study reported the IL-6 serum profiles in patients with head-and-neck cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813478573">14</xref></sup> no study has reported the IL-6 serum levels from healthy subjects and individuals with OPLs or the prognostic value of pretreatment IL-6 serum levels for patients with only OSCC tumors until now. IL-6 concentrations were highly overexpressed in OSCC tumors, and IL-6 concentrations in blood also correlated with tumor size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813478573">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813478573">16</xref></sup> Although higher IL-6 levels were detected previously in the saliva and serum of OSCC patients compared with those of controls, the number of enrolled subjects was quite limited and the procedures of collecting saliva were also diverse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813478573">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813478573">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813478573">18</xref></sup> Nonetheless, these findings implied that OSCC tumors could be associated with an increase in IL-6 levels, and the increased IL-6 levels might be also correlated with OSCC tumor burdens.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis and elucidate the range of IL-6 serum concentrations, we measured the IL-6 serum levels in 3 large groups of patients. Although we have samples from the independent groups of individuals and sample sizes are relatively big enough, the distribution of IL-6 serum levels are not normally distributed. Under such circumstances, a <italic>t</italic> test, which tests the differences of the means and makes the assumption that the variable is normally distributed, is the less robust one to be used. Instead, a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) has been used in the current study. Here, IL-6 serum levels were statistically higher in patients with OSCC tumors compared with those of healthy controls and the OPL group. In addition, the higher IL-6 serum levels were associated with higher T status, overall stage, and deeper tumor depth. In this study, we demonstrated that higher IL-6 serum levels were found in the OSCC patients whose tumors were significantly associated with bone invasion documented in the pathological reports. In a previous study, IL-6 was highly expressed in both OSCC cells and osteoclasts at the tumor-bone interface, suggesting that OSCC cells provide a suitable microenvironment for osteoclast formation by producing IL-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813478573">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>IL-6 activates a transcriptional response through the IL-6 receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813478573">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813478573">21</xref></sup> Upon binding to the receptor, IL-6 activates STAT3-phosphorylation, which increases proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of various malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813478573">22</xref></sup> The IL-6/Jak/Stat3 pathway has also been shown to be a principal pathway in carcinogenesis and in the regulation of many important mediators of tumorigenesis and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813478573">23</xref></sup> It also activates the AKT pathway to inactive many proapoptotic mediators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813478573">22</xref></sup> Although these pathways help cells to survive during the inflammatory process even in very toxic microenvironments, they also serve to maintain cell progression toward neoplastic growth and to protect them from cellular apoptosis and chemotherapeutic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813478573">22</xref></sup> Meanwhile, a recent review also addressed the importance of the IL-6/Jak/Stat pathway in human malignancies and introduced the potential roles of inhibitors to this pathway in the cancer treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813478573">23</xref></sup> The current study demonstrated that pretreatment IL-6 serum concentrations were an independent prognostic predictor of overall survival of OSCC patients by univariate and multivariate analyses. These findings also support the fundamental importance of the IL-6 pathway in OSCC tumors and further confirmed the role of IL-6 serum levels as a useful prognostic tool for OSCC patients.</p>
<p>The limitation of the current study was that we did not have complete demographic information for all cases to differentiate the past and present substance users as well as their frequency of usage. Thus, we were unable create a heterogeneous group of patients for statistical comparison and this therefore precludes the ability to truly discern the carcinogenic role of alcohol and tobacco with regard to IL-6 serum levels.</p>
