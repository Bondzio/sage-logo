<p>This is a book about <italic>engaged scholarship</italic>: its rationales, the theoretical underpinnings, and the ways to accomplish it in practice. It was published as part of a series of “pocket guides to social work research methods” and authored by two faculty members at Rutgers: J. Longhofer and J. Floersch and Janet Hoy from the University of Toledo.</p>
<p>Engaged scholarship emerged in mid-1990s as an approach which integrates the interdisciplinary knowledge of researchers and nonacademics: practitioners, clients, policy makers, community members, and others. Characterized by a notion of reciprocity, encouragement, and interdependence, <italic>engaged scholarship</italic> proposes more informed and sensitive ways to design, implement, and evaluate social interventions.</p>
<p>The book is structured into five parts. The first chapter looks into the theory of critical realism in order to discuss social work as a practice which engages in the dynamic between <italic>facts</italic> (descriptive aspects) and the <italic>values</italic> attached to them (normative, ethical evaluations about “what is best to do”). This chapter engages in presenting distinctions between “the Real, the Actual, and the Empirical” domains of experience, between the “Brute and Institutional Facts,” between “Closed versus Open systems,” between “Emergence and Downward Causation,” or between “Contingency and Necessity.” Later, constructionism, essentialism, the “phenomenological practice gap,” empiricism, and behaviorism are briefly discussed.</p>
<p>The second chapter is a “quick-start” to qualitative research. It takes the reader along a research process that goes from identifying the aims and questions, to finding research partners, the recruitment of participants, and to the collection and management of data. The chapter includes a brief <italic>ATLAS. ti</italic> tutorial and a “case illustration”: an example of how engaged scholarship works in practice.</p>
<p>The third chapter is an example of institutional ethnography. It looks into the “phenomenological practice gap” intervening in a mental health system in the context of completing a service evaluation form. It illustrates how engaged scholarship can be employed in order to identify the “different but interdependent” standpoints of the actors involved: case managers, clients, and administrators.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter illustrates how engaged scholarship can be used when an evidence-based practice needs to be modified or adapted. It is a practical guide which takes a mental health intervention through all stages necessary for its adaptation for groups of incarcerated adults. Such steps include literature review, focus groups with various stakeholders, the collaborative design of sampling and recruitment strategy, thematic analysis by double coding. The chapter demonstrates that, unlike the research informed by experts’ opinion alone, an engaged scholarship approach is likely to “coproduce” more reliable knowledge on open systems, such as jail settings.</p>
<p>The last chapter transposes Margaret Archer’s “modes of reflexivity” in the area of engaged research. It calls for “autonomous reflexivity” as a process unfolding at personal, methodological, theoretical, and representational levels, among others. It warns about the (inherent) dangers for researchers to act as sources of bias and distinguishes between the notions of “reflection <italic>on</italic> action” (which follows the practice) and “reflection <italic>in</italic> action,” which is simultaneous with practice.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is successful in passing the message on the need for engaged scholarship. It moves beyond a conventional rhetoric on cooperation between various stakeholders, by indicating the actual steps to be taken for a genuine “coproduction of knowledge.” For instance, the chapter on the use of qualitative methods for adapting evidence-based practice is particularly relevant, as it enters into the intricacies of a process that despite being largely advocated for, is usually less transparent. Moreover, the thematic illustrations’ and the case studies supporting the opinions presented in the book are extracted from actual research.</p>
<p>There are several crosscutting ideas that unify the theoretical and the applied side of the book. One such example is the argument that the gap between research and “real-life situations” encountered by practitioners is not a matter of knowledge transfer, but one of “knowledge production” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513475825">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). It is, thus, argued that consensus among different stakeholders should not be a goal and that engaged scholarship should build on the creative tensions generated between theory and practice or between different stakeholders. Thus, the book calls for replacing a customary search for consensus, by a proactive fostering of disagreement for “coproduction of knowledge.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, balancing rigor and theoretical thoroughness with accessibility in a “pocket guide” model, is far from an easy task. The book alternates sections that are conceptually extremely dense and which require some prior knowledge of critical realism, with others that are practical and more accessible to nonacademics. At times, it seems that different chapters speak to different audiences. For instance, it is less likely that a question such as “what is qualitative data” (p. 38) is pertinent after a first theoretical chapter heavily permeated by critical realism and the conceptual divides between “the Real, the Actual and the Empirical,” or between “Contingency and Necessity,” among others.</p>
<p>All things considered, the book proposes a way of thinking about research which deserves the attention of the academic and nonacademic community. For practitioners, it offers grounds for empowerment and for embracing new professional roles. For researchers, the book is an occasion to reflect critically on their previous work and to chart partnerships that go beyond the academic area.</p>
