<p>To call Donald J. Shoemaker’s book, <italic>Theories of Delinquency: An Examination of Explanations of Delinquent Behavior</italic>, a must read for any graduate-level course in juvenile delinquency would not be an exaggeration. The lack of slick, glossy, and colorful pedagogical bells and whistles, often found in overpriced undergraduate textbooks that address similar subject matter, is the mark of Shoemaker’s serious scholarly work. Now in its sixth edition, Shoemaker’s text has been intimidating first-year graduate students of criminology for almost 30 years.</p>
<p>The text begins with a careful look at “causation” and rightfully treats causality as an epistemological concern. From beginning to end, Shoemaker artfully weaves methodological necessities into the reader’s understanding of the history of thought as it pertains to the theoretical trends associated with studies in delinquency. While many may fault the book for not being as up-to-date as some of the other delinquency theory texts, Shoemaker’s text must be rightly appreciated for its thorough attention to detail as it delivers what could be flippantly viewed as the mother of all specialty comprehensive examinations on delinquency. The end result is an artfully crafted text that positions methodology within theory, and theory alongside of a rigorous statement of the field.</p>
<p>Most notable is Shoemaker’s innate affinity for utilizing solid empirical evidence to skeptically unravel each theory’s truth claims. In so doing, he reveals that nothing is left for the reader to hold on to. At the end of nearly every chapter, the reader must face up to the broken promises of modernity. As a consequence, Shoemaker brings the reader to the realization that there is no core of truth to hold on to, and there is no silver bullet to solve “the problem” of delinquency in our society.</p>
<p>While the text certainly tests the mettle of the reader, Shoemaker confronts his own dilemma. By standing on the shoulders of giants, Shoemaker forgoes breaking any new ground. Nevertheless, Shoemaker’s text is the gold standard for any graduate course in delinquency. In fact, it can be argued that the reason why the criminological discipline has become so incredibly successful is because of scholars like Shoemaker, that initially laid down a foundation of solid scientific inquiry for us all, not because of fly-by-night popular culture trends such as the “CSI Effect.”</p>
<p>Shoemaker introduces the reader to a foundation of knowledge that was successfully built after decades and decades of selfless scholarship and study. By meticulously detailing the history of these fashions of thought about delinquency, the reader’s knowledgebase is broadened and fortified. While outlining theories of choice, biology, psychology, anomie, control, and labeling (to only name a few), Shoemaker brings into view the never-ending exchange between agency and structure. Shoemaker teaches the reader that the individual and the collective endlessly negotiate within the ebb and flow of temporal and spatial locations. In-between the lines, Shoemaker instructs the reader that “the problem” of delinquency is one of life’s ancient burdens.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Shoemaker’s text accurately captures the collective meanings of these many different theories. He does so by condensing these forcefully crafted arguments into readable chapters, not an easy task to accomplish by any measure. Impressively, he does not sacrifice nuance for brevity. In addition, he does not allow judiciousness to fall under the juggernaut of simplification.</p>
<p>Shoemaker allows the reader to appreciate the complexity of America’s fragmented and conflicted systems of thought associated with understanding (or misunderstanding) delinquency. Each perspective touched upon in his book has survived the test of time in its own specific way. Each and every theoretical perspective of delinquency leaves a legacy of highly useful explanatory tools for the junior and senior scholar alike to employ throughout the course of their intellectual development.</p>
<p>The theories that Shoemaker touches upon have left behind them an abundance of insights and a plethora of illuminations. These theories of delinquency not only teach us about ourselves but also about the young people who walk among us. In a world that is characterized by displacement and a mediated sense of reality for young and old alike, Shoemaker assists us all in finding a balance between responsibility and dignity for those who have transgressed established standards of conduct.</p>
<p>The value associated with Shoemaker’s theoretical interpretations is without measure. His theoretical summaries should serve to encourage other scholars to construct their own interpretations of differing theories of delinquency. Through leading by example, Shoemaker’s text emerges as nothing more and nothing less than accurate representations of the complex but incredibly important social phenomena that we all refer to as delinquency. Not unlike other social phenomena, delinquency will continue to be shaped and distorted within social and historical contexts, as well as by personal introspection and individual bias. Thankfully for us all, delinquency as a subject of inquiry will stay forever young.</p>
