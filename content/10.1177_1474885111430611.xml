<abstract>
<p>This paper has three aims. First, it argues that the present use of ‘ideal theory’ is unhelpful, and that an earlier and apparently more natural use focusing on perfection would be preferable. Second, it has tried to show that revision of the use of the term would better expose two distinctive normative issues, and illustrated that claim by showing how some contributors to debates about ideal theory have gone wrong partly through not distinguishing them. Third, in exposing those two distinct normative issues, it has revealed a particular way in which ideal theory even under the more specific, revisionary definition will often be central to working out what to do in non-ideal circumstances. By clarifying the terms on which debates over ideal and non-ideal theory should take place, and highlighting the particular problems each deals with, it tries to clear the ground for turning to the actual problem, which is what to do in our non-ideal and often tragic circumstances.</p>

<body>
<p>It has become commonplace to criticize much of contemporary political theory as excessively ideal. Colin Farrelly, Charles W. Mills and Amartya Sen have all recently argued that because the assumptions it depends on when making prescriptions are not met in the real world, it is unable to provide us with practically useful guidance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474885111430611">1</xref></sup> Various attempts have been made to refute at least parts of this charge, for example by A. John Simmons, Zofia Stemplowska, Adam Swift and Laura Valentini.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474885111430611">2</xref></sup> However, like the critics I am aware of, the defences of ideal theory thus far seem to me to have mischaracterized ideal theory and so the debate over its importance is to a large degree taking place on misconceived grounds. While I agree with much of what defenders of ideal theory say, I think that their defences, like the attacks upon it, obscure much of what is valuable about it and the relation it stands in to non-ideal theory. In this paper, I argue for a more precise definition of ideal theory, returning to a conception that I think is not only the core of the original usage but more natural. This definition divides the field into ideal and non-ideal theory on the basis of the distinct normative problems they face, rather than their contingent relation to the situation we happen to face. It also makes it clear why, some of the time at least, we will need ideal theory to deal with the distinctive normative problems posed by our less-than-perfect world. The idea will be that non-ideal situations are often tragic because they necessarily involve not meeting all the demands that we should. Understanding how to navigate through that tragedy will often require understanding exactly which demands are not being met and so ideal theory, which specifies what it would take to perfect a given value or virtue.</p>
<p>The paper has three sections. In the first, I argue against the way in which the terminology seems to be most frequently used. This is neither the way in which it was used by Rawls, who seems to have been the first to give it a strict sense, nor particularly natural, given the meaning ‘ideal’ has in ordinary language. I also flesh out the way I think the term should be used and say a little about what I think the origins of its misuse are. In the second section, I argue that whatever terminology theorists opt to make standard, the sense in which I believe we should use the jargon of ideal and non-ideal theory helps to distinguish two distinct normative problems. In the third section, I lay out the circumstances in which ideal theory, under both my definition and its common usage, is likely to be useful in guiding action. The focus of this section will be on what I think are the tragic circumstances of non-ideal theory, but I will also situate what I say with respect to a number of existing critiques and defences of ideal theory.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1474885111430611"><title>What is ideal theory?</title>
<p>Although authors are not always very clear about exactly what ideal theory is, the general idea seems to be something like Zofia Stemplowska’s definition of it as theory which fails to produce ‘achievable and desirable’ policy recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474885111430611">3</xref></sup> That certainly would track the failure to generate practically useful guidance, since that failure would then define ideal theory. Yet this understanding of ideal theory seems to miss the point about it, mistaking ideal theory for a kind of utopianism. Ideals do not have to be in that sense utopian. A more conventionally Rawlsian understanding of ideal theory is more helpful because many theories which do not generate achievable and desirable policy recommendations are not best described as ideal. This is because there are a number of ways in which theories can fail to be practically relevant, some of which seem to have little to do with being ideal in the usual sense of the term. For example, it would seem a cruel joke to describe Hobbes’s theory of the justification of political authority as ideal yet, unless one thinks that our political authorities are either Leviathans or radically unstable, it has no direct practical implications for us.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474885111430611">4</xref></sup> Nor does that mean that it is a bad piece of theorizing, since what Hobbes says about what one should do in those circumstances may be right. One might make similar claims about Rousseau’s less dystopian state of nature. Isolated individuals, with very limited needs and no social life, might well have no obligations to each other. Nonetheless it, like Hobbes’s version, does not seem ideal. Although one might well be perfectly happy in it, the idea of humans as totally unreflective does not seem to track any sense of ideal as meaning desirable or perfect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474885111430611">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>That sense of ideal, of desirable or perfect, seems more natural than the sense of it as impractical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474885111430611">6</xref></sup> After all, ideals can be practical. That something is ideal does not mean it is unattainable. For example, it does not involve incoherence to say that some couple have an ideal marriage. To find that something being ideal meant that it was unachievable would be not only depressing but a discovery, and in no sense an entailment of it being an ideal. If ideals were definitionally impractical then what our ideals were could change from day to day as what was practical likewise changed. Rather than calling theories which do not generate achievable and desirable recommendations ideal, it would be preferable to say they were utopian or dystopian, depending on whether the theory is overly optimistic or pessimistic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474885111430611">7</xref></sup> It seems reasonable, then, to set aside the idea that ideal theory is characterized by failing to generate achievable and desirable policy recommendations, and turn instead to the idea of ideal theory as modelling perfection.</p>
<p>After all, that is how Rawls originally introduced the term: ideal theory is the theory of strict compliance because it is under strict compliance that we can tell what ‘a perfectly just society would be like’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474885111430611">8</xref></sup> The idea would seem to be that only a society in which the demands of justice were at least generally adhered to could possibly be perfectly just.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474885111430611">9</xref></sup> Any other society would have, by definition since the demands of justice were not generally adhered to, injustices in it. Similarly, unless there are unjust acts, then surely there cannot be a complaint about a society from the perspective of justice. As long as ought implies can and injustices ought, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, to be refrained from, for an injustice to exist, there must be some agent, individual or collective, who could refrain from committing it. If there was no agent who could refrain from committing the injustice, then there would be no one who ought, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, to refrain from committing it and hence no injustice. Strict compliance then defines the ideal theory of justice, and partial compliance the non-ideal theory of justice.</p>
<p>This is not, it has to be said, how Rawls uses the term even through the whole of <italic>Theory of Justice</italic>. When discussing possible limits on liberty there, he says that non-ideal theory has ‘two rather different subparts’, one dealing with ‘adjustments to natural limitations and historical contingencies’ and the ‘other of principles for meeting injustice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474885111430611">10</xref></sup> At least as far as justice goes, this seems a mistake. Either there is some act which is unjust, in which case there is an actor not complying with the demands of justice, or all actors are complying with the demands of justice, in which case there surely cannot by any injustice. Our responses to natural limitations and historical contingencies clearly can be just or unjust, and a theory of justice will have to say something about such responses. However, to complain that constraints on what we can do and achieve entirely beyond our control make it impossible for us to satisfy the demands of justice seems mistaken. Although we might rightly regret such constraints, they are not themselves directly a source of injustice.</p>
<p>Gopal Sreenivasan draws on Rawls to suggest that a lack of just background institutions is a separate source of non-ideal conditions from partial compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474885111430611">11</xref></sup> This also seems unhelpful. Unless the lack of just background institutions is something that some agent is culpable at the bar of justice for, then claiming that justice has not been fully realized seems to lack a rationale. Justice seems to be an ideal dealing with the way that agents relate to each other. It seems, for example, that it is only if individuals are not single unitary actors that they can be just or unjust to themselves. Given that justice specifies an ideal of interpersonal relations, it seems that perfecting it must depend on agents and their acts and so should be seen in terms of strict compliance with its demands. The ideal theory of other virtues, of course, may not be best characterized in these terms, since other virtues do not have the same structure. Courage, for example, seems like a radically individualistic virtue. No one else needs to be involved for me to be courageous. It would then be unhelpful to think of the ideal theory of courage in terms of strict compliance, because courage does not concern itself directly with specifying the terms on which agents interact. How to think about perfecting courage is not my task here though. As the titles of their articles show, Farrelly and Sen are, like others criticizing ideal theory, particularly concerned with justice. My argument is that, because it defines a situation in which all its demands are met and so perfects it, we should think about justice in terms of strict compliance.</p>
<p>Nor does this make justice a worryingly individualistic virtue. The properties of wholes and so of collectives, including institutions, do not have to be reducible to the properties of their individual members abstractly conceived. The individual parts of planes, after all, cannot fly. Equally, it is not clear that we would want to say that the actions, for example, of large transnational corporations or domestic legal systems were reducible to the individually considered actions of their members. Defining the ideal theory of justice in terms of strict compliance allows for the possibility that there may be demands of justice which bear on institutions and not on individuals, demands of justice which those institutions, in their capacity as actors over and above the actions of their members, can fail to comply with. Equally, that implies that which institutions exist may determine whether a situation involves injustice or not, since even institutions cannot act unjustly if they do not exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474885111430611">12</xref></sup> Nor does admitting that possibility commit me to the view that institutions have some metaphysically worrying existence independently of their members, in the way to which Hegel is sometimes supposed to have been committed. Planes do not have a metaphysically worrying existence independently of their parts yet, like institutions, have properties which their constituent parts do not. That it is possible that demands of justice bear on institutions and not only individuals, of course, does not mean that they do, but settling that question is not my purpose here.</p>
<p>Onora O’Neill’s account of idealization as assuming falsehoods seems to have been influential in leading theorists away from the Rawlsian understanding of ideal theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474885111430611">13</xref></sup> She contrasts idealization with abstraction, where that is understood as ignoring facts, and has persistently attacked Rawls for using idealizations rather than abstractions. Stemplowska says of strict compliance theory that it ‘is ideal in the sense that it assumes an idealized (untrue) version of reality: in the actual (nonideal) world, people do not always comply with what is required of them’, and is in other ways clearly influenced by O’Neill.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474885111430611">14</xref></sup> Farrelly seems to have a similar conception of ideal theory to Stemplowska – for him, the less relevant to contemporary concerns something is, the more ideal it is – and also invokes O’Neill in his critique of Rawls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474885111430611">15</xref></sup> This is natural enough, since a theory which designed for conditions which do not obtain will usually not apply in those we are faced with. Hence theories idealized in this sense will be ideal in the typical pejorative sense, as they will not provide achievable and desirable recommendations for the here and now.</p>
<p>As we have already seen though, a theory’s practical irrelevance can be not because it is over-optimistic, but because it is massively pessimistic, or neither optimistic nor pessimistic but just radically different. Idealizations in O’Neill’s sense, even though they involve moving towards an ideal in her critique of Rawls,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474885111430611">16</xref></sup> do not have to do so in any broader sense. I can assume things which are false but would be terrible or just radically different, and I will making an idealization in O’Neill’s sense. To put it another way, whilst it is typically sufficient for some piece of theorizing to be an idealization in O’Neill’s sense that it is a piece of ideal theory in my sense, idealizations in O’Neill’s sense do not have to be pieces of ideal theory in my sense. There are plenty of idealizations which have nothing to do with ideal theory – the idealization of what we should do or even what justice in particular would require if human lifespans were on average only a day long, for example. In such a case it seems a mistake to describe what I am doing as ideal theory. Usually we do not think of ideals as having much to do with assuming falsehoods in general but instead as being related in some way to perfection, which does not necessarily involve different circumstances from those we actually face.</p>
<p>Obviously, we could use ‘ideal theory’ to refer to pieces of theory which did not generate achievable and desirable policy recommendations, and use some other vocabulary to refer to ideal theory in my sense. However, doing so would seem to obscure a perfectly sensible use of that term by confusing it with another use of it for which there already exists another, widely understood and accepted, set of terms. Ideal theory is not the theory of utopias and dystopias; that, unsurprisingly, is the province of utopian and dystopian theory. Ideal theory and utopian and dystopian theory are not necessarily supposed to do the same thing, and treating them as analogous will tend to lead to confusion. Part of the point of utopian theory may be that it is unrealizable, for example, whereas to find that an ideal is unrealizable would not only be a discovery, but a depressing one. That means that it may be a problem that an ideal is beyond the reach of any conceivable human beings in a way that it would not necessarily be for a utopia, just as it is not obviously a problem for a dystopia that no human society could ever be that cruel or brutish.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474885111430611"><title>Dividing the field into distinctive problems</title>
<p>More, there is a further and here more important consideration in favour of using the term the way I have argued for here. If ideal theory is simply theory which does not produce achievable and desirable policy prescriptions, then non-ideal theory is any theory which does produce achievable and desirable policy prescriptions. Understanding ideal theory as the theory of perfection and in particular in the case of justice of strict compliance, however, reveals a feature of non-ideal theory that is veiled by thinking of it as any theory which produces practically useful policy guidance. If the ideal theory of justice is the theory of strict compliance with its demands, then its non-ideal theory is the theory of non-compliance with those demands, the theory of what to do when not everyone does as they ought to. Under this definition, justice’s non-ideal theory has a distinctive normative problem to deal with, rather than being a categorization which depends on what the world happens to look like at a given time. Accepting that this applies only to the non-ideal theory of justice, which is what I will mean by non-ideal theory hereafter,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474885111430611">17</xref></sup> this is the sense in which non-ideal theory can be tragic.</p>
<p>A situation of non-compliance is one where someone is not doing what they ought to. That means that either someone is going to lack something they are entitled to, or that someone else is going to have to pick up the slack by doing more than they ought to be required to. Failing to pick up the slack will, though, often leave you complicit in the wrong. If political institutions I obey and benefit from wrong someone, then I seem to be complicit in that wrong unless I have either mitigated the injustice, distanced myself from the institution or either of these would have been too costly for me. If someone lacks something they are entitled to, then they have been done an injustice, and if the only way someone can avoid being complicit in an injustice is through supererogation, then they have also been done an injustice. There may be some resistance to the thought that complicity is a harm, but consider Bernard Williams’s ‘Jim and the Indians’ case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474885111430611">18</xref></sup> There, Jim is confronted by the insistence of a military officer, Pedro, that he either shoot one of a group of captives or the rest will be shot by Pedro’s men. Jim is surely wronged by Pedro by being involved in the deaths of the Indians, more wronged than if he merely witnessed the killings. Presumably this has something to do with Jim’s consequent responsibility for whatever deaths result; the reason Williams thought it raised the question of integrity is surely because of that personal connection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474885111430611">19</xref></sup> Non-compliance not only then treats people unjustly but often also imposes, to a greater or lesser degree, complicity in those injustices on some of those who might have acted to prevent or mitigate them. Together, those two features will often make non-ideal theory tragic in the sense that it necessarily deals with injustice.</p>
<p>Thinking of ideal theory as impractical and non-ideal theory as practical obscures this, since it draws attention not to <italic>why</italic> a theory might be desirable but simply that it is. Surely it is helpful if our meta-theoretical distinctions divide up our field into distinctive problems. It is helpful to distinguish, for example, distributive and rectificatory justice, and would not be helpful to divide up their distinctive problems on the grounds of whether the world presently calls for action on the basis of certain principles instead. Even arguing about whether one is prior to the other depends on accepting that they are in principle different questions and so should initially be approached differently. Dividing that field up into action-guiding and not-action-guiding theories would disguise the ways in which distributive and rectificatory justice are and ought to be different, hence likely leading to mistakes and confusion. Doing so in ideal and non-ideal theory I think does the same.</p>
<p>Some might think that this overstates the case, that a little non-compliance presents us with no need to do very much differently from when everyone does as they ought to. That some people do not do as they ought to is not something that the ideal theorist has to worry about, since it does not really matter if some people have to pick up a little slack or some others get a little less than they should. Laura Valentini, for example, seems to think that Rawls’s domestic theory of justice is in some sense action-guiding for us even though we do not have full compliance with our own institutions, let alone those that his theory prescribes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474885111430611">20</xref></sup> It is of course perfectly possible that non-compliance is not troubling – small-scale, economically insignificant tax evasion by a few people would not presumably require an otherwise compliant set of institutions to give up on the difference principle, for example – but it is prima facie troubling and requires investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474885111430611">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>For example, whether or not one ought to abide by a maxim of honesty in a society with a significant minority who reject it is a different question from whether one ought to abide by it in a society in which everyone else is always honest, since the burdens and effects on others of doing so are different in the two cases. Whether one ought to be honest when others are not is not answered by only investigating whether one can lie when others do not. That one has shown that honesty is an appropriate response when others are honest does not mean that one has shown that it is when they are not. Yet theories like Rawls’s do not simply prescribe one principle but rather a set of principles, each with various requirements, which are justified together and so are more complicated to transfer from situations of full compliance to those of partial compliance than single principles. What if, because of the hostility of the wealthy to it, the only way to enforce the difference principle would be to restrict political rights? The lexical priority of the first principle over the second seems best understood as a feature of ideal theory and so may not apply here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474885111430611">22</xref></sup> The costs imposed by departures from the two principles are not even alike, as they would presumably be in the case of one principle like that of the maxim of honesty. What should be done in these cases, I submit, cannot be read straightforwardly off the prescriptions of the ideal theory. Different normative problems are raised, and we need different pieces of theorizing to find answers to them.</p>
<p>Valentini’s willingness to defend Rawls’s domestic theory’s applicability here is odd because she attacks his international theory for what seems to be exactly the same failing. She criticizes <italic>The Law of Peoples</italic> on the grounds it is not applicable in a world where, for example, states in the developed world support international institutions which systematically undermine the ability of states in the developing world to provide adequate levels of support for their citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474885111430611">23</xref></sup> The problem here is that non-compliance with the principles Rawls prescribes means that the fair background which acting on Rawls’s prescriptions would sustain and against which they would make sense is absent. All other agents acting according to the principles makes it make sense for any given agent to act according to the principles, but in circumstances of non-compliance the principles are inappropriate. When others do not do as they ought to, there are injustices to which those principles do not properly respond. This seems identical to the problem Rawls’s domestic theory faces in a world where we clearly do not have the institutions that theory prescribes and so the background against which its principles would make sense is similarly absent. Distinguishing between the two theories on grounds of inapplicability in the actually-existing world then seems a mistake.</p>
<p>In this sense, Farrelly and Sen are right to say that a lot of contemporary political philosophy is not directly action-guiding and Valentini is wrong to claim that they have mistakenly attacked Rawls’s domestic theory. This is despite the fact that Farrelly is wrong about why Rawls’s theory fails. Farrelly claims that Rawls’s theory fails because the endorsement of lexical priority over other primary social goods for the basic rights and liberties is blind to the cost of rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474885111430611">24</xref></sup> In some situations, he maintains, it would be a mistake to assign priority to those rights. Rawls does not disagree; this is the point of the general conception of justice which does not prioritize liberty over other primary social goods. He simply maintains that we are in the conditions under which the special conception, which does prioritize it, is appropriate.</p>
<p>Farrelly argues against this assumption by claiming that ‘satisfying the equal basic liberties principle… could be a never-ending aim’ because ‘the state will not be able to make rights absolute in the way [it requires]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474885111430611">25</xref></sup> This requires, though, that <italic>basic</italic> rights are <italic>total</italic>, that having a basic right to personal security requires absolute protection against any threats. That, though, is generally implausible for at least two reasons. First, the basic liberties are required to protect the two moral powers, but a tiny risk of physical harm by others does not pose a threat to my pursuit of my conception of the good. Second, absolute liberties would clearly conflict with each other. An absolute right to privacy is incompatible with an absolute protection against violations of personal security, for example. Independently, it seems likely that, under full compliance, the costs of rights would anyway be lower. Farrelly’s argument, even if it succeeded on its own terms, would fall foul of the way it assumes that a theory designed for full compliance can be criticized for its failings under partial compliance – although it is worth bearing in mind that over three-quarters of the costs he quotes for the protection of American citizens’ negative rights are made up by the US defence department budget, surely largely tangentially connected with the protection of anyone’s negative rights.</p>
<p>Both Farrelly’s attack on Rawls’s theory and Valentini’s defence of it, then, seem to fail because in failing to distinguish properly between theories meant for full compliance and those meant for partial compliance, they do not see which claims they need to be able to defend. Defining ideal theory the way that I argue we should would presumably have avoided these mistakes, since it draws attention directly to the specific normative issues that ideal and non-ideal theory deal with. Seeing that what is appropriate under conditions of full compliance may not be appropriate under those of partial compliance would avoid either defending it as appropriate or attacking it for failing to be so. Either way, whether we call the theory of partial compliance non-ideal theory does not make any difference to whether it has a particular problem. Non-compliance is often tragic, regardless of whether a theory is defined as non-ideal. Further, even if we use non-ideal theory to describe theory which is practically oriented, much of that theory will be non-ideal theory in my sense as well. Often what makes theories of full compliance inapplicable here and now is that we do not live in societies where everyone abides by the rules, let alone the rules that political theorists would like them to. Practically oriented theories for us here and now are often going to involve dealing with the problem of non-compliance. Because of that, they are usually going to be tragic, in the sense that I think non-ideal theories can be, because usually someone somewhere is not doing what they ought to.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474885111430611"><title>Why does this matter?</title>
<p>One might wonder what turns on this. First, much contemporary use of the jargon of ideal and non-ideal theory departs from a more sensible use which would categorize the two according to the problems they deal with and so obscures the distinctive character of their problems; second, even if we do not adopt that more sensible distinction, as long as we want to properly orient ourselves when acting politically, we are still going to have to deal with at least one of those two distinctive problems. What bearing does any of that have on whether or not we should do ideal theory in the sense in which it is usually pejoratively used?</p>
<p>Note that it is clear that ideal theory in that pejorative sense does not fail as such. Hobbes’s theory is not <italic>false</italic> in virtue of being inappropriate for guiding our action here and now, although of course it may be false for other reasons, and uninteresting or pointless for yet further reasons. Sen and Farrelly are simply wrong to claim that theories which do not guide action here and now somehow fail. Hobbes’s theory may well be quite right about what we should do in the circumstances his theory talks about, whether those circumstances are the ones we face or not. That question, not the question of whether we are in those circumstances, settles the question of the truth-value and so validity of Hobbes’s and any other normative theory. That we are not presently on the surface of Venus does not make theories of what it is like fail; likewise, that we are not presently in Hobbes’s state of nature does not make theories of how we ought to behave in it fail, whatever other virtues and vices such theories may have.</p>
<p>Given this, it is unclear why Valentini thinks that the first premise of her trilemma, ‘[a]ny sound theory of justice is action-guiding’, holds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474885111430611">26</xref></sup> Independently of her failure to properly distinguish which theories are in fact action-guiding here and now, it is wrong to claim that sound theories are action-guiding. It is therefore also wrong to distinguish between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ idealizations on the basis of whether they prevent the theories which use them from being action-guiding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474885111430611">27</xref></sup> Rawls’s domestic and international theories are similarly placed as far as their capacity to guide action in the world here and now goes, and neither fails in virtue of lacking that capacity. They may of course fail for other reasons, but in both cases their assumptions about the behaviour of relevant agents, which mean that they are not able to guide action here and now, do not threaten their soundness. Distinguishing the idealizations they make on that particular basis is then a mistake.</p>
<p>Her discussion of the fact-sensitivity of theory, which echoes Farrelly’s, in this regard is a further unnecessary diversion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474885111430611">28</xref></sup> She claims that whether a theory regards action-guidingness as a requirement of validity depends on whether it is fact-sensitive in G. A. Cohen’s sense. Fact-sensitivity in Cohen’s sense, though, has nothing to do with action-guidingness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474885111430611">29</xref></sup> Fact-sensitivity in Cohen’s sense depends on whether a fact is invoked in support of a principle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474885111430611">30</xref></sup> ‘Never lie’ is an action-guiding principle, yet it is not clear that there is any requirement to invoke facts in its support as such. Equally, invoking facts about the likely consequences of doing so in support of the principle, ‘when confronted with genocidal extraterrestrials, resist them with all available force’, does not make the principle’s soundness depend on whether we are presently confronted with such a threat. What Cohen calls rules of regulation may or may not be action-guiding<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474885111430611">31</xref></sup> and may or may not have facts invoked in their support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474885111430611">32</xref></sup> There is then no reason to connect action-guidingness and fact-sensitivity.</p>
<p>That a lack of action-guidingness is not fatal for a theory of justice does not mean there are no questions about its capacity to provide practically useful guidance in the here and now. Given that theories generated under a certain set of assumptions are likely to be inappropriate for guiding action here and now, we need to ask ourselves whether we should bother generating such theories. Ought we to think about what our political institutions ought to look like under the assumption of strict compliance and reasonable levels of material wealth, for example, even if we may never achieve those conditions? After all, that there is a truth about the number of blades of grass on my lawn does not mean that I ought to get down on my hands and knees and count them all; claims do not have to lack truth-value for there to be little point in pursuing knowledge of them.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the potential tragedy of non-ideal theory suggests that we ought to do full-compliance theory, even if we think we are very unlikely to ever achieve full compliance. Thus, in the sense that I use ideal theory, I think we should do ideal theory. The reason that we should do ideal theory in the sense of full-compliance theory is because, without doing it, we will often not be able to understand if and to what extent non-ideal theory is tragic. In not understanding that tragedy, we will tend to make mistakes about what is actually desirable in the circumstances of tragedy. One of the important normative features of those circumstances is their tragedy, and being unable to grasp that feature will tend to generate mistakes about how to respond to it. Unless we know how people are being mistreated, then we are likely to continue to mistreat them and fail to take the steps we are obliged to in order to rectify their mistreatment.</p>
<p>There is a fairly simple sense in which this is true of ‘ideal’ theory in general, as has been fairly widely observed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474885111430611">33</xref></sup> There is extensive disagreement about what is and is not just.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474885111430611">34</xref></sup> In order to know what we should and should not do, at least some of that disagreement has to be resolved. For example, Sen claims ‘instituting a system of public health insurance in the United States that does not leave tens of millions of Americans without any guarantee of medical attention at all [would be] an advancement of justice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474885111430611">35</xref></sup> That is a controversial claim, with which – judging by their willingness to vote for candidates who actively campaign against it – apparently tens of millions of Americans disagree. Resolving that disagreement may well involve theorizing which assumes things which would make the results inapplicable, because an obvious strategy for doing so is to abstract away from sources of disagreement. Doing that allows us to isolate considerations relevant to that particular issue, which however do not have to be all the considerations relevant given all the issues facing us. Perhaps some opponents of such a guarantee think that people can be held responsible for failing to provide such a guarantee themselves. Some examples about free choice amongst a set of options not legitimating the set of options may be helpful here whether or not they answer all possible questions about the justice of requiring provision of a guarantee here and now – like whether doctors have legitimate expectations to their present high rewards, for example.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this vindicates full-compliance theory in particular. It vindicates theory which assumes things which mean that it is not directly practically relevant – although only such theory when it answers an existing disagreement about a situation’s justice or injustice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474885111430611">36</xref></sup> Nor does it vindicate that theory in cases where there is not disagreement about whether there is injustice. Presumably we do not need to show that straightforward chattel slavery is unjust any more. So then it might seem that we do not need to do full-compliance theory in particular, or indeed theory which is inapplicable, unless there is disagreement about whether some situation is unjust. That would be wrong. Disagreement about whether some situation is unjust is not the only need to which theory which is not directly applicable answers. We do not need to know just where injustice occurs, but often also how extensive it is and how a just society would avoid it. This is because in order to respond fully to non-compliance, we need to understand whether and to what extent it is tragic; what exactly is the injustice that is being inflicted on someone, and what exactly is the loss compared to their rightful entitlements that others would have to bear in order to put it right? That requires that we know what they would have in a perfect world.</p>
<p>Consider this example. Imagine an education system which allowed the wealthy to buy their children’s way into transparently superior schools and to thus unjustly advantage them in their possession of various positional goods. I am sure that this system is as a whole unjust, yet I know that the relevant authorities, for whatever reason, will not put an end to it and that, as long as it exists, some parents are likely to take advantage of it. I am wealthy enough – for argument’s sake, let us say not obviously unjustly – to send my children to the superior schools. Should I do so? They will be unjustly disadvantaged by not attending the schools, yet in avoiding that injustice for them, I would be perpetuating an unjust system even if the advantages my children got would add nothing to the disadvantage of the children who did not attend such schools.</p>
<p>Although it seems unlikely that there is a single simple algorithm for converting our duties in full compliance to duties in non-compliance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474885111430611">37</xref></sup> surely it matters how much injustice must be suffered in order to rectify or avoid complicity in injustice inflicted on others. If my children will have a slight decrease in their educational advantage from the level demanded by justice by attending the state schools but on average children suffer enormously because of the parallel private system, then the case for sending my children to the state schools is stronger. They do not lose out importantly, and avoid complicity in injustice even if they do not directly benefit others. If the position is reversed, and my children will suffer extensively in comparison to their just holdings whereas typically children do not, then it is less likely that a duty exists to move towards the just system by abstaining from taking advantage of the unjust one.</p>
<p>Note that what matters here is the position in a just system. Slave-owners are not entitled to the benefits of being a slave-owner, and so it is irrelevant that they lose out significantly by ceasing to be slave-owners. Likewise, it does not matter what educational advantages my children would get in the unjust system, but rather what their loss is from the just system. Note though that losses from the position one would hold in a just system can be imposed. Someone, somewhere, is going to get less than they are entitled to, and so simply complaining of an injustice against what one would get under full compliance is not enough to avoid losses. That is an unavoidable feature of the situation, at least for those imposing the cost. That of course does not mean that any loss from the position one would hold in a just world can be imposed, but equally we should be aware that costs which would be transparently unjust under full compliance may be just when that is absent. In her <italic>Compliance, Complicity, and the Nature of Non-Ideal Conditions</italic>, Tamar Schapiro is rightly careful to avoid judging that Edmund Exley’s killing of Dudley Smith towards the end of the film <italic>L.A. Confidential</italic> is either acceptable or unacceptable. As she points out, Smith has massively corrupted the LA police department, murdering or ordering the murders of mobsters, civilians and fellow police officers alike for enormous personal gain, and Exley has every reason to believe that, unless he dies, he will carry on doing so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474885111430611">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Central to Schapiro’s unwillingness to judge Exley’s act as wrong is his complicity in Smith’s acts. It is because Exley is also a policeman, and has had the institution he is committed to and so his professional life turned into a sham by Smith’s subversion of it that we should be careful when judging whether his act of homicide is murder or not. Someone who was less complicit in Smith’s crimes, and would not be faced with helping him go unpunished in the way it is clear that Exley would, would have less reason prevent him from continuing them. Thus, the question is not only what good it would do those suffering for me to not be complicit in the injustice against them, but whether I can reasonably be party to that injustice. One does not have to wait for boycotts to be large enough to end or significantly impact on an injustice for it to be morally required to participate in them. The demand to keep one’s hands clean has weight when it is only that demand, and not also to help the victims of the injustice one is steering clear of responsibility for.</p>
<p>This shows that a personally focused account of duties in non-ideal circumstances can account for our duties to foster justice, as A. John Simmons rightly points out Liam Murphy’s more collective view struggles to do.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474885111430611">39</xref></sup> One of the oddities of Murphy’s view is that there is no clear analogy for the situation that Exley faces in <italic>L. A. Confidential</italic> in ideal theory, and so no obvious sense in which he could perform the appropriate fraction of his duty in ideal theory. He faces a problem which definitionally cannot exist in ideal theory, that of an agent actively committing injustices. Focusing instead on the departures from a just world that one is complicit in and would have to bear incorporates concerns about duties to foster justice directly in calculations of what actors should do. These departures will help define when one has a positive duty to foster just conditions. If I can reduce injustice without denying myself any of my just entitlements, then presumably I should. If I am complicit in some injustice, then <italic>ceteris paribus</italic> if I cannot disassociate myself from it I must act so as to mitigate it. Positive duties to foster justice then are going to depend at least in part on the consideration which my understanding of non-ideal theory identifies as particularly relevant.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be wrong to claim that we will always need a fully worked-out ideal theory to know how to respond to situations of partial compliance. If I am a wealthy doctor with lots of free time in the United States, then, subject to the obvious provisos, I should volunteer at an otherwise understaffed clinic to provide free, basic healthcare for the poor. Although one might need to do various bits of ideal<italic>izing</italic> theory to show this, one does not need a fully worked-out ideal theory to do so, since one does not need a fully worked-out ideal theory to show that the poor have a right to free, basic healthcare or that the doctor is likely presently one of those benefiting from the denial of that right. That granted, in order to know in more detail what the doctor should do – how much time they should give up; how to divide their time between ameliorating the effects of injustice and campaigning against the institutions which perpetrate it; how to ameliorate and campaign – we may well require ideal theory.</p>
<p>Nor is this case particularly complicated. Depending on one’s role in a political system or the challenges one’s political system faces, the complexity and tragedy of non-ideal theory may be much starker. Imagine I am a progressive legislator in the United States. I understand that it is politically impossible to get a perfectly just medical system, let alone a perfectly just political system <italic>tout court</italic>, legislated into effect. Whatever medical reform is passed will not be perfect and so I need to know which imperfect medical system involves the least injustice, as well as how much political capital to expend fighting this injustice and so not fighting others. That will almost certainly require an extensive ideal theory in order to assess the injustice of various costs imposed by the medical systems available, their interactions with other unjust institutions, on whom those injustices fall and so on. Likewise, if our doctor is now faced with the question of working in either one of two racially segregated and differentially funded clinics for the poor, where they will by treating workplace injuries allow local employers to continue to be negligent about the safety of their employers, the question becomes more difficult. Justice, after all, whatever Sen may say, is not really like height.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474885111430611">40</xref></sup> It is complex and subject to controversy, whereas everyone agrees that if I add a stone to the top of a pile of stones it will make it taller. It requires sophisticated theorizing, and often, even when it is not directly practically applicable, sophisticated theorizing that should be done under the rubric of what I describe as ideal theory.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1474885111430611" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has had three aims. First, it has argued that the present use of ‘ideal theory’ is unhelpful, and that an earlier and apparently more natural use would be preferable. Instead of understanding ideal theory as any theory which does not generate directly action-guiding principles, it would be better to understand it as theory which attempts to characterize the perfection of some value or virtue. In particular, ideal theories of justice should be understood as theories of justice which specify the content of duties of justice when everyone is acting justly. Otherwise, someone somewhere would be being treated unjustly and so justice would not have been provided to all.</p>
<p>Second, it has tried to show that its revision of the use of the term would better expose two distinctive normative issues, and illustrated that claim by showing how some contributors to debates about ideal theory have gone wrong partly through not distinguishing them. Understanding ideal theory as modelling perfection, and therefore the ideal theory of justice on strict compliance, helps reveal the way in which partial compliance often generates a dilemma for well-intentioned agents. Those agents will either have to sacrifice themselves or others to third parties’ injustice. Appreciating the significance of this dilemma makes what is at stake in defending ideal theory clearer, since it is not supposed to be action-guiding in circumstances where not all its prescriptions are being followed by all actors.</p>
<p>Third, in exposing those two distinct normative issues, it has exposed a particular way in which ideal theory even under the more specific, revisionary definition will often be central to working out what to do in non-ideal circumstances. Agents will often face the kind of tragic choice the revisionary definition helps reveal in non-ideal circumstances. In order to understand that tragedy and so respond to it adequately, they will need to know what entitlements are being violated and by whom. This, quite apart from the general clarificatory role of ideal theory, will mean that it will often serve a valuable role in guiding action even when agents should not act directly according to its prescriptions.</p>
<p>As a whole, the paper has tried to clarify the terms on which debates over ideal and non-ideal theory should take place, and in doing so, tried to highlight the particular difficulties which each deals with. By tracking a normatively relevant distinction between the circumstances each is designed for, my account of the difference between ideal and non-ideal theory meets, whatever else its virtues, the desiderata of dividing the field up into distinctive problems and so illuminating them. In doing so, I hope it has cleared and prepared the ground for turning to what is surely the most pressing problem, that of what to do in our non-ideal circumstances.</p>

Amartya Sen (2006) ‘What do we Want from a Theory of Justice?’<italic>, Journal of Philosophy</italic> 103(5): 215–38. It has been suggested to me that Mills is not making this complaint. While his complaints may differ in some respects from Farrelly and Sen’s, it is clear that he thinks the problem with ideal theory as it is commonly done is that it fails to provide appropriate normative guidance in the here and now. For example, he says, having summarized what he claims are its failings, ‘[w]hy should anyone think that abstaining from theorizing about oppression and its consequences is the best way to bring about an end to oppression?’ (p. 172). The failure to bring about an end to oppression, i.e. to provide appropriate guidance here and now where there is oppression, is the criterion by which ideal theory fails. Hence I group Mills with Farrelly and Sen. My argument can be seen as linking his ‘ideal-as-normative’ with his ‘ideal-as-idealized-description’ (pp. 166–7).</p></fn>

However, they are the exception. Farrelly e.g. says that what is wrong with ideal theory is that because ‘the collective aspiration to implement the conclusions of a theory would not result in any noticeable increase in the justness of one’s society… it fails as a normative theory’ (Farrelly (n. 1), p. 845; emphasis suppressed).</p></fn>

It is irrelevant even if that is wrong, though, since the usage of science is not the ordinary language usage. This is the point of the marriage example.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn12-1474885111430611"><label>12</label><p>There seem to be two relevant cases here. First, there may be institutions whose existence is discretionary from the perspective of justice but which bring duties of justice with them once they exist. Federalism may be such a case, for example. In such a case, there is neither a duty to create the institution nor a duty to observe the constraints which would apply to it if it existed. Second, there may be institutions which are dependent on certain technologies. For example, a requirement to ensure control over delegated authority may depend in part on the technology available to pass information quickly over long distances. In such cases, duties related to the institution will depend on the availability of the relevant technology.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn19-1474885111430611"><label>19</label><p>Obviously, the sort of wrong that complicity involves will depend both on the injustice and the connection to the injustice. Although I think Tamar Schapiro’s (n. 3) suggestion that non-compliance makes us into tools of evil by making a mockery of our participation in a practice is promising, it fails to cover cases where the person made complicit and the perpetrator of injustice do not share a practice, as I think Jim and Pedro do not.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn20-1474885111430611"><label>20</label><p>Valentini (n. 2). As far as Rawls goes, Valentini also ignores the surely crucial assumption that societies’ inhabitants live out their entire lives in them. His aim was to ‘formulate a reasonable conception of justice for the basic structure of society conceived… as a closed system isolated from other societies’ (Rawls (n. 8), p. 8). Without this assumption, the question of the voluntariness of the institutions citizens share would be more difficult to avoid.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn21-1474885111430611"><label>21</label><p>This of course implies that not all non-ideal theory presents us with tragic choice; it may not require us to do anything other than we would normally do, either because the situation is close enough to the ideal one, or perhaps because the sacrifice required to ameliorate the wrong is one that no one could reasonably expect. However, without ideal theory it is difficult to see how we could know which these cases were.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn22-1474885111430611"><label>22</label><p>Rawls expresses different views at different places about this. See Rawls (n. 8), e.g. pp. 243–51 and 541–8. In the second of those two sections, the case for the priority of liberty depends on full compliance, since it depends on the role of liberty in providing a secure sense of self-worth in a society where one already has enough. In the first, however, it does not: the only grounds that are admitted are ones of a greater liberty for all or for those denied an equal liberty. Massive deprivation, however, is not seriously considered, and given the role of the general conception, it seems plausible that it would allow for limits on liberty. Such limits could easily be equally imposed, after all.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn36-1474885111430611"><label>36</label><p>Thus, I do not go as far either as Rawls or Cohen in saying that ‘ideal theory… provides… the <italic>only</italic> basis for the systematic grasp of these more pressing problems’ (Rawls (n. 8), p. 9; emphasis added) or ‘rules of regulation <italic>necessarily</italic> lack ultimacy: they cannot tell us how to evaluate the effects by reference to which they themselves are to be evaluated’ (Cohen (n. 31), pp. 265–6; emphasis altered). Sen is right that ideal theory is not necessary or sufficient for judgements about justice in the here-and-now. Plenty of things that are not necessary or sufficient for some <italic>x</italic> contribute to that <italic>x</italic> though: a loving sexual relationship may not be a necessary or sufficient condition of a good life, but it would be foolish to deny that lives are generally made better by such relationships.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn37-1474885111430611"><label>37</label><p>Murphy’s claim that one should do the appropriate fraction of the full-compliance duty is, apart from the failing I later discuss, sometimes overdemanding and sometimes nothing like enough because of thresholds in the usefulness and costliness of action. Liam Murphy (2000) <italic>Moral Demands in Nonideal Theory</italic>. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Although his claim is strictly made about duties of beneficence, he believes these are the only duties which call for collective action. This is surely implausible. Duties to respect bodily integrity e.g. surely also call for collective action. If you physically attack me, then I am entitled to respond with force I would otherwise not be entitled to. That has nothing to do with benevolence, yet my duties change depending on how you act.</p></fn>
