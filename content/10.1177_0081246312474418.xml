<abstract>
<p>The concurrent criterion-related validity of the Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES-SR) was examined in a cross-sectional study of 719 secondary school students attending a high school in Durban, South Africa. For purposes of analysis, exposure to complex developmental trauma was defined as exposure to either chronic (&gt;1 month) and/or multiple incidents (5+ types) of interpersonal victimisation prior to the age of 18 years. A series of discriminant analyses indicated that 12 of the 45 items on the SIDES-SR (27%) did not significantly discriminate individuals who had been exposed to complex developmental trauma from those who had not, with the removal of these 12 items from the scale having no significant impact on estimates of the concurrent validity, sensitivity, or specificity of the SIDES-SR. These findings suggest that the SIDES-SR may be characterised by some degree of construct over-representation when applied to South African samples, with further research being indicated in order to not only replicate the present findings but also address the issue of construct under-representation in the South African context.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, there has been an emerging consensus that a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) fails to adequately capture the constellation of symptoms associated with chronic developmental trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0081246312474418">Courtois &amp; Ford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474418">D’Andrea, Ford, Stolbach, Spinazzola, &amp; van der Kolk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0081246312474418">J.

Following field trials for the fourth edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246312474418">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>), this constellation of symptoms was included in <italic>DSM-IV</italic> as ‘associated features’ of PTSD, with these associated features including problems with behavioural and affective dysregulation, dissociation, somatic complaints, self-perceptions and/or self-efficacy, interpersonal relationships, and/or spiritual alienation. Although various terms have been used to describe these traumatic sequelae (e.g., <italic>type II trauma</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0081246312474418">Terr, 1991</xref>], <italic>complex PTSD</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0081246312474418">J.

<p>Findings from both clinical and research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0081246312474418">Cloitre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0081246312474418">Ford &amp; Courtois, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0081246312474418">J.

<p>Although a variety of psychometric instruments are available to assess specific symptoms of CDT (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081246312474418">Briere &amp; Spinazzola, 2009</xref>), only one instrument has been developed to assess the full constellation of CDT symptoms. Developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474418">Pelcovitz et al. (1997)</xref>, the Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES) is a rationally derived 48-item instrument designed to assess symptoms associated with exposure to chronic developmental trauma. Items for the SIDES were derived from a comprehensive review of the literature on reactions to extreme stress, with the face validity of items being assessed by approximately 50 experts in the field.</p>
<p>Identified items were subsequently formulated by Judith Herman into a 48-item measure that assesses seven broad domains: (1) alterations in regulation of affect and impulses, (2) alterations in attention or concentration, (3) alterations in self-perceptions, (4) alterations in perceptions of the perpetrator, (5) alterations in relationships with others, (6) somatisation, and (7) alterations in systems of meaning. For purposes of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> field trials, items were organised into a structured interview that assessed both lifetime and current symptoms in each of the seven domains (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474418">Pelcovitz et al., 1997</xref>). Cut-off points for domain endorsement were established using chi-square analyses, which were used to identify items that significantly discriminated survivors of interpersonal violence from survivors of disaster, with the judgement of three experienced researchers being used to determine which subscales were necessary for scale endorsement.</p>
<p>As a result of both sporadic endorsement and low levels of internal consistency (<italic>α</italic> = .53), a decision was made during the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> field trials to drop domain IV (alterations in perceptions of the perpetrator), resulting in a 45-item, six-domain scale (the SIDES-R), with the SIDES-SR being a self-administered version of the SIDES-R based on equivalent item content.</p>
<p>In the original validation sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474418">Pelcovitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0081246312474418">Roth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0081246312474418">van der Kolk et al., 2005</xref>), the SIDES-R demonstrated high levels of inter-rater reliability (<italic>κ</italic> = .81), acceptable levels of internal consistency (full scale = .96; subscales = .76 to .90), and evidence of concurrent criterion-related validity in the sense that SIDES-R scores were found to be positively associated with a history of chronic developmental trauma. Consistent with the researcher’s predictions, SIDES-R scores were also found to be associated with a younger age at time of first victimisation and with exposure to more chronic forms of interpersonal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0081246312474418">van der Kolk et al., 2005</xref>). These findings were, however, based on estimates of lifetime, as opposed to current, symptomatology, and as such, obtained SIDES-R scores may not reflect a constellation of symptoms that were present at any one time.</p>
<p>Subsequent studies have provided evidence of the convergent and discriminant validity of the SIDES-R. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0081246312474418">Zlotnick and Pearlstein’s (1997)</xref> analysis of selected SIDES-R subscales (Affective and Behavioural Dysregulation, Dissociation, Alterations in Self-Perceptions, and Somatisation) in a sample of 74 sexual abuse survivors, each subscale was found to be significantly correlated with scores obtained on validated self-report measures designed to measure the same construct (convergent validity) but not significantly correlated with scores on a measure of narcissism (divergent validity). Although this study has the advantage of having been based on measures of current (rather than lifetime) functioning, study findings need to be treated with some caution due to a reliance on a relatively small and unrepresentative sample (i.e., 74 sexual abuse survivors who qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD).</p>
<p>The rationally derived six-factor structure of the SIDES-R has not, however, been supported in subsequent studies. In a survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0081246312474418">Scoboria, Ford, Lin, and Frisman (2008)</xref> of adult trauma survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 231), a five-factor model was identified (Demoralisation, Somatic Dysregulation, Anger Dysregulation, Risk/Self-harm, and Altered Sexuality). This five-factor solution provided a good fit in confirmatory factor analysis conducted among incarcerated adults (<italic>n</italic> = 447) with the authors reporting low to high internal consistency for the 20-item revised scale (Cronbach’s α: full scale = .87, subscales = .64 to .80). Validity analyses of the revised scale in the incarcerated sample indicated that the scale had adequate concurrent, convergent, and divergent validity.</p>
<p>Attempts to explore the validity of the SIDES-R in non-Western countries have been few and far between. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0081246312474418">Weine et al.’s (1998)</xref> study of 24 survivors of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the SIDES-R yielded relatively low estimates of trauma-related personality change, leading the authors to conclude that the SIDES-R may not be sensitive to communal traumas such as genocide. These conclusions do, however, need to be treated with caution given the extremely small sample size. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474418">de Jong, Komproe, Spinazzola, van der Kolk, and Van Ommeren (2005)</xref> examined the factor structure of the SIDES-R among survivors of war or mass violence in Algeria (<italic>n</italic> = 652), Ethiopia (<italic>n</italic> = 1200), and Gaza (<italic>n</italic> = 585). Analyses of the factor structure of SIDES-R scores across these three samples indicated that the factor structure was not stable. Although there are a range of possible reasons for this observed lack of stability (e.g., sampling variation and intergroup variations in the nature of traumatic exposure), the findings of de Jong and his associates suggest that cross-national construct equivalence of domains assessed by the SIDES-SR cannot necessarily be assumed.</p>
<p>In summary, research on the psychometric properties of the SIDES-R has produced evidence of adequate test–retest reliability and internal consistency and acceptable levels of convergent, discriminant, and concurrent criterion-related validity. However, the rationally derived six-factor model, which informed the original development of the SIDES-R, has not been supported in empirical studies conducted in the United States, with there being reasons to suspect that the constitution of the theoretical construct assessed by the SIDES-R (i.e., chronic developmental trauma) may not be universal. As such, attempts to adapt the SIDES-R for non-Western populations need to start from first principles, including the initial development of a contextually appropriate test specification.</p>
<p>An important issue that needs to be addressed in the development of such a test specification relates to how the relationship between cultural influences and traumatic symptomatology is most usefully conceptualised. One possibility, suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474418">de Jong et al. (2005)</xref>, is that there are likely to be three broad categories of symptoms (Type A, Type B, and Type C), which need to be considered in the development of a test specification: Type A symptoms, which have been found to have a strong neurophysiological basis (e.g., heightened affective dysregulation) and which are therefore likely to be universal; Type B symptoms, which reflect universal underlying problems but which may manifest differently in cross-cultural settings (e.g., differences in the nature and relative importance of different forms of traumatic re-enactment); and Type C symptoms, which reflect culture-specific processes (e.g., culturally informed perceptions of self, others, and the world in general).</p>
<p>If de Jong and his associates are correct in their assumptions, then one of the first steps in the development of a test specification for CDT needs to involve a process of identifying, and drawing a distinction between universal (neurophysiologically determined) symptoms and symptoms that can best be explained within a sociocultural paradigm. However, such a process presupposes that a clear distinction can be drawn between universal symptoms and culture-specific symptoms, with some authors, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0081246312474418">van Rooyen and Nqweni, (2012)</xref>, arguing that even Type A symptoms may reflect cultural influences in their ‘origin, symptomatic expression, and . . . mediation’ (p. 51).</p>

<title>Adapting the SIDES-SR for the South African context</title>
<p>South Africa is characterised by high rates of interpersonal violence, with children shouldering a disproportionate share of this burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0081246312474418">Seedat, Van Niekerk, Jewkes, Suffla, &amp; Ratele, 2009</xref>). In addition to high levels of domestic violence, many South African children are exposed (either directly or vicariously) to relatively high levels of school-based or community violence, with such exposure having been found to be associated with PTSD and related posttraumatic symptomatology in a significant proportion of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081246312474418">Barbarin &amp; Richter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081246312474418">Barbarin, Richter, &amp; deWet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0081246312474418">Ensink, Robertson, Zissis, &amp; Leger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0081246312474418">Foster, Kuperminc, &amp; Price, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0081246312474418">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0081246312474418">Seedat, Nymai, Njenga, Vythilingum, &amp; Stein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0081246312474418">Seedat, van Nood, Vythilingum, Stein, &amp; Kaminer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0081246312474418">Ward, Flisher, Zissis, Muller, &amp; Lombard, 2001</xref>). Although there has been no systematic attempt to explore the prevalence of complex PTSD in samples of South African children, available data would suggest that prevalent rates are likely to be high.</p>
<p>In this context, there would appear to be a clear need for the development of a standardised instrument that provides a reliable and valid estimate of the prevalence and dynamics of CDT in the South African context, with this article representing an initial step in the process of adapting the SIDES-SR for the South African context. As a prelude to developing a test specification for the adapted test, this study explored the item discriminating power of items on the SIDES-SR using data derived from a sample of South African adolescents. Although no specific hypotheses were entertained, it was expected that some items on the SIDES-SR may not demonstrate adequate concurrent criterion-related validity (i.e., some items would fail to adequately discriminate individuals who had experienced chronic development trauma from those who had not).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0081246312474418">
<title>Respondents</title>
<p>Respondents were secondary school students attending an English medium high school located in Durban (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) during 2011. Of the 802 students attending the school, 752 (94%) consented to participate in the study and 719 (90%) submitted usable responses. Respondent characteristics were as follows: gender – male (66%); race – Black African (95%), ‘coloured’ = 2.7%, White = 1.5%, Asian = 0.6%; and mean age – 15.5 years (range: 12–20 years, standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 1.61).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0081246312474418">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>A history of developmental trauma was assessed using the Developmental Trauma Inventory (DTI). The DTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474418">Collings, Valjee, &amp; Penning, in press</xref>) is a 33-item, retrospective, self-administered measure of interpersonal trauma experiences developed specifically for the South African context. Factor analysis of the DTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474418">Collings et al., in press</xref>) produced the best fit for a nine-factor model: emotional abuse, community assault, domestic assault, witnessing community violence, witnessing domestic violence, indecent assault, domestic neglect, rape, and intentional domestic injury. DTI scales have been found to have moderate to high internal consistency (.70 to .81) and high concurrent validity in the sense that all scale scores are significantly correlated with scores on clinical measures of PTSD and/or complex PTSD. CDT was assessed using the 45 items of the SIDES-SR (as described above).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0081246312474418">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethical approval for the research was obtained from the Humanities Ethics Committee at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Written parental consent was obtained in all cases, with respondents providing written assent for their participation. Prior to assenting, each respondent was provided with a study information sheet, which described the purpose of the study, emphasised the voluntary nature of participation, and assured confidentiality of study findings. Research questionnaires were administered to groups of consenting participants during life orientation lessons, with offers of free counselling support (from the school guidance teacher) and/or free psychological counselling (at a university clinic) being made to all respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0081246312474418">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>For purposes of analysis, median splits were used to identify high- and low-risk groups for CDT, with exposure to complex trauma being operationalised as exposure to above median levels of chronicity (&gt;1 month) and/or exposure to above median levels of poly-victimisation (5+ types). Using these criteria, respondents were divided into two mutually exclusive groups – exposure to chronic and/or poly-victimisation (<italic>n</italic> = 387) versus no chronic or poly-victimisation exposure (<italic>n</italic> = 332) – with discriminant analyses being used to determine whether SIDES-SR items significantly discriminated these two groups.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0081246312474418" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-0081246312474418">
<title>Extent of traumatic exposure</title>
<p>Six hundred and forty-eight respondents (90%) reported lifetime exposure to at least one form of interpersonal violence, with 44 respondents (6.1%) reporting clinically elevated scores on all six SIDES-SR scales. The most common form of exposure reported by respondents was witnessing community violence (62%), with at least 40% of respondents reporting exposure to domestic assault (49%), sexual molestation (40%), and community assault (40%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0081246312474418">
<title>Concurrent validity: item analysis</title>
<p>A series of univariate discriminant analyses were employed to explore whether SIDES-SR items significantly discriminated individuals who had been exposed to CDT (i.e., chronic and/or poly-victimisation) from those who had not. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474418">Pelcovitz et al. (1997)</xref>, scores of 2 or 3 (on the 0–3, 4-point scale used in the SIDES-SR) were used to calculate symptom severity, with score of either 0 or 1 being coded as 0. These analyses indicated that scores on 12 SIDES-SR items (indicated in bold in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0081246312474418">Table 1</xref>) failed to significantly discriminate respondents who had been exposed to CDT from those who had not. Of particular significance was the fact that the non-discriminating items included all four items designed to assess avoidant or phobic sexual behaviour, with this trend being evident across gender (i.e., for both male and female respondents) and across different forms of traumatic exposure (i.e., rape or sexual molestation versus other forms of traumatic exposure).</p>

<title>Concurrent validity: full scale severity scores</title>
<p>In order to assess the impact of removing the 12 non-discriminating items from the SIDES-SR, full-scale symptom severity scores were calculated separately for (a) all 45 items on the SIDES-SR, using procedures suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474418">Pelcovitz et al. (1997)</xref>, and (b) a 33-item version of the SIDES-SR, which excluded non-discriminating items, with symptom severity scores being calculated by simply summing all item scores.</p>
<p>Univariate discriminate analyses of these two estimates of symptom severity indicated that both the 45-item version of the scale (λ = 0.933, χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = 39.78, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and the 33-item version (λ = 0.921, χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = 49.76, <italic>p</italic> = .000) significantly discriminated the two exposure groups, with estimates of concurrent validity being slightly (although not significantly) higher for the 33-item version of the scale. With respect to classification, the two versions of the scale were examined with respect to both <italic>sensitivity</italic> (i.e., the proportion of respondents who reported complex trauma exposure who were correctly identified) and <italic>specificity</italic> (i.e., the proportion of respondents who did not report complex trauma exposure who were correctly identified). Compared to the 45-item measure, the abbreviated measure demonstrated greater, although not significantly greater, specificity (.68 versus .63) but equivalent sensitivity (.47 versus .47).</p>
<p>Finally, a multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis, in which the two measures of symptom severity were entered as independent variables, was conducted to determine whether the two measures of symptom severity accounted for similar or different portions of the explained variance. Symptom severity scores for the 33-item version were entered into the analysis at step 1 (λ = 0.919, χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = 50.58, <italic>p</italic> = .000), with scores for the 45-item version failing to account for a unique additional proportion of the explained variance (<italic>F</italic> to enter = .000, <italic>ns</italic>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the 33-item measure may provide a more parsimonious measure of symptom severity, which does not negatively impact the concurrent validity of the SIDES-SR.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present findings suggest that the SIDES-SR may be characterised by some degree of construct over-representation when applied to South African samples. In the present sample, 12 (27%) of the SIDES-SR items failed to significantly discriminate individuals who reported chronic developmental trauma from those who did not. Furthermore, the removal of these 12 items had no discernable impact on the concurrent validity of the scale.</p>
<p>Of particular significance was the fact that non-discriminating items included items designed to measure processes that have been found to have a strong neurophysiological basis (e.g., affective dysregulation) as well as items that are generally assumed to be strongly influenced by sociocultural factors (e.g., relationships with others and sense of meaning). Taken together, these findings suggest that a comprehensive adaptation of the SIDES-SR for the South African context needs to be based on a careful consideration of item performance across all three categories of the typology developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474418">de Jong et al. (2005)</xref>, that is, symptoms that have been found to have a strong neurophysiological basis through to symptoms that are regarded as largely culturally determined.</p>
<p>A somewhat unexpected finding of this study was that all four of the SIDES-SR items relating to avoidant or phobic sexual behaviour failed to discriminate groups defined by the presence or absence of exposure to chronic developmental trauma. While further research is required in order to validate this finding, the present findings suggest that the Difficulty Modulating Sexual Involvement/Preoccupation subscale of the SIDES-SR may need to be significantly modified and/or redefined to suit the South African context.</p>
<sec id="section12-0081246312474418">
<title>Implications and limitations</title>
<p>The present findings suggest that there is a need to adapt the SIDES-SR for the South African context. In the present sample, more than one in four of the SIDES-SR items failed to discriminate groups defined by the presence or absence of CDT, suggesting some degree of construct over-representation. Further research is indicated in order to not only validate these findings but also address the issue of construct under-representation. It may well be that there are additional items, or even additional subscales, that need to be added to the SIDES-SR in order to adequately define the latent factor (CDT) in the South African context.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to psychometric considerations, there are a number of other factors that need to be addressed in the development of a measure of CDT, with one of the more important of these factors relating to the diagnostic status of CDT. Although it is generally acknowledged that the constellation of symptoms comprising CDT includes both clinical disorders (e.g., somatisation and dissociation) and pervasive/inflexible patterns of inner experience and behaviour (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0081246312474418">J. L. Herman, 1992b</xref>), there has, somewhat surprisingly, been no systematic attempt to conceptualise CDT as a multi-axial disorder, with clinicians and researchers having tended to conceptualise CDT as either an Axis I disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0081246312474418">J. L. Herman, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0081246312474418">van der Kolk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0081246312474418">van der Kolk et al., 2009</xref>), as associated symptoms of an Axis I disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081246312474418">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), or as an Axis II disorder (International Classification of Diseases [<italic>ICD-10</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0081246312474418">World Health Organization, 1992</xref>). However, available attempts to develop measures of CDT as an Axis I disorder have failed to produce instruments with factor structures corresponding to the observed clinical phenomenology of CDT (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0081246312474418">Scoboria et al., 2008</xref>), whereas the <italic>ICD-10</italic> diagnosis of ‘lasting personality changes following catastrophic stress’ fails to address any of the cardinal clinical symptoms of CDT. As such, a multi-axial conceptualisation of CDT may well be indicated as a more appropriate framework for the development of test specifications that comprehensively address the phenomenology of CDT.</p>
<p>With respect to the diagnostic status of CDT, there is also an active, and ongoing, debate regarding ‘the ripeness of . . . [complex posttraumatic stress disorder] to be included in DSM-5’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0081246312474418">Weiss, 2012</xref>, p. 256), with various authors arguing that available evidence (a) provides support for the inclusion of CDT as a discrete diagnostic entity in its own right (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0081246312474418">van der Kolk et al., 2009</xref>), (b) supports the recognition of CDT as a discrete entity within a spectrum of posttraumatic disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0081246312474418">J. Herman, 2012</xref>), or (c) does not support a new diagnostic category at this time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0081246312474418">Resick et al., 2012</xref>). Regardless of which of these positions is adopted, there is, however, a general consensus that there is a need for a more precise descriptive definition of CDT, as well as a need for the development of more precise and validated assessment instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0081246312474418">Weiss, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A further issue that needs to be addressed in the development of measures of CDT relates to the need for a conceptualisation of traumatic exposure that adequately captures the child’s full victimisation profile. Available attempts to validate measures of CDT have tended to be informed by a conceptualisation of traumatic exposure that draws heavily on PTSD notions of traumatic stress as a <italic>single traumatic event</italic>. What is not adequately addressed in such a conceptualisation is the fact that different forms of childhood victimisation tend to cluster together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0081246312474418">Finkelhor, Ormrod, &amp; Turner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0081246312474418">Nishina &amp; Juvonen, 2005</xref>) with many children experiencing chronic patterns of multiple forms of victimisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0081246312474418">Clausen &amp; Crittenden, 1991</xref>) and with exposure to multiple types of victimisation being strongly predictive of both the complexity and the chronicity of posttraumatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474418">D’Andrea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0081246312474418">Finkelhor, Ormrod, &amp; Turner, 2009</xref>). As such, there is clearly a need for measures of CDT to be validated in relation to measures of traumatic exposure (such as the DTI) that provide a comprehensive indication of a child’s full victimisation profile as well as a clear indication of the extent of multiple or poly-victimisation experienced by a child. Moreover, the fact that CDT outcomes have been found to be strongly associated with forms of interpersonal victimisation, which clearly meet <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for a traumatic event (e.g., physical and/or sexual abuse) <italic>as well as</italic> with a range of adverse childhood experiences that do not necessarily satisfy <italic>DSM</italic> criteria for traumatic events (e.g., emotional abuse and neglect), suggests that the current <italic>DSM</italic> conceptualisation of trauma may be too narrow to adequately encompass the full range of traumatic experiences that are likely to be relevant to CDT outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, interpretations of the study findings need to be considered in the context of the study’s limitations. The retrospective nature of the study would preclude any strong causal inferences and may have led to errors in recall. In addition, the present findings were obtained from an urban sample of school-going youth in one South African school district and may not generalise to more representative samples of South African school-going youth or, indeed, to representative samples drawn from the general South African population. Furthermore, the fact that most respondents completed a questionnaire that was not written in their mother tongue may have led to a degree of response bias.</p>
<p>The present findings do, however, suggest that the SIDES-SR may be characterised by some degree of construct over-representation when applied to South African samples, with further research being indicated in order to not only replicate the present findings but also address the issue of construct under-representation in the South African context.</p>
