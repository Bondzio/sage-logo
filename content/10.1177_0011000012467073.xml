<p>On July 17, 2012, the field of counseling psychology lost one of its great champions and leaders. Bruce Fretz passed away due to complications following open heart surgery. Over the course of three decades, Bruce had a major impact on counseling psychology nationally as well as at the University of Maryland. He was an exceptionally gifted leader, scholar, administrator, mentor, teacher, and colleague.</p>
<p>Bruce was born and grew up in the small town of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College in 1961 and did his graduate studies in counseling psychology at The Ohio State University, studying with Dr. Lyle Schmidt and receiving his doctorate in 1965. At that point, Bruce began his career at the University of Maryland as an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and was promoted to associate professor quickly. In 1969, at the age of 29, he became the training director of the Counseling Psychology Program, and he remained in that role for the next 22 years. He was joined by Dr. Janice Birk as codirector in 1985, when the counseling psychology faculties of the Psychology and Counseling and Personnel Services Departments, formed a collaborative program.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Bruce seemed to excel at all of the tasks on which he focused his considerable energy. He held major offices and positions that enabled him to both protect and strengthen counseling psychology—and he did this with an ease and grace that came very naturally to him. In his connection to the broader field of psychology, Bruce was chair of the American Psychological Association (APA) Education and Training Board, and a member of the APA Council of Representatives and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Committee of the American Board of Professional Psychology. He also served as president of the National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology. Through these involvements, Bruce maintained the presence of counseling psychology within psychology, and his participation in the broader field facilitated the growing strength of counseling psychology.</p>
<p>Within counseling psychology, Bruce made myriad contributions. He was on the Division 17 Executive Committee for more than 20 years and was president of the Division in 1991 to 1992. During his presidency, and throughout his career, Bruce promoted diversity in its many forms in Division 17. He was one of the founders of the Council of Counseling Psychology Training Program (CCPTP), which has been a key, if not the key, organization aimed at enhancing graduate training. Bruce organized the first meeting of CCPTP and was its chair in 1978 to 1979. He was the second editor of our Division 17 journal, <italic>The Counseling Psychologist (TCP)</italic>, from 1985 to 1990. During Bruce’s editorship, the journal began its affiliation with SAGE Publications, a union that has been mutually beneficial. As former Division 17 president, John Westefeld, said, “Thanks to Bruce’s wisdom, measured approach, and interpersonal skills, the transition went smoothly and was effective—as evidenced by the fact that we are now in our 27th year with SAGE.” As an editor, Bruce had the reputation of being tactful, evenhanded, and supportive of authors, even when he did not accept their work for publication. An inconspicuous but important way in which Bruce had a deep impact on counseling psychology was through being a member or chair of more than 30 site visits for APA accreditation.</p>
<p>In her article about Bruce for the Legacies and Traditions Forum of <italic>TCP</italic>, Clara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012467073">Hill (2000)</xref> asked Bruce about the strengths of counseling psychology. Bruce’s reply reveals much about him and his feeling for counseling psychology:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the things that is very special is that counseling psychologists as a group are incredibly caring, considerate, and enjoyable people . . . just a wonderful group of people. There is a sense of family. There is a core set of beliefs about what it is like to be truly human that we want to nurture, things like accentuating the positive, emphasizing development . . . We have a value system that is a unique strength. It keeps counseling psychology alive even when there are various professional or historical forces that impinge on it. It is as if there is a flame that is not going to be put out. (p. 388)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bruce also influenced the field in other ways. He especially enjoyed writing and conducting research in areas that had received little prior attention. For example, Bruce conducted seminal work on nonverbal behavior in counseling in the 1960s, and its heuristic value over the years has been notable. He coauthored the first major textbook in counseling psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012467073">Gelso &amp; Fretz, 1992</xref>), conducted the first major meta-analysis in career counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012467073">Fretz, 1981</xref>), and may have been the first psychologist to obtain a grant from the National Institute of Aging to study preretirement anxieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012467073">Fretz, Kluge, Ossana, Jones, &amp; Merikangas, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>As a training director, teacher, and mentor, Bruce was unsurpassed. He was responsible for transforming a faltering Counseling Psychology Program into a top program. In the same gentle and understated way that was part of his leadership in counseling psychology, Bruce was known as a master teacher. He loved to teach introductory psychology, and he did that with exceptional skill throughout much of his career. In addition, Bruce taught seminars on teaching to graduate students at the University of Maryland. As part of his commitment to undergraduate education, Bruce was the national president of Psi Chi from 1974 until 1978.</p>
<p>Bruce was also a beloved advisor to many graduate students, and he had a deep impact on their professional lives. His former students have described his compassion, patience, and belief in them as people and professionals, even when they themselves doubted. Many advisees remembered how he welcomed new students to the program at Maryland by giving each a cutting from his spider plant. Some have continued this tradition and give cuttings from their plants to their advisees and interns. The feelings of his former students may be captured by Brent Mallinckrodt, in a poignant note sent when Brent learned that Bruce was gravely ill. Brent wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>I will be forever grateful to you . . . for calling forth all the very best parts of me professionally. From you I learned how to treat colleagues with kindness and respect, to take real joy from my work, and that the extra effort to do my best is well worth it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for these gifts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bruce not only excelled in his professional life but also in his roles as husband to Dr. Barbara Fretz, father to Eric and Lori, and grandfather. Bruce had loving relationships with his family, and they shared many remarkable experiences, including traveling the world (visiting more than 120 countries), taking train trips, volunteering in their community, and singing in numerous choirs. Bruce’s son Eric was quoted as saying, “My dad has been, and is, a singularly excellent father, teacher, and friend.”</p>
<p>With Bruce’s family, students, and counseling psychology colleagues, we, too, share our deep appreciation for his immense contributions to counseling psychology and to those of us fortunate to have known this extraordinary man.</p>
