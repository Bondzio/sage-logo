<abstract>
<p>This study describes the level of moral sensitivity among nursing students enrolled in a traditional baccalaureate nursing program and a master’s nursing program. Survey responses to the Modified Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire for Student Nurses from 250 junior, senior, and graduate students from one nursing school were analyzed. It was not possible to draw conclusions based on the tool. Moral category analysis showed students ranked the category structuring moral meaning highest and interpersonal orientation second. The moral issue ranking highest was honesty, respect for the patient second, and third was responsibility to know the patient’s situation. Seniors agreed more often about the need to focus on patient safety. As students progress through the baccalaureate program and into the graduate program, their perspectives increasingly recognize the contextuality of moral issues. The results show a need to further develop a tool to measure moral sensitivity, using student understanding and perceptions of moral issues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After graduating from nursing school, new registered nurses begin practice in a complex health care system that demands limitless energy and strong problem-solving abilities. New nurses are confronted with complex work environments that affect motivation for moral satisfaction. As a result, nurses experience moral and ethical dissonance, leading to both emotional stress and burnout for nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011411399">1</xref>
</sup> To prepare nursing students to enter this complex environment, nursing schools are challenged to prepare practitioners who bring the necessary knowledge and science, clinical reasoning and skilled know-how, and ethical comportment and formation to patient care settings (p.25). <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011411399">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As part of the professional role, nurses engage in an ethic of caring. The ethic of care exists when the ethical self is in relationship with others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011411399">3</xref>
</sup> Daily nursing activities comprise responsible caring practices, each differently situated within the bounds of the nurse-patient relationship and the factors that influence it. Moral issues are embedded and wait to be discovered in the context of each patient situation. Whether this is taught, learned, or innate, moral sensitivity needs to develop for nursing students as they prepare for professional practice. It is unclear how attention is given in nursing curricula to the development of sensitivity to moral or ethical issues. Literature has shown that nursing students are able to recognize that an ethical dilemma has occurred during a caring experience.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011411399">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011411399"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011411399">6</xref>
</sup> There is a need, however, to examine how nursing students expect to encounter moral issues and what level of moral sensitivity new nurses bring to practice settings. Knowledge of this may determine what nursing education programs need to do to further cultivate moral sensitivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733011411399">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Nurses engage in moral reasoning as part of an ethical decision-making process. However, nurses must first be able to recognize the moral or ethical component within each situation, that is, to have moral sensitivity. As a concept that is still developing, the terms moral sensitivity and ethical sensitivity have been used differently by different authors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011411399">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011411399"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011411399"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011411399">10</xref>
</sup> A better grasp of the variations used in the literature is emerging, and it is recognized that there are competing perspectives about the terminology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011411399">11</xref>
</sup> As used by Rest,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011411399">9</xref>
</sup> ethical sensitivity is a precursor to making ethical decisions. Those who display ethical sensitivity are able to assess the responses and feelings of others and are aware of potential courses of action. In contrast, Lützén et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011411399">10</xref>
</sup> defined moral sensitivity as the ability to recognize a moral conflict, show a contextual and intuitive understanding of the patient’s vulnerable situation, and have insight into the ethical consequences of decisions made on behalf of another person (p.132). Since moral sensitivity includes freedom to recognize that ethical issues are largely contextual, this standpoint was selected for this study.</p>
<p>A person’s propensity for moral reasoning, the ability to engage in ethical decision making, has been shown to develop over time. Perry believes that perception and knowledge of ethics are contextually relative and proposes three major phases of moral thinking and development: safety in dualism, relativism, and finally commitment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011411399">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011411399">14</xref>
</sup> Using this model, Kohlberg’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011411399">15</xref>
</sup> justice-based theory, demonstrates how males progress toward higher stages of moral development. Next Gilligan, using a caring, responsibility orientation, contends that women’s moral development and judgment differs, in that the main moral issue for women is the conflict that occurs between the self and others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011411399">16</xref>
</sup> Later nursing studies show that the approach to moral decision making are not clearly based on gender.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011411399">17</xref>
</sup> Rest integrates both positions, delineating stages through which all individuals recognize a dilemma, interpret it, define the corrective action, prioritize values, and act. <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011411399">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It remains unclear how moral sensitivity develops for student nurses. Including ethical reasoning as a curricular theme in baccalaureate nursing programs is essential; however, no study has attempted to identify student nurses’ moral sensitivity, a precursor to making ethical decisions. This study seeks to understand and describe nursing students’ level of moral sensitivity and how it continues to develop while enrolled in a baccalaureate nursing program or during a master’s nursing program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0969733011411399">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A mixed method design was used to explore nursing students’ perceptions about moral sensitivity, and six research questions were answered through survey research. In addition, naturalistic inquiry provided answers to a seventh, qualitative question. The qualitative data provided additional insight and served to validate or repudiate the quantitative data. Finally, the results of both data sets were compared and interrelated to again answer each research question.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011411399">19</xref>
</sup> Use of a survey instrument can provide objective findings, though such instruments do not allow for examination of context. Since naturalistic inquiry allowed subjects to give detailed, rich responses, an in-depth discussion more sufficiently describes such findings and their interrelation with the survey findings. Hence, only the results of the quantitative method are reported here.</p>
<p>For this study, moral sensitivity was defined according to the research by Lützén and colleagues whose work led to the development of the Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire (MSQ).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011411399">20</xref>
</sup> The MSQ has six conceptual category subsets: interpersonal orientation (building a trusting relationship with the patient and finding ways of responding to the patient’s perceived needs); modifying autonomy (strategies that are taken to limit a patient’s autonomy while being aware of the principle of self-choice, often in situations requiring physical or psychological protection of the patient or others); expressing benevolence (a moral motivation to do good or act in the best interest of the patient); structuring moral meaning (a process whereby one reflects and interprets decisions made and actions taken, even if they limited patient self-choice); experiencing moral conflict (first experiencing the presence of a moral conflict, then recognizing feelings, intuition, and the cognitive perception of a moral issue and what ‘ought’ to be done); and relying on physician knowledge (turning to the physician for authority and expertise to solve certain patient care problems). Lützén reported a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.78 for the MSQ instrument.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011411399">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For this study the researcher adapted the MSQ, with permission of Lützén, and developed the Modified Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire for Student Nurses (MMSQ-SN). Questions were tailored to best assess student nurse perspectives. Items from the original survey that reflected reliance on physician orders for day-to-day decision making were reworded to focus instead on the personal conviction that professional knowledge is necessary when dealing with moral issues. Categories of the MMSQ-SN measured the students’ relational orientation, orientation for modifying the level of patients’ autonomy, inclination to express benevolence, disposition toward structuring moral meaning, expression of moral conflict, and personal conviction that professional knowledge is necessary when dealing with moral issues. A total of 29 items on the survey corresponded to these six categories. An additional item referred to giving medication by force and was not categorized, reflective of the MSQ. The tool was piloted using freshman and sophomore pre-nursing students enrolled in an anatomy and physiology class at the same university. No changes were made to the instrument following the pilot study. Internal consistency reliability analyses for the modified tool revealed a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.63; after deleting the uncategorized Item 29, a value of 0.64 was calculated.</p>
<p>Upon approval by the University Institutional Review Board, a convenience sample of 251 nursing students in junior and senior baccalaureate or master’s nursing courses were recruited from a Midwestern university. Permission was received from classroom faculty to survey students at the beginning or last part of a selected class session, near the end of the academic year. Each student was provided a letter explaining the study and human subject rights. A total of 251 students completed the survey; one survey was deemed incomplete so the final sample size was 250. Of the 178 baccalaureate students, 106 were juniors, and 71 were seniors. The remaining 73 participants were graduate students. Completion of the survey took up to 15 minutes for most students. Item scores indicated the extent of disagreement or agreement with the moral issue in the item. Based on evaluation of all survey scores, it became apparent that three items with negative wording required reverse coding, since a low score indicated a more favorable response.</p>

<p>A Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree) was used to provide students with a broad range of choices for each item. Given the scoring, those items with higher mean values reflected general agreement that the moral issue was very important (<italic>M</italic> = 5.9–7.0) or important (<italic>M</italic> = 5.0–5.8) to students. Those items with scores between 3.1 and 4.9 reflected neutrality. Items with mean scores below 3.1 indicated disagreement or strong disagreement with the moral issue.</p>

<title>Moral categories</title>
<p>To answer the first research question and determine which categories of moral issues nursing students recognize as being present in patient care situations, moral categories for all students were analyzed for inter-item correlations. Only very modest relationships were found between the individual items and the categories, so the moral issues were analyzed categorically and then by individual survey items using mean scores. Descriptive statistics were used to determine means and standard deviations of each item in rank-order from highest to lowest. The categories that were found to be useful are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733011411399">Table 3</xref>. The range of mean scores for each category (3.94–5.57) demonstrates the broad perspectives students used when answering the questions.</p>

<p>The category, structuring moral meaning, ranked first among all students and refers to the spontaneous process that individual nurses use to solve a moral conflict. Through their responses, students concurred that each nurse considers all known aspects of the context, including personal, past experiences in order to make sense of a new and unique situation, weaving together what was perceived about the situation, the knowledge used to arrive at a decision, and alternatives that were weighed in order to find moral meaning and to justify actions. To structure moral meaning, the nurse must reflect on the moral aspects of decisions made and actions taken, even if the actions limit the patient’s self-choice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011411399">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>All respondents ranked the category, interpersonal orientation, as second most important. Students showed general agreement with items that supported the nurse’s use of an interpersonal orientation to build trusting relationships with patients and find ways to respond to patient needs. An interpersonal orientation is important for both nurse-patient and nurse-colleague relationships.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011411399">10</xref>
</sup> The third highest ranked category selected by students, expressing benevolence, reflects a desire to do good for another person, in this case, the patient. Good refers to the intention underlying the nurse’s actions initiated for the good of the patient and is based more on a desire to convey compassion and less on following the rule of obligation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011411399">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ranking fourth, the category of modifying autonomy refers to enhancing as well as limiting the patient’s self-choice. For this category, students considered how nurses modify patient autonomy as it refers to perceived patient needs when a conflict exists, such as when the nurse identifies that a patient might be in a vulnerable situation. Items in this category do not refer to coercion or to informed consent, which implies shared decision making. Further, the category does not refer to self-sufficiency, which is defined as being independent and separate from others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011411399">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The category, experiencing conflict, ranked fifth according to students. Nurses express conflict when they experience inner feelings of inadequacy, fear, and anxiety related to difficult nurse-patient situations. Conflict is experienced when an event prompts the nurse to recognize the moral components of a situation. Events such as participating in treatments against a patient’s will, feeling tension caused by patient violence, and being overworked can result in moral conflict. To cope with conflict, nurses might select a professional demeanor that distances them from the patient yet allows them to remain emotionally balanced.<sup>

</table-wrap>
<p>The highest mean score (<italic>M</italic> = 6.44) was for Item 6, ‘If a patient should ask for information about his or her treatment, it is important for me always to be honest,’ indicating honesty as the most important moral issue. Item 7 was ranked second highest (<italic>M</italic> = 6.43) and states, ‘I believe that “good” nursing care includes respecting the patient’s self-choice,’ reflecting the importance of involving the patient when making care decisions.</p>
<p>Third highest among survey items as ranked by students was Item 2 (<italic>M</italic> = 6.36), which reads, ‘It is my professional responsibility as a nurse to have knowledge about the patient’s whole situation.’ This suggests that the study sample overall placed importance on knowing information about the patient, which could include health history, current presentation, disease process, and/or treatments. In addition, the phrase ‘whole situation’ might reference having knowledge about other circumstances, such as the family situation, social problems, financial considerations that affect treatment, or emotional or spiritual needs. Ranking fourth was Item 30 (M = 6.25), indicating that students strongly agreed that ‘In situations where it is difficult to know what is right, I consult experts, more experienced nurses, or the physician.’ This clearly suggests that all three groups recognized the importance of seeking expert knowledge when not enough is known to make well-grounded decisions. Item 1 from the MMSQ-SN ranked fifth and read, ‘What is most important in my nursing practice is my relationship with my patients’ (<italic>M</italic> = 5.96). Students strongly agreed that the nurse-patient relationship was an important aspect of a successful nursing practice.</p>
<p>Moral issues that cause a nurse to rely on other health providers to make decisions for the patient (Item 16) or to follow mandated treatment orders even when the patient protests (Item 24) were found to be unacceptable to students. Students also disagreed with items suggesting that the nurse frequently experienced conflict in patient situations (Items 11 and 28). Lastly, students strongly disagreed with the uncategorized item, ‘I can sometimes be motivated to threaten the patient with an injection by force, if he or she does not of his own free will take the medicine that is ordered’ (Item 29).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733011411399">
<title>Relational orientation for care</title>
<p>The second research question for this study was, ‘What level of relational orientation for care is identified by nursing students using the MMSQ-SN?’ Results were analyzed using frequency distributions for the six items in the interpersonal orientation category. As a whole, junior students scored the highest (<italic>M</italic> = 32.77, possible range 6.0–42.0) among all groups for the category and significantly higher than graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 30.84, <italic>p</italic> = .<italic>006)</italic>. To better describe this finding, it is important to look at which moral statements contributed to the differences, as measured by the one-way ANOVA and Scheffe post hoc test. First is Item 1, ‘What is most important in my nursing practice is my relationship with my patients.’ Juniors (<italic>M</italic> = 6.14, <italic>p</italic> = .<italic>001</italic>) and seniors (<italic>M</italic> = 6.01, <italic>p</italic> = .<italic>033)</italic> scored significantly higher than graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.63). Item 2, ‘It is my professional responsibility as a nurse to have knowledge about the patient’s whole situation,’ was scored higher by juniors students (<italic>M</italic> = 6.51, <italic>p</italic> = .008) than the graduate nursing students (<italic>M</italic> = 6.15); the juniors felt it more important to take responsibility for knowing all of a patient’s specific information. In summary, junior students showed greater attention to building relationships and knowing their patients than did the more experienced graduate nursing students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733011411399">
<title>Modifying patient autonomy</title>
<p>The third research question asked, ‘What level of activities do students identify as necessary to limit a patient’s autonomy?’ This question was analyzed using mean scores, one-way ANOVA, and the Scheffe post hoc test results for the five items in this category. Analysis for the category revealed that juniors and seniors agreed significantly more often to modify the patient’s autonomy than did the graduate nursing students, even when it meant limiting the patient’s self-choice (<italic>F</italic> = 9.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Both the senior nursing students (<italic>M</italic> = 15.14, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and junior nursing students (<italic>M</italic> = 14.86, <italic>p</italic> = .002) scored higher than the graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 13.26, poss. range 5–30). Four survey items from the category showed significant group differences, helping to better answer the research question. Scores for three of the items fell in or just above the neutral range of the Likert scale, but the fourth item score showed greater agreement and importance for the students. First, regarding items that scored in the neutral range, Item 12, ‘In making difficult decisions for the patient, I rely mostly on the rules and principles that are accepted by the staff on the floor or unit,’ received significantly higher scores from the junior students (<italic>M</italic> = 4.61, <italic>p</italic> = .031) than the graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 4.05). There was also a significant difference between both the junior and senior classes and the graduate student class for the moral issue in Item 13: ‘It is my experience as a nurse that strict rules are important for the care of certain patients.’ More junior (<italic>M</italic> = 5.12, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and senior students (<italic>M</italic> = 4.88, <italic>p</italic> = .004) than graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 4.13) felt that, in their experience, strict rules were significantly more important. Juniors scored highest for both items (12 and 13), showing that these students felt that rules were more important than their more experienced, generally older, counterparts. For the moral issue in Item 15: ‘I am faced with difficult decisions to make almost every day,’ graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.11) felt they were faced with making difficult decisions significantly more often than their younger, less experienced counterparts (senior students, <italic>M</italic> = 4.42, <italic>p</italic> = .029) (juniors, <italic>M</italic> = 4.29, <italic>p</italic> = .003). Lastly, though all groups showed general agreement with Item 27, ‘If I see that a patient is becoming more and more aggressive, it is first of all the other patients’ safety that is my responsibility,’ senior students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.72) felt it was more important to focus on the safety of others than either the juniors (<italic>M</italic> = 5.12, <italic>p</italic> = .043) or the graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.06, <italic>p</italic> = .042). Scores for this fourth item reflect that the safety of others is an important moral issue for all of the classes, though more intently by the senior group. The fifth item from the modifying autonomy category that scored as being important is Item 10, ‘When I am in conflict, where I have difficulty in knowing what to do in response to the patient, there are always people that I can ask’ (<italic>M</italic> = 5.70). No differences were shown between the classes, and all students recognized the importance of having persons available to assist with decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733011411399">
<title>Expressing benevolence</title>
<p>Research question four asked, ‘What level of actions do students identify as being benevolent and in the best interest of the patient?’ Analysis for this question was based on how often students agreed with the eight items from the ‘expressing benevolence’ category. Using descriptive statistics, differences were found between groups (<italic>F</italic> = 5.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.01). By class, juniors (<italic>M</italic> = 41.26, <italic>p</italic> = .048) and seniors (<italic>M</italic> = 41.8, <italic>p</italic> = .010) agreed more to the items related to expressing benevolence than the graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 39.71, poss. range 8–56). As measured by the one-way ANOVA and the Scheffe post hoc tests, two of the eight category items showed significant difference by class. Item 5, ‘If I should lose my patient’s trust, I would feel that I failed my patient,’ was scored higher by senior students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.83) than graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.26, <italic>p</italic> = .027). The second item of significance in this category was Item 27: ‘If a patient is dying from alcoholism and his or her last wish is a glass of whisky, it is my obligation to fulfill this wish.’ All three groups’ responses fell in the neutral range. Seniors were the most positive (<italic>M</italic> = 4.47), compared to juniors (<italic>M</italic> = 3.75, <italic>p</italic> = .045) and graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 3.44, <italic>p</italic> = .005). While students tended to agree with the assumptions in the category of expressing benevolence, scores showed the widest range of mean score responses (3.85–6.43) among all of the categories, demonstrating that students approached acting with benevolence in different ways for different patient issues. The wide range of mean scores for items in the category might indicate that such actions are contextually based, and raised concern about the utility of the categories on the MMSQ-SN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733011411399">
<title>Patient self-choice</title>
<p>Research question five ‘What amount of patient self-choice do student nurses believe that patients should be afforded and respected?’ was measured using the 5 items in the ‘moral meaning’ category. Again the ANOVA and Scheffe post hoc tests were used to examine this data. As a whole, students agreed with this category; however, there was a significant difference between class groups (<italic>F</italic> = <italic>4</italic>.<italic>74</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Identical junior and senior mean scores (<italic>M</italic> = 5.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were greater than graduate student mean scores (<italic>M</italic> = 5.19) showing that the juniors and seniors felt it more important to reflect on decisions used to determine their actions, even if those actions might limit the patient’s self-choice. Although juniors (<italic>M</italic> = 5.22) scored slightly higher than graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 4.74) for Item 20 (‘When a patient refuses treatment it is important for me that there are rules to follow’), the difference was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.83).</p>
<p>As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0969733011411399">Table 4</xref>, three of the items from this category were found to have mean scores of 5.3 or greater. The full set of students agreed it was important to always be honest with patients and ranked Item 6 highest among all the MMSQ-SN items (<italic>M</italic> = 6.44). Providing information was felt to be one way of affording patients the option of self-choice. By contrast, the item students scored lowest in this category is Item 14, demonstrating that students have less likelihood to base responses on feelings than according to principles. This item received a mean score of 4.44. The full category exhibited a range of mean scores equal to 2.0. This again raised concern about the utility of the categories. The mean score of undergraduate students for this category identified that nursing students who were less experienced more often turned to established ways of knowing, through rules and principles, to help make patient care decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733011411399">
<title>Dealing with moral conflict</title>
<p>The last quantitative research question asked, ‘What level of moral conflict is experienced by nursing students related to patient care?’ Analysis of the data for this question was based on the three items in the ‘experiencing moral conflict’ category. No significant differences were found between groups. The mean scores of juniors (<italic>M</italic> = 3.91), seniors (<italic>M</italic> = 3.83), and graduate students (<italic>M</italic> = 4.09) demonstrated neutrality or disagreement. Scores revealed that students did not identify moral conflict in these particular survey items, and they disagreed that conflict was frequently experienced when caring for patients.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-0969733011411399">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this survey suggest that a difference exists among the levels of moral sensitivity that junior, senior, and graduate nursing students bring to patient care experiences. Differences exist among and within the categories of moral sensitivity as identified through the MMSQ-SN.</p>
<p>This entire sample of student nurses felt that a relational orientation with patients was very important. The works of Benner et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011411399">2</xref>
</sup> and Noddings<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011411399">3</xref>
</sup> highlight that an ethic of care exists when the ethical self is in relationship with others, and that individuals are enhanced or diminished within the context of a caring relationship. Additionally, Tronto<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011411399">24</xref>
</sup> describes that caring and a care ethic are present when individuals do what they must to maintain, continue, and repair the world so that all people can thrive as well as possible. While developing professional nurse-patient relationships is essential, circumstances might prevent positive relationships with every patient. Junior students scored highest among the three groups for this moral issue, while perhaps more experienced students realized that nurse-patient relationships vary within larger, more realistic bounds. As students progress through their nursing program or have more experience, other facets appear to affect the way they gauge the quality of the nurse-patient relationship. Such a case was noted by Nolan and Markert<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011411399">4</xref>
</sup>, who found that students were increasingly aware of ethical issues and that ethical thinking expanded during health science programs. This study sample was primarily female, and Gilligan<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011411399">15</xref>
</sup> described women’s moral development within relationships. Even so, Rest postulates that both men and women must first connect what they interpret with possible implications of actions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011411399">9</xref>
</sup> Others found that moral actions are not related to gender.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011411399">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011411399">17</xref>
</sup> Other studies need to more thoroughly address any correlation between gender and moral sensitivity.</p>
<p>In this study, younger nursing students were more likely to look for rules to support correct actions, while graduate nursing students were more likely to use professional judgment. This follows Perry’s development model which postulates that individuals move from wanting and looking for absolute answers (rules) to the position of relativism, before finally reaching comfort with a commitment to base personal choices on moral values.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011411399">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Graduate students, rather than juniors or seniors, were more likely to identify that situations contain moral dilemmas. Again, using Perry’s scheme,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011411399">12</xref>
</sup> graduate students with greater experience in practice are more likely to approach situations from a more advanced position. In such cases, they are committed to using moral values as part of their decision-making schemes, and are more likely to recognize their responsibility for, and relationship with, persons who are affected by moral issues. Through use of an ethic of care,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011411399">23</xref>
</sup> the needs of all individuals are responded to, and no one is left alone or hurt. Further, using Gilligan’s model,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011411399">15</xref>
</sup> it could be claimed that within an ethic of responsibility and in relationship with others, nurses rely on the concept of equity and the ability to recognize differences in other’s needs.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that senior students agreed more often than their junior counterparts about the need to focus on the safety of all of the patients within a patient care setting. Students in this particular program study psychiatric and public health nursing in the senior year. The psychiatric nursing content includes a discussion about patient aggression as a result of mental illness, so for these senior students it is likely that responses were based on their recent clinical experiences. Further, because context appears to be more apparent to them, senior students had more difficulty selecting between the good versus the bad thing to do, as with Item 26, which asks whether or not the student would provide a glass of whiskey as a last request for a patient who is dying from alcoholism. This follows with Nolan and Markert’s work,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011411399">4</xref>
</sup> which found that the level of students’ uncertainty increased concerning ethical issues at the end of the program. Similarly, Brookfield<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011411399">24</xref>
</sup> recognized the inevitable contextuality and situationality of moral reasoning, explaining that each person subjectively defines what is considered to be morally admirable or defensible behavior as a product, in part, of personal experiences. The desire to provide care within its context is also supported by Gastmans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011411399">25</xref>
</sup> who stated that caring as a moral attitude is considered the nurse’s sensitive and supportive response to each situation and circumstance of vulnerable human beings who need help. Such actions are found best by stepping away from one’s own personal reference systems and empathizing with the patient.</p>
<p>Juniors and seniors felt it more important to make decisions, or take actions, even if they might limit the patient’s self-choice. This might be best explained using the middle stage of Kohlberg’s theory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011411399">14</xref>
</sup> With this perspective, students may be trying to do their duty, respect authority, and maintain a given set of policies. In other words, there is a conscious effort to uphold policies and procedures. From another perspective, Woods<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011411399">26</xref>
</sup> found that experienced nurses were <italic>not</italic> unreflective or random in decision making. Because decisions emerge from everyday practice, a nursing ethic exists. It is possible to postulate that students consider and reconsider experiences in clinical practice, reflecting on the moral issues involved, eventually arriving at an understanding of the contextuality of ethical issues. The wide range of mean scores between items from the corresponding MMSQ-SN category (modifying autonomy) makes its usefulness questionable and supports the need to revise some of the survey items.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy was that all students in this study sample did not believe that they frequently confront individual moral issues in daily practice. This indicates that conflict is not recognized among the students as a distinct phenomenon through patient care. It might be suggested that it is within the context of patient care situations that such conflict emerges. Through studies on moral distress, Jameton<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011411399">27</xref>
</sup> found that during initial distress a nurse feels frustration, anger, and anxiety when encountering institutional obstacles and interpersonal value conflicts. Unlike moral dilemmas, when it is possible to choose and implement several correct courses of action, moral distress burdens the individual nurse with more than one right thing to do, the limitation to select only one, and the inability to act on another. The individual nurse, while choosing a right action, also omits another action, which is equally morally important. Zuzelo<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011411399">28</xref>
</sup> recognized this as moral stress, whereby one’s clinical decisions are surrounded by conflicting ethical principles that threaten patients’ autonomy. Other studies found that students’ conflict increased under conditions of short staffing and pressured conditions because of organizational policies that emphasized efficiency and conservation of time and resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011411399">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011411399">7</xref>
</sup> The context of patient care issues presented on the MMSQ-SN apparently led to feelings of conflict. That graduate nursing students scored significantly higher than juniors and seniors for Item 15, which pertained to daily difficult decisions, might give credence to the impact of delivering patient care amidst institutional constraints; undergraduate students are not personally exposed to these daily limitations.</p>

<title>Implications for research, practice and education</title>
<p>This study used a convenience sample at a Midwestern university and the self-reported nature of the data limits its generalizability to other schools of nursing. The first time use of the revised tool and its low Cronbach alpha further limit confidence in the survey findings; however, these data coupled with the qualitative data from this study (but not described here) provide a foundation for understanding how students develop moral sensitivity.</p>
<p>This survey measured the level of student agreement or disagreement with statements that represented moral issues. For this study, it is likely that participants were unable to discriminate between moral issues that confront them in patient care settings and rule-based course requirements. The categories of the MMSQ-SN were modified from the original survey, which had been developed for moral issues involving nurses who cared for psychiatric patients. Lützén’s original tool has been modified for use with that particular population. More work is needed, however, to adapt it for the student nurse population. Before further studies are conducted among student nurses, items need to be modified, pilot tested and further analyzed for psychometric properties.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the moral issues to which nursing students are sensitive, qualitative methods can be used to triangulate the data. Mixing the two methods will provide greater insight into how students are able to think through patient care situations that contain moral dilemmas. Very few longitudinal studies identifying moral sensitivity were identified. Though this study identified variation between student cohorts at different levels of education, additional inquiry is needed.</p>
<p>Further, as nurses enter practice, they perceive or attend to moral issues differently than nurses who have many years of patient care experience. Educational programs should consider ways to help support the transition of students into the role of the nurse, emphasizing how to cope with moral issues that can result in moral distress. Patient simulations, with or without high fidelity simulators, provide an opportunity to discover types of moral issues that might arise during patient care experiences. Case studies, specifically designed to uncover examples of moral or ethical dilemmas, offer undergraduate students the opportunity to become familiar with issues that exist in current patient care settings. Narrated stories about the current health system and related issues provide students the opportunity to learn about larger ethical dilemmas tied to the distribution or accessibility of health care. Such educational activities might be more effective in cultivating the development of moral sensitivity.</p>
