<p>Slow, shuffling, dysrhythmic gait is common in people with Parkinson’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511432652">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511432652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511432652">3</xref></sup> Despite advances in medical care, gait disturbance emerges early in the disease process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511432652">4</xref></sup> and worsens as the disease progresses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511432652">5</xref></sup> contributing to loss of independence, falls and poor quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511432652">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511432652">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511432652">7</xref></sup> Many people with Parkinson’s disease are not referred for a specific exercise programme until they have more advanced disease and significant difficulty walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511432652">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511432652">9</xref></sup> However, the early implementation of effective and sustainable exercise interventions may assist in improving and prolonging mobility, independence and quality of life of people with Parkinson’s disease.</p>

Given the limitations of healthcare systems and the need for people with Parkinson’s disease to receive ongoing treatment, this model of treadmill training is not pragmatic or sustainable. Semi-supervised home-based treadmill training could overcome these problems, however no studies to date have investigated the feasibility of home-based treadmill training or its potential to improve walking capacity.</p>
<p>Therefore, this pilot randomized controlled trial aimed to address the following questions: (1) Is home-based treadmill walking training feasible and safe? (2) Is home-based treadmill walking training effective in improving walking capacity, quality of life, walking speed, walking consistency, Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms and fatigue? (3) Are the effects of home-based treadmill walking training maintained at follow-up?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0269215511432652">
<title>Design</title>
<p>An assessor-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled pilot trial of a six-week semi-supervised home-based treadmill walking programme with a six-week follow-up was conducted. The recruitment target was 140 participants, however the trial was discontinued after 20 participants completed the study due to lack of ongoing funding. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT00261781). After baseline assessment, a staff member who was not involved in the trial randomly allocated participants to the treadmill training or control group using opaque envelopes pre-prepared by one investigator (CGC). The allocation ratio for randomization was 1 : 1, so that there were equal numbers of participants in the two groups. All testing and training procedures were coordinated with medication ‘ON’ periods. The study was approved by the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees and all participants gave written informed consent.</p>

<sec id="section12-0269215511432652">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twenty people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease were recruited through advertising in the Parkinson’s New South Wales newsletter and from clinics at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Volunteers were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had mild Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages I–II),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511432652">26</xref></sup> were aged between 30 and 80 years, were sedentary (&lt;2 hours per week of leisure time physical activity in prior three months) and had a stable response to levodopa medications. Volunteers were accepted into the study if they walked unaided but reported a subjective gait disturbance and/or scored one or two on the gait item of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511432652">27</xref></sup> Parkinson’s disease-specific exclusion criteria were: disabling dyskinesias or motor fluctuations; freezing while ‘ON’ medication; or significant balance impairment (&gt;1 on UPDRS postural stability item). Volunteers were also excluded if they: scored less than 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511432652">28</xref></sup> had fallen more than once in the prior year; experienced severe and frequent dizziness; experienced any other neurological/musculoskeletal/cardiopulmonary or metabolic conditions that affected walking; or had any other contraindications to moderate intensity, semi-supervised exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511432652">29</xref></sup> Prior to randomization, each participant was required to provide written medical clearance to certify him/her as safe to participate in the treadmill walking programme. Seventeen participants were being treated with levodopa medications with daily doses ranging from 100 to 1200 mg. Ten participants were also being treated with dopamine agonists with two of these participants taking COMT (catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyl transferase) inhibitors. Three participants (2 control, 1 experimental) were not taking any Parkinson’s disease medications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269215511432652">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The experimental group undertook a semi-supervised home-based programme of 30–40 minutes of treadmill walking, four times a week for six weeks. The full training protocol is available as supplementary material online. In brief, all sessions included a 5-minute warm-up and cool-down of walking in place, sit-to-stand exercise and stretching exercises followed by treadmill walking at 50% of the average speed maintained during the pre-test 6-minute walk test. The intensity of treadmill training was progressed over the six weeks of intervention. Participants initially walked at 60% of the average speed maintained during the pre-test 6-minute walk test to allow them to become accustomed to walking safely on the treadmill. Over subsequent sessions, the walking speed was gradually increased to 80% of the average 6-minute walk test speed. Additional cognitive or manual tasks during walking were introduced systematically from week 4 of training, with participants aiming to maintain stride length during dual tasking. To ensure safety, participants were required to hold onto the treadmill handlebars and to attach a magnetic safety key to their waistband, which would automatically stop the treadmill if the participant stumbled. Treadmills were also fitted with a large safety stop button. Verbal and visual cues were provided to encourage participants to focus on maintaining big steps while walking. A total of seven sessions were supervised, in the participant’s home, by a physiotherapist. Two investigators (CGC and CMD) were responsible for the supervised training sessions. All other sessions were completed independently by the participant. The control group received usual care (i.e. advice to maintain current levels of physical activity).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269215511432652">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Feasibility outcomes collected were exercise adherence, exercise intensity, fatigue, muscle soreness, adverse events (e.g. falls) and exercise acceptability. These were monitored via participant logbooks, consultation between the participant and the training therapist and a post-intervention questionnaire. At the conclusion of every treadmill walking session, participants used the logbook to record the details of the walking completed along with a rating of their muscle fatigue and muscle soreness as none, mild, moderate or severe.</p>
<p>Efficacy outcome measures were made by an assessor blinded to group allocation (NEA). Measurements were taken on admission to the study (pre-test), after six weeks training (post-test) and after a further six weeks (follow-up). Participants were assessed in the Department of Neurology at Westmead Hospital, approximately 1 hour after taking their usual levodopa medication, and the order of measurements was standardized.</p>
<p>The primary outcome measure of efficacy was walking capacity, measured as the distance covered in the 6-minute walk test conducted on a 20 m walkway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511432652">30</xref></sup> Secondary outcome measures were: exercise heart rate, quality of life measured using the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511432652">31</xref></sup>; walking speed, walking speed while performing a concurrent task(s); walking consistency during the 6-minute walk test; Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511432652">27</xref></sup> and fatigue.</p>
<p>Heart rate was measured following 3 minutes of rest and immediately following the 6-minute walk test using a heart rate monitor (Polar Electro, Finland). Walking speed and walking consistency were measured using a 4 m displacement detecting mat (GAITRite instrumentation, CIR Systems Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA) which records gait velocity, step time and step length using custom-built software. Walking speed and walking speed while performing a concurrent task(s) were measured with the GAITRite mat in the middle of a 10 m walkway. The dual task condition involved walking while performing a cognitive colour classification task. The multiple task condition involved walking while performing the colour classification task and carrying a cup full of water. Walking consistency was determined as the coefficients of variation for stride time and stride length recorded during the 6-minute walk test using the GAITRite mat in the middle of a 20 m walkway. Parkinson’s disease-specific motor impairments were rated on the UPDRS motor examination (Subscale III) and participants rated their fatigue during the prior two weeks on a seven-point visual analogue scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269215511432652">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data regarding the feasibility of home-based treadmill walking training is presented descriptively. The coefficients of variation for stride time and stride length were calculated manually using Excel (Microsoft Office Excel 2003), after extracting the raw data from the GAITRite system. To test for between-group effects of the intervention, analysis of covariance was performed using multiple linear regression. Pre-test scores for the primary outcome variable (walking capacity) were entered into the model as a covariate. Separate analyses were performed on the post-test and follow-up data. Analysis was by ‘intention-to-treat’ and data were analysed using SPSS version 16 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty participants were randomized to the treadmill training or control group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511432652">Table 1</xref> reports participant characteristics at baseline and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511432652">Figure 1</xref> shows the study design and the flow of participants through the study. There were three drop-outs: one from the control group (due to an unrelated medical diagnosis requiring surgical intervention) and two from the experimental group. The first drop-out from the experimental group completed only one supervised training session. She complained of chest pain when walking on the treadmill which was likely due to dystonia in her left trapezius muscle. Since the safety protocol for the trial excluded any participant who experienced chest pain while walking, this participant did no further treadmill walking training and declined post-test and follow-up assessment. The second drop-out in the experimental group dropped out after four sessions. She reported the onset of recurrent hip and back pain, associated with lifting a young child. This participant attended post-test assessment, but declined follow-up assessment.</p>

<title>Feasibility of home-based treadmill walking</title>
<p>Home-based treadmill walking training was feasible for the majority of participants. Overall, 186 of a possible 240 treadmill walking sessions i.e. 78% (SD 36) were completed. The eight experimental participants who completed the treadmill walking programme had excellent adherence. Four of these participants reported 100% adherence, and the mean adherence for these eight participants was 94% (SD 8) of the prescribed sessions completed.</p>
<p>Treadmill training details for the nine experimental participants who completed post-test assessment are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511432652">Table 2</xref>. Treadmill walking distance increased from 1.05 km (SD 0.41) at the initial training session to 2.12 km (SD 0.72) at the final training session, six weeks later. On average, participants walked for 28 minutes/session (SD 10) and 11% of total time walking was spent performing a concurrent cognitive or manual task.</p>

<p>Participants tolerated the treadmill walking training with only minimal levels of muscle fatigue or soreness. Of the 186 treadmill walking sessions completed, participants reported 28% of sessions produced no muscle fatigue, 61% mild fatigue, 11% moderate fatigue and no sessions produced severe muscle fatigue. With respect to muscle soreness, participants reported 59% of sessions were associated with no muscle soreness, 36% mild soreness, 5% moderate soreness and no sessions produced severe muscle soreness. No adverse events associated with treadmill training were reported, including any falls during training. Seven of the eight participants who completed the treadmill programme returned the post-training questionnaire. All seven reported feeling confident and comfortable performing home-based treadmill training and no difficulties with the installation or operation of the treadmill were encountered.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This pilot randomized controlled trial shows that a minimally supervised, home-based treadmill walking programme is feasible, acceptable and safe for carefully screened people with mild Parkinson’s disease. However, while the treadmill group reported some improvements in fatigue and quality of life compared to the control group, there was no improvement in walking capacity, walking speed, walking consistency or Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms following home-based treadmill training in this population.</p>
<p>Home-based treadmill walking training at moderate intensity was feasible for 80% of the treadmill group participants. Furthermore, participants reported feeling confident and comfortable performing treadmill training independently at home. However, it must be noted that all participants were carefully screened, had relatively mild Parkinson’s disease, were cognitively intact and conducted all treadmill walking while ‘ON’ medication. The two participants who did not complete the treadmill programme were unable to do so due to musculoskeletal pain caused by factors unrelated to the treadmill programme. The remaining eight treadmill participants had excellent adherence (94%) and did not report any falls or other adverse events.</p>
<p>The frequency of falls during treadmill walking training has been reported in only one previous trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432652">22</xref></sup> Presumably most trials have not reported whether or not participants fell on the treadmill as they have required participants to wear a safety harness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511432652">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432652">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511432652">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511432652">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511432652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511432652">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511432652">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511432652">23</xref></sup> thus preventing injury from falls. However, the absence of falls during treadmill walking in this trial is in contrast to the pilot study reported by Skidmore et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432652">22</xref></sup> where two of the five treadmill participants experienced a total of 11 falls or near-falls in 136 treadmill sessions. These conflicting results are likely to be due to the differing disease severity of the participants and differing safety protocols used in the two studies. Skidmore et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432652">22</xref></sup> conducted a fully supervised, 12-week, laboratory-based study where participants had moderate Parkinson’s disease, walked at a relatively fast speed, wore a safety harness and were encouraged to try not to use the handrails. In contrast, participants in the present semi-supervised, six-week, home-based trial had mild Parkinson’s disease, walked at conservative speeds, did not wear a safety harness and were required to hold the handrail with at least one hand at all times.</p>
<p>In this pilot study home-based treadmill training did not produce any meaningful improvement in walking capacity, walking speed or walking consistency. This is in contrast to fully supervised facility-based studies which have shown improvements in these measures following treadmill training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511432652">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432652">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511432652">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511432652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511432652"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511432652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511432652">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511432652">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432652"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511432652">23</xref></sup> The poor improvement in the current study may indicate that the home-based treadmill training was not of sufficient intensity, potentially due to the requirement for participants to be able to train safely on their own. As home-based treadmill walking appears to be a feasible and pragmatic form of exercise training for suitable people with Parkinson’s disease, further research investigating methods to safely increase the dose (intensity and/or duration) of this form of training is warranted.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of improvement in the 6-minute walk test, participants in the current trial walked twice as far on the treadmill in the final training session compared with the first training session (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511432652">Table 2</xref>), indicating substantial progress in their capacity to walk on the treadmill. The treadmill group also demonstrated improvement in general fatigue level compared to the control group, as well as a trend towards a smaller increase in heart rate during the 6-minute walk test at post test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511432652">Table 3</xref>), suggesting an improvement in cardiovascular fitness. Furthermore, the treadmill group reported greater improvement in quality of life at follow-up than the control group. This improvement in quality of life at follow-up may have been because seven of the treadmill group participants self-reported increasing the amount of walking that they did in the follow-up period compared to before commencing the trial (two of these continued to use a treadmill).</p>
<p>The results from the present trial combined with the overall favourable results from previously published facility-based studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511432652">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511432652">25</xref></sup> suggest a full-scale trial into the effectiveness of home-based treadmill training is justified. Walking capacity effect sizes reported in previous studies suggest a between-group difference of 50 m in the 6-minute walk test could be reasonably expected from an effective treadmill walking programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432652">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511432652">19</xref></sup> A standard power calculation based on this effect size and the variability found in the current trial indicates that a sample size of 100 (50 per group) would be required for a full-scale trial.</p>
<p>The improvement in fatigue in the current trial is in contrast to the findings of a recent trial where 12 weeks of gym-based exercise did not improve fatigue levels in people with Parkinson’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511432652">32</xref></sup> However, participants in the current trial reported good adherence to the treadmill walking programme, completing an average of 2.6 sessions per week, whereas participants in the gym programme had poor adherence, completing an average of 1.25 sessions per week. It may be that the frequency of the exercise completed by the participants in the gym-based trial was insufficient to reduce fatigue.</p>
<p>There were a number of limitations to this study. We were unable to attract ongoing funding and, therefore, we could not recruit the number of participants indicated by our a priori sample size calculation. As far as we are aware, this is the first trial of home-based treadmill training to be reported. As such, we used strict critieria for inclusion and excluded those with disabling dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, freezing while ‘ON’ medication as well as significant balance or cognitive impairment. Therefore, our findings have limited generalizability beyond the population investigated. However, it is possible that home-based treadmill training may be safely implemented in a wider population of people with Parkinson’s disease. Given the demonstrated and likely benefits of exercise and physical activity for people with Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511432652">33</xref></sup> home-based treadmill walking may be a feasible and sustainable exercise option and this warrants further investigation.</p>
