<abstract>
<p>This study qualitatively assesses the acceptability and feasibility of a school-located vaccination for influenza (SLIV) project that was conducted in New York State in 2009–2011, from the perspectives of project participants with different roles. Fourteen in-depth semistructured interviews with participating schools’ personnel and the mass vaccinator were tape-recorded and transcribed. Interviewees were randomly selected from stratified lists and included five principals, five school nurses, two school administrators, and two lead personnel from the mass vaccinator. A content analysis of transcripts from the interviews was completed and several themes emerged. All participants generally found the SLIV project acceptable. School personnel and the vaccinator viewed the SLIV project process as feasible and beneficial. However, the vaccinator identified difficulties with third-party billing as a potential threat to sustainability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Each year, influenza disease among children causes a substantial number of office and emergency department visits, as well as hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512452667">Bourgeois, Valim, Wei, McAdam, &amp; Mandl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512452667">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512452667">Neuzil, Mellen, Wright, Mitchel, &amp; Griffen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512452667">O’Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512452667">Poehling et al., 2006</xref>). In 2008, annual influenza vaccination of all children 6 months to 18 years of age was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Association of Family Practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512452667">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). Most school-age children who receive influenza vaccine do so in a primary care practice, but these practices may not have the capacity to vaccinate all their patients before influenza’s arrival in the community. School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) provides an alternative, as SLIV offers the ability to vaccinate large number of children over a short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512452667">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). However, there are a variety of challenges with respect to implementation and financing both the vaccine and its administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512452667">Carpenter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512452667">Hull, Frauendienst, Gundersen, Monsen, &amp; Fishbein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512452667">King et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512452667">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2011</xref>). For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a competitive funding opportunity announcement (RFA-IP-08-007) to support the development of a demonstration project to determine the feasibility of SLIV when conducted with a private mass vaccinator and third-party billing.</p>
<p>Studies of SLIV have demonstrated that extensive coordination and collaboration are needed between the public health system, providers, school systems, and insurers in order to conduct SLIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512452667">Carpenter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512452667">Daley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512452667">Hull, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512452667">King et al., 2006</xref>) School nurses, in particular, are often active partners in SLIV programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512452667">Hall &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). However, little detailed information exists on their experiences of the SLIV process. In order for SLIV to be broadly adopted, a better understanding of the perspectives of program partners with different roles is needed, including those of school nurses who represent a vital link between sponsoring health departments and schools, on barriers encountered and possible solutions. The purpose of this study of the SLIV project conducted in Monroe County, NY, in fall 2009 and fall 2010 was to examine qualitatively (1) the acceptability and feasibility of SLIV and (2) the experiences of school nurses and administrators, as well as the mass vaccinator, over the two project years.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1059840512452667">
<title>Background</title>
<p>This study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial, which was approved by the Research Subjects Review Boards (RSRB) of the University of Rochester and the Monroe County Department of Public Health in 2008. This qualitative interview study was approved by the RSRB in 2011. Elementary schools were randomized to standard-of-care (i.e., no school involvement in seasonal influenza vaccination) or to one of two intervention arms. The intervention arms included SLIV with two different intensity levels (high and low intensity) of recruiting children to the SLIV program through various media, for example, written notices, presence of project staff at school open houses, and automated telephone messaging. Low-intensity schools involved an introductory letter sent to parents, a backpack reminder with parent consent form, and two subsequent reminders. High-intensity schools included these same points of contact, plus a second backpack kit (reminder and parent consent) and two autodialer reminders to the home. Additionally, schools were stratified by location (urban, suburban).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840512452667">Table 2</xref> summarizes project activities. In 2009, in addition to seasonal influenza vaccine, H1N1 (pandemic flu) vaccine was recommended, but not offered as part of this project. Vaccine clinics were conducted from November 3, 2009 to December 18, 2009, and November 02, 2010, to November 18, 2010. In 2009, two clinics per school were held; in 2010, only one clinic per school was offered. At each clinic, the mass vaccinator provided at least one registered nurse and a clerk. When children arrived in the clinical area, each child’s consent form and identity were checked. Children received the vaccine (injectable or nasal) requested on their consent form unless their medical history contraindicated this.</p>
<p>The partner teams for this project consisted of representatives from participating schools, including school administrators, principals, and school nurses; a local mass vaccinator, and the logistical coordination team.</p>
<sec id="section4-1059840512452667">
<title>The school partner</title>
<p>While individual schools were the target of intervention, it was first necessary to receive district approval for participation in the project. The Director of the Monroe County Department of Health (MCDPH) met with county school districts and outlined the project’s purpose, proposed role of schools, and plan to randomize school assignments. After a school district agreed to participate and schools were randomized, the district administration for intervention schools received a letter of intent outlining elements of parental consent and confidentiality. Logistics were handled district by district, and the role of school nurses was determined school by school. All schools in the county had an associated nurse, but not all worked full-time at a single school. School nurses and principals were consulted in each participating school building, and specific duties related to managing program logistics were assigned based on work load.</p>
<p>Participating schools were located in Monroe County, NY, population 744,322 according to the 2010 census (United States 2010 Census, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512452667">n.d.</xref>). Twenty-one schools participated each year; these represented six districts in 2009 and five in 2010. Schools that participated in Year 1 were invited to participate in Year 2. One suburban district with three participating schools withdrew after Year 1; another participating district added four schools in Year 2. A summary of school demographics, including high-intensity, low-intensity, and control group school, is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512452667">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>The mass vaccinator</title>
<p>In-school vaccination was delivered by local mass vaccinator, Health Checkpoint, at the University of Rochester Medical Center’s School of Nursing’s Center for Nursing Entrepreneurship. Part of the Center for Entrepreneurship’s mission is to identify and create new partnerships with students, alumni, local businesses, and nonprofit organizations and to both coordinate and publicize school-based experiences. Health Checkpoint agreed to give vaccines in schools and bill insurers as would be done in other public clinics. They managed influenza vaccine ordering, storage, administration, and billing in their routine manner. They obtained permission from the state health department to administer Vaccine for Children (VFC) vaccine and worked with third-party payers to arrange payment. They also contacted each intervention school to schedule Vaccine Days.</p>

<sec id="section6-1059840512452667">
<title>The logistical coordination team</title>
<p>Consisting of staff from the MCDPH and the University of Rochester’s Center for Community Health, the logistical coordination team provided oversight of all project activities and acted as a liaison between participating schools’ staff and the mass vaccinator. The coordination team performed several duties including: being available to answer parents’ and others’ questions about vaccines and clinics; managing consent forms; developing and distributing notification materials for parents. Parent notification modes included (1) a wide range of print materials sent home in students’ backpacks or mailed, with report cards or separately, (2) pre-recorded telephone messages with SLIV information delivered by automated school emergency notification systems, and (3) the SLIV project website. Blank consent forms were mailed to parents 8–10 weeks before Vaccine Days; students returned completed forms to school. The logistical coordination team reviewed all consent forms for completeness, created lists for each school, and gave counts to the mass vaccinator.</p>

Those who reported no direct involvement were ineligible for participation in the qualitative portion of the study. In all, 18 principals and 12 nurses were eligible. Using a random number generator in Microsoft Excel, principals and school nurses were randomly selected from the four categories of schools based on location (urban, suburban) and intensity of intervention (high or low doses parent notification). To increase the number of schools represented, only one staff per school was allowed to participate. All but one randomly selected subject agreed to the interview. Administrators from all participating school districts were solicited for participation in the qualitative portion of the study, with administrators from two districts ultimately choosing to participate. Finally, representation from the mass vaccinator was solicited, including personnel involved in direct administration of vaccines within the schools as well as an agency supervisor. In all, 14 individuals from four categories of stakeholders were interviewed: principals (<italic>n</italic> = 5), school nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 5), district administrators (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and the mass vaccinator’s lead personnel (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Ten different schools were represented.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The interviewer was an experienced communications researcher who had not been involved with SLIV implementation. All interviews were conducted by telephone (Telspan<sup>®</sup>), recorded, transcribed by an independent contractor, and de-identified before delivery to the authors for coding and analysis.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512452667">Heieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>) began with thorough review of the transcripts and discussion of emerging topics. Transcripts were reviewed line by line, lists of categories and subcategories were identified, and quotes extracted. The transcripts were reevaluated to group categories into broader conceptual themes and reviewed for their relevance to the research question. A single author (JC) coded each transcript to maintain continuity. All codes were entered into a spreadsheet and compared across and within stakeholder groups. The emerging categories and themes were reviewed and revised by the investigators iteratively during weekly conference calls and e-mail exchanges. Memos were written throughout the analysis to record the analytic process, as categories were grouped and themes developed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Program feedback from key stakeholders focused on six areas of program implementation.</p>
<sec id="section12-1059840512452667">
<title>Commitment From Schools</title>
<p>School administrators noted that having strongly established relationships with the health department was key to achieving commitment to participate. While program commitment was initiated at the district level, school principals and school nurses were engaged early on to ensure successful implementation. Having SLIV details clearly described in advance helped school personnel evaluate the program’s fit for their specific school. Principals particularly valued the school nurse’s assessment on how the program would impact school staff. One principal noted, “I actually think the decision to participate should be done by the building principal and the school nurse. I think it should be a joint decision because it impacts both the day-to-day operation of the building as well as what takes place in the nurse’s office.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1059840512452667">
<title>Planning</title>
<p>School districts needed lead time during the planning stage to address program logistics, and schools needed time to build internal agreement. Both district administrators and school-based staff noted the importance of being treated as active and equal partners, and having ample opportunity to comment on implementation. One administrator said, “We [school district and the logical coordination team] met several times  . . . so that we could work through pieces that might be confusing . . . and that worked well for us.”</p>
<p>The logistical coordination team was credited with keeping in contact with school personnel and being accommodating to school needs. One principal stated, “ . . . they went right with what we wanted and were very accommodating. Anything we wanted to change up from their recommendation they changed up.”</p>
<p>School personnel expressed difficulty defining and evaluating the school nurse’s role. Some principals and nurses wanted to “protect” the school nurse from SLIV involvement during all phases. Principals were primarily concerned that the nurse would be pulled away from normal health services. While nurses shared this concern, some believed they could serve as a key liaison between parents and project personnel. One nurse emphasized the importance of involving the school nurse, “because obviously parents are going to call the Health Office if they have questions, more than the Main Office or the Principal’s Office.” Because they felt responsible for the well-being of children in their schools, even nurses who knew they lacked the time to actively contribute to project planning or implementation wanted to do so. Many felt their contribution was vital because they were keenly aware of the social, language, and medical needs of their own school populations. As one school nurse noted, “I was there just to give my input on how well I thought it would go in the building.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1059840512452667">
<title>Program Promotion to Parents</title>
<p>School personnel, including school nurses, wanted to consult on materials for families because they know the best methods to communicate and have important insight into literacy and language barriers. School nurses noted that not having materials that clearly come from the school is a barrier when reaching out to families to encourage participation. One nurse said, “Maybe they see it as something separate from the school. Maybe a letter with the school logo/letterhead on it . . . a letter from the principal and the health office saying we’re hosting this clinic. We feel it’s really important . . . ” Principals agreed, pointing out, “If it doesn't have that school name on it or my name on it they're just going to throw it out. If they get something from the Health Department it's going to be like, `What is this?'”</p>
<p>District administrators further desired that promotion materials highlight the specific health benefits to children and families: “. . . we make it very clear that this is for the benefit of the kids and their families because they won’t be bringing germs home from school. So that the positive effects are really emphasized. . . .” Both school personnel and vaccine providers felt SLIV project promotion needed to be more intense in years when media coverage on influenza’s severity for children was less intense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1059840512452667">
<title>Managing the Consent Process</title>
<p>Managing the consent process was the project’s most labor-intensive aspect for school personnel, and for school nurses in particular. It was important to identify a person in each school to be responsible for distributing, collecting, and transferring consent forms to the logistical coordination team. In some schools, the principal assumed this role because of staff shortages. However, more often it was the nurse who assumed this role, which sometimes led to confusion about their responsibilities within the overall SLIV project. For instance, while nurses knew to refer parents’ questions on SLIV to the logistical coordination team, they wanted to uphold their established relationship with parents and address concerns: “We try to tell them we’re not involved, but the fact that it’s happening here . . . we are involved. It’s happening here so parents didn’t like that answer.”</p>
<p>Some nurses expressed frustration with the lack of flexibility when a parent wanted their child vaccinated but had not returned the consent by the deadline. From their different perspective, the mass vaccinators noted occasional poor communication between the school staff and parents, both in enforcing the deadline for returning consent forms and not being notified when a consented child got vaccinated elsewhere. School nurses noted that a 3-week span between the deadline for returning consents and Vaccine Day was too long. One nurse said, “I don't think [parents] always remembered to tell us [about vaccines received elsewhere] because we wound up with a few phone calls saying, `Why did my kid get the vaccine?! They already went to the doctor.'”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1059840512452667">
<title>Day of the Clinic</title>
<p>Managing logistics on Vaccine Day varied by building, with the principal or school nurse usually leading coordination. School personnel emphasized the importance of having adults beyond the logistical coordination team and mass vaccinator team available. Nurses wanted help with younger and special needs children. Principals specifically wanted familiar school personnel accompanying children to/from classrooms, and to reassure and comfort them. However, despite advanced planning, too few familiar and trusted staff or volunteers were on hand at most clinics.</p>
<p>Most respondents felt that the project partners collaborated smoothly on clinic days. Principals and nurses found the mass vaccinator to be efficient: “They did their jobs, they got people through, everybody was vaccinated in a timely fashion. It was kind of like a regular doctor’s office where you made an appointment, you went in, you got what you needed to get. That’s why there weren’t too many complaints. People got what they were expecting to get.” However, some problems were noted. Breakdowns in communication within a school could culminate in disorganization on clinic day. For example, both years the vaccinator arrived at an appointed school and found the time of the clinic had been changed or no one from the school had been assigned to manage logistics for setting up and supervising the clinic.</p>
<p>Breakdowns in communication from parents also led to confusion on clinic days. Opinions varied on the appropriate course when children claimed to have already been vaccinated. School nurses expressed their willingness to be involved in such cases: “I just wish now in hindsight that they would have come to us if a child said like ‘I’m not supposed to get it’ or something.” In a few cases, children received duplicate vaccines and this troubled all participating staff. Principals and nurses also noted occasional communication breakdown between parents and children, that is, parents had not prepared children for getting being vaccinated at school. School staff did not like having to explain a parental health decision to children.</p>
<p>School nurses and mass vaccinator nurses sometimes had different opinions on managing a child who was visibly upset. School nurses said the vaccinator appeared unwilling to deviate from the list of students for whom they had consent: “If we just dropped the students off down there and then somebody cried and said they didn’t want it, they still gave it to them because they had a form.” Mass vaccinator personnel tended to describe their role as providing protection for children according to the parent’s written consent and noted that not having the chance to consult parents at the point of care was a different, and not completely comfortable, experience than they had in traditional public clinics.</p>
<p>Some school nurses expressed frustration with not being able to be actively involved on the day of the clinic due to competing priorities. One nurse commented, “I really had very limited involvement that day because I was swamped in my office.” However, other nurses were ambivalent regarding their involvement, as it added stress to their already heavy workloads: “ . . . it falls back to a health issue, so the last two principals felt that the health office should be involved with it. And I understand where they’re coming from but it’s hard, because<italic> we’re so short-staffed.</italic>”</p>
<p>Mass vaccinator personnel felt school participation was similar in both years, but noted important gains for children in Year 2. In particular, children who returned for vaccination during Year 2 had generally positive recollections of their experience the previous year. These children acted as a natural peer model for younger children who were participating in SLIV for the first time. “What was…different was the enthusiasm of the kids. The kids were much more engaged the second year . . . that peer model that made all the difference . . . the older kids were cheering on the younger kids.”</p>
<p>Both school and mass vaccinator personnel found offering two clinics per school problematic because it increased pressure on all parties to track vaccines given elsewhere. The second clinic was poorly attended, adding to vaccinator costs. In project Year 2, children who needed a second dose were referred to primary care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1059840512452667">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>School personnel generally felt SLIV was successful. They supported ongoing SLIV, especially to reduce absenteeism. One nurse observed, “I don’t have any real numbers but I’ve been in school nursing for 20 years and I know that flu season is . . . we’re always pretty heavily hit…and it seems to me it’s being effective. I don’t have near the amount of absentees as in the past.” Principals and nurses noted the convenience and benefits of SLIV for families and believed many children would not otherwise have been vaccinated. School principals felt the program worked well, and neither unduly disturbed school activities nor burdened schools. Their main regret was that vaccines were not available to school staff.</p>
<p>School nurses noted some negative consequences of in-school vaccinations. In particular, nurses worried about the lasting impact on their relationship with children for whom the clinic was a traumatic experience. “I actually have another student who would not come to see me for quite a while because I held them [while they were getting vaccinated]. They did not want to come to my office, thinking they would get another shot.” Another nurse noted that the resulting fear associated with getting a shot at school lingers beyond the clinic day. “It was very upsetting to them to think they were going to the gym to get a shot. The next day some of the kids actually did not want to go to gym class. They thought they were going to get another shot. They were very upset.”</p>
<p>The mass vaccinator expressed satisfaction with being involved in the SLIV project and felt they contributed to a healthier community. They believed that SLIV increased their access to children who did not usually seek influenza vaccine, but were unsure if it was feasible to sustain the project given challenges with billing and reimbursement. One mass vaccinator stated, “You really have to have a complete understanding of whether or not you are going to be financially remunerated for your services in the model that you can sustain.” Billing government-based insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid) was particularly challenging. Although reimbursement was not assured, it was decided, for this project, to take a financial loss and vaccinate all eligible children rather than limiting access.</p>

<sec id="section18-1059840512452667">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In most previous SLIV studies, the project model was substantially different. In these, usually the study funder provided project personnel and vaccine without charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512452667">Carpenter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512452667">Hull et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512452667">King et al., 2006</xref>). In the model described here, school personnel invested considerable time in planning, promotion, and coordinating the process without remuneration.</p>
<p>Overall, results of this study highlight the feasibility of SLIV for elementary school-age children. Stakeholders, including participating school nurses, found the SLIV project manageable. However, a great deal of communication between all partners, with school personnel as active participants, was necessary throughout project years. School nurses recognized that breakdowns in in-school communication were most common in schools that were stressed, understaffed, or suffered from high staff turnover. It was key for schools to identify and assign a point person to work with the project partners and manage school-based logistics. When the school nurse is identified as the lead, the duties related to SLIV cannot interfere with day-to-day health needs of the school students. This study also revealed the importance of a flexible SLIV model that can adjust to the structure and culture of a given school. Project partners suggested creating a checklist for schools to help them assign roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>When replicating this model for SLIV (i.e., using a private mass vaccinator with ability to administer VFC vaccine and third-party billing), significant planning time is needed. Planning should begin during the year prior to the target for implementation. It is also important to clearly define roles and responsibilities for managing the consent process and Vaccine Day activities. Overall, Vaccine Days were viewed as well worth the effort, causing minimal disruption to the school day.</p>
<p>School leaders wanted to shield nurses from the added burden of SLIV, while the nurses were conflicted regarding their involvement. While nurses felt the pressure of meeting their regular duties, they equally felt a sense of responsibility and obligation to SLIV as being a school-based health activity. Their feelings were driven by a sense of accountability to families and a desire to maintain those relationships. Developing a decision guide to assist principals and nurses in thinking through how best to manage an SLIV program in their school, and what additional help is needed for Vaccine Day, would be beneficial.</p>
<p>This study also points to the importance of a project team coordinator to ensure oversight and ongoing communication between stakeholders. This role could perhaps be filled by a health department or other coordinating group within a county or district. Also, participants noted that deciding on a primary point person at each school was essential, but the choice of point person and scope of responsibility depended on individual school culture. School and mass vaccinator personnel desired ongoing planning meetings throughout subsequent project years in order to use experience to the project’s benefit.</p>
<sec id="section19-1059840512452667">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This evaluation had several limitations. Participants in this study were from a single demonstration project that utilized a specific model for SLIV (with a private mass vaccinator that billed third-party payers). The project was conducted during two consecutive years, one of which was the H1N1 pandemic that occurred during the project. The purpose of this qualitative study was not, however, to identify themes generalizable to all SLIV programs, but to gain an in-depth understanding of one program experience from which others may learn. Because the sample size for these in-depth interviews was small (<italic>n</italic> = 14), it was not possible to deeply explore differences between schools (e.g., urban vs. suburban).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, results of this study highlight the acceptability and feasibility of SLIV for elementary school-age children. Stakeholders found the SLIV project manageable, but noted that a great deal of communication between all partners, with school personnel as active participants, was necessary throughout project years. The mass vaccinator questioned the long-term financial sustainability of the model due to problems experienced in the third-party billing process.</p>
<p>It was important for schools to identify and assign a point person to work with the project partners and manage school-based logistics. When the school nurse is identified as the lead, the duties related to SLIV cannot interfere with day-to-day health needs of the school students. This study also revealed the importance of a flexible SLIV model that can adjust to the structure and culture of a given school.</p>
<p>The project was relatively easy for schools to manage and caused minimal disruption to regular school-day activities. Lessons learned from previous year’s experiences were valuable in refining and adjusting the model to maximize efficiency. Development of planning and decision-making tools informed by successful implementation of SLIV could be beneficial for future SLIV programs. When replicating this model for SLIV (i.e., using a private mass vaccinator with ability to administer VFC vaccine and third-party billing), significant planning time is needed to adequately address areas such as identification of the appropriate point person from within the school, developing strategies for communication with parents, and clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of the school nurse leading up to and during Vaccine Day. Planning should begin during the year prior to the target for implementation. It is also important to clearly define roles and responsibilities for managing the consent process and Vaccine Day activities.</p>
