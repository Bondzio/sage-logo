<abstract>
<p>The long history related to the purpose and development of special schools to accommodate the needs of gifted students has been fraught with celebration and concern, envy, and disappointment. The site or location of the school, entry criteria, competencies of the faculty, test scores and evidence of awards received by students relative to different types of competitions, and graduation entries to prestigious schools are often used to determine the efficacy of a special school for the gifted. Regardless of the professional and personal responses evoked by special schools for the gifted, they have ignited the consistent inquiry into a series of educational questions: What is special about a special school for the gifted? and How do special schools for the gifted influence each other?</p>

<p>An informal examination of a set of elementary public schools within the same large urban school district labeled specifically as “special schools” to respond to the needs, interests, and abilities of gifted students reveals some elements that can be generalized to all specials schools. This examination is centered on one feature of special schools: implementation of a differentiated curriculum. While many special schools outline their curriculum as appropriate for the gifted, the variance or gap between what is stated and intended for the gifted and what is actually practiced is the basis to answer this question: Is this really a special school for the gifted? More importantly, this question can be readdressed: Is this really an appropriate intellectual environment for the gifted?</p>
<p>The degree of fidelity related to the concept of implementing a differentiated curriculum seems to distinguish the “specialness” of the school. Implementation of the differentiated curriculum appears to be contingent on the interpretation of the role of the basic or core curriculum juxtaposed to the differentiated curriculum for the gifted. The range of interpreting the implementation of differentiated curriculum within the set of special schools is illustrated by the following patterns.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1076217513487186" position="anchor">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1076217513487186-img1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The variance in the patterns of implementation reveals variances in the belief of the value attributed to recognizing and attending to the gifted. These patterns uncover a significant factor about special schools for the gifted: the struggle with compliance to the basic or core curriculum and the perceived latitude to be given to the implementation of the differentiated curriculum. This struggle is not totally addressed in a school’s philosophy and practices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217513487186">Table 1</xref>). The literature defining differentiated curriculum is replete with how to establish the relationship between the core and differentiated curriculum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1076217513487186">Table 2</xref>). However, constructing this relationship is confounded by test scores that emanate from achievement of the basic and not differentiated curriculum; evaluations of the teachers’, administrators’, and school’s recorded performance indicators; and parental concern that differentiated curriculum could obliterate the basic skill sets necessary for achievement. The prevailing issue is how special a special school can be without addressing the relationship between the core and differentiated curriculum, and how and why one curriculum becomes superordinate or subordinate as they coexist.</p>

<p>Further examination of differentiated curriculum at special schools designated for the gifted appear to equate differentiated curriculum with the exhibition of flamboyant products and a collection of trophies and ribbons. The presentation of products more dependent on the types of materials provided and the expenditure of time on task rather than the qualities of intellectual rigor are erroneous methods to showcase the gifted or the school for these students. Walking down the hall surrounded by products and prizes awarded to the gifted, parents and even educators are awed by what they perceive makes the gifted and the school “special.” The issue is not to negate the worth of the products or the prizes. The problem is to recognize explicitly that these artifacts should be an outgrowth of differentiated curriculum and not a consequence of isolated or enrichment experiences that are adjuncts rather than internal activities of a differentiated curriculum. It has appeared that some special schools perceive that products and awards are necessary to underscore their specialness. Attributing a school as a special school for the gifted has to transcend the exhibition of products and prizes without affirming the integral relationship of these items to a differentiated curriculum.</p>
<p>The short-term or immediate outcomes of the special school’s differentiated curriculum are sometimes given more credence than are the long-term goals of the same curriculum. To this end, grades and achievement scores are deemed to discern and confirm the students’ and school’s success as a special school for the gifted. An assessment of the link between academic achievement and the development of scholarliness has not been discussed by many of these special schools or even considered as a feature of their mission statement. Basically, deciding in what ways the differentiated curriculum reinforces assisting students in their evolution to become a scholar is not typically included in the stated goals of the school. The goal of nurturing scholarliness transcends “good grades” and high-test scores. Scholarliness requires an environmental setting that affords gifted students opportunities to respond to their curiosity and even more vital, the school facilitates the development of the gifted students’ abilities to arouse and sustain curiosity by and for themselves. It is important to remember that schools can be scholarly without being labeled as special.</p>
<p>An analysis of the mission statement and classroom implementation of curriculum for the gifted reflected of the public special school X can be used to note the dissonance between theoretical statements of curricular intent and actual practices. Classrooms A and B exemplify two distinct means by which the same mission statement has been interpreted. The curriculum in each of these classrooms are exemplars of educators and parents assuming compliance to a goal without clear adherence to stated criteria guiding attainment of the stated goal.</p>
<p>There would be little argument that the curriculum in both Classrooms A and B broadly meet the expectations of the mission statement of the special school. A comparison of Classrooms A and B illustrates what can be termed <italic>nuanced</italic> from <italic>appropriate</italic> differentiation. Nuanced differentiation is represented by Classroom A because it exemplifies a curriculum distinguished by some elements that make it different from what gifted students traditionally confront in their classrooms. Classroom B is representative of “appropriately responsive” differentiation represented by the researched qualities of a curriculum designed for the gifted. Parents, teachers, and gifted students often are tantalized by the nuanced rather than the appropriately responsive curriculum. Facilitating curricular decision making requires knowledge. Determining the efficacy between the professed ideal and the reality of an appropriate differentiated curriculum for the gifted requires parents and educators of the gifted to recognize and apply a set of referenced criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1076217513487186">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The debate that special schools for the gifted cater to and create elitism provides a provocative platform for discussions of the merit of special schools for the gifted. Some of the special schools for the gifted have maintained their reputation on their abilities to define themselves as separate educational settings because their population comprises the gifted and not because they have a differentiated curriculum appropriately aligned to the gifted. A closer analysis of special schools for the gifted needs to rely on the differentiated curriculum and not be dependent on the differences in the population that participates at the school.</p>
<p>The discussion regarding special schools for the gifted often reverts into a debate revolving around the questions: Why are special schools for the gifted necessary? and Are special schools for the gifted really special? One way to respond and resolve some of these issues is to consider the quality of the differentiated curriculum that is offered by how the curriculum is implemented in special schools. It is also imperative to discern the curriculum that these schools offer and to analyze the immediate and long-term effects of the differentiated curriculum. There are multiple roles for special schools for the gifted. One role is decidedly to accommodate gifted students, and a second underplayed but significant role is to provide a model for all schools to ignite potential in all students.</p>
