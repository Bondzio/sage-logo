<abstract>
<p>Competing demands and a nursing shortage have contributed to a managerial workforce that is overworked and a health care environment that is under constant tension. The short supply and high turnover of manager positions, upwards of 30% in some regions in Canada, have contributed to an unstable work environment. The aim of this study examined the stress experiences and coping strategies of nurse managers in an acute care setting. Semi-structured interviews of five nurse managers were included in this pilot study. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the transcribed text. Six descriptive themes related to work stressors were identified: fiscal responsibilities, inadequate human resources, managing others, intrapersonal distress, middle management role and competing priorities. Three descriptive themes related to coping strategies were identified: peer and superior support, cognitive coping strategies and social and personal strategies. Findings indicate that coping mechanisms lessened the work stressors experienced by managers, but it was not always evident managers felt confident in their ability to cope effectively. Senior nurse leaders play an integral role in assuming responsibility for equipping managers with appropriate preparation and support to facilitate their success and to enhance the attractiveness of the manager role to potential recruits.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111434189" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health care restructuring in North America over the past decade has had a profound and distressing impact on nursing leadership in health care organisations. In the 1990s in Canada, organisational restructuring in health care institutions occurred in response to the need to address fiscal challenges and to create more efficient patient-care delivery systems. Programme management structures replaced traditional departmental structures and radically changed nursing leadership structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111434189">Baumann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111434189">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The restructuring efforts involved downsizing the nursing workforce and resulted in the initial exodus of nurse managers in acute care settings, while simultaneously expanding the work responsibilities for those remaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111434189">Canadian Nursing Advisory Committee (CNAC), 2002)</xref>. Specifically, a reconfiguration of the head-nurse role and an erosion of nursing leadership affected staff nurses’ work life. With organisational change, head nurses assumed the role of nurse manager and took on administrative responsibilities of senior leaders who had been laid off. The meaningful relationship nurses had with supervisors was lost because supervisors were less accessible or visible; the supportive role of the head nurse as a coach and mentor was also lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111434189">CNAC, 2002</xref>). The role change adversely affected the working dynamics and the relationships between nurses and their managers. Nurse managers play a critical role in creating a health care work environment that facilitates the delivery of high quality professional nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111434189">CNAC, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111434189">Laschinger et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The employment profile of Registered Nurses (RNs) in administration in Canada was 17,039 (6.4%) in 2009 as compared to 16,028 (6.4%) in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111434189">Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111434189">2010</xref>). The number of RNs assuming a manager or assistant manager role was 13,790 (5.2%) in 2009 as compared to 12,868 (5.1%) in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111434189">CIHI, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111434189">2009</xref>). Although the growth of nurses assuming administrative roles appears to have slowly increased, there remains a concern for the recruitment and retention of individuals in nursing leadership roles and the value placed on work-life balance by the younger generation of nurses likely to apply for management positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111434189">Laschinger et al., 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111434189">Statistics Canada (2007)</xref>, 67% of head nurses and nurse supervisors report the highest work stress among health care providers. These data point to the challenges and stressors nurse managers continue to encounter given the constant changes in the health care environment.</p>
<p>As leaders in the health care system, nurse managers find themselves challenged by increasingly complex issues requiring more effective and positive role modelling for staff and higher levels of productivity amidst financial and human resource constraints. Nurse managers must respond to and balance multiple and competing demands by defining, prioritising and implementing their responsibilities to meet the goals of the organisation, frequently with inadequate training and support. The role of the contemporary nurse manager has been reorganised by subordinating the clinical practice role in favour of new managerial practices associated with productivity and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111434189">Rankin and Campbell, 2006</xref>). The nurse manager must possess keen knowledge in areas not specific to traditional nursing practices, such as information technology, human resources and financial management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111434189">Gould et al., 2001</xref>). Yet studies have shown that nurses in a managerial role perceive themselves as having many tasks and duties for which they feel ill-prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111434189">Shirey et al., 2008</xref>; Udod and Care, 2011). Despite the magnitude and complexity of the role, senior administration appears unable to offer sufficient support and resources for managers to enhance the effectiveness of their role. As such, performance expectations for nurse managers are often seen as unrealistic (Courtney et al., 2002 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111434189">Cruickshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111434189">Shirey et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there have been some studies on managerial stress, few study how nurse managers cope with their job responsibilities. Nurse managers work in an increasingly complex work environment, placing them under considerable stress as they struggle to uphold standards of care, implementing authorised organisational initiatives and mentoring, recruiting and retaining staff nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111434189">Judkins and Ingram, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111434189">VanOyen Force, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111434189">Bailey, 2009</xref>). The literature on nurse manager stress has reported a culture of acceptance and expectation of work stressors combined with a lack of awareness of ways to proactively manage stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111434189">Rodham and Bell, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111434189">Shirey (2009)</xref> found nurse managers who worked in a negative environment felt they had less ability to express themselves, minimal support from superiors and less energy to perform at an optimal level of performance.</p>
<p>The organisational culture plays a significant role in nurse manager stress and role satisfaction. Studies found that wider spans of control, organisational demands and time constraints resulted in limited opportunities for interaction between the manager and nursing staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111434189">Laschinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111434189">McCutcheon et al., 2009</xref>). These interactions may decrease the ability of the manager and nursing staff to develop high quality, growth fostering relationships, thus hampering nurses’ ability to experience satisfaction in their work role and motivation to assume a future leadership role.</p>
<p>Nurse executives are challenged to recruit and retain nurse managers. This can have a negative impact on succession planning. Succession planning strategies are priorities for health care institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111434189">Laschinger et al., 2008</xref>). Staff nurses view the manager role as complex and stressful, thus making the job of nurse manager an unattractive option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2006</xref>). The short supply and high turnover of manager positions have contributed to an unstable work environment. The nursing shortage ultimately will affect the availability of future nurse managers. An underinvestment in building leadership potential tends to leave managers ill-prepared to adequately assume fiscal and human resource responsibilities and provide effective leadership. This in turn adds to their stress and affects their ability to cope. By creating a better understanding of the roles and responsibilities of nurse managers and reducing workplace stressors, organisations might better support and enhance the development of nurse managers as a way to retain and support nurse managers and recruit future managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111434189">Schroeder and Worrall-Carter, 2002</xref>). The aim of the study is to explore the stress experiences and coping strategies of nurse managers in an acute care setting in Canada as a way to recruit and retain individuals in nurse manager roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111434189">Udod and Care, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1744987111434189" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111434189"><title>Design</title>
<p>A qualitative, descriptive design was chosen as a means to understand an event or experience in everyday terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987111434189">Sandelowski, 2000</xref>). A qualitative design allows for in-depth questioning and probing and eliciting managers’ perceptions and practices of their work stress experiences and coping strategies. Semi-structured open-ended interviews were used as the primary method of data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111434189"><title>Sample</title>
<p>Using purposive sampling, five participants were recruited from among nurse managers working in a large tertiary hospital in western Canada. The decision to use purposive sampling focused on selecting information-rich cases that illuminated the questions under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111434189">Patton, 2002</xref>). Inclusion criteria consisted of the following parameters: i) voluntary consent to participate in the study and ii) minimum one year’s experience as a nurse manager on a respective unit.</p>
<p>Participants had varied experiences in nursing (5–35 years). Four participants had previous management experience with one participant relocating from a manager role in a rural community hospital to manager in an urban setting. Another had managed a community programme. Two of the other participants had experience as a clinical coordinator and a clinical nurse educator, and one participant had been a manager of other units in two provinces. The average length of time in the nurse manager role was 18 months and ranged from less than 12 months to 36 months. Managers’ responsibilities varied greatly with some being responsible for one or two units and each unit having about 5 to 51 beds and 25 to 100 RNs. There were four female participants and one male participant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111434189"><title>Data collection procedures</title>
<p>After obtaining approval from the regional health authority ethics board, the researchers made contact with senior nurse leaders in the hospital who provided a list of names the researchers could contact. Study participants completed a demographic questionnaire and had a semi-structured face-to-face interview. An interview guide covered the themes outlined in the research questions. The questions concerned the nurse managers’ thoughts and actions related to: what it was like to be a manager on this particular unit, how they prepared for the role, what challenges they faced, how they coped, what was their ability to secure support and resources in the organisation and what key responsibilities made up their role. To encourage participants to begin their narration, the interview started with an open-ended question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111434189">Patton, 2002</xref>), and probing questions were used.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted in a private area according to the preference of the participant – usually in the participant’s office. Before signing the written consent, participants were informed of the study purpose, risks, and benefits and rights as a participant in the study. Interviews were audiotaped and planned as uninterrupted 45- to 60-minute sessions, but most interviews were more than one hour each. In one situation, the researcher returned to complete the interview with one participant. In this situation, the participant did not answer all the questions in the allotted time and due to a previously scheduled appointment, agreed to complete the interview a couple of days later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111434189"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis in this study addresses the experiences of nurse managers’ stressors and how they utilised coping strategies in their roles. A research assistant checked the transcripts for accuracy verifying them with the audiotapes. Each interview was transcribed verbatim, and then the transcripts were coded using the procedures of thematic analysis. The primary investigator and the research assistant independently read a sample of the first interview transcript noting the participant’s phrases and sentences indicating the stressors and coping strategies related to their managerial role. As new themes arose from the data, additional codes were added. Data was treated confidentially, and anonymity was secured during analysis.</p>
<p>For each interview, a summary extensively identifying each theme with supporting quotes was generated. Although each participant’s specific stressful situation was the focus for the interview, analysis also included details preceding and surrounding the situation to capture factors in the work environment contributing to the stressful situation. Themes were developed from factors that nurse managers identified when recalling details surrounding stressful situations. For three of five participants, data suggested that these managers were under significant stress, and the opportunity to share their experience was therapeutic. In particular, two of the interview transcripts were interspersed with powerful metaphors depicting the angst managers experienced.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1744987111434189" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Six descriptive themes emerged from <italic>identified stressors</italic>: fiscal responsibilities, inadequate human resources, managing others, intrapersonal distress, middle management role and competing priorities. Three descriptive themes emerged from <italic>coping strategies</italic>: peer and superior support, cognitive coping strategies and social and personal strategies.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1744987111434189"><title>Identified stressors</title>
<sec id="sec9-1744987111434189"><title>Fiscal responsibilities</title>
<p>A major stressor identified was the nature of fiscal responsibilities, which refers to managers’ attempts to stay within a prescribed financial plan. Participants had minimal training to handle financial responsibilities, and all stated they had trouble understanding the budgeting process. All had access to a financial management adviser within the organisation to whom they relied on to support their understanding of the financial aspect of the role and to guide their fiscal management on the unit. Participants felt pressure to be accountable for the unit’s expenditures, but their limited ability to navigate financial responsibilities on their own was related to a low level of financial competency. One manager described her superior’s lack of understanding regarding the challenges and complexity in making difficult financial decisions, as she explained:<disp-quote>
<p>The finances are a big stress because I’m constantly in a negative variance, and so my direct manager is often, I wouldn’t say that she’s sort of saying, “Why are you over budget?” It’s not like that, but she’s often reminding me we’re in a negative variance. We gotta really look at this …</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111434189"><title>Inadequate human resources</title>
<p>A second major stressor identified for all nurse managers was the lack of RNs to deliver safe, quality patient care. Budgetary concerns influenced shortages as managers tried to adjust schedules while maintaining adherence to the nurses’ union collective agreement, limit overtime and manage overworked staff. Participants were responding to senior management who pressured them to maintain a balanced budget while the union advocated for adding RNs to support a less stressful work environment and improve the safety and quality of patient care. Some participants experienced the stress of the nursing shortage as a tension between administration and practice, as one participant shared: ‘I’m answering to the nurses who are saying help, we’re drowning here, and then someone else is saying to me, no you can’t bring in more staff, you’re in a negative variance’ …</p>
<p>Two managers discussed challenges they faced when nurses on their units sabotaged attempts by the manager to recruit nurses to the unit. This was manifested by nurses having negative attitudes that created an undesirable work environment, as one participant explained:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the turning point came when one of the staff upstairs was willing to come down and see if she wanted to work here … the attitude in the unit wasn’t very positive. And she went back up and said, … “I don’t want to work in that kind of atmosphere”. That, that was my foot in the door to say “OK guys, like, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot” … but I couldn’t recruit staff into that.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987111434189"><title>Managing others</title>
<p>The third major stressor identified by all cases relates to the significant challenges in guiding and supervising interpersonal staff relationships. This theme encompassed suspicion and mistrust of nurses towards management and power struggles. One manager inherited deep-rooted conflict requiring an outside facilitator to manage a tumultuous situation. Suspicion and mistrust were commonly reported by three of five managers. The source of suspicion and mistrust was derived primarily from nursing manager turnover, a lack of resources to provide adequate patient care and organisational changes and merging of units. One manager experienced distrust amongst staff when two units were merged into one large unit. Fear of further job loss emerged, and resistance to the changes, with some as minor as parking privileges, occurred. The change was tumultuous for staff, and after more than a year after the change initiative, the manager was still dealing with a ‘we versus them’ mentality between the staff and the manager, as the manager noted:<disp-quote>
<p>So, there was just a lot on the plate … and, you know, to try and establish some foundation of trust with the [hospital name deleted] group, because, to be perfectly honest with you, being a new manager … I think I was the fourth, I believe, in the series, in five years.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Whereas some participants clearly experienced suspicion, one manager perceived the staff trusted her. From this manager’s perspective, having assumed the acting manager role on several previous occasions, she attributed this trust to the staff’s confidence in her as a leader because she understood the unit’s priorities, the programme goals and the nurses as a result of her familiarity on the unit.</p>
<p>A power struggle ensued on one unit as a result of staff being accustomed to the previous manager’s ‘distant management’ strategy, and nurses assumed an informal management role. The distant management strategy was described as the manager’s time and attention in being responsible for several units. Nurses had assumed scheduling control of the unit and, knowingly or unknowingly, incurred contract violations. When the manager took control of staff scheduling, nurses perceived a lack of trust by the manager. This manager made references throughout the interview to ‘weathering through’ or going through ‘rocky water’ as evidence of significant challenges faced in the role. One such situation occurred when the manager realised that she could not address the turmoil alone, as she explained:<disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t recruit staff … I also had to [hire] a contract facilitator from outside of the region, that would work with us on some of that internal turmoil. That was the point where I realised that it was really bigger than me and I needed some help with that. I couldn’t, I couldn’t fix it. When I took it [the nurse manager job], I realised how much work there was to do down here. And that was a little discouraging. That’s when we got the conflict resolution facilitator involved and that has helped immensely.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987111434189"><title>Intrapersonal distress</title>
<p>The fourth major stressor identified by participants related to managers’ intrapersonal angst, frustration and worry regarding the implementation of their role. All managers experienced these emotions and perceptions in varying degrees and intensities, and they faced similar yet unique stressors in their units. Some of the major factors impacting managers’ distress were their inability to consistently obtain the requisite fiscal and human resources to reduce nurses’ stress and enable nurses to provide essential patient care. Participants used emotive-based terms during the interview such as ‘inner turmoil’ and ‘walking a tight rope’ when describing power struggles amongst staff, as one participant explained:<disp-quote>
<p>I have pressure from above … saying to me, it’s not a hotel, they can’t stay two days, they’ve got to go home. But I’m a woman, and I’ve worked in the community … I feel like I’m walking this tight rope all the time, trying to make room for the new ones to come, get the ones that are here out quickly enough that they don’t feel like they’re pushed out, but at the same time, get that process happening fast enough that the beds can be cleaned before the patients come in.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Others struggled with high expectations in the role. According to one participant:<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of nurses just cannot stand or cannot even think of being in this job. And it’s interesting, because years ago it was the prize job, right? Everyone wanted to be the head nurse. They wanted to be the boss. And I think there was that perceived ability to manage things then, but now in this time of limited resources and just high expectations, it’s a really tough job that a lot of people don’t care to have any interest in.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants felt unable to consistently act in ways they believed they should to alleviate a negative impact on individual practice and patient care. The prevalence of intrapersonal distress described by participants was indicative of a stressful practice environment and was exacerbated by a sense of isolation and a lack of trust between the participant and staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987111434189"><title>Middle management role</title>
<p>The fifth stressor identified by participants refers to a sense of isolation and ‘being sandwiched’ in their role. Participants described being sandwiched as being caught between staff needs and their responsibility to senior management in implementing organisational policies and meeting authorised organisational goals. Some interview transcripts were punctuated with metaphors depicting the challenges and demands managers experienced in their roles. Managers used terms such as ‘very squished’, ‘you’re sandwiched’, ‘isolated’ and ‘very squeezed’. On occasion, managers found nurses saying they were drowning and overwhelmed with work. Yet their superior was stating the unit was experiencing considerable financial constraints, as one participant explained:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve only been doing this for just over a year, and this has been one of the hardest years of my life. I have shed more tears in the last year than I have shed through lots of different things that should have caused me to feel crushed. It’s a very demanding job … but you are very squished between the expectations that, that the people above you have, in terms of budget, in terms of just time frames and things that you have to accomplish, and then you are very squeezed by the staff below you, and in many ways, that’s where I kind of can relate more. So, it’s very difficult. It’s very challenging, and I wouldn’t say that, yet, it is a job that I actually like.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants who had a managerial background and office support expressed the pressure they felt from staff and senior management, leading one participant to express: <italic>‘You’re sandwiched between upper administration and the front line workers, and … basically you are messaging what the staff need to administration and what administration is telling you’.</italic></p>
<p>Participants in challenging situations found themselves being pulled in opposite directions by staff needs and senior administration, each with their own expectations of the manager.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987111434189"><title>Competing priorities</title>
<p>The sixth major stressor identified by all managers related to their struggle with prioritising work responsibilities and attempting to place boundaries around time spent at work beyond regular work hours. Participants expressed a continual vetting of paperwork and email, responding to unit and organisational goals and priorities and responding to staff needs, while attempting to maintain a clinical presence on the unit. At times, participants felt significant pressure to ‘be all and do all’ while attempting to balance work and family, as one participant shared:<disp-quote>
<p>And I think it’s hard to let some things go because you don’t like to let things go. I have a hard time not getting you know, my to-do list, getting it done. That bothers me. And you sometimes you need to just get to a place where you know, you’re still efficient but you’re not going to let it just weigh on you. And I’m not there yet.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987111434189"><title>Coping strategies</title>
<sec id="sec16-1744987111434189"><title>Peer and superior support</title>
<p>The first coping strategy addressed by all managers cited the importance of collegial support from first-line managers and senior management. All participants shared that their immediate supervisors were a source of support and often served as a sounding board, but the degree of reliance on superiors varied due to superiors having their own set of demands. Colleagues provided a sounding board for participants to vent their frustrations, share common experiences, clarify interpretations of organisational changes and share ideas in finding solutions. One participant, who had been in the role of manager for less than one year, shared that staff had approached management and given her name as a candidate for the nurse manager position in her unit. She perceived she had support from upper management who encouraged her to apply for the position, calling her superior a ‘great informal mentor’. An accountability agreement consisting of goals and objectives to work towards in the subsequent year, developed in mutual collaboration with her superior, guided her day-to-day work. Yet not all peer support was edifying, and one participant noted that relying on peers can add to work burdens because of other’s negativity and attitude, as she shared:<disp-quote>
<p>Because there’s so many demands, it can become a toxic group, too … There’s a lot of unhappy people …. they really bring you down, and in this role you don’t have a lot of time to be brought down … So you sort of get to know who are the ones that have a pretty good head on … have a good feel for what should we be stressed about, this or not …</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987111434189"><title>Cognitive coping strategies</title>
<p>The second coping strategy reported by all managers related to cognitive-based strategies in which participants made a deliberate decision to choose how they would respond to work demands to more effectively manage their roles and responsibilities. Only one participant was able to leave work at work with a degree of ease, whereas the others struggled with feeling comfortable with this aspect of their role. Participants talked about setting boundaries, working towards work–life balance and letting go of issues as ways to cope with work stressors. One participant explained:<disp-quote>
<p>I always have a desk full of stuff …. I need to know what are my priorities that I need to, absolutely, get done every day, and what are the things that can, can slide off’ til the next day? Because, if I try and do it all, which I have done before, you go crazy, because you can’t do it all.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An additional dimension of this theme was that participants frequently talked about ‘working towards’ or ‘not being there yet’ with respect to believing they were not yet able to successfully manage the stressors of their work life, as one participant explained:<disp-quote>
<p>So if something is in front of me that doesn’t seem right, I feel I have to deal with it. So, I think a lot of the things that were stressful for her in this job, she doesn’t - didn’t - let them bother her, and I have not yet found my way in that.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Coping strategies were frequently overshadowed by stressors. Managers reverted to talking about their stressors despite repeated efforts by the researcher to focus on how participants managed their stressors. We speculate that this focusing on their work challenges was a cathartic strategy for participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1744987111434189"><title>Social and personal strategies</title>
<p>The third coping strategy encompassed strategies aimed at balancing participants’ work and personal lives. This theme encompassed strategies such as exercising, family support, self-reflection to cope and faith. One participant found that exercising during her lunch break was therapeutic, as she explained: <italic>‘I’d rather go out and burn off some of that energy and come back a little bit more even-keeled …’</italic> One participant vented to her husband, and yet another used the time commuting to work to reflect on how alternate strategies could have resulted in better outcomes. One manager found guidance in her faith, as she explained:<disp-quote>
<p>My pastor has … believed that I am here because, what he sort of sees as my role or what I’m maybe meant to be doing here is to provide comfort in a really stressful environment for the nurses. And he said sometimes he thinks that maybe because the health care system is just so wild right now … you’re that kind of a person that can sort of offer that support to people.</p></disp-quote></p>

<p>The findings of this study imply that the nurse manager role has multiple demands and the role generates considerable stress for these participants. Nurse managers also had less ability to cope effectively. Fiscal and human resource shortages, time constraints and competing work demands were highlighted as major stressors for managers. Participants attempted to place boundaries around time spent at work beyond regular work hours. This is consistent with findings in the literature that describe experiences with fiscal restraints and a shortage of skilled personnel as creating major stress for managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111434189">Blythe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111434189">Rodham and Bell, 2002</xref>). Participants also described inner angst associated with mistrust and conflict with staff and being caught between management’s priorities and nurses requests for further support in safely meeting patient needs.</p>
<p>Managers provided accounts of work–life imbalances, concerns and anxiety for the well-being of patients, staff and the unit. Adherence to the vision of nursing care may easily get lost in the turbulence of day-to-day administrative matters and priorities. This finding is in line with the literature that suggests nursing administration has the potential to safeguard an ethical culture of nursing care where staff is able to concentrate on nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111434189">Bondas, 2009</xref>). Complex leadership challenges were offset by managers’ professional commitment to patients and as a result of their professional and personal coping strategies.</p>
<p>Managers varied greatly in coping strategies in response to the demands of their role. Participants used a variety of coping strategies surrounding time management, which included setting boundaries for work–life balance, limiting the length of their workday and making a deliberate effort to disconnect from work at the end of the day. Professional relationships and support from other nurse managers and senior management support were deemed essential in countering work stressors. In such relationships, senior managers or superiors coached novice managers through conflictual situations, facilitated fragile interpersonal issues, provided advice on operational matters or coached a new manager to work through increasingly complex situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111434189">Rodham and Bell (2002)</xref> suggest managers become aware and recognise the potential impact of workplace stressors within their practice and find ways to facilitate positive, sustainable responses.</p>
<p>Managers used coping mechanisms that minimised or lessened the work stressors they were experiencing, but it was not always evident that managers felt confident in their ability to cope effectively. Managers described their experiences with the use of powerful metaphors such as ‘rocky water’ and ‘a bit of a poison environment’ to depict their work environment. Participants demonstrated signs of frustration and inner turmoil in their role. This may suggest that the chronic stress in this population makes them vulnerable to leaving their managerial role. The findings in this study are consistent with recent research suggesting that nurse managers are exposed to work stress and burnout, making this crucial segment of the nursing workforce vulnerable to negative health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111434189">Laschinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111434189">Lindholm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The management of work stress is a significant and topical concern for nurse managers and can impact personal and organisational outcomes. The management of nurse manager stress should be an organisational concern, and a healthy workplace should be an expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2009</xref>). Links have been established between an engaging style of leadership and staff attitudes to work and their well-being at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111434189">Alban-Metcalfe and Alimo-Metcalfe, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111434189">Alimo-Metcalfe et al. (2008)</xref> suggest that creating a culture of engaging leadership predicts a range of positive, effective outcomes such as staff job satisfaction and decreased levels of stress and emotional exhaustion. These authors describe an engaging leader as someone who shows respect for others and concern for staff development and well being and who is characterised by integrity, openness and transparency and valuing others. More specifically, when staff perceive leadership as engaging by involving them in developing a shared vision, by being loyal to them, by coaching and mentoring them and by involving them to achieve a vision, positive attitudes towards work and a sense of well being at work is to be expected from subordinates. Engaging leadership essentially involves leaders and subordinates working together and being proactive in meeting the challenges of change in the health care institution.</p>
<p>Organisational support is vital for decreasing nurse manager stress, and nurse managers who feel positive about their role are more likely to convey those feelings to staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111434189">Cruickshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2009</xref>), thus engendering potential recruits to nurse manager positions. This has positive implications for manager recruitment, retention and succession planning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1744987111434189" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings reveal a serious concern about stressors in managers’ work roles, which are of great importance to personal well-being and organisational outcomes. Moreover, findings reveal managers cope less effectively with work stressors. These results are suggestive of work expectations that may be unrealistic and the need for manager competencies that fit the organisation’s culture as critical to successful outcomes. The nature of the nurse manager role is becoming increasingly more dynamic and systematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111434189">Cilliers and Terblanche, 2010</xref>). Infrastructures must be created and support systems put in place to advance a positive work environment for managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111434189">Shirey, 2009</xref>). Managers need to be selected for their ability to understand the importance of the leader-manager skills. Managers also require access to continuous professional development, which is imperative to their ability to be flexible and successfully respond to a rapidly changing environment. Finally, we concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111434189">Shirey (2008)</xref> who suggests that senior nurse leaders could analyse, reexamine and potentially reconfigure the nurse manager role to decrease the overwhelming nature of nurse managers’ work and to ultimately make the role more manageable and appealing to staff nurses.</p>
