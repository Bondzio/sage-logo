<abstract>
<p>The Coalition Government has abolished regional institutions, with ‘localism’ now regarded as the best approach for promoting economic development and shaping and delivering public services. This article provides an early assessment of the shift by drawing upon research in the North East of England, where the dismantling of the regional tier is likely to have a considerable impact given its long history of regional economic interventions and the traditionally strong level of support for the idea of a coherent regional voice. For some in the region, the changes have generated concerns about the end of the ‘North East’ and scepticism about the Government’s motives for promoting localism. Others articulate a more sanguine view: that there is life ‘after the region’ and that, in any case, the long-standing focus on the ‘North East’, as an administrative and economic construct, was itself problematic. Now, there are signs that a ‘commonsense’ regionalism may be emerging – a pragmatism that recognises that, while the North East needs to take advantage of new opportunities under localism, coordination and integration at the regional level will still be required.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094211434468"><title>Don’t mention the ‘R’ word</title>
<p>Following the May 2010 General Election, the Coalition Government embarked on a wide-ranging programme to reform and restructure devolved governance in England. This has included the removal of an entire tier of regional organisations, notably the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and Government Offices for the Regions (GOs) and a shift to policies and interventions based on ‘localism’. This new emphasis is reflected particularly in the creation of Local Enterprise Partnerships to drive sub-regional economic development within supposedly more ‘natural’ economic areas, supported by the new Regional Growth Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211434468">BIS, 2010</xref>). In addition, the new <italic>Localism Act</italic> provides councils with a new ‘power of general competence’; aims to encourage voluntary groups and social enterprises to take over the running of public services; and is intended to help communities to acquire buildings and land under ‘community right to buy’ provisions (DCLG (Department for Communities and Local Government), 2010). In a measure recently described as aiming to ‘fill the hole in the doughnut of regional policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094211434468">Townsend, 2011</xref>), the 12 largest cities outside London will be required to hold referendums on installing elected mayors – again, a proposal supporting a localist agenda. There are also examples of localism in other policy areas: the NHS reforms have a strong localist flavour, given the move to local commissioning groups, the re-establishment of Directors of Public Health within local authorities, and the creation of local Health and Wellbeing Boards.</p>
<p>This is more or less in line with what voters were promised by the two parties that formed the Coalition Government. The Conservative Party was committed to a ‘control shift’ away from the centre to local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434468">Conservative Party, 2009</xref>) which would end ‘the command and control apparatus of England's over-centralized state’ (Eric Pickles MP, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434468">Cooper, 2011</xref>). The Conservatives were also hostile to the regional tier as a matter of principle – they consider it ‘unwieldy, interfering, and more concerned with fussy structures than actual job creation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211434468">Kelly, 2011</xref>: 4). Instead, they wanted to see the development of city or sub-regional approaches to economic development and were unwilling to allow RDAs to continue to exist in their current form, with many Conservative think-tanks arguing for their abolition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094211434468">Wallace, 2010</xref>). Their subsequent coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, also promised reform of the RDAs, with their manifesto arguing, somewhat confusingly, that where they had strong local support they could continue, albeit with more limited responsibilities, and where they did not, they would be abolished and their powers given to local authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211434468">Centre for Cities, 2009</xref>). When the new Coalition Government’s programme was eventually announced, all RDAs were to be axed and so, too, were the Government Offices for the Regions – which was a Liberal Democrat (not a Conservative) manifesto commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434468">Cooper, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is clearly a radical change, rapidly implemented by a Government whose hackles rise at the very mention of the word ‘regional’. According to one RDA Chief Executive, ‘[Eric] Pickles wanted to abolish the agencies because he hated regions. Period’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211434468">Hayman, 2010a</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211434468"><title>The Region ‘formerly known as the North East’</title>
<p>The shift from regionalism to localism is bound to have a substantial impact on North East England, where regionalism has arguably been more important than anywhere else in England. The North East has a long history of regional institutions: the region’s economic development organisations can be traced back as far as the creation of the North East Development Board in 1935 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211434468">Cousins et al., 1974</xref>). Moreover, the concept of regionalism has certainly been important in the North East – culminating in the previous Labour Government’s (albeit unsuccessful) proposals for a directly elected regional assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211434468">Shaw and Robinson, 2007</xref>). The region has also had a strong and distinctive voice, reflecting its well-established identity based on a shared economic history and a fair amount of geographical coherence. Hence, the abolition of regional governance, and the shift to localism, marks a genuinely radical break with the past and is likely to have significant consequences for the region’s future development. It is too melodramatic to suggest that we are witnessing ‘the end of the North East’, but we are seeing the end of its articulation as an important administrative and economic construct.</p>
<p>For the North East, the Government’s plans have meant abolition of the full paraphernalia of regional institutions, including: the Government Office for the North East (GONE); the RDA, One North East (ONE) together with the end of its Integrated Regional Strategy (IRS); the abolition of a Minster for the North East; the end of the Regional Select Committee and also of the short-lived (and obscure) Regional Grand Standing Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211434468">Lloyd, 2009</xref>). The abolition of ONE (due to be fully completed in 2012) has also meant the end of a number of RDA-supported regional initiatives, such as the North East Research and Information Partnership (NERIP), which provided the region with analytical capacity, and, in all likelihood, the removal of regionally coordinated approaches to tourism. Abolition of the RDA has also meant the dissolution of the pan-regional Northern Way, a partnership between ONE and the RDAs in the other two Northern Regions. Similarly, the closure of the Government Offices for the North East (in March 2011) has meant the dismantling of regional coordination across a range of areas and, instead, the development of various channels of departmental representation, with each government department formulating their own ways of working at the sub-national level. It is also apparent that the abolition of the regional level of governance challenges the continuing relevance of other regionally constituted bodies, representing business, local government, arts and culture, the North East’s universities, and the voluntary sector. With the removal of the key regional institutions, they, inevitably, will need to review their roles and consider their position in relation to the new arrangements.</p>
<p>To replace the RDA, two new Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) have now been created in the region: the so-called North Eastern LEP, covering Northumberland, Durham and the five metropolitan councils in Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley LEP, covering the five local authority areas in the south of the region. The North Eastern LEP was only agreed after the initial bid (for four separate bodies, covering Northumberland/North Tyneside; County Durham; Newcastle/Gateshead; and Sunderland/South Tyneside) was rejected by the Government, which instead favoured one LEP bid for the north of the region. The eventual outcome in the North East was said to reflect a compromise between BIS (Department for Business, innovation and Skills) Secretary Vince Cable, who wanted a single region-wide LEP, and DCLG’s Eric Pickles, who particularly wanted Tees Valley to have its own LEP, since that area had developed a strong proposal based on its existing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211434468">Hayman, 2010b</xref>). So the old North East has, effectively, been split in two.</p>
<p>Over the past few months we have been following these changes and gauging the response to them. Our research has engaged over 70 local, regional, and national policymakers and practitioners in discussions of the impact on the North East of the shift from regionalism to localism<bold>.</bold><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094211434468">1</xref></sup> The research sought to get beyond lamenting the ‘loss of the familiar’, and aimed to produce a balanced and informed critique of what is happening to governance in the area – and how the recent changes have been interpreted by a wide range of individuals and organisations. The article captures the concerns and anxieties which, for some, are considerable. It is clear that the loss of the regional structures presents challenges not only for organisations in the North East but also for the Government itself, since abolition of GONE means that government is now without its regional ‘eyes and ears’, rendering interdepartmental coordination on issues affecting the region potentially more difficult.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while some view the changes as mistaken and as a worrying leap into the unknown, others have adopted a more sanguine view, seeing it as an opportunity to do things differently and move on from a backward-looking, rigid regionalism. Some individuals and organisations are taking advantage of new opportunities and innovative ways of working and are seeking to develop new relationships. In this respect, we detect the emergence of an approach based on commonsense regionalism, an approach which recognises that, since old structures have gone and will not be coming back in the foreseeable future, it is up to people and organisations in the North East to decide if, when, and how, they continue to work collaboratively. Many in the region now seem to feel that if a new voice is to be developed, it needs to articulate a more positive vision which captures the strengths of the North East: a perpetually negative focus on the region’s ‘problems’ merely runs the risk of being easily ignored. In responding to the changes, people have had to reconsider the value and the values of regionalism itself – but, nevertheless, many remain convinced that some form of regional level coordination and integration is needed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094211434468"><title>From regionalism to localism: Interpreting the change</title>
<p>While many of those who participated in the research were still coming to terms with the scale and pace of change, there was widespread recognition that a fundamental shift in the architecture of governance in the region is taking place, and real worries about the possible consequences. Policymakers and practitioners expressed concerns that ‘tried and tested ways of working had been swept away’ and that ‘knowledge and expertise built up over many years is being lost’.</p>
<p>People spoke of their sense of loss: ‘I worked in the civil service in regional posts for over 20 years and at the moment I still find it difficult to believe the Government Office is no longer there’ (Former regional official). Some also argued that since the North East had always felt itself to be different – a separate and distinctive region – abolition of the regional tier would have a more adverse impact than in other parts of England. According to one regional business leader:<disp-quote>
<p>Most would accept the North East as an identifiable and coherent region. If you go to the other parts of the country there isn’t a regional identity. If you talk to people in the South East, there is no economic coherence, no common shared identity, and no common history.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, by way of contrast, a senior local government officer was clear that while:<disp-quote>
<p>the North East has always thought of itself as being different, we didn’t demonstrate that on 4 November 2004 [the date of the referendum on an elected regional assembly] … We didn’t sufficiently win the argument nationally, that our RDA and our regional structures were somehow different and more distinctive and more deserving to continue.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In our discussions, several regional stakeholders expressed concern, even anger, that in the new sub-national lexicon the word ‘region’ no longer seems to be acceptable to the Government. One participant suggested that we should perhaps now talk of the ‘region formerly known as the North East’, while another felt that it was safer to refer to ‘the area between Berwick and Redcar’. Discussions with Whitehall civil servants confirmed that the Government has moved firmly away from regional structures and ‘Ministers would not be moving back to a political or economic view based on regions’.</p>
<p>But there was also a strongly held view, particularly in the south of the region and amongst the business community, that ‘nostalgia’ should be avoided at all costs. It was important to be realistic – and also not forget that the ‘old’ system was itself flawed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094211434468">Shaw and Robinson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211434468">2007</xref>). For a participant from Tees Valley, ‘It’s almost as though there’s a golden age … with people nostalgic about the RDA era. But I just don’t recognise that view’. By the same token, a regional academic felt that: ‘if this discussion was 18 months ago it wouldn’t be rosy about how things were – we would have been talking about top-down national indicators, performance measures … it wasn’t all great was it?’</p>
<p>A business stakeholder, who was critical of the failure of the old regional institutions to represent the region’s (as opposed to the centre’s) interests, described previous approaches as a form of ‘colonial regionalism’ in which the region could be seen as ‘an outpost of empire’. Another participant in our discussions, who had worked in a number of regional organisations, was not convinced the regional structures had ever spoken for the whole North East; he said that what we might think of as a regional voice was ‘probably the voice of a certain subset of the powerful within the region. When was the voice of the marginalised ever heard in the North East?’</p>
<p>Pragmatists think that the time is right to move on. In any case, bringing back the Government Office and the RDA is simply not an option. Several people commented that the emphasis should now be on making the most of the opportunities offered within the localism agenda. One participant, working in the tourism sector, saw it as liberating and said that ‘we now have fewer shackles on how we spend money, given the disappearance of the regional structures’. Several also pointed to the scope for making the most of localism by adopting more innovative and creative approaches. One said there was a clear opportunity ‘to use the rhetoric of localism’, and saw ‘no reason why local authorities can’t seize the opportunity to propose radical solutions. If the Government turns round and says you can’t have that, then it’s an instant opportunity for voice’. Others talked about how localism could enhance community involvement and empowerment in areas such as neighbourhood planning.</p>
<p>For many, the key question that needs to be clarified was really: ‘what is most appropriately done at which spatial level?’ It was acknowledged that certain functions are best performed at the local level – and in this sense, localism can be flexible and liberating. But in other cases there may be a need for continued regional coordination to focus scarce resources efficiently, or maintain a research and analysis infrastructure, or ensure adequate regional voice (such as at the EU level) and to ‘avoid competing LEPs undermining their respective activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094211434468">Valler and Carpenter, 2010</xref>: 454). What is needed, it was generally agreed, are flexible and informal collaborative networks, organised at the most suitable geographical scales. There was also a pragmatic acceptance that there would need to be, in the words of one participant ‘different geographies for different things’<italic>,</italic> so that policy areas such as economic regeneration, business development, skills, health, transport, housing, tourism, and so on may well require different configurations and arrangements. In particular, some regional representatives said that the North East still faces a particular set of economic challenges that can be most effectively tackled at the regional level. For one former civil servant: ‘in the North East, it’s still all about the economy, jobs, and the relative size of the public sector’.</p>
<p>There was a consensus in the discussions that maintaining some form of regional-level dialogue would be useful both for organisations within North East England and, it was supposed, for central government as well. As one participant said, ‘how do we communicate with decision makers in London so that they actually know what’s happening?’ It was also felt that it would be up to people and institutions in the region to organise coordination and find ways of articulating that regional voice. It could be quite a challenge, but, as one put it, ‘we don’t need permission to organise ourselves; it’s now entirely up to us’<italic>.</italic> However, it was also understood in the region – and confirmed by Whitehall civil servants – that creating new formal structures for their own sake must be avoided. As far as structures are concerned, it was agreed that it would be important to be realistic and keep it simple. Hence, it was less about new bureaucratic arrangements and more about new flexible and creative approaches to coordination.</p>
<p>Following on from this general overview, the next two sections capture in greater detail the challenges and opportunities identified by the local, regional, and national stakeholders involved in the research While there was a fair amount of agreement on the key issues, the wide range of participants involved ensured that some of the issues – inevitably – remain highly contested.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211434468"><title>From regionalism to localism: Challenges</title>
<p>The main concerns expressed about the implications of the shift from ‘regionalism’ to ‘localism’ were related to the loss of: regional ‘voice’; resources; strategic coherence; analytical capacity; and organisational coherence. There were also a number of concerns expressed over what localism might mean in practice.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0269094211434468"><title>The loss of a ‘voice’ for the North East</title>
<p>Many felt that the North East may now struggle to relay key ‘messages’ to the Centre. This was seen as especially important given the region’s small size, peripherality, and political isolation. Concerns were also expressed about how the North East would be able to compete with other areas, particularly given the resources and economic powers available to the Scottish Government and to the Mayor of London. It was also argued that, without regional institutions, there is a real danger of the North East being left politically weak and isolated, especially at a time when only four of the region’s MPs are from the two governing parties, and now no North East politicians are in government – a marked contrast to the 1997–2010 period.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094211434468"><title>The loss of resources</title>
<p>Despite the creation of the Regional Growth Fund, the abolition of the RDA has resulted in a major loss of financial resources for the region: ‘put simply, we’ll miss the money, no doubt about that’ (local authority officer). Compared to the former level of resources available to RDAs, it has been argued that there will now not be sufficient government support for economic growth in the North, where ‘rebalancing’ the economy poses a major challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211434468">IPPR, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094211434468">Smith Institute, 2011</xref>). There were also concerns about the potentially uneven distribution of resources across the North East under new funding mechanisms such as the Regional Growth Fund and the New Homes Bonus. One participant in the discussions thought that: ‘the Government’s approach to economic development focuses on areas with growth potential. The question that does need to be asked, however, is ‘what is the strategy for those places that are not going to benefit from that approach?’. Such a sentiment has also been echoed in the DCLG Select Committee’s recent report on regeneration, which was highly critical of the Government’s approach on the grounds that it failed to focus on the specific issues faced by<disp-quote>
<p>deprived communities and areas of market failure … The government is wrong to place so much emphasis on funding streams such as the New Homes Bonus, the Regional Growth fund and rail investment, which, whatever their benefits, are not focused primarily upon regeneration. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211434468">House of Commons, 2011a</xref>: 4)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The point was also made that there was greater affinity with the RDA in the North East than had been the case in other regions, simply because the North East is a less economically successful area and RDA resources had therefore been more central to business survival and growth.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094211434468"><title>The loss of strategic thinking</title>
<p>There was considerable regret over the loss of the strategic thinking that was developing within the Integrated Regional Strategy (IRS). A participant from the voluntary sector commented that, following the merger of the Regional Economic and Spatial Strategies, the IRS had represented a much-needed attempt to think about the region’s future in a comprehensive way, bringing together both economic and social issues:<disp-quote>
<p>With the IRS I felt that we’d finally reached a place where we had an evidence base and we were talking about what sort of North East we wanted to live in, bring our children up in, and work in. We were just starting to look at different visions and plans and then the pendulum swung completely.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Discussions often returned to views about the continuing need for strategic thinking. It was felt that, while there may be strong arguments in favour of dealing with economic development at a sub-regional level, other functions really needed strategic development and coordination at a regional level. Regional strategic thinking was considered to be necessary in areas such as skills, housing, transport, tourism, and place marketing, and aspects of public health. A public health official made the point that:<disp-quote>
<p>There are some regionally-specific issues we need to deal with, like the fact that people in the region present very late with symptoms of cancer, and we’ve also got some polling evidence that shows there is a significantly greater appetite for further legislation on tobacco amongst people in the North East than in other areas of the country. I think actually there are differences here and we ought to be able to respond to those. I’m not sure we are going to be able to do that under the new mechanisms.</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094211434468"><title>The loss of analytical capacity</title>
<p>Concerns were expressed about the loss of capacity to maintain and analyse key regional data sources. The closure of the North East Research and Information Partnership (NERIP), which had been supported by the RDA, was felt to be particularly worrying. One participant spoke for many when he highlighted the ‘loss of skills, capacity, expertise and data. It’s about being able to monitor and measure and compare our progress with different places. I think that’s potentially being undermined’. The general depletion of the North East’s research and intelligence capacity, at both the regional and local levels, is expected to have a negative impact on policy making and implementation in the new LEPs and other agencies. One LEP member felt that:<disp-quote>
<p>The single biggest issue about losing the RDA is the loss of evidence-based research. That is the key to any voice and lobbying. Our Achilles heel will be when we try and say that this is what we want because we know this will work – if we haven’t got the evidence to back it up<italic>.</italic></p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094211434468"><title>The loss of coherence and clarity</title>
<p>At the time of these discussions, there was still considerable uncertainty about how government departments will interact with the North East in the absence of GONE. Participants wondered how the different government departments would be reconfigured at the sub-national level; who they would need to contact in the new arrangements; and what the government departments themselves now expected in terms of engagement from relevant organisations in the North East. A former regional official pointed out that different departments were adopting their own approaches to managing their geographical responsibilities and that ‘there isn’t a single view out there as to what the right geography is. Take three different central government departments: they all have a different view about the level at which they want to interact with people’. Regional agencies may have been imperfect in many ways, but for some, regionalism had at least been helpful in structuring relationships between central and sub-national tiers of governance. A number of participants were evidently confused over who they should now contact in government for advice and how to go about it.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094211434468"><title>Uncertainty over localism</title>
<p>The ideas behind localism were – in principle – welcomed, but the way in which it was being implemented generated a degree of scepticism. Some said they were unsure exactly what localism entailed, and how it connected to other initiatives such as the Big Society and the commitment to Open Public Services. Some viewed it as essentially ‘window dressing’: ‘We recently had a Whitehall civil servant talk to us about localism. We asked him to give an example of localism. The example he gave was Royal Wedding Street parties’ (local authority participant).</p>
<p>There were also concerns about too much local variation and too little coherence, and, from a senior local politician, a worry that the <italic>Localism Bill</italic> ‘is more about appealing to certain local individuals or local neighbours, it’s not about local authorities, it’s about unlocking influence lower down’. Participants also wondered whether there would actually be greater local autonomy and influence, fearing that, in the end, it might result in additional central interventions to deal with the resulting uneven provision. In our subsequent discussions with Whitehall civil servants, it was acknowledged that it was still ‘early days’ and the nature of the relationship between the local level and Whitehall under the new arrangements is still evolving. One civil servant noted that, ‘Whitehall wants to have a supporting role, providing advice and feedback rather than top-down guidance or direction’. But there are potential conflicts and contradictions; as one local authority senior officer said, ‘programmes such as the Regional Growth Fund and the Work Programme are still very centrally directed’. There was a hope that government would hold to the principles implied by localism, and it was argued that if localism is to work, it is important that it is not simply viewed by ministers as a way of curbing public sector costs in a tough spending environment, but is seen as part of a wider social and economic vision to transform service provision and empower localities.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0269094211434468"><title>Regionalism to localism: Opportunities</title>
<p>The research certainly captured the concern of people and organisations in the North East, but it was also clear that many wanted to make the best of the new situation and, more than that, many felt that there were genuine opportunities on offer. Two areas were highlighted: the potential of the LEPs; and the development of new approaches to collaborative working within the region, and between the region and the centre.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0269094211434468"><title>Local Enterprise Partnerships: ‘The only game in town’?</title>
<p>LEPs were considered by many to provide a more appropriate level at which to promote local economic growth – in contrast to the previous regional-level interventions of the RDA. The value of a sub-regional approach seems to be particularly felt in the southern part of the region, Tees Valley, where the new arrangements were viewed as a natural progression from earlier attempts at joint-working – going as far back as the precursor Structure Plan, ‘Tees Plan’, in the 1960s and 1970s – which had provided a strong focus on the particular needs of the city-region. In Tees Valley, the opportunity to ‘run their own affairs’, free from the control formerly exercised by regional bodies based in Newcastle, was greeted with enthusiasm by local institutions keen to push ahead with their own, locally agreed, strategy for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094211434468">Merrick and Arnold, 2010</xref>). The fracturing of the old regionalism, involving the decision of organisations in the Tees Valley to ‘go it alone’ when bidding for a separate LEP in the summer of 2010, can be viewed as a decisive break with the old regionalist order. For one Tees Valley Partnership member, the key ingredient was that ‘the five local authorities realise that, working together, they get more than working on their own, and they are starting to see added value in working in partnership’.</p>
<p>In general, local government officers viewed LEPs as offering new opportunities for local authorities to work closely with local businesses to reduce barriers to enterprise and even enhance the private sector’s ability to compete at the global level. But, as one business leader said, it was important to be realistic and recognise that businesses have very limited interest in structures, old or new:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a bit of noise around LEPs but actually the number of people who want to get involved from business is actually tiny. I just think for most of the private sector, most of the time, we would say just get on with it – just do it properly please<italic>.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The crucial importance of encouraging private sector-led growth and rebalancing the economy is recognised by many, although there was also a strong plea, especially from the voluntary and community sector, not to downplay the wider social agenda, particularly in view of the region’s high levels of deprivation. Recent research on the role of the voluntary and community sector in the work of LEPs in the North suggests that there is still considerable scope for greater involvement of the sector in developing the LEPs and shaping their agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094211434468">IPPR, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is, however, a strong feeling that the economic issues simply have to come first, and must be considered before any wider social concerns. One LEP board member said:<disp-quote>
<p>When you are talking to this government, the economy is the ‘Trojan horse’ that gets you through to talk about the other stuff. It’s got to be focused on the economy, if we start to get that right, the other stuff will start to come right as well.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants (in both the north and south of the region) expected that the two new LEPs in the North East would work together where this was mutually beneficial, and believed mechanisms to enable that should be developed. The North East Economic Partnership was jointly developed by the Northern Business Forum (NBF) and the Association of North East Councils (ANEC) to act as an ‘enabler’, promoting an ‘alliance between the two LEPs in areas where it makes sense to collaborate across a larger geography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094211434468">NBF, 2011</xref>: 2). By late 2011, however, there was still considerable uncertainty over the role of the North East Economic Partnership in relation to the two LEPs.</p>
<p>The view of one Whitehall civil servant was that LEPs needed to ‘develop according to local needs as they are not owned by central government’. However, there are worries in the region that such a lack of direction could mean that too much might be expected of LEPs – hence, managing expectations would be important. One LEP member was concerned about ‘mission creep’ and thought that the centre would give LEPs more and more things to do. These fears may not be unfounded: recent coverage of central government intentions suggests that there are plans for LEPs to band together to form new Local Transport Consortia covering a wider area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211434468">Hayman, 2011</xref>), and that LEPs will be directly involved in supporting key infrastructure projects (such as housing, roads, business parks) by allocating funding to private developers to kick start the development process. Funded through a new £500m Growing Places Fund, the LEPs have each been told how much money they will receive (the North East LEP has £16.7m and Tees Valley, £5.7m), but must then submit proposals on how they would spend it. Given that the Government had previously argued that LEPs would not require government funding in order to ‘lever-in’ private capital, some observers see the development as a tacit recognition that scrapping the RDAs was a mistake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211434468">BBC, 2011</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0269094211434468"><title>New collaborative opportunities</title>
<p>The new arrangements are viewed by some as offering an opportunity to move away from an approach to joint-working in the region based on ‘grant coalitions’ (where partnerships were structured by the RDA and lubricated by its resources), to one based on ‘coalitions of the willing’, where individuals and organisations would now need to assess the wider benefits of collaboration and consider whether their participation in more flexible and voluntary approaches to networking would really add value. One participant said that:<disp-quote>
<p>Regional structures imposed a certain amount of discipline on the way that the various individual bodies operated, so that we were forced to collaborate and to work together. Now we’re part of a coalition of the willing because we want to be, rather than because we are being forced to do it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It was also felt that there were now better opportunities for more direct and transparent relationships between North East bodies and central government departments. As one Tees Valley participant noted, the lack of such relationships was perhaps one of the failings of the old system where ‘we seemed to concentrate too much on influencing the regional bodies and not enough on actually getting our case across to central government directly’. Several contributors to the discussions were very positive about this opportunity, as they felt that the previous mechanisms had not adequately represented the range of opinions in the North East, with the structures acting more as ‘creatures of the centre’ rather than the voice of the region. There would also be opportunities to review and reconsider approaches to lobbying that had lain dormant during the ‘regionalist’ New Labour period. A voluntary sector participant argued that:<disp-quote>
<p>For 13 years we had quite a benign policy arena that benefited us. We now have to get to grips with this notion of lobbying – the very basics of getting down to see the influencers and shakers and having some impact.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The end of regionalism does not necessarily mean the end of a regional view, but it is felt that if there is still to be a regional ‘voice’ it needs to articulate a more positive vision which emphasises the strengths of the North East. One LEP member, who had worked with a number of government departments over the years, argued that:<disp-quote>
<p>The one thing that gets you success is to give them solutions and not problems. Whingeing is not the way to influence governments. We need to start thinking collectively at different levels and ask what solutions we can offer to their issues.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the difference between optimistic and pessimistic views of the region’s future is reflected in recent arguments between some North East MPs over the appropriate level of central government’s support for tackling the region’s economic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211434468">Green, 2011</xref>), and the views of a LEP director that continually focusing on figures that show a growing North-South divide paints too gloomy a picture of the region and ignores the positive steps that have been taken to boost the local economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211434468">Business Network, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Government departments are still in the process of adapting to the post-Government Office era, and local and regional organisations are still struggling to come to terms with the new and emerging organisational arrangements. It will clearly take time for both the centre and the region to become acclimatised to the new ‘rules of the game’. But there are certainly signs of new relationships developing, for example via the creation of ‘BIS Local’ structures; the appointment by the Cabinet Office of a Big Society ‘Champion’ for the North East; the support given to LEPs from within the DCLG; and advice from the Treasury on the North Eastern LEP’s bid for Enterprise Zone status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211434468">Pearson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this regard, one of the most interesting developments has been the announcement by the DCLG that it is setting up of a new network of 14 English localities, each with a named ‘area director’ and ‘localities partner’. The 14 areas comprise those based on traditional boundaries (this group includes the North East) and other areas where a number of former regions have been banded together (such as the odd configuration that stretches from Cornwall to the middle of Oxfordshire). It might be said that the proposed changes run the risk of adding further complexity to the new arrangements for sub-national governance, given that the boundaries are not contiguous with LEPs, nor with the regional structures of the Homes and Community Agency, nor with the six ‘BIS Local’ offices. It also leaves the Government open to the charge that they are merely ‘recreating a regional tier, albeit in a slimmed down form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211434468">Hayman, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0269094211434468"><title>‘Commonsense’ regionalism</title>
<p>In the past, organising things at a regional level was a normal, almost ‘default’ response in the North East; now, arrangements for doing things need to be more fully considered and justified. No doubt that is healthy, but the danger is that regional-level structures that are really necessary are lost, or not developed, just because of the Government’s aversion to regionalism.</p>
<p>As one observer has noted, while the Government has abolished RDAs as <italic>statutory bodies</italic>, this does not necessarily mean the end of the <italic>concept</italic> of regional economic development or its significance as a level of <italic>policy coordination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211434468">Meagher, 2010</xref>). What seems to be emerging in the North East is the development of a more pragmatic, ‘commonsense’ regionalism, which accepts that there are sensible and realistic things that the North East could, and should, do for itself at a regional level; these are actions that would not involve new bureaucratic structures, substantial resources or require central approval. It is not so much a matter of wanting to turn the clock back but, rather, an acknowledgement that regional coordination is needed, not least to manage the competing claims of different parts of the area. In the discussions, four quite specific proposals were highlighted:
<list id="list1-0269094211434468" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>There was support for retaining cooperation and collaboration on a regional basis for functions best coordinated at that level. This is particularly the case where there is still a regional layer of organisations representing business, universities, various professions, and the voluntary sector. Some of these are long-established organisations and networks, very much part of the region’s economy and society, which will survive because they are still deemed to be of value. Thus, the North East Chamber of Commerce (NECC) has continued and still produces, for example, regional Skills Policy Reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094211434468">NECC, 2011</xref>), while the North East Enterprise Agencies consortium has played a key role in accessing ERDF money for business support for North Eastern SMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211434468">DCLG, 2011</xref>). Voluntary Organisations’ Network North East (VONNE) continues to serve as the voice of the region’s third sector. And policy networks, such as the North East Housing Innovation Forum and the North East Regional Poverty Commission, have been reconfigured to help lobby decision makers, provide advice and support to partner bodies, and to relay information and innovations across the wider North East.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While there is nervousness about creating new structures, there was a strong commitment to the North East ‘getting on’ and ‘doing things for ourselves’. There was much interest in the idea of setting up a forum, not directly linked to traditional political channels, in which a range of organisations could meet to discuss matters of mutual interest. It was suggested that such a relatively informal and voluntary regional forum could also form the basis of a regional sounding board that may be of use in future central-local discussions. The local and national politicians who contributed to the research also separately argued that a political voice for the North East could be developed through the establishment of an all-party regional parliamentary group of MPs and Peers. It was also thought that the North East’s five universities were well placed to execute an ‘honest broker’ role as the convenor of a regional forum or sounding board, possibly in alignment with an experts’ group that would contribute to the sustenance of the region’s analytical capacity. Recent developments have seen universities, the Association of North East Councils, and local authority officers coming together to establish a relatively informal North Eastern Research and Information Network (NERIN) to keep open channels of communication and foster collaboration on data and intelligence issues at the regional level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As noted earlier, the DCLG has recently appointed some of its senior officials to serve as area and locality managers in 14 areas of England to assist local engagement with Whitehall and to help ensure that the Government is aware of local concerns. It is stressed that ‘building relationships with local areas will become part of the role of senior civil servants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211434468">Hayman, 2011</xref>). This development reflects one of the important messages from the research: that localism provides the opportunity to fashion new, direct, relationships with the centre. One suggestion coming out of the research – and which goes further than the DCLG initiative – was that civil servants with area-based responsibilities in different departments could meet together as a North East area group and perhaps, from time to time, meet with representatives from the region itself. Establishing an effective mechanism for communication could help to avoid duplication of effort and issues being overlooked; it could also help to ensure that when cross-cutting issues arise, structures and partners are in place to provide a response.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It was also suggested that new approaches to joint central-local working could be utilised from time to time on a voluntary basis. Several regional stakeholders pointed to how a Peer Assist Review process could be used to bring the centre and the localities together and offer opportunities for critical challenge and debate. Such a process took place in relation to the Tees Valley’s Business Plan for a City Region in 2007, and involved a panel of civil servants from six government departments visiting the Tees Valley to provide a constructive consideration of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, areas of progress, barriers to be overcome, and practical recommendations for improving performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211434468">Tees Valley Unlimited, 2007</xref>). Peer Assist could also be harnessed to identify areas where further support from central government is needed to achieve key objectives. It was also suggested that the Peer Assist Review process could be a useful mechanism to help develop new collaborative approaches between government departments and the LEPs.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec15-0269094211434468"><title>Conclusion: Whither the North East?</title><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he North East’s discernible sense of itself as a region – unique, born in depression and nurtured to some degree by sentiment – is a burden it could do with offloading, for a while at least. I see no harm in the city economies of Tyneside, Wearside and Teesside trying to be relatively independent in the quest for specialised business. But if they don’t endeavour to be complementary – following usefully wherever another has led – then they’re missing a trick. If Newcastle doesn’t stay mindful of ways that Stockton and Seaham are innovating – and vice versa – the region’s relative decline will only accelerate. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211434468">Kelly, 2011</xref>: 7)</p></disp-quote>
<p>The North East of England is experiencing substantial changes to its governance, pushed through by a government hostile to regionalism. The rules of the game have changed, and the regional compromises and ‘grant coalitions’ of the last two decades are now obsolete. In particular, the effective splitting of the region by the formation of the two LEPs represents a decisive break with the old order. Regionalism has been fundamentally undermined and, as things stand now, there seems little point in awaiting a change in policy direction – or even a change in government.</p>
<p>The genuine concerns expressed at the recent loss of the regional institutions in the North East should not hide the fact that many people were not exactly enamoured with the old ways of doing things. Those ways could be regarded as cumbersome and not necessarily ‘fit for purpose’. In 2007, we reported the view of a senior civil servant from the North East that:<disp-quote>
<p>the heavy institutional architecture of the region was designed in a previous era, to manage decline. You need a lot of governance to manage decline. In this sense the region still has the feel of a former East European communist state about it. Now what is needed is a structure able to promote economic growth. For that, we need governance with a lighter touch, slimmer and leaner, more streamlined. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094211434468">Shaw and Robinson, 2006</xref>: 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nor is this just a recent critique. Nearly 40 years ago, an influential study of the North East concluded that the region was, in many ways, an artificial construct which does not necessarily serve the area well:<disp-quote>
<p>the main purpose of the regional organisations has remained constant – to persuade the people of the North East to accept a certain range of policies and assumptions about policy and to mobilise to achieve these aims in a socially comprehensive way, on ‘regional’ rather than on area, industry, party or interest basis. The significance of this policy-model of regional problems lies in alternative approaches which have been repressed; the significance of the regional organisation lies in its repression of a spatial or social lack of homogeneity in the North East. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211434468">Cousins et al., 1974</xref>: 143)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>From this viewpoint, the ‘end’ of the North East as an administrative and economic creation may be viewed as providing a chance for local and regional decision makers to think anew about the value and values of regionalism. It can certainly be argued that previous manifestations of regionalism have contributed to a parochialism and insularity in the North East which has hindered the development of a more outward-looking approach. As one participant in the research – who was new to the area – commented:<disp-quote>
<p>In the short time I’ve been here, I’m staggered about how much emphasis there is on the ‘North East’ in the North East. But actually what we face is global competition, and it’s all about how you match that global competition. It’s about going way beyond the North East.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, with its absence of political representation in government, the North East is now easily marginalised and ignored – a problem region 250 miles from London that does not have the clout of Scotland, its increasingly emboldened neighbour. Hence, the North East does need a voice, but that voice has to be credible, rooted in the place and people, and able to engage realistically with government. There is a feeling that the region does not want to be doing what it has done before: either complaining about how bad things are or else engaging in insincere ‘boosterism’. But developing that voice and sense of regional purpose is a considerable challenge for a region that is used to being organised, rather than organising itself.</p>
<p>The emergence of what can be simply called a commonsense regionalism is recognition that the North East needs to respond to the new situation, take advantage of any new opportunities and innovative ways of working, and seek to develop effective relationships. This is particularly the case in relation to making the most of LEPs, and developing new – and more direct – connections with central government departments. Such a view also suggests that it is up to people in the North East to decide when, and how, to set up collaborative mechanisms; after all, that is what localism is all about. There is continuing support for retaining some form of cooperation and collaboration on a regional basis, covering functions such as skills, housing, transport, public health, and tourism. In some areas, such as business, the professions, higher education, and the voluntary sector, it is noticeable that their regional organisations show no sign of being dismantled, irrespective of the position of central government. It seems probable then, that joint-working and collaboration will emerge and continue, when deemed to be of value.</p>
<p>Many participants in the research expressed enthusiasm for developing some kind of regional forum, constituted from people concerned with the region’s economic and social development, which could articulate the region’s concerns and maintain a dialogue within the region itself. There was also support for maintaining some shared research and analytical capacity, and for involving universities in taking on the responsibility of producing a regional monitoring publication or even an annual State of the North East report. There were other suggested ways of strengthening the region’s voice, such as the idea of an all-party parliamentary group for the North East. Discussions with senior civil servants from a range of government departments also led to a proposal that those with a remit specifically to engage with the North East should meet together with other civil service colleagues with an interest in the region. Such meetings, taking place on a regular basis, would provide an opportunity for light touch coordination, facilitate the discussion of issues cutting across different government departments and perhaps, in the future, provide an opportunity for North East stakeholders to present their views to the relevant civil servants. Other initiatives were discussed, included the possible use of Peer Assist Review to support the role of LEPs, particularly where joint working is required.</p>
<p>The transition to a coherent and effective approach to economic development at a sub-regional level was always likely to prove a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094211434468">Harding, 2010</xref>), and a recent report pointed out that only two of the 24 LEPs launched in October 2010 had yet published a long-term strategy, and eight had not yet had their boards approved by the Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094211434468">Centre for Cities, 2011</xref>). In the North East, collaboration between the seven authorities within the North Eastern LEP has not had an auspicious start, as indicated by the very public row between the constituent local authorities over two competing proposals for Enterprise Zones covering different parts of the LEP area (Green and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211434468">Pearson, 2011</xref>). The tensions that may have simmered under the surface in the old regional arrangements have come to the fore and some kind of resolution will have to be found to take the LEP forward. Sub-regionalism or localism brings these challenges – just as regionalism did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094211434468">Shaw and Greenhalgh, 2010</xref>). In addition to such internal issues, the two LEPs will also be required to work collaboratively in a number of areas, yet finding an appropriate mechanism for achieving this seems also to be problematic. While the North East Economic Partnership could play a role in bringing the business communities together, and the Association of North East Councils (ANEC) could fulfil a similar role in relation to the political leadership in the north and south of the region, it may be necessary to develop other mechanisms. Whilst avoiding the creation of any new formal structures, this might involve the LEP Chairs and Directors regularly meeting together, and utilising existing networks for discussions on issues that cut across the LEP boundaries, work on EU programmes and projects, and the use of data resources.</p>
<p>Doubts certainly remain in the North East about what localism means and, above all, what it can deliver. The end of regions might actually result in greater centralisation. For example, in our discussions a businessman noted that recent decisions about the future of RDA assets, the Regional Growth Fund and Business Development measures showed that:<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the strategic issues which we thought should be done on a much bigger scale than the sub-regional, ended up centralised. You know all the things we were concerned about were taken on by national government, so in the end our problem is that we have gone from arguing whether this should be regional to whether it’s right to be centralised?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps these concerns about centralisation by stealth, or by default, should come as no surprise. Looking back, in the heady days of ‘new regionalism’, leading up to the 2004 North East referendum on the formation of an elected regional assembly, there was a growing and upbeat literature on the supposed increasing importance of regional responses to global economic competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094211434468">Wood and Valler, 2004</xref>). But even then, there were still concerns that the centre would use the development of new forms of regional economic governance to increase its influence. One critic was sceptical of arguments stressing the neat link between territorial scale and economic performance, asserting that RDAs simply did not have the capacity to effectively induce economic growth. From this perspective, ‘despite the political and academic weight placed on the importance of inter-organisational alliances involving civil society actors as pre-requisites of economic success, it would appear that the nation state retains its role in orchestrating governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094211434468">Jones, 2004</xref>: 193). For others, the Northern Way strategy was a good example of a rescaling approach that can be described as ‘deconcentration’, whereby central government establishes a national spatial strategy – with regionally specific variations – which provides a way of directing the work of sub-national organisations, making ‘sure they work together in a way that facilitates, rather than hinders economic growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211434468">Goodchild and Hickman, 2006</xref>: 133).</p>
<p>The end of the regional ‘experiment’ in England is a sober reminder that the contemporary focus on ‘multi-level governance’, and on the centre’s territorial delegation of responsibilities and resources to the regional level, has substantially underestimated the continuing power of central government to use its extensive resources in order to determine policy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094211434468">Wilson, 2003</xref>). If localism is to work, the Government must deliver on its commitment to end the ‘command and control apparatus of England's over-centralized state’, and be mindful of the warning from the House of Commons Select Committee on Communities and Local Government that, ‘the litmus test for delivering a more localist political culture will be how ministers react to devolved decisions they dislike’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094211434468">House of Commons, 2011b</xref>). In the North East, making the most of localism while still maintaining, where appropriate, regional-level coordination and collaboration will not be easy to achieve – and may prove to be a test of the Government’s commitment to localism.</p></sec>
