<title>Business and Finance</title>
<p><bold><italic>Finance and the Good Society</italic></bold>. Robert J. Shiller (Professor of Economics, Yale University). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, April 2012, 288 pp., $24.95. Author of <italic>Irrational Exuberance</italic> argues that “finance should be defined not merely as the manipulation of money or the management of risk but as the stewardship of society’s assets (pp 6-7).” Rather than condemning finance for the subprime mortgage meltdown, we need to reclaim it for the common good. Far from being a parasite on society, finance is one of the most powerful tools we have for solving our problems and increasing general well-being. Calls for rechanneling financial creativity to benefit society as a whole and describes how inventions such as insurance, mortgages, saving accounts, and pensions contributed to the good of society. But we have to be careful that government is not captured by existing financial interests: there is a sharp distinction between the financial forms that exist today and the kinds of democratized forms we might see tomorrow that consider the interests of all elements of society.</p>
<p><bold><italic>International Political Economy: The Business of War and Peace</italic></bold>. James H. Nolt (World Policy Institute, New York City). New York: Routledge, July 2012, 352 pp., $49.95 pb (also as e-book). Realism focuses on nation-states as the principal actors in international relations and ignores transnational actors (mostly business organizations) that are often vital to patterns of international relations. However, liberalism recognizes that transnational structures, regimes, or organizations can be important, but loses sight of the business interests that create these structures. Nolt’s approach is to begin with business as the main constitutive element of modern international relations. Business organizations are one of the main agents in the conduct of international relations, and business concerns generate most of the enduring issues of international relations, that is, the substance of the struggles. Sections cover (1) mercantilism to free trade, (2) imperialism and the rise of business internationalism, (3) the triumph of business internationalism, (4) looking forward, and (5) research methods.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Business Regulation and Non-State Actors: Whose Standards? Whose Development?</italic></bold> Edited by Peter Utting (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development [UNRISD], Switzerland), Darryl Reed and Ananya Mukherjee Reed (York University, Canada). New York: Routledge, January 2012, 336 pp., $140 (also as e-book). Assesses the achievements and limitations of a new set of nonstate or multistakeholder institutions that are concerned with improving the social and environmental record of business, and holding corporations to account. Contents focus on the International Organization for Standardization, the Forest Stewardship Council, global retail strategies, Wal-Mart’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) regime, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, blood diamonds, nonstate actors and development, peoples’ tribunals in Latin America, International Framework Agreements and Development, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and the institutionalization of organic agriculture, the World Fair Trade Organization, Fairtrade International, and so on.</p>

<title>Cities (See Also Regions and Nations: China)</title>
<p><bold><italic>The Temporary City</italic></bold>. Peter Bishop (Nottingham Trent University, UK) and Lesley Williams (Freelance Consultant, UK). New York: Routledge, January 2012, 256 pp., $155. Explores the growing interest in temporary, interim, “pop-up” or “meanwhile” uses for land and buildings in urban areas. Using sixty-eight diverse case studies from Europe and North America, the authors challenge our preoccupation with long-term strategies and master plans, and question our ability to achieve them in the face of increasing resource constraints and political and economic uncertainty. Topics include the dream of permanence, drivers and conditions of temporary urbanism, site life and the private sector, temporary arenas for consumption, the city as a stage, creative cities and the gentrification dilemma, planning for temporary activity, and so on.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The New Century of the Metropolis: Enclave Development and Urban Orientalism</italic></bold>. Tom Angotti (Hunter College, City University of New York). New York: Routledge, June 2012, 224 pp., $160. The problems created by metropolitanization have become increasingly apparent. Attempts to limit growth, disperse populations, and plan neighborhoods have been largely unsuccessful. Angotti questions urban planning’s inability to integrate urban and rural systems, its contribution to the growth of inequality, and increasing enclave development throughout the world. In contrast to “urban orientalism,” which underpins modern urban planning grounded in global inequalities, Angotti proposes a new, progressive approach to community and metropolis in the twenty-first century. When the city is understood as a necessary and beneficial accompaniment to social progress, a progressive, humane approach to urban planning can be developed.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Remaking the Metropolis: Global Challenges of the Urban Landscape</italic></bold>. Edited by Edward Cook (Arizona State University) and Jesus J. Lara (Ohio State University). New York: Routledge, July 2012, 288 pp., $47.95 pb. Examines examples of urban decay and destruction as well as urban rebirth. Shows why particular approaches were successful, or did not achieve their objectives. By bringing together innovative approaches to urban living from across the world, and by demonstrating how local initiatives can contribute to global solutions, establishes a framework in which to evaluate current and future developments for urban change, and to stimulate a reassessment of urban redevelopment and policies.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Cities and Climate Change</italic></bold>. Harriet A. Bulkeley (University of Durham, UK). New York: Routledge, November 2012, 256 pp., $39.95 pb. Examines how governments, businesses, and communities worldwide are seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, and considers implications for cities and for the environment. Draws on examples from cities in the north and south to explore the intersection between climate change and urbanization. Considers the causes and impacts of climate change in the city, examines how responses to mitigate and adapt to climate change have emerged, and assesses their impacts and implications. Topics include low-carbon cities, adapting cities to climate change, and alternative urban politics of climate change.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Planning Asian Cities: Risks and Resilience</italic></bold>. Edited by Stephen Hamnett (University of South Australia) and Dean Forbe (Flinders University, Adelaide). New York: Routledge, June 2012, 344 pp., $115. Explores the planning history and recent development of Pacific Asia’s major cities. Globalization, and the competition to achieve global city status, has had a profound effect on Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Bangkok, Jakarta, and Manila. Looks at whether these cities can manage continuing pressures for development and growth while reducing their vulnerability to a range of potential crises, including climate change, recovery from shocks and disasters, and so on. Also explores the forms of governance and planning appropriate for the vast mega-regions that are emerging.</p>

<title>Communications</title>
<p><bold><italic>Moving Data: The iPhone and the Future of the Media</italic></bold>. Edited by Pelle Snickars (Head of Research, National Library of Sweden) and Patrick Vonderau (Associate Professor of Cinema Studies, Stockholm University). New York: Columbia University Press, July 2012, 352 pp., $29.5 pb (also as e-book). Many millions of consumers now love and live by their iPhones. Combining traditional and social media with mobile connectivity, the iPhone and other smartphones have redefined as well as expanded the dimensions of everyday life, allowing individuals to personalize media as they move and process constant flow of data. Looks at the implications of this technology on society, media, and culture by exploring the iPhone as a technological prototype and lifestyle gadget, patterns of consumption, the fate of solitude against smartphone ubiquity, the economy of the App Store, and the distance between the accessibility of digital information and the protocols governing its use.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Digital Media and Society: An Introduction</italic></bold>. Adrian Athique (University of Waikato). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, November 2012, 288 pp., $24.95 pb. Presents theoretical and ethical debates on the sociology of digital media in short summaries, ranging from economy and technology to criminology and sexuality. Explores key theoretical paradigms through a broad range of social phenomena—from social networking and virtual lives to the rise of cyber crime and identity theft, from the utopian ideals of virtual democracy to the surveillance society, from the free software movement to the implications of online shopping.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Cultures of Mediatization</italic></bold>. Andreas Hepp (Bremen University). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, November 2012, 180 pp., $24.95 pb. What does it mean for our culture that we can be reached on our mobile phones wherever we are and at all times? What are the cultural consequences of being informed about “everything and anything important” via television? “Cultures of mediatization” are cultures whose main resources are mediated by technical media. Everyday life in cultures of mediatization is molded by the media. To grasp this challenging media change, it is inappropriate to focus on a single media such as television, the press, mobile phones, the Internet, or other forms of digital media; rather, one has to capture “mediatization” of culture in its entirety.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Twitter: Social Communication in the Twitter Age</italic></bold>. Dhiraj Murthy (Bowdoin College). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, October 2012, 220 pp., $22.95 pb. Discusses Twitter’s role in our political, economic, and social lives, and draws a historical line between the telegraph and Twitter to reflect on changes in social communication over time. Also dwells on the impact of Twitter on the contemporary media environment.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Ubiquitous Photography</italic></bold>. Martin Hand (Queens University, Ontario). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, August 2012, 200 pp., $22.95 pb. A critical examination of the technologies, practices, and cultural significance of digital photography in historical, social, and political-economic context. Shifts in image making, storage, commodification, and interpretation are highly significant processes in an image-rich culture. Covers the history and politics of image making and manipulation, the current explosion in amateur photography, tagging and sharing via social networking, memory and mobility, immediacy and preservation, and citizen journalism.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Can Journalism Survive? An Inside Look at American Newsrooms</italic></bold>. David Ryfe (University of Nevada, Reno). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, August 2012, 256 pp., $24.95 pb. Journalists have failed to respond adequately to the challenge of the Internet, with far-reaching consequences for the future of journalism and democracy. Journalists are unable or unwilling to innovate for a variety of reasons: (1) their habits are difficult to dislodge, (2) the costs of change far exceeds the benefits, and/or (3) basic definitions of what journalism is and is for anchor journalism to tradition. As a consequence, journalism is unraveling as an integrated social field; it may never again be a separate and separable activity from the broader practice of producing news.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas</italic></bold>. Natasha Dow Schüll (Assistant Professor of Science, Technology, and Society, Massachusetts Institute of Technology [MIT]). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, June 2012, 368 pp., $35. Recent decades have seen a dramatic shift away from social forms of gambling to solitary gambling at electronic terminals. The mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into the “machine zone,” in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away. Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible. Schüll describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture, and ambiance management—all designed to meet the market’s desire for maximum “time on device.”</p>
<p><bold><italic>Identification and Quantification of the Proceeds of Bribery: Revised Edition, February 2012</italic></bold>. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Paris: OECD, March 2012, 70 pp., $23 pb. Public and private organizations alike have long recognized that bribery of public officials is harmful to good governance, economic development, and competitive conditions. Confiscation and recovery of the proceeds derived from foreign bribery are key elements in the international framework to fight corruption of public officials. Chapter 1 introduces the international legal framework for the treatment of the proceeds of active bribery—the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and the 2005 UN Convention against Corruption—and catalogs the legal remedies available in various jurisdictions, and how these remedies may interact. Chapter 2 defines the principal types of proceeds of active bribery (from contracts; business authorizations, permits, or licenses; expenses or losses avoided; expedition or delays; gains from using lax internal controls; and inaccurate or incomplete books and records) and analyzes how they may be quantified. Each system is illustrated by examples from countries using such methods, as well as commentary on some practical challenges linked to calculation of proceeds. Chapter 3 offers a compilation of case summaries to illustrate the principles covered in the preceding chapters.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Combating Cyber Crime</italic></bold>. Richard Stiennon. Washington: Government Institutes (dist. by Rowman &amp; Littlefield), January 2013, 192 pp., $39.95 (also as e-book). Reports of cyber crime rose 22 percent in 2009. Such crimes include not only identity theft and fraud but also malicious attempts to hack into federal infrastructures. While cyber crime is on the rise, there are measures that can be taken to mitigate its effects. The author of <italic>Surviving Cyberwar</italic> (GI 2010) and <italic>Cyber Defense</italic> (GI 2011) deals with the rise of criminal organizations on the Internet, their methods, evolution, and measures that e-commerce sites, retailers, banks, and individuals are using to avoid loss of intellectual property, money, and reputation.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Phake: The Deadly World of Falsified and Substandard Medicines</italic></bold>. Roger Bate (Fellow in Global Prosperity, American Enterprise Institute). Washington: AEI Press (dist. by Rowman &amp; Littlefield), May 2012, 400 pp., $49.95. Draws on many years spent on the trail of counterfeit medicines in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East to expose the anatomy of a nebulous, far-reaching black market that has resulted in countless deaths and injuries around the world. Describes the counterfeit drug trade and offers an incisive policy analysis with important ramifications for decision makers in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Reforming the Governance of the Financial Sector</italic></bold>. Edited by David Mayes (Professor of Finance and Director of the Europe Institute, University of Auckland, New Zealand) and Geoffrey Wood (Professor Emeritus of Economics, Cass Business School, City University, London). New York: Routledge, September 2012, 304 pp., $135. Good governance is crucial to the success of any regulatory regime. Explores how better governance of the financial sector can be achieved, going beyond banks, which have been the subject of most studies, to the whole of the financial sector. Sections focus on (1) <italic>The Need for Action</italic> (origins of the financial crisis, fundamental problems with the governance of the financial sector, impact of the global financial crisis on financial policy), (2) <italic>What Went Wrong</italic> (missing the red flags; the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and capital controls, poor performance of compulsory saving in Australia, moral hazard, and the protection of depositors), and (3) <italic>Ways Forward</italic> (the roles of governance and of regulation, time for a paradigm shift, improving the governance of financial institutions, cultural considerations for prudential supervisors, surviving the next crisis, the regulatory delusion—how economists mislead regulators).</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Global Economics of Sport</italic></bold>. Dongfeng Liu (Shanghai University of Sport, China), Chris Gratton, Girish Ramchandani, and Darryl Wilson (Sheffield Hallam University, UK). New York: Routledge, May 2012, 264 pp., $49.95 pb (also as e-book). Examines the economics of contemporary sport using the global market as the primary unit of analysis. Surveys the changing nature of the sports market over the past hundred years, and explores difficulties of measuring the true scale and impact of the global sports economy. Topics include global sports organizations, global commercial sport corporations, events, broadcasting, sponsorship, and the future of the global sports market. Drawing on case studies from the United Kingdom, North America, Europe, and the Far East, Liu offers a forecast for the evolution of the global sports market over the next twenty years.</p>
<p><bold><italic>A Primer on Heterodox Economics</italic></bold>. Ingrid Rima (Temple University, USA). New York: Routledge, July 2012, 256 pp., $56.95 pb. Economics is notable for having spawned a number of competing schools of thought; although the free market orthodoxy of neoclassical economics has come to hold sway in recent times, there remain an array of critical undercurrents. Rima charts the development of these varying schools of thought, their current status, and future prospects. The financial meltdown, the credit crunch, and the subprime crisis have provided fertile ground for less orthodox ways of thinking. Hence, a range of methodologies—from Austrian to Feminist, from Post Keynesian to Institutionalist—have begun to make their presence felt again, and there has been a considerable heating up of the debates. Chapters discuss postautistic economics, econometrics as a tool of prediction, American institutionalist dissent, evolutionary institutionalism, the New Classical Synthesis, post-Keynesian economics, German–Austrian economics, organizational economics or “new” institutionalism, Cambridge post-Keynesian economics, the “New” Left, and the revival of political economy.</p>
<p><bold><italic>A New Blueprint for a Green Economy</italic></bold>. Edward Barbier (Professor of Economics, University of Wyoming, USA) and Anil Markandya (Basque Centre for Climate Change, Bilbao, Spain). New York: Earthscan/Routledge, September 2012, 192 pp., $35.95 pb. First published in 1989, this book presented practical policy measures for greening modern economies and putting them on a path to sustainable development. The current book revisits and updates its main messages by asking what has been achieved in the past twenty years, and what more needs to be done to generate a truly “green economy” in the twenty-first century. Making economies more sustainable requires urgent progress in three key policy areas: valuing the environment, accounting for the environment, and incentives for environmental improvement. With rapid and widespread global environmental degradation, these policies are still relevant. Examines the progress since 1989 in implementing policies and other measures to improve environmental valuation, accounting and incentives, and the new policies and approaches needed for economic management of today’s environmental concerns.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Land, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness</italic></bold>. Molly Scott Cato (Professor of Strategy and Sustainability, University of Roehampton). New York: Routledge, October 2012, 224 pp., $49.99 pb. The U.K. Green Party economics spokesperson sets out a visionary account of what a bioregional approach to the economy would mean and how to get there. A bioregional approach to economics assumes a different system of values to that which dominates neoclassical economics. In the neoclassical view, the global economy is driven by growth, and the consumption ethic that matches this is one of expansion in range and quantity. Goods are defined as scarce, and access to them is a process based on competition. The bioregional approach challenges every aspect of that value system. It seeks a new ethic of consumption that prioritizes locality, accountability, and conviviality in the place of efficiency, expansion, and profit; proposes a shift in the focus of the economy away from profits and toward provisioning; and assumes a radical reorientation of work from employment toward livelihood.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Global Ecology and Unequal Exchange: Fetishism in a Zero-Sum World</italic></bold>. Alf Hornborg (Lund University, Sweden). New York: Routledge, June 2011, 208 pp., $125 (also as e-book). Resources from labor to energy are unequally transferred across the globe to the detriment of the environment and equity. In modern society, we tend to have faith in technology. Challenges the idea that humanity as a whole is united in a common development toward increasingly efficient technologies. Rather, modern technology implies a kind of global zero-sum game involving uneven resource flows, which make it possible for wealthier parts of global society to save time and space at the expense of humans and environments in the poorer parts. Chapters discuss fetishism, dissociation, and the cultural analysis of capitalism; progress as environmental load displacement; the unequal exchange of time and space; value, unequal exchange, and uneven development; how money transforms ecosystems; intervening in the logic of capitalism; and so on.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Zeronauts</italic></bold>. John Elkington (London). New York: Routledge, April 2012, 256 pp., $35.95. Founder of Sustain Ability and Volans, and author of <italic>The Triple Bottom Line</italic> and other books on corporate social responsibility, showcases pioneers who are at the cutting edge of the global sustainability movement and novel ways to create wealth in tune with the twenty-first century reality of a human population pushing toward ten billion people by mid- century and with key elements of the planet’s biosphere already coming apart at the seams. Introduces the emerging disciplines of zero-impact design, engineering, and management through the personal experiences and reflections of the leading practitioners, putting us on a path to a “zero-impact economy” of Zero Risk, Zero Emissions, Zero Pollution and Waste, Zero Biodiversity Loss, and Zero Population Growth. Shares the lessons learned from scores of people worldwide who are helping to define the scale of the challenges our species now faces and, crucially, developing and deploying at scale some of the solutions that will provide the building blocks of tomorrow’s economies and the foundations for some of the future’s greatest fortunes.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Economists’ Voice 2.0: The Financial Crisis, Health Care Reform, and More</italic></bold>. Edited by Aaron S. Edlin (Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley) and Joseph E. Stiglitz (Professor of Economics, Columbia University; former Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, World Bank). New York: Columbia University Press, June 2012, 256 pp., $22.99 (also as e-book). Gathers together the strongest thirty-two essays published in <italic>The Economists’ Voice</italic>—a nonpartisan online journal, by academics, economists, consultants, and policy makers. Topics include the economics of health care reform, the future of the health insurance industry, the value of the health insurance subsidies, effects of financial regulatory reform, possibilities for ratings reform, and the issue of limiting bankers’ pay. Also considers investment banking regulation, alternative strategies for addressing the next financial crisis, stability of pension security bonds, the value of a carbon tax, the unforeseen consequences of government debt, and so on.</p>

<p><bold><italic>The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities Are Reshaping the World</italic></bold> (with a new preface by the author). Ben Wildavsky (Scholar in Research and Policy, Kauffman Foundation). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, June 2012, 240 pp., $18.95 pb. The international competition for the brightest minds is transforming the world of higher education. As international universities strive to become world class, the new global education marketplace is providing more opportunities to more people than ever before. Discusses notable developments in higher education since the first edition in 2010.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Not for Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</italic></bold> (with a new afterword by the author). Martha C. Nussbaum (Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, University of Chicago). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, April 2012, 192 pp., $15.95 pb (cloth 2010). Thinking about the aims of education has gone disturbingly awry in the United States and abroad. We increasingly treat education as though its primary goal is to teach students to become economically productive, rather than to think critically and become knowledgeable and empathetic citizens. The focus on profitable skills has eroded our ability to criticize authority, reduced our sympathy with the marginalized and the different, and damaged our competence to deal with complex global problems.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Sustainable University: Green Goals and New Challenges for Higher Education Leaders</italic></bold>. James Martin (Professor of English, Mount Ida College; Academic Vice President, The Education Alliance) and James E. Samels (CEO and President, The Education Alliance). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, May 2012, 352 pp., $45 (also as e-book).While almost 700 chief executive officers have signed the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, several thousand have yet to do so. Identifies four of the most formidable challenges facing these presidents and their leadership teams, along with solutions to address them: (1) effectively institutionalizing sustainability thinking; (2) developing an efficient, flexible system of sustainability benchmarks; (3) implementing an accountable university budget mode; and (4) engaging boards of trustees in the campus sustainability agenda. Discusses specific action plans, best practices, and emerging trends in sustainability efforts.</p>
<p><bold><italic>On Education: Conversations with Riccardo Mazzeo</italic></bold>. Zygmunt Bauman (Professor Emeritus, University of Leeds). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, May 2012, 143 pp., $12.95 pb. Many young people are inclined to withdraw—in some cases into the online world of games and virtual relationships, in other cases into depression, anorexia, alcohol, or even drug abuse, hoping to find shelter from a world perceived as more and more dangerous. Reflects on the predicament of young people today and the role of education in a world where the certainties of our predecessors can no longer be taken for granted (also see <italic>Collateral Damage: Social Inequalities in a Global Age</italic> by Zygmunt Bauman, Polity Press, 2011, 192 pp., $19.95 pb).</p>

<p><bold><italic>The Future of Helium As a Natural Resource</italic></bold>. Edited by William J. Nuttall, Richard Clarke, and Bartek Glowacki (University of Cambridge). New York: Routledge, April 2012, 320 pp., $130. Major new users of helium are expected to enter the market, especially in nuclear energy (both fission and fusion). Prices and volumes supplied are expected to rise and this will prompt greater efforts toward development of new helium sources, as well as helium conservation and recycling. Chapters focus on the history of the helium industry, the U.S. federal helium reserve, helium in Russia and India, helium from the air, minimizing helium demand in cryogenic applications, helium and nuclear fission, and so on.</p>
<p><bold><italic>OECD Green Growth Studies: Energy</italic></bold>. OECD with the International Energy Agency. Paris: OECD, February 2012, 104 pp., $33 pb (also as e-book). The OECD Green Growth Strategy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth">www.oecd.org/greengrowth</ext-link>) aims to provide concrete recommendations and measurement tools, including indicators, to support national efforts to achieve economic growth and development, while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which well-being relies. The strategy proposes a flexible policy framework that can be tailored to different country circumstances and stages of development. Together with innovation, going green can be a long-term driver for economic growth, by investing in renewable energy and improved efficiency in the use of energy and materials. Chapter topics: (1) <italic>Transforming the energy sector to sustain growth</italic>, (2) <italic>Promoting the transition to green growth</italic> (potential trade-offs and adjustment costs, key technologies for green growth and energy), (3) <italic>Reshaping the political economy</italic> (structural adjustment, stranded capital, employment effects, and distributional effects in implementing green energy), and (4) <italic>Monitoring progress towards green growth</italic> (OECD’s Green Growth indicators).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Deploying Renewables: Best and Future Policy Practice</italic></bold>. International Energy Agency. Paris: OECD, March 2012, 180 pp., $140 pb (also as e-book). The global energy system faces urgent challenges. Concerns about energy security are growing, as highlighted by the recent political turmoil in Northern Africa and the nuclear incident in Fukushima. At the same time, the need to respond to climate change is more critical than ever. Against this background, many governments have increased efforts to promote deployment of renewable energy—low-carbon sources that can strengthen energy security. Renewables are now the fastest growing sector of the energy mix. Features of this report: (1) a comprehensive review and analysis of renewable energy policy and market trends, (2) analysis in detail of the dynamics of deployment and best-practice policy principles for different stages of market maturity, (3) assessment of the impact and cost-effectiveness of support policies using new methodological tools and indicators, and (4) the strategic reasons underpinning the pursuit of renewable energy (RE) deployment by different countries and the prospects for globalization of RE.</p>

Going beyond the Earth’s complete history, the authors look at the search for other habitable worlds in the Milky Way, contemplate whether the Earth will remain habitable as our influence on global climate grows, and consider the ways in which humankind can sustain Earth’s habitability and perhaps even participate in further planetary evolution.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Climate-Smart Development in Asia: Transition to Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economies</italic></bold>. Edited by Ancha Srinivasan, Frank Ling, and Hideyuki Mori. New York: Routledge, January 2012, 272 pp., $44.95 pb (also as e-book). Covers critical aspects of climate-smart development and attempts to integrate market-based and technology-based solutions into a comprehensive approach to create a road map for low-carbon, climate-resilient economies in Asia. Examines strategies, policies, and incentives in selected countries for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, transportation, land use, and buildings sectors. Identifies policies that are essential to improve resilience to current and future impacts of climate change.</p>
<p><bold><italic>OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050: The Consequences of Inaction</italic></bold>. OECD. Paris: OECD, March 2012, 350 pp., $112. Humanity has witnessed unprecedented growth and prosperity in the past decades, with the size of the world economy more than tripling and population increasing by more than three billion people since 1970. This growth, however, has been accompanied by environmental pollution and natural resource depletion. The current growth model and the mismanagement of natural assets could ultimately undermine human development. Based on joint modeling by the OECD and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the report looks forward to 2050 to find out what demographic and economic trends might mean for the environment if the world does not adopt more ambitious green policies. Also looks at what policies could change that picture for the better. Focuses on two scenarios (a Baseline Scenario and a 450 Delayed Action Scenario) and four areas—climate change, biodiversity, freshwater, and health impacts of pollution—all identified by the previous Environmental Outlook to 2030 (OECD 2008) as issues requiring urgent attention.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Climate Change and the Built Environment: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Design</italic></bold>. Alisdair McGregor and Cole Roberts (Arup Consulting Engineers, San Francisco) and Fiona Cousins (Arup, New York). New York: Routledge, December 2012, 240 pp., $54.95 pb. Sustainable design is an approach to a low-carbon future that considers economic and social impacts as well as the environmental issues of projects. Provides guidance for moving to a low-carbon future for developers and the design and construction community. Reviews the current science and predictions for global warming and looks at what steps can be taken to design the built environment to mitigate the extent of global warming and to adapt to inevitable changes in climate. Discusses both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Shows how a sustainable design approach to the built environment will both help mitigate climate change and provide resilience for the unavoidable climate changes already facing humanity.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Climate Change and Social Ecology: A New Perspective on the Climate Challenge</italic></bold>. Stephen M. Wheeler (University of California, Davis). New York: Routledge, April 2012, 192 pp., $37.95 pb. Industrial cultures have been unable to confront the issues underlying the climate problem such as overconsumption, overpopulation, inequity, and dysfunctional political systems. Political and social obstacles have prevented adoption of improved technologies, and these would provide only a partial solution in any case. To address this impending catastrophe and bring about more sustainable development, we must focus on improving social ecologies—our values, mind-sets, and organizations. Shows how to help social ecologies evolve toward sustainability, and explores the social transformations needed to deal with the climate crisis in the long term; reviews climate change strategies considered to date; presents a detailed vision of a future sustainable society, and analyzes how this vision might be realized through more conscious public nurturing of social ecologies.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Hockey Stick and the Climate War: Dispatches from the Front Lines</italic></bold>. Michael E. Mann (Director, Penn State Earth System Science Center). New York: Columbia University Press, March 2012, 384 pp., $22.99 (also as e-book). Worldwide human activity since the industrial age had raised CO<sub>2</sub> levels, trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and warming the planet. In its 2001 report on global climate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change prominently featured the “Hockey Stick,” a chart showing global temperature data over the past 1,000 years, to demonstrate that temperature had risen with the increase in industrialization and use of fossil fuels. The “Hockey Stick” became the central icon in the “climate wars” and well-funded science deniers immediately attacked the chart and the scientists responsible for it. Mann tells the story of the science and politics behind this controversy, the “Climategate” scandal and the 2009 hacking of climate scientists’ e-mails, and the role of science deniers in diverting attention away from one of the central scientific and policy issue of our time.</p>
<p><bold><italic>River Republic: The Fall and Rise of America’s Rivers</italic></bold>. Daniel McCool (Director, Environmental and Sustainability Studies and Professor of Political Science, University of Utah). New York: Columbia University Press, August 2012, 352 pp., $26.99 (also as e-book). Chronicles the history of water development agencies in America and the way in which special interests have abused rather than preserved the country’s rivers. Narrates the surging grassroots movement to bring these rivers back to life and ensure that they remain pristine for future generations. As a result, America’s rivers are returning to a healthier, free-flowing condition. The politics of river restoration have also brought democratic grassroots activism back to its meaningful roots.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Beach Book: Science of the Shore</italic></bold>. Carl H. Hobbs (Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary). New York: Columbia University Press, June 2012, 192 pp., $19.50 pb (also as e-book). Provides natural resource managers and concerned citizens with richer information on sediments, gauging erosion rates, erosion control, beach nourishment, and coastal zone development. Proposes new methods for keeping our beaches healthy by discussing ways to combat erosion and the decline of habitats. Uses examples from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America, which have characteristics to be found worldwide.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Climate Wars: What People Will Be Killed For in the 21st Century</italic></bold>. Harald Welzer (University of Hanover and Witten/Herdecke). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, February 2012, 224 pp., $25. Climate change and violence go hand in hand. Climate change has far-reaching consequences for the living conditions of people around the world, as habitable spaces shrink, scare resources become scarcer, and injustices grow deeper, not only between North and South but also between generations. This gives rise to new social tensions, and leading to violent conflicts, civil wars, and massive refugee flows. Very little is being done to confront the challenges climate change poses in terms of security, responsibility, and justice.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Inclusive Wealth Report 2012: Measuring Progress toward Sustainability</italic></bold>. United Nations University (UNU) International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (Partha Dasgupta, Inclusive Wealth Report [IWR] Science Advisor; Professor Emeritus of Economics, Cambridge University). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, July 2012, 336 pp. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr">www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr</ext-link>). Introduces the <italic>Inclusive Wealth Index</italic> (IWI) to measure the three kinds of assets available in an economy: physical capital (machinery, buildings, infrastructure, etc.), human capital (education and skills of the population), and natural capital (agricultural land, forests, fisheries, fossil fuels, and minerals). Of twenty countries assessed, Japan had the highest inclusive wealth per person, followed by the United States, Canada, Norway, Australia, Germany, Britain, and France. Among the twenty countries, fourteen had positive IWI growth rates in the 1990–2008 period, led by China at 2.1 percent, Germany at 1.8 percent, France at 1.4 percent, four nations at 0.9 percent (Japan, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and India), the United States at 0.7 percent, Canada at 0.4 percent, Australia at 0.1 percent, and Kenya at 0.06 percent. Six nations had negative growth rates: Colombia, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Venezuela (primarily due to high population growth, except in Russia). Of the twenty countries assessed, Japan was the only one with growth in natural capital, due to increased forest cover. Human capital has increased in every country, being the primary capital form that offsets the decline in natural capital in most economies. Recommendations: (1) many countries should build up investments in renewable natural capital (e.g., reforestation, agro-biodiversity landscapes, and seascapes); (2) countries should embed the IWI in their macroeconomic planning, alongside common indicators like gross domestic product (GDP; which is inadequate and misleading as a measure of economic growth); (3) governments should shift from an income-based accounting framework to a wealth accounting framework; (4) governments should move away from GDP per capita, and evaluate policies based on contributions to inclusive wealth; (5) research programs should be established for valuing key components of natural capital, particularly ecosystem services (much work must still be done to make natural capital accounts fully operational so that they become mainstream instruments in policymaking). (Note: An important step forward in moving away from the misleading GDP measure of progress, although the many critics of GDP may still find various faults with IWI.)</p>

Earthscan (dist. by Routledge), June 2012, 288 pp., $53.95 pb. Examines an array of different distortions that are causing food supply chain dysfunction in many countries. Outlines the underlying changes that are currently occurring in the direction of food supply chains, and provides some solutions to the current food security problem. Focuses on liberal trade and deregulation as a more successful solution to stabilizing food supply chains and distribution. Highlights a common thread of either farmers using government for vested-interest intervention, or autocratic governments seeking market and supply chain power. Comingled commoditization of food has led to increased hoarding, corruption, and dependence on food aid. A competitive food supply chain that has minimum intervention is more likely to provide future food security; adequate rewards and competition in the supply chain are the essences of sustainable food security.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Food and the Tourism Experience—The OECD-Korea Workshop</italic></bold>. OECD. Paris: OECD, March 2012, 176 pp., $63 pb. Tourism is a major part of the contemporary experience economy, which has seen a shift toward intangible culture and heritage. The focus of many tourists has changed from the classic “must-see” physical sights such as museums and monuments to a “must-experience” imperative to consume intangible expressions of culture, such as atmosphere, creativity, and lifestyle. Food plays an increasingly important role. Provides an understanding of the role of food tourism in local economic development and its potential for country branding. Features case studies of the experience economy in the Nordic countries, Italy, Latin America, Korea, Spain, Austria, France, and Japan.</p>

<p><bold><italic>The Spirit of Compromise: Why Governing Demands It and Campaigning Undermines It</italic></bold>. Amy Gutmann (President and Distinguished Professor of Political Science, University of Pennsylvania) and Dennis Thompson (Professor of Political Philosophy, Harvard University). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, May 2012, 176 pp., $24.95. Campaigning for political office calls for a mind-set that blocks compromise—standing tenaciously on principle to mobilize voters and mistrusting opponents to defeat them. Good government calls for an opposite cluster of attitudes and arguments—the compromising mind-set—that inclines politicians to adjust their principles and to respect their opponents. Proposes changes in our political institutions, processes, and mind-sets that would encourage a better balance between campaigning and governing.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Unheavenly Chorus: Unequal Political Voice and the Broken Promise of American Democracy</italic></bold>. Kay Lehman Schlozman (Professor of Political Science, Boston College), Sidney Verba (University Professor Emeritus, Harvard University), and Henry E. Bradley (Professor of Political Science and Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, May 2012, 608 pp., $35. Politically active individuals and organizations make huge investments of time, energy, and money to influence everything from election outcomes to congressional subcommittee hearings to local school politics, while other groups and individual citizens seem woefully underrepresented in our political system. Looks at the political participation of individual citizens alongside the political advocacy of thousands of organized interests—membership organizations such as trade associations, unions, professional organizations, and citizens groups, as well as organizations like corporations, hospitals, and universities. Demonstrates that American democracy is marred by deeply ingrained and persistent class-based political inequality, how the political voices of organized interests are even less representative than those of individuals, how political advantage is handed down over generations, how recruitment to political activity perpetuates and exaggerates existing biases, and how political voice on the Internet replicates these inequalities.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Democracy Index: Why Our Election System Is Failing and How to Fix It</italic></bold>. Heather K. Gerken (Professor of Law, Yale University). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, June 2012, 192 pp., $16.95 pb (cloth 2009). Calls for a Democracy Index that would rate the performance of state and local election systems, and provides a blueprint for quantifying election performance and reform results. It would work because no one wants to be at the bottom of the list. The Index would consider areas with the shortest lines at polling stations, easiest places to cast an absentee ballot, cities with the most accurate voter rolls, leading states for accurate voting machines, and best registration processes.</p>
<p><bold><italic>When the State Speaks, What Should It Say? How Democracies Can Protect Expression and Promote Equality</italic></bold>. Corey Brettschneider (Associate Professor of Political Science, Brown University). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, June 2012, 232 pp., $35. The democratic state faces the hard choice of either protecting the rights of hate groups and allowing their views to spread, or banning their views and violating citizens’ rights to freedoms of expression, association, and religion. Brettschneider’s theory of value democracy argues that the state should protect the right to express illiberal beliefs, but the state should also engage in democratic persuasion when it speaks through its various capacities: publicly criticizing, and giving reasons to reject hate-based or other discriminatory viewpoints. Public criticism of viewpoints advocating discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation should be pursued through state’s expressive capacities as speaker, educator, and spender. By using democratic persuasion, the state can respect rights and counter hateful or discriminatory viewpoints.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Politics of Precaution: Regulating Health, Safety, and Environmental Risks in Europe and the United States</italic></bold>. David Vogel (Professor of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, May 2012, 320 pp., $39.50. Since the 1990s, global regulatory leadership shifted from the United States to Europe in regard to vehicle air pollution, ozone depletion, climate change, beef and milk hormones, genetically modified agriculture, antibiotics in animal feed, pesticides, cosmetic safety, and hazardous substances in electronic products. Explains why Europe and the United States have often regulated risks differently. Concerns over these risks, and pressure on political leaders to do something about them, have risen among the European public, but declined among Americans. European policy makers have thus grown more willing to regulate risks on precautionary grounds, whereas increasingly skeptical American policy makers call for higher levels of scientific certainty before imposing additional regulatory controls on business.</p>

Edited by Larry Diamond (Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution; Director, Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law, Stanford University) and Marc F. Plattner (Vice President for Research and Studies, National Endowment for Democracy). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, June 2012, 184 pp., $24.95. While technology has been instrumental in freeing Egypt and Tunisia (earning it the label “liberation technology”), other cases—such as China and Iran—demonstrate that it can be deployed just as effectively by authoritarian regimes seeking to control the Internet, stifle protest, and target dissenters. This two-sided dynamic has set off an intense technological race between “netizens” demanding freedom and authoritarians determined to retain their grip on power. Discusses the dichotomy of “liberation” versus “control” with regard to the Internet and the sociopolitical dimensions of such controls. Focuses on individual countries: China, Egypt, Iran, and Tunisia. Case studies regard specific technologies such as Ushahidi—a platform developed to document human rights abuses in the wake of Kenya’s 2007 elections—and the cyber-censorship circumvention tool alkasir, which has been used widely throughout the Middle East.</p>

Edited by Francis Fukuyama (Senior Fellow, Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law, Stanford University), Larry Diamond (Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution and Institute for International Studies, Stanford University), and Marc F. Plattner (Vice President for research and studies, National Endowment for Democracy). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, March 2012, 192 pp., $29.95 pb. Citizens who feel that democracy failed to improve their economic condition are often vulnerable to the appeal of political leaders with authoritarian tendencies. Addresses (1) the complicated philosophical and moral issues surrounding distribution of economic goods in free societies, (2) the empirical relationships between democratization and trends in poverty and inequality, (3) the variety of welfare state policies that have been adopted in different regions of the world, (4) whether democracy promotes inequality, (5) socioeconomic factors that drive democratic failure, (6) basic choices that societies must make as they decide how to deal with inequality, and (7) how problems of poverty and inequality have been handled (or mishandled) by newer democracies in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia.</p>

Explores the complexities of contemporary global politics.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Federal Management Reform in a World of Contradictions</italic></bold>. Beryl A. Radin (Public Policy Institute, Georgetown University). Washington: Georgetown University Press, March 2012, 208 pp., $29.95 pb (also as e-book). Reform efforts within the U.S. federal management have frequently failed for more than fifty years. Examines three sets of contradictions between the strategies of the reformers and the reality of the U.S. federal system: (1) contradictions in the shared power structure, (2) contradictions in values, and (3) contradictions between politics and administration. Explores six types of reforms—contracting out, personnel policy, agency reorganization, budgeting, federalism policies and procedures, and performance management—and the core beliefs that guided them. Too often, these prescriptions for reform have tried to apply techniques from the private sector or a parliamentary system that do not transfer well to the structure of the U.S. federal system and its democratic and political traditions.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Health Policy and the Public Interest</italic></bold>. Lok-sang Ho (Lingnan University, Hong Kong). New York: Routledge, March 2012, 256 pp., $144. A systematic introduction to the theory of health and the theory of health policy design that is grounded on a good understanding of human nature. Reducing extreme risks will improve welfare, and so it is important for the government to protect citizens against such extreme risks as arising from health risks. Health policy should incorporate the incentives of patients and caregivers to render the preservation of health efficient. Draws on experience in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, France, and so on, to emphasize the importance of defining the appropriate role of publicly provided care. It should cover basic care, form the backbone of health care, and be universally accessible at an appropriate price, which should discourage demand-side moral hazard, and at the same time should offer no incentive for suppliers to oversupply or undersupply services. Private health care and health insurance also have a place to provide supplementary care and greater choice.</p>
<p><bold><italic>It’s Enough to Make You Sick: The Failure of American Health Care and a Prescription for the Cure</italic></bold>. Jeffrey M. Lobosky, M.D. (Associate Professor of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, May 2012, 284 pp., $27. More and more Americans are finding themselves without health insurance or with coverage that is so inadequate that they face financial ruin in the event they get sick. So they go without and their children do not receive immunizations. Just how did our system become so dysfunctional and who is responsible? Explains how the varied special interests have conspired to create a system that is by far the costliest in the world and yet is mediocre at best in providing quality care. Explores the various culprits and how each has contributed to the sad state of affairs, dissects in detail The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and offers a practical and compassionate blueprint for meaningful reform.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Blowing Smoke: Rethinking the War on Drugs without Prohibition and Rehab</italic></bold>. Michael J. Reznicek, M.D. (Clinical Psychiatrist, Washington State). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, February 2012, 170 pp., $34.99 (also as e-book). Addiction is not a medical problem to be treated in rehab or by prohibiting substance use. The disease model has exacerbated the problem by telling drug abusers that they are not responsible for their behavior, that they are sick, and that they are not to blame. Proposes the habit model, a new approach to drug use and abuse. Habits are practiced as long as they provide comfort, and are abandoned when they cause pain. The habit model is more consistent with current neuroscientific knowledge and accounts for the widely observed phenomenon that most substance abusers do not change until they “hit bottom,” the point where the consequences of drug use finally outweigh its benefits. The solution to the drug problem is to turn back the clock, and to take lessons from societies that use social controls and consequences to deal with addiction and drug abuse. Recommends legalization of drugs for adults, implementation of social practices to dissuade abusers, and an end to the use of rehab as a way of handling addiction.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Obesity Reality: A Comprehensive Approach to a Growing Problem</italic></bold>. Naheed Ali, M.D. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, May 2012, 352 pp., $35 (also as e-book). More than a billion people are overweight worldwide, and that number is expected to increase substantially over the next decade. There is no magic medication or vaccine that can head off the obesity epidemic as it sweeps across the planet. Discusses the realities of obesity and its repercussions, which include poor health, high medical costs, restrictions on lifestyle and activities, and so on. Shows how we can address obesity, starting in childhood, to prevent it from getting worse, both on a personal and on a societal level, and how we can reverse its effects through proper diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices, as well as medical procedures and medications.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Public Health for an Aging Society</italic></bold>. Edited by Thomas R. Prohaska (Professor of Public Health, Center for Research on Health and Aging, University of Illinois at Chicago), Lynda A. Anderson (Director, Healthy Aging Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Adjunct Associate Professor, Emory University), and Robert H. Binstock (Professor of Aging, Health, and Society, Case Western Reserve University). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, March 2012, 448 pp., $40 pb (also as e-book). Chapters discuss research, policy, and practice; managing and preventing diseases; promoting mental and physical health; and maintaining quality of life for an aging society. Adopts a socioecological perspective that incorporates individual, family, community, societal, and environmental concerns. Addresses the most critical public health issues facing an aging society, including Medicare and family caregiving, and introduces many new and emerging concepts, such as emergency preparedness, technology in aging, transnational research, genomics, and environmental influences on health and health practices.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Long-Term Care, Globalization, and Justice</italic></bold>. Lisa A. Eckenwiler (Associate Professor of Philosophy and Health Administration and Policy, George Mason University; Director of Health Care Ethics, Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, July 2012, 144 pp., $60 (also as e-book). Long-term care can be vexing on a personal as well as social level, and it will only grow more so as individuals continue to live longer and the population of aged persons increases in the United States and around the world. Care work is organized not just nationally, as much current debate suggests, but also transnationally, through economic, labor, immigration, and health policies established by governments, international lending bodies, and for-profit entities, in a manner that raises pressing questions of local as well as global responsibility. Examines this organizational structure to show how it creates and sustains injustice against the dependent elderly and those who care for them, including a growing number of migrant care workers, and weakens the capacities of source countries and their health care systems. Offers a corrective philosophical framework and finds ethical and practicable policy solutions to care for aging populations in the United States and in less well-off parts of the world.</p>

Nessa Carey (former Senior Lecturer, Imperial College in London). New York: Columbia University Press, March 2012, 352 pp., $26.95. Epigenetics has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the structure and behavior of biological life on earth. It explains why mapping an organism’s DNA code is not enough to determine how it develops or acts, and shows how nurture combines with nature to engineer biological diversity. Epigenetics is now informing our understanding of drug addiction, cancer, malnutrition, mental disorders such as schizophrenia, and the physical and psychological consequences of childhood trauma. Offers future directions of research and the potential for epigenetics to improve human health and well-being.</p>

New York: Columbia University Press with Médecins Sans Frontières, March 2012, 320 pp., $24.50 pb (also as e-book). Provides a frank account of the strategies required to bring controversial aid to those in desperate need, in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of MSF. Addresses the evolution of humanitarian goals, political deals MSF has struck (or failed to strike) to achieve its objectives, and political transactions and potentially unsavory negotiations aid workers must undertake to go forward with their plans. Questions the existence of a protected “humanitarian space”—in reality, humanitarian organizations must negotiate with multiple, possibly opposing parties, each with its own interests and claims who may or may not allow humanitarian organizations to operate within their crisis zones.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Global Health Governance</italic></bold>. Jeremy Youde (University of Minnesota, Duluth). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, April 2012, 240 pp., $26.95 pb. Discusses the changing international legal environment, the governmental and nongovernmental actors involved with health issues, and the current regime’s ability to adapt to new crises. Focuses on the evolution of international regulations aimed at stopping the spread of health problems across borders over the past 150 years, the most prominent actors in global health governance (World Health Organization [WHO], the World Bank, private philanthropic organizations, etc.), and pressing global health issues such as access to pharmaceuticals, costs and benefits of making health a security issue, and the role of civil society organizations.</p>

Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, September 2012, 200 pp., $24.95 pb. Examines key intersections between health and international relations today: (1) foreign policy and health diplomacy, (2) health and the global political economy, (3) global health governance, and (4) global health security. The explosion of interest in these subjects has been due to “real-world” concerns such as disease outbreaks, antibiotic resistance, counterfeit drugs, and other risks of human health amid the spread of globalization. Also looks at how global health is problematized, how certain issues and agendas are prioritized, and what determines the potential solutions put forth to address them.</p>

Many Republicans and most conservatives are antigay and have capitulated to an antigay agenda formulated and pursued by the religious right for the past several decades. Makes the case that support for gay rights will provide long-term political benefits for the Grand Old Party (GOP) and the conservative movement. The antigay agenda exposes the hypocrisy of those who talk of limited government and individual rights.

Surveys the major geopolitical, economic, and security challenges facing the world in general, and the Jewish world and the United States in particular. Looks at (1) the shift of power and influence from the United States and Europe to the emerging powers in Asia and Latin America, (2) globalization and the new information age, (3) the battle for the direction of the Muslim world, (4) nontraditional security threats, (5) changing demographics that pose a particular challenge for Jews worldwide, (6) the rise of a new anti-Semitism that seeks to delegitimize Israel as a Jewish state, and (7) the enduring nature of and challenges to the strategic alliance between the United States and Israel (also see <italic>Israeli Statecraft</italic> by Yehezkel Dror, Routledge, September 2011).</p>

Smith (Assistant Professor of International Affairs, Lewis &amp; Clark College, Oregon). Washington: Georgetown University Press, April 2012, 192 pp., $29.95 pb (also as e-book). Many governments that persistently violate human rights have also ratified international human rights treaties that empower their citizens to file grievances against them at the United Nations. Governments ratify these treaties insincerely in response to domestic economic pressures: signing the treaties is a way to at least temporarily keep the critics of their human rights records at bay while they secure international economic assistance or more favorable trade terms. Examines the factors contributing to commitment and compliance among post-Soviet States such as Slovakia, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>

A strong legitimate central government is far from likely to emerge in Kabul; fewer coalition forces, used in creative ways, may have better effects on the ground than a larger, more conventional presence. While there may never be complete peace in Afghanistan, a self-sustaining security system able to restore order swiftly in the wake of violence is attainable. A significant number of U.S. combat troops will remain in Afghanistan until at least 2014. Provides a comprehensive assessment of the alternatives for restoring peace and stability to Afghanistan, and weighs the many costs, risks, and benefits of each.</p>

<p><bold><italic>China and India: The Quest for Energy Resources in the 21st Century</italic></bold>. Hong Zhao (East Asian Institute, Singapore). New York: Routledge, February 2012, 208 pp., $152. What is the new definition of energy security? How does it affect global politics and international relations? What are the energy security concerns of China and India, and what policies and approaches have they taken to deal with energy security issues? Provides insight into what the new global energy order may be, and how the growth models and energy structures may shape the economic growth and energy. Analyzes the state-centered approach and market-oriented approach in the global quest for energy resources. Case studies cover the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia.</p>

New York: Routledge, July 2012, 324 pp., $44.95 pb (also as e-book). Drawing on years of research experience and observations of the triumphs and problems in China’s cities, uncovers urban dynamism and complexity amid dramatic changes in the Chinese economy and society, and explores the consequences of current development paths and emerging technologies on urban economies, the people, and the environment. Covers such topics as history and patterns of urbanization, spatial and regional context, models of urban form, social-spatial transformation, economic restructuring, urbanism and cultural dynamics, housing and land development, environmental issues, and challenges of urban governance.</p>

Liselotte Odgaard (Professor of Strategy, Royal Danish Defence College; former Fellow, Woodrow Wilson Center, 2008–2009). Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press (dist. by Johns Hopkins University Press), April 2012, 224 pp., $45. “Peaceful coexistence,” long a key phrase in China’s strategic thinking, is a constructive doctrine that offers China a path for influencing the international system. China’s program emphasizes absolute sovereignty and noninterference in the internal affairs of other states. Its policy of working within the international community and with nonstate actors such as the United Nations aims to win for China greater power and influence without requiring widespread exercise of military or economic pressure. Examines the origins of peaceful coexistence in early Soviet doctrine, its mid-century development by China and India, its ongoing appeal to developing countries, and its role in (1) China’s border disputes in the South China Sea and with Russia and India; (2) diplomacy in the UN Security Council over Iran, Sudan, and Myanmar; and (3) China’s handling of challenges to the legitimacy of its regime from Taiwan, Xinjiang, and Japan.</p>
<p><bold><italic>China’s Environmental Challenges</italic></bold>. Judith Shapiro (American University). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, June 2012, 200 pp., $22.95 pb. China’s huge environmental challenges are significant for all of us. Investigates China’s struggle to achieve sustainable development against a backdrop of acute poverty and soaring middle-class consumption. Asks whether it is even possible to build an equitable system in which people enjoy equal access to resources without taking them from successive generations, from the poor, or from other species. The path toward a more sustainable development model is still open to the world and to China; it will not remain so much longer.</p>

<p><bold><italic>The Crisis of the European Union</italic></bold>. Jürgen Habermas (Johan Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, April 2012, 120 pp., $19.95. Critiques the ineffectual and evasive responses to the global financial crisis, especially by the German political class. Explains the threat posed by current proposals to transform the system of European governance into one of executive federalism. The central argument is that the European project must realize its democratic potential by evolving from an international into a cosmopolitan community (also see <italic>An Awareness of What Is Missing: Faith and Reason in a Post-Secular Age</italic> by Jürgen Habermas, Polity Press, 2010, 96 pp., $14.95 pb).</p>

New York: Columbia University Press, April 2012, 288 pp., $27.99 (also as e-book). Once understood as the vanguard of postcommunist political and economic reform, Hungary has become an example of the new threats destabilizing democracies across Central Europe: nationalism, ethnic hatred, corruption, and authoritarian tendencies. Since the spring of 2012, right-wing populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has embarked on a sweeping and ruthless concentration of power and has sought to reshape the state through a new constitution, and a vast series of laws and decrees that dismantle safeguards protecting the autonomy of the executive branch and the media. Nationalist rhetoric is increasing tensions in neighboring Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia.</p>

Revisits the major turning points and trends of Pakistani history over the past six decades, focusing on (1) the increasing entrenchment of Pakistan’s army in political and economic arenas, (2) the complex role of Islam in public life, (3) tensions between central and local identities and democratic impulses, and (4) the effect of geopolitical influences on domestic policy and development. Affirms Pakistan’s potential for a positive reawakening, in that favorable opportunities still remain.</p>

OECD. Paris: OECD, April 2012, 88 pp., $33 pb (also as e-book). OECD member countries provided $46.7 billion in official development assistance to fragile states in 2009 but no low-income fragile state has yet achieved a single Millennium Development Goal (MDG); 1.5 billion people live in countries affected by repeated cycles of violence and insecurity. These countries face tremendous challenges as they transition from conflict to peace. International support can play a crucial role in these contexts, but has so far struggled to deliver transformative results. Presents clear policy recommendations for better practice to improve the speed, flexibility, predictability, and risk management of international support during postconflict transition. Draws on the DAC International Network on Conflict and Security actions in Afghanistan, Haiti, and Sudan. Shows current approaches are inadequate because (1) the aid architecture is fragmented, (2) policies and procedures of engagement are not tailored to the context, (3) there is not enough prioritization among international actors, and (4) there is both duplication and lack of coherence in aid instruments. Calls for the need for change in the context of risk, coherent planning and prioritization, and getting the mix of aid instruments right.</p>

Evaluates the impact of coercive arms control efforts to curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction in the twenty-first century. Contents discuss (1) paradigm shift in arms control (noncooperative arms control, coercion and the informalization of arms control), (2) effectiveness and legitimacy of arms control instruments, and (3) prospects for a new arms control agenda as viewed from the United States, Europe, India, and the Middle East.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Preparing for the Next Asia-Pacific War: Defence Planning in the Twenty-First Century</italic></bold>. Stephan Fruhling (Australian National University). New York: Routledge, October 2013, $145. Analyses the defense policy statements of three key Asia-Pacific powers—the United States, Australia, and New Zealand—and shows how uncertainty about the rise of China has influenced current defense planning decisions, and how thinking about the strategic risks associated with China has changed over time. Explains the difference in approach by the three countries, the degree to which strategic risk emanates from China directly or indirectly from China’s wider impact on the region, the consequences for Japan of China’s rise, and whether the defense planning responses are commensurate with the real degree of risk.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Psychology of Terrorism</italic></bold> (2nd ed.). John Horgan (Penn State University). New York: Routledge, June 2012, 240 pp., $37.95. Presents a unique model of involvement and engagement in terrorism by considering it as a process, and explores three distinct phases of the making of a terrorist: (1) becoming involved, (2) remaining involved (or “being” a terrorist), and (3) leaving terrorism behind. Illustrates the lack of any identifiable psychopathology in terrorists, and demonstrates how frighteningly “normal” and unremarkable in psychological terms are those who engage in terrorist activity.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Cyber Defense: Countering Targeted Attacks</italic></bold>. Richard Stiennon. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, December 2012, 192 pp., $39.95. Widespread random attacks from viruses, worms, and bots were used to engage in cyber crime and disruptive behavior. As these threats mature, they turn into targeted attacks against banks, large data processors, and governments. Today, such targeted attacks have become the greatest threat facing every organization. Overviews the technology, methodology, and tools needed to defend digital assets from targeted attacks. Addresses security practitioners, IT managers of corporate and government sites, and government agency officials determining cyber policies. Explains why countering targeted attacks requires new investment in technology, as well as changes to security operations and organizations. Addresses new services and products that have arisen to assist in the task of discovering and blocking targeted attacks, and how deploying these technologies properly is a critical defense against targeted attacks. Each chapter introduces a technology, the types of attacks it defends against, and the products and services available that are suited to the task.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Right-Wing Resurgence: How a Domestic Terrorist Threat Is Being Ignored</italic></bold>. Daryl Johnson (former Terrorism Analyst, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, 2004–2010). Washington: Government Institutes (dist. by Rowman &amp; Littlefield), August 2012, 432 pp., $45 (also as e-book). In 2008, there were 149 militia groups in the United States. In 2009, that number more than tripled to 512, and now there are nearly 600. Accounts for the growth of right-wing extremism and militias in the United States and the ever-increasing threat they pose. Depicts events leading up to the leak of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Right-Wing Extremism report. Includes case studies and interviews with leaders, which reveal their agendas, how they recruit, and how they operate around the country. This threat is only beginning to be realized, and is still largely ignored in many circles.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Violent Image: Insurgent Propaganda and the New Revolutionaries</italic></bold>. Neville Bolt (Department of War Studies, King’s College, University of London). New York: Columbia University Press, May 2012, 256 pp., $23.99 (also as e-book). In a visual world, the pull of the violent image is more powerful and resonant than the draw of the carefully crafted word. Fast-moving, self-perpetuating images of violence have radically changed the nature of insurgency in modern times, and the global media trafficking these images have fundamentally transformed the act and speed of the exchange among populations. Rebels who hope to overthrow states or to establish transnational, ideological communities use dynamic technologies (from satellite TV and laptops to cell phones and social media) to advance their goals. Describes insurgents (from the Taliban to the architects of the Arab Spring) and their manipulation of violent imagery to build narratives and bring social change. Questions whether we are already in the grip of a new era of revolutionary politics as insurgents and populations drive images and ideas more rapidly than ever before.</p>
<p><bold><italic>New and Old Wars</italic></bold> (3rd ed.). Mary Kaldor (Professor of Global Governance, London School of Economics). Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, September 2012, 224 pp., $22.95 pb (not for sale in the Americas). Changes the way scholars and policy makers understand contemporary war and conflict, answers the critics of the new war argument, and shows how old war thinking in Afghanistan and Iraq greatly exacerbated what turned out to be archetypal new wars—characterized by identity politics, a criminalized war economy, and civilians as the main victims.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Why Peace Fails: The Causes and Prevention of Civil War Recurrence</italic></bold>. Charles T. Call (Assistant Professor of International Studies, American University). Washington: Georgetown University Press, April 2012, 328 pp., $32.95 pb (also as e-book). Some countries that show every sign of having successfully emerged from civil war fall once again into armed conflict. Examines the factors behind fifteen cases of civil war recurrence in Africa, Asia, the Caucasus, and Latin America. Widely touted explanations of civil wars—such as poverty, conflict over natural resources, and weak states—are far less important than political exclusion. Inclusion of former opponents in postwar governance plays a decisive role in sustained peace. International actors must remain fully engaged with postwar governments, ensuring that they make room for former enemies.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Security and Development in Global Politics: A Critical Comparison</italic></bold>. Edited by Joanna Spear (Director, Security Policy Studies Program, Associate Professor of International Affairs, George Washington University [GWU]) and Paul D. Williams (Associate Professor of International Affairs, GWU). Washington: Georgetown University Press, April 2012, 360 pp., $32.95 pb (also as e-book). The blending of security and development agendas seems admirable and designed to produce positive outcomes all around. However, security issues are getting priority over development concerns, which undermines security in the longer term. Illuminates not only the common points of interest but also the significant differences between the security and development agendas. With chapter pairings—each written by a development expert and a security analyst—explores seven core international issues: (1) aid, (2) humanitarian assistance, (3) governance, (4) health, (5) poverty, (6) trade and resources, and (7) demography.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Progress or Collapse: The Crises of Market Greed</italic></bold>. Roberto De Vogli (University College London). New York: Routledge, December 2012, 240 pp., $34.65. Global warming and the depletion of natural resources are widely recognized as major threats to the future of industrial society and survival of human species. However, this environmental destruction is paired with an often-overlooked deterioration of psychosocial well-being. In spite of the rapid material success of the past two centuries, mental disorders have become one of the leading causes of death and disability in industrial societies. Depression, anxiety, stress, and distrust are increasing. The power- and profit-driven nature of contemporary notions of progress cause five damaging behaviors which in turn contribute to both types of breakdown: (1) excessive consumerism, (2) mass conformity, (3) pervasive inequalities, (4) civic disengagement, and (5) eco-estrangement. We must redefine “progress” and overcome the inertia of our model of development by tailoring society around a new organizing principle.</p>

Derevensky (Professor of Psychiatry, McGill University; Codirector, International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors, McGill University). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, May 2012, 264 pp., $34 (also as e-book). While gambling addiction is recognized as a psychiatric disorder, there is a common misconception that adults are the only sufferers. Data from around the world point to high levels of gambling problems among adolescents, with rates of adolescent gambling problems being between two and four times those of adults. Large numbers of adolescents remain actively involved and engaged in almost all forms of regulated and unregulated gambling activities (games of personal skill, poker among friends, purchasing lottery tickets, sports wagering, casino gambling, or gambling over the Internet) in spite of age restrictions. Explores the causes and extent of youth gambling problems, consequences of enabling youth gambling, and strategies for prevention and treatment.</p>

The exodus is no longer conducted in a single file of people headed for some possible Promised Land, but a closed-circuit exodus within a cramped world where reduction in human stocks will suddenly loom like the only solution to the lockdown of history.
