<abstract>
<p>This article examines citizens who combine liberalism on one of two major issue dimensions with conservatism on the other, assessing whether they are less politically engaged than “consistent” liberals and conservatives and whether this relationship has strengthened over time with elite polarization. It also explores the contributions of cross-pressures, partisanship, and alienation to contemporary ideological differences in political engagement. This article departs from most existing research by defining ideology two dimensionally. Using the 1984-2008 American National Election Studies, it finds that culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans and to a lesser extent culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans are less engaged in elections than “consistent” liberals and conservatives. Different factors explain these differences with liberals and conservatives, but cross-pressures do not demobilize either “two-dimensional ideologue.” Over time, the increased involvement of liberals and conservatives has produced a growing ideological gap in political engagement.</p>

<p>The last couple of decades have revealed a growing ideological disconnect between the bulk of the American public and those activists and officials that make up the political “elite” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11416441">Fiorina, 2009</xref>). Many elite policy positions are now polarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11416441">Fiorina, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416441">Layman, Carsey, &amp; Horowitz, 2006</xref>), whereas citizens’ preferences remain centrist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11416441">Fiorina, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, across an increasing variety of issues, elite positions can be arrayed along a single dimension whose poles represent “liberal” and “conservative” views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X11416441">Layman, Carsey, Green, Herrera, &amp; Coopermann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11416441">McCarty, Poole, &amp; Rosenthal, 2006</xref>). Mass ideology is better characterized along two dimensions, one dealing with economic or social welfare issues and another concerning moral or cultural issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11416441">Carmines, Ensley, &amp; Wagner, n.d.-a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11416441">Feldman &amp; Johnston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11416441">Keeter &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11416441">Maddox &amp; Lilie, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11416441">Schofield, Miller, &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11416441">Shafer &amp; Claggett, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532673X11416441">Swedlow &amp; Wyckoff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11416441">Treier &amp; Hillygus, 2009</xref>). This article concerns this latter form of the mass-elite ideological disconnect. When citizens thinking in a multidimensional issue space must make political choices in a unidimensional space, how do those citizens cope?</p>
<p>This article focuses on political engagement. Some predict that extreme candidate choices and increasingly uncivil politics may disengage ordinary Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11416441">Fiorina, Abrams, &amp; Pope, 2005</xref>). Others find that growing percentages of Americans now express interest in the elections, recognize differences between the candidates, care about the outcome, and participate in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11416441">Abramowitz &amp; Saunders, 2008</xref>), even when they self-identify as moderates or do not place themselves on a liberal-conservative scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416441">Hetherington, 2008</xref>). The most politically knowledgeable and engaged citizens have shown over time increasing consistency (as defined by party elites) across issue attitudes and tighter linkages between their policy attitudes and party affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416441">Abramowitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11416441">Claassen &amp; Highton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11416441">Levendusky, 2009</xref>). Polarization on balance, then, does not turn off voters. However, existing research tells us little about the behavior of the diverse groups of Americans whose policy belief systems do not line up with elites’.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are those citizens who combine structured liberal views on one issue dimension with structured conservative views on the other. If these voters care about issues in each dimension, they face a particular keen dilemma under the current elite partisan and ideological alignment. Whether through cross-pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11416441">Berelson, Lazarsfeld, &amp; McPhee, 1954</xref>), alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11416441">Zipp, 1985</xref>), or just growing turned off to politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11416441">Fiorina et al., 2005</xref>), existing theory predicts disengagement as citizens’ mix of attitudes and alliances complicates their candidate choice. Existing breakdowns of engagement trends by self-reported ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416441">Hetherington, 2008</xref>), however, are largely descriptive, and it is unclear where one would find these two-dimensional ideologues on a single liberal-conservative scale. Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11416441">Treier and Hillygus (2009)</xref> conclude, self-placement on a one-dimensional liberal-conservative scale performs poorly as a measure of underlying policy attitude structure and can lead to mistaken predictions about relationships between ideology and political behavior.</p>
<p>In this article, I ask, first, are Americans with two-dimensional ideologies (elite Democratic liberalism on one set of issues and elite Republican conservatism on the other) less engaged in contemporary elections than Americans with one-dimensional ideologies? Second, has this relationship strengthened over time, as elite politics has increasingly polarized? Third, which factors best explain the relationship between ideology and political engagement? Using American National Election Studies (ANES) from 1984-2008, I analyze care about elections, voter turnout, and campaign activism and assess the contributions of cross-pressures, alienation, and partisanship to ideological patterns of political engagement. Although there is nothing new in most Americans’ failure to mirror elite belief systems, the recent polarization phenomenon arguably heightens its importance and makes study of its link to political engagement an important check on the health of American democracy.</p>
<p>I find that two-dimensional ideologues are, in some analyses, less engaged in elections than “consistent” liberals and conservatives. These involvement gaps have grown since the less polarized 1980s but reflect the growing involvement of liberals and conservatives more so than the withdrawal of two-dimensional ideologues. I also find substantial differences in political engagement among two-dimensional ideologues and in the factors that account for their engagement gaps with liberals and conservatives. Culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans are not consistently less engaged than liberals and conservatives. Differences that do exist are not explained by cross-pressures or alienation but by diminished enthusiasm for the parties and their candidates. The political involvement of culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans lags behind everyone else’s. The behavior of minorities of these citizens who are unaffiliated with a party or otherwise believe that neither Democrats nor Republicans represent their views drives much of this result, alongside a general disinterest in politics. These citizens show few signs of cross-pressures.</p>
<p>This article contributes in a few ways to existing knowledge about ideology and engagement. First, with more rigorous analysis than found in the existing literature, it weighs in on the debate about elite polarization’s connection to mass engagement. Second, its two-dimensional measure of ideology reveals relationships between ideology and engagement that a one-dimensional measure would likely obscure. Third, it sheds light on the mechanisms that link ideology to participation. It rejects the hypothesis that cross-pressures demobilize but suggests that citizens’ issue stances vis-à-vis the major parties are nonetheless associated with diminished enthusiasm and even, somewhat indirectly, alienation.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532673X11416441">
<title>Cross-Pressures, Alienation, and Partisanship</title>
<p>On balance, existing literature offers reason to expect that two-dimensional ideologues will be less politically engaged than one-dimensional ideologues, especially as elite polarization increases. In this section, I discuss three reasons for this expectation why: two-dimensional ideologues’ theoretically greater risk of cross-pressures, their weaker partisanship, and the greater likelihood that these citizens feel alienated due to inadequate representation. I further suggest that engagement differences could emerge among two-dimensional ideologues.</p>
<p>Citizens who pair liberal views on one issue dimension with conservative views on the other are potentially, but not necessarily, “cross-pressured.” Generally speaking, citizens experience “cross-pressures” when they are aware that some voting cues pull them toward Democrats, while other cues pull them toward Republicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416441">Hillygus &amp; Shields, 2008</xref>). As a result, a vote for either party’s candidate will be incongruent with some aspect of these citizens’ politics. This knowledge theoretically produces the psychological state of “cognitive dissonance.” Most people will act quickly to reduce dissonance and may avoid altogether those situations that cause it, especially as the degree of incongruity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11416441">Festinger, 1957</xref>).</p>
<p>Although withdrawal is not the only response to cognitive dissonance—other possible responses include denial and aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11416441">Festinger, 1957</xref>)—political scientists’ application of dissonance theory generally predicts cross-pressured citizens’ disengagement from politics. Indeed, individuals cross-pressured by aspects of their social identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11416441">Berelson et al., 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416441">Brader, Tucker, &amp; Therriault, 2009</xref>) or a politically diverse social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11416441">Mutz, 2002</xref>) are less likely to vote and show less engagement and participation along other measures as well. However, other studies find no relationship, or even positive relationships, between cross-pressures and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11416441">Nilson, 2002</xref>). Contemporary parties also aggressively court cross-pressured voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416441">Hillygus &amp; Shields, 2008</xref>), potentially offsetting any demobilizing effects. If cross-pressures have any impact on participation, this impact should be especially visible for two-dimensional ideologues during a period of elite polarization.</p>
<p>Two-dimensional ideologues’ weaker partisanship relative to one-dimensional ideologues’ may also weaken participation. As members of a “team,” party identifiers are more easily caught up than independents in the competitive aspects of elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11416441">Green, Palmquist, &amp; Schickler, 2002</xref>). Strong partisans’ higher voting rates are nothing new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X11416441">Verba, Schlozman, &amp; Brady, 1995</xref>), but partisans’ turnout has increased over time with polarization, whereas pure independents’ turnout has fallen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416441">Abramowitz, 2010</xref>). Party also provides a convenient institutional channel through which citizens can participate in campaigns. Since 1972, citizens with consistently liberal or conservative attitudes have strengthened their ties to the major parties, but citizens with liberal views on one issue dimension and conservative views on the other have weakened them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11416441">Carmines, Ensley, &amp; Wagner, n.d.-b</xref>). The same pattern holds for the number and balance of things that individuals like and dislike about the major parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11416441">Carmines et al., n.d.-a</xref>). Increasing inequality in political engagement between one- and two-dimensional ideologues should result.</p>
<p>A third way of understanding two-dimensional ideologues in the present era of elite polarization is as citizens whose views are not well represented by any of their candidate choices. They may indicate indifference about the winner—the candidates’ policy views are spatially equidistant from the citizen’s—or alienation. In the latter case, the citizen may prefer one candidate but nonetheless perceive distance between the candidate’s views and her own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11416441">Zipp, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11416441">Zipp (1985)</xref> found alienation and especially indifference to significantly decrease the probability of voting, findings others have confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11416441">Adams, Dow, &amp; Merrill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X11416441">Plane &amp; Gershtenson, 2004</xref>). Psychological measures of alienation have also been linked to voter turnout. Individuals who feel they lack political power, or who perceive an unresponsive political system, are less likely to vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11416441">Southwell, 2008</xref>). Beyond Election Day turnout, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11416441">Claassen (2007)</xref> finds that proximity to a candidate on a unidimensional ideological scale is associated with increased campaign activism.</p>
<p>These clusters of theory and literature suggest that two-dimensional ideologues should participate less than one-dimensional ideologues and that this linkage should strengthen over time. Facing increasingly polarized candidates, two-dimensional ideologues may disengage—because they may feel torn between candidates, unrepresented and alienated, or distanced from partisan mobilizing cues. However, these theories’ coexistence with the lack of evidence for any mass disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416441">Hetherington, 2008</xref>) introduces a puzzle with a few possible explanations. First, the actual prevalence of cross-pressures or alienation among two-dimensional ideologues may be low. To be meaningfully cross-pressured by issues, citizens must care about those issues and recognize party differences on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416441">Hillygus &amp; Shields, 2008</xref>). Affective identification with a political party is a potent force in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11416441">Green et al., 2002</xref>) which could blind citizens to policy disagreements with their party or overwhelm any alienating effects of disagreements that are recognized. Second, the theories could be wrong. Third, the theories may apply to some groups of citizens better than others, so that failure to disaggregate appropriately could obscure those relationships that exist. Among two-dimensional ideologues, there is reason to suspect participation could vary with citizens’ belief systems themselves.</p>
<p>This needs further explanation. Citizens’ issue attitudes may be related to political engagement when elite outreach privileges some issue stances over others. Spatial models of candidate strategy in a two-dimensional electorate convey incentives to enlarge majority coalitions by exploiting cross-cutting issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11416441">Schofield et al., 2003</xref>). Yet if both parties chase the same type of two-dimensional ideologue, as Republicans and Democrats were believed to do with fiscally conservative, culturally liberal Americans in the 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11416441">1</xref></sup>, citizens with opposing views on both issue dimensions (economically liberal, culturally conservative) could be further marginalized.</p>
<p>Similarly, two-dimensional ideologues may differ in their access to elite cue givers and institutional channels for campaign participation. The political engagement of culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans may benefit, for example, from the substantial numbers of pro-choice, economically conservative Republican convention delegates and the occasional presidential candidate representing the Libertarian Party or otherwise espousing a fiscally conservative, culturally liberal platform. Although welfare liberalism resides with the Democrats, Democratic pro-life delegates are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416441">Jackson, Bigelow, &amp; Green, 2007</xref>). Congress too has lost many pro-life Democrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X11416441">Adams, 1997</xref>), and recent presidential elections have arguably lacked a visible culturally conservative, pro-welfare candidate.</p>
<p>In all, these considerations suggest that this study’s expectations about the political engagement of two-dimensional ideologues may vary with these citizens’ belief systems. I turn next to testing these expectations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532673X11416441" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>This study’s data come from the 1984-2008 ANES. I use ANES because the surveys include multiple policy questions from each issue dimension, asked repeatedly over time. I reach back to the 1980s to compare contemporary political behavior with that of a time before the broad recognition of ideological polarization. I start with 1984 because of substantial differences in the policy questions included on prior surveys.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11416441">Carmines et al. (n.d.-a)</xref>, I measure respondents’ belief systems by creating two principal components factor scores, one representing a social welfare dimension and the other a cultural issues dimension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11416441">2</xref></sup> With these factors standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, scores less than −0.5 are considered liberal, and scores greater than 0.5 are considered conservative. A six-category typology results, although I ultimately limit my sample to individuals in the first four categories to facilitate this study’s comparisons of interest.</p>
<p>Citizens that I call “liberals” are liberal on both the social welfare and cultural issues dimensions; “conservatives” are conservative on both. By this definition, over the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential elections, between one quarter and one third of Americans are liberals (15.7%) or conservatives (12.8%). About half as many hold culturally liberal, economically conservative (8.5%) or culturally conservative, economically liberal (6.2%) views. A plurality of Americans, 44%, holds liberal or conservative views on one issue dimension and moderate views (a factor score between −0.5 and 0.5) on the other. Twelve and a half percent are moderate on both dimensions.</p>
<p>This distribution in earlier decades is not substantially different. The public over the 1984 and 1988 elections contained fewer liberals (13.0%) and conservatives (10.5%), more moderates (14.4%), and more culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens (10.9%). Liberal and conservative shares peaked in the 1990s at 17.1% and 15.3%.</p>
<p>To improve sample size for subgroup analysis, I pooled data across decades when creating my ideology variable. For each decade, I identified questions that (a) concerned policy issue topics related to personal or societal morality or the redistribution of wealth to the economically vulnerable and (b) were asked in every election year that decade. My factor scores use nearly all of these questions (specified in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1532673X11416441">appendix</xref>), discards only reflect efforts to make the 1980s and 1990s measures as consistent as possible with the 2000s measure.</p>
<p>I used only cases with complete data on every policy question, reflecting my hesitance to impute policy attitudes to individuals in a study where attitude “consistency” is central. A consequence is reduced sample sizes in individual election years, which I address by pooling across decades. A second tradeoff involves potential threats to the representativeness of my sample. Analysis of missing value patterns, however, indicates that the single most important reason for exclusion was that ANES had randomly selected a respondent to be part of a split-sample experiment with alternative questions; the proportion of respondents who were excluded because they did not have an opinion or refused to answer a question was much smaller. Limiting my sample to individuals with “liberal” or “conservative” views on both issue dimensions results in sample sizes of 507, 836, and 673 for the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively (2,016 altogether).</p>
<p>I model three indicators of political engagement: whether a respondent reported caring “a good deal” versus “not very much” about who won the presidential election, self-reported voter turnout, and whether a respondent engaged in two or more of the following five campaign activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11416441">Abramowitz &amp; Saunders, 2008</xref>). These activities were attending a political rally, meeting, or event; working on a campaign; displaying a campaign button, sticker, or sign; attempting to influence another person’s vote; and donating money to a party, candidate, or political action committee.</p>
<p>Logit models control for education, income, sex, race (Black and Latino dummies), age, marital status, union membership, church attendance, length of community residence, residence in a southern state, perception that the race will be close, and year or decade dummies. Another set of controls included in some models taps political motivation: strength of partisanship (dummies for strong partisan identifiers and weak partisan identifiers), receipt of contact from a political party, interviewer-assessed political knowledge, campaign interest, reported care about who wins the election (in the turnout and activism models only), political efficacy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11416441">3</xref></sup> and degree of preference for one party’s presidential nominee over the other’s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11416441">4</xref></sup> I present the underspecified model because a theoretical causal path from ideology to participation may run through the second set of variables. If so, a finding that two-dimensional ideologues’ weaker motivation explains away differences in participation may still suggest an <italic>indirect</italic> relationship between ideology and participation, as weaker motivation may itself result from recognition that one does not fit with the parties ideologically.</p>
<p>A second set of models, estimated with the 2000-2008 cross-sections, attempts to identify the political factors that best account for contemporary ideological differences in engagement. They focus especially on the roles of cross-pressures, alienation, and partisanship.</p>
<p>The measure of cross-pressures I employ is similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416441">Hillygus and Shields (2008)</xref>, whose cross-pressured voters disagree with their party on an issue they care about. Given how my sample is defined, I measure disagreement with a party and issue salience in terms of an entire issue dimension rather than a single policy issue. An issue dimension is salient if a respondent invoked an attitude from that dimension in responses to open-ended questions about what he or she liked and disliked about the major parties and their nominees and what he or she considered personally to be the most important problem or issue in the election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11416441">5</xref></sup> As ANES does not ask respondents about perceived candidate and party positions on every issue in the survey, I measured perceptions of party differences on the issues with one question from each dimension: abortion legality and government’s role in guaranteeing jobs and living standards. I treated individuals as aware of party differences if they placed the Democratic candidate to the left of the Republican candidate. In all, “cross-pressured” citizens comprise the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1532673X11416441" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Culturally conservative (culturally liberal) Democrats (Republicans) who find cultural issues salient and recognize party differences on abortion;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Economically conservative (economically liberal) Democrats (Republicans) who find welfare issues salient and recognize party differences on jobs;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Independents who pair liberalism on one dimension with conservatism on the other, find both types of issues salient, and recognize party differences on both abortion and jobs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some models involving this cross-pressure measure also employ a second dummy variable that I use to mark “knowingly congruent” individuals. “Knowingly congruent” citizens fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<list id="list2-1532673X11416441" list-type="bullet">

<p>Inclusion of this measure allows differentiation of two types of non-cross-pressured citizens: those who are not cross-pressured because they are aware that their views on issue dimensions they care about are aligned with a major party and those who are not cross-pressured because they do not care about issues and/or do not recognize actual party differences on the issues. Failure to differentiate these citizens could otherwise hide relationships between cross-pressures and participation because the former group should be highly motivated to participate while the latter group may not be.</p>
<p>As alienation is a multidimensional concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11416441">Finifter, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11416441">Southwell, 2008</xref>), I tap it with multiple measures. One important component is political powerlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11416441">Finifter, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11416441">Southwell, 2008</xref>), which is already captured by my Internal Political Efficacy Index. A second is detachment from partisan politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11416441">Schwartz, 1973</xref>). I operationalize this first with a dummy variable marking individuals who, when asked, would not or could not volunteer anything they liked about either political party’s presidential nominee. An alternative measure, available for 2004 and 2008 only, indicates an affirmative response to the following question: “Would you say that any of the parties in the United States represents your views reasonably well?” This question also reflects a third, related understanding of alienation as a sense of being unrepresented and dissatisfied with one’s candidate options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11416441">Zipp, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>I begin the next section by comparing my ideological groups demographically and politically over 2000-2008. Next, I estimate logit models of participation for 1984-2008. I then return to the 2000-2008 period for a series of models that explore cross-pressures, partisanship, alienation, and other potential factors in the ideology–engagement relationship.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Liberals and conservatives show stronger political preferences than two-dimensional ideologues. In all, over two thirds of liberals and conservatives identify with a party, often strongly, and more than 90% choose the ideologically “correct” party. Almost two thirds of culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans identify with a party and 80% of those are Democrats. Culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans are by far the least partisan, though of the 48% that identify with a party, about 80% are Republicans. Respondents in each group, on average, have a clear candidate preference, but one-dimensional ideologues hold more polarized views of the candidates.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noticeable pattern to political engagement, visible across nearly every indicator in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11416441">Table 1</xref>, involves culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans’ weak attachment to electoral politics. The behavior of this group’s Whites appears to drive this, as (not shown) their election care, voting, and campaign activism rates substantially trail Blacks’.</p>
<p>Most two-dimensional ideologues are not cross-pressured, though substantial differences exist between groups. Twenty-nine percent of culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans experience cross-pressures. Seven percent of culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens do, and this group includes hardly any Blacks. Within groups, cross-pressures are unrelated to party identification.</p>
<p>The low prevalence of cross-pressures among culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans results chiefly from widespread misperception of Democratic candidates’ abortion positions and low levels of cultural issue salience. Only about 30% of this group placed the Democrat to the left of the Republican on abortion, compared with large majorities of the other three groups. Twenty-three percent of culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans found cultural issues salient, whereas this figure ranged from 37% to 53% across the other groups. Culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens are more likely than any other group to find both welfare and cultural issues salient; still, both are salient to just 35% of this group, making partisan conflict easier to resolve.</p>
<p>Culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens exhibit strikingly low political efficacy. They are also the most likely to find nothing to like about both parties’ presidential nominees. The vast majority feel represented by a party, however. Most culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens also feel represented, though 42% believe they are not.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11416441">Figure 1</xref> summarizes how care about elections, voter turnout and campaign activism vary over time and by ideology. Even in the arguably less polarized 1984 and 1988 elections, liberals and conservatives showed the greatest care about election outcomes and posted the highest turnout and activism rates. Their differences with culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens on these measures, however, are substantively minor. The relatively lower engagement of culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans is also evident in the 1980s, though less pronounced than it would later become. The proportion caring about the election outcome increases for all groups over time, but at different paces. Voter turnout is roughly stable. The proportion of liberals and conservatives engaging in two or more campaign activities increases greatly between the 1980s and the 2000s. Two-dimensional ideologues change little on this measure.</p>

<p>The first three models in the table predict the likelihood of caring about the election, voting, and participating in two or more campaign activities as functions of ideology, demographics, election year, and the perceived closeness of the race. Results are quite similar for each dependent variable. In the 1980s, the only significant engagement differences by ideology are the lower likelihood of voting and campaign activism by culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens relative to liberals. The likelihood of caring about the election and voting increases significantly among liberals and conservatives in the 1990s, and election care among culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens increases significantly as well. Conservatives further post a marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) increase in campaign activism over the 1990s. As a result of these changes, culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens are significantly less likely than everyone else in the 1990s to care about who wins the election, and both types of two-dimensional ideologues are significantly less likely than liberals and conservatives to vote and engage in campaign activism (but <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 for liberals vs. culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens on campaign activism).</p>
<p>In the 2000s, election care increases significantly for liberals and conservatives over 1990s levels. Their campaign activism increases are statistically significant versus 1980s rates. Between the 1990s and the 2000s, culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens also increase their likelihood of caring about the election (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), while culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans increase their voting (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and campaign activism (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). A snapshot of the 2000s shows both types of two-dimensional ideologues as significantly less likely than conservatives (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and marginally less likely than liberals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) to care about the election. Both are also significantly less likely than liberals and conservatives to practice campaign activism. Furthermore, culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens vote at lower rates than everyone else (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Adding motivational controls that may themselves result from a two-dimensional ideology alters this story somewhat (Care Model 2, Turnout Model 2, and Activism Model 2). These controls wipe out all statistically significant engagement differences by ideology in the 1980s. For election care, the significance levels on some overtime increases fall to .10 and liberals’ increase between the 1990s and 2000s is not statistically significant. The only ideological difference in election care by the 2000s is the marginally greater care of conservatives relative to culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). For turnout, 1990s and 2000s within-decade differences remain largely intact. Of within-group turnout changes, only liberals’ 1990s increase retains (marginal) significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). The model also estimates a significant turnout decrease for liberals between the 1990s and 2000s. Campaign activism increases for liberals and conservatives fall to the .10 significance level, as do two-dimensional ideologues’ campaign activism differences with conservatives in the 2000s. 1990s activism deficits for culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans lose significance entirely. These changes suggest that much of liberals’ and conservatives’ participation increases are associated with these groups’ strengthening partisanship and political engagement.</p>
<p>In sum, a few key observations emerge from this analysis. First, the campaign involvement of one- and two-dimensional ideologues has diverged. To a lesser extent, so has the likelihood of caring about the election. Second, a voter turnout gap between culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens and everyone else has widened. Third, these changes are more clearly associated with the increased political enthusiasm of liberals and conservatives than with the withdrawal of two-dimensional ideologues.</p>
<p>Turning back to the 2000-2008 ANES, I next attempt to discern the contributions of cross-pressures, alienation, partisan attachment, and other measures to these ideological gaps in engagement. With the 2000-2008 data, I first estimated <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11416441">Table 2</xref>’s Care Model 1, Turnout Model 1, and Activism Model 1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11416441">7</xref></sup> Then, to each “base model,” I added variables as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532673X11416441">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1532673X11416441">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1532673X11416441">4</xref>. I pursued this strategy so to better observe how each variable or set of variables alters relationships between ideology and political engagement. Figures depict the change in the predicted probability of caring about the election, voting, and participating in two or more campaign activities when one is a conservative or either type of two-dimensional ideologue, rather than a liberal. These discrete changes were estimated with control variables set at their means.</p>

<p>Cross-pressured Americans are no more or less likely than the rest of my sample to care about elections, vote, and participate in campaigns. Added to each of the three base models, the coefficient is always positive, never approaches significance, and fails to alter relationships between ideology and engagement. Refining the comparison group does not change this much. Compared with voters whose lack of cross-pressure is due to nonsalient issues or poor political knowledge, the cross-pressure coefficient remains positive but never significant. Cross-pressured voters are less engaged than voters who are similarly invested in and knowledgeable about cultural and welfare issues but congruent with a single party, but this is statistically significant only in the election care model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The engagement of knowingly congruent voters significantly exceeds (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) the base group’s on all three measures. Identifying these citizens does reduce ideological gaps in participation, especially for culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans. Their insignificant differences with liberals in election care and with conservatives in voting and election care shrink to nearly zero. It also substantially reduces their campaign activism gaps with liberals and conservatives; the difference with liberals is now marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Voter turnout and election care gaps between culturally conservative, economically liberal individuals and liberals are also smaller and—though still visible—no longer statistically significant.</p>
<p>Indicators of partisan attachment similarly reduce engagement gaps. Strong and weak partisan identifiers are significantly more likely than independents (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to care about the election winner, and strong partisans vote and contribute to campaigns at significantly higher rates (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Strength of candidate preference and receipt of contacts from a party are significant positive predictors of all three dependent variables (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>With controls for strength of partisanship, the insignificant election care gap between culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens and liberals disappears, and a marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) voter turnout gap emerges between them, favoring the former. These controls eliminate almost entirely culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans’ insignificant voter turnout gap with conservatives and greatly reduce their election care gap with them, so that it is now only marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Controlling for degree of candidate preference instead has similar and perhaps larger effects. Election care differences are no longer significant. It also visibly cuts into campaign activism gaps with liberals and especially conservatives.</p>
<p>Strength of partisanship controls dent culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens’ voting and election care gaps with liberals and conservatives. Controlling for degree of candidate preference instead reduces the significance of voter turnout and election care gaps with liberals to the .10 level. A predicted campaign activism gap with conservatives narrows by a few percentage points, but remains substantial.</p>
<p>The three alienation measures contribute little to ideological differences in participation. Though political efficacy is a highly significant predictor of voting (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), controlling for this measure still leaves substantial, significant voter turnout gaps between culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans and everyone else. The difference with liberals falls, however, to the .10 level. Americans who find nothing to like about either major party candidate are less engaged along all three measures, and these coefficients are significant at the .01 level. Only in the election care model, however, does this visibly reduce culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans’ engagement deficit, in this case, with liberals (now <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Not shown in the figure, models that control for a citizen’s perception that a major party represents his views barely nudge the ideological differences in engagement found in base model estimates on the 2004-2008 data. The perception of representation, however, is associated with highly significant increases in election care, voter turnout, and campaign activism.</p>
<p>Holding constant psychological engagement in politics (campaign interest, political knowledge, and, for turnout and activism, care about who wins the election) most effectively accounts for the weaker participation of culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans. Estimated election care gaps with liberals and conservatives fall to a fraction of their previous sizes, as does these citizens’ voting deficit versus liberals. Election care and turnout differences with liberals are no longer statistically significant. Turnout differences with conservatives and culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens remain statistically significant, but narrower. These controls also erode culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens’ still-significant campaign activism gaps with liberals and conservatives.</p>
<p>Last, for two theoretically central measures, I assess whether relationships between key predictors and political engagement could vary by ideology. Such analysis may help explain the minimal importance of alienation to ideological differences as well as the counterintuitive relationship between partisanship and engagement among two-dimensional ideologues. I first estimate a logit model of each dependent variable with the party representation measure as the key covariate. Seven dummy variables mark represented and unrepresented citizens in each ideological category. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1532673X11416441">Figure 5</xref> charts changes in each dependent variable’s predicted probability associated with each category relative to represented liberals.</p>

<p>Americans who perceive themselves unrepresented are significantly less likely to say they care who wins the election and significantly less likely to vote—unless they hold culturally liberal, economically conservative views. Unrepresented citizens in this group, in fact, vote at very high rates that significantly exceed those of unrepresented liberals. Meanwhile, among culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens, gaping election care and turnout gaps open based on perceived representation. Those who feel unrepresented are significantly less likely to vote than each of the other seven groups, though their difference with unrepresented liberals is significant only at the .10 level.</p>
<p>A marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) difference in campaign activism divides culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens; the represented are more likely to participate. For culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens, the campaign activism difference associated with representation is substantial in magnitude but not statistically significant. Represented conservatives and liberals are significantly more likely than everyone to practice two or more campaign activities. The higher participation of unrepresented liberals is also marginally significant relative to all two-dimensional ideologues, save for represented culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens.</p>
<p>Readers should interpret these findings cautiously, given the loss of a year of data (<italic>N</italic> = 491) and the small number of cases in some categories. As they are, however, findings suggest that the alienation from party politics perceived by some culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans may be an important factor in this group’s low political engagement. Meanwhile, this same perceived lack of fit with the two-party system, which afflicts a much larger proportion of culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens, is not generally associated with political withdrawal outside of campaign activism.</p>
<p>I performed similar analysis with party identification, generating seven dummies that split each ideological category into party identifiers and independents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11416441">8</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1532673X11416441">Figure 6</xref> displays results, presented as differences in the predicted probability of each dependent variable relative to liberal party identifiers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X11416441">9</xref></sup> The relationship between party identification and engagement is weakest among culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans; party affiliation makes no difference to care about elections and a small, marginally significant difference to voting (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Its role in campaign activism is more substantial (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Among partisans only, culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens’ campaign activism gaps with liberals and conservatives fall to insignificance and marginal significance, respectively, but remain notably sized. Culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens care as much about elections as independent liberals and conservatives. The likelihood of voting among culturally liberal, economically conservative partisans exceeds independent liberals’ (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>

<p>Affiliation with a party matters most for culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans. Their increased campaign activism, although not statistically significant, is visible. More strikingly, the model estimates statistically significant deficits in voter turnout and care about elections that amount to 27 and 39 percentage points when all independent variables are set at their means. Coefficient estimates for these culturally conservative, economically liberal independents are significantly lower than every other group’s (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Meanwhile, culturally conservative, economically liberal partisans care about the election at least as much as everyone else and are significantly more likely to do so than even independent liberals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). They are no less likely to vote than anyone, save conservative partisans (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has examined whether ideological alignment with a major party is associated with political engagement and whether this relationship has strengthened over time. Though I find evidence for both of these notions, the strength and even the direction of these relationships varies at times with the combination of issue attitudes that a citizen holds. Citizens who align with one of the major parties by holding consistently liberal or consistently conservative views on welfare and cultural issues are significantly more likely to participate in campaigns than those who pair consistently liberal views on one issue dimension with consistently conservative views on the other. They are also more likely to care about who wins the election, though differences here are smaller. The voter turnout of culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens lags behind every other group’s, whereas culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens are at least as likely if not more likely than liberals to vote.</p>
<p>An enthusiasm gap perhaps best explains the engagement differences that do exist between culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens and one-dimensional ideologues. Close to one third of culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens experience cross-pressures and nearly half affirm that a major party does not represent their views—yet these situations, with only one exception, are not directly associated with these citizens’ engagement. Culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans’ engagement might increase modestly if more identified with a political party. More importantly, though, these citizens fall short of liberals and conservatives in the strength of the party ties they do have, their degree of preference for their candidate, and in the likelihood that they perceive themselves aligned with one party on the issues they care about. Despite this, these citizens follow politics, show up at the polls, and feel no less efficacious than liberals and conservatives. They look like the “persuadable voters” identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416441">Hillygus and Shields (2008)</xref> as the frequent and fruitful targets of contemporary campaign appeals. Were culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans to encounter a major party candidate that aligned with them on the issues, they might embrace that candidate with something closer to liberals’ and conservatives’ passion and involve themselves more in election campaigns.</p>
<p>Culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans are less politically engaged than others and depend more on parties as gateways to political involvement. Cross-pressures do not drive this phenomenon. Only a handful of these citizens are cross-pressured, but that handful is more politically active than other culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans. Instead, the phenomenon seems to reflect a disinterest in, or alienation from, partisan politics that does not involve much contemporary issue content. It translates more dramatically, though, than it does for other groups into political withdrawal. Some of these citizens may be formerly cross-pressured Democrats who were turned off years ago by their party’s cultural left turn. Without longitudinal data, this is impossible to test. The coincidence of independence and disengagement among these citizens fits well with accounts of polarization and sorting, in which the most politically informed, involved, and partisan members of public have gradually brought their views into line with either party’s elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11416441">Claassen &amp; Highton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11416441">Levendusky, 2009</xref>), and this closer alignment fuels further increases in political information, involvement, and partisanship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416441">Abramowitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11416441">Levendusky, 2009</xref>). Many culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens may have simply missed this boat.</p>
<p>This does not mean issues are irrelevant. It remains unclear why a culturally conservative, economically liberal platform should predict detachment while its reverse would not. Issue-based differences in elite outreach and access, as suggested earlier, may matter. If engagement drives ideology or something else drives them both, we need a clearer theory of policy attitude formation. The lower turnout of liberals relative to conservatives suggests a focus on welfare liberalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps personality and other circumstances moderate behavioral responses to a perceived lack of political fit, in ways that map onto ideology. According to Schwartz’s theory of political alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11416441">1973</xref>), one of several active or passive “behavioral orientations” toward politics moderates the translation of alienation into political behavior. Factors predicting adoption of a passive or active orientation include socioeconomic status, personal political efficacy, energy, and comfort with one’s own anger, with lower levels of each promoting a passive orientation. Schwartz only partially supports this last assertion in a study of college students,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X11416441">10</xref></sup> but the theory is roughly consistent with the divergent behavior of culturally conservative, economically liberal and culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans.</p>
<p>Whether the state of affairs this article portrays is a problem for American democracy comes down to perspective. Citizens with structured but two-dimensional ideologies have not demobilized, but the increased involvement of liberals and conservatives has yielded growing <italic>inequality</italic> in engagement. This is unlikely to change soon as increasingly polarized activists encourage increasingly polarized candidates and vice versa. Party polarization also means more to lose with a third-party vote, diminishing this route to mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416441">Abramowitz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens’ weaker political interest and knowledge make them a challenge to reach, while their low voter turnout diminishes party incentives to do so. Recent growth in their care about elections, however, may signal their receptivity to appeals. Initially, they may seem ripe for Republican mobilization—but their independents and Democrats, Whites and Blacks alike care little about cultural issues. Perhaps they could be convinced to care. However, to Republicans, for now, most culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans are not “persuadable voters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416441">Hillygus &amp; Shields, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, the Whites in this constituency might welcome a reintroduction to Democrats. A Clinton-era rightward tack on welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X11416441">Williams, 2003</xref>) seems unnecessary; these citizens by definition are liberal on this issue. This reintroduction, however, might touch on more than issues as these citizens believe they share more views with Democrats than they actually do. Rather than the stress of choosing between a consistently conservative Republican and a consistently liberal Democrat, their growing participation deficit may reflect a desire to avoid the political fray. Perhaps this is out of habit. However, perhaps some feel neither wanted or represented nor likely to make a difference.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<p>The following questions were used to define ideologies. Unless otherwise specified, the question was used in all three decades.</p>
<sec id="section5-1532673X11416441">
<title>Cultural Issue Questions</title>
<p>Do you <italic>favor</italic> or <italic>oppose</italic> laws to protect homosexuals against job discrimination? Do you [favor/oppose] such laws <italic>strongly</italic> or <italic>not strongly</italic>? (90s and 00s)</p>
<p>Do you think homosexuals should be allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces or don’t you think so? Do you feel <italic>strongly</italic> or <italic>not strongly</italic> that homosexuals [should be allowed/should not be allowed] to serve? (90s and 00s)</p>
<p>Do you think gay or lesbian couples, in other words, homosexual couples, should be legally permitted to adopt children? (00s only)</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of talk about women’s rights. Some people feel that women should have an equal role with men in running business, industry, and government. (Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.) Others feel that a woman’s place is in the home. (Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.) And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place <italic>yourself</italic> on this scale, or haven’t you thought much about this?</p>
<p>There has been some discussion about abortion during recent years. Which one of the opinions on this page best agrees with your view? You can just tell me the number of the opinion you choose.</p>
<list id="list3-1532673X11416441" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>By law, abortion should never be permitted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The law should permit abortion only in case of rape, incest, or when the woman’s life is in danger.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The law should permit abortion for reasons other than rape, incest, or danger to the woman’s life, but only after the need for the abortion has been clearly established.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>By law, a woman should always be able to obtain an abortion as a matter of personal choice.Which of the following views comes closest to your opinion on the issue of school prayer?</p></list-item>
</list>
<list id="list4-1532673X11416441" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>By law, prayer should not be allowed in public schools.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The law should allow public schools to schedule time when children can pray silently if they want to.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The law should allow public schools to schedule time when children as a group can say a general prayer not tied to a particular religious faith.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>By law, public schools should schedule a time when all children would say a chosen Christian prayer. (1988)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some people think it is all right for the public schools to start each day with a prayer. Others feel that religion does not belong in the public schools but should be taken care of by the family and the church. Have you been interested enough in this to favor one side over the other? (IF YES) Which do you think–schools should be allowed to start each day with a prayer or religion does not belong in the schools? (1984) 1984 and 1988 responses were recoded by the author for maximum comparability.</p>

<title>Social Welfare Questions</title>
<p>Some people feel the government in Washington should see to it that every person has a job and a good standard of living. Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1. Others think the government should just let each person get ahead on their own. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place <italic>yourself</italic> on this scale, or haven’t you thought much about this?</p>
<p>Some people think the government should provide fewer services even in areas such as health and education to reduce spending. Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1. Other people feel it is important for the government to provide many more services even if it means an increase in spending. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place <italic>yourself</italic> on this scale, or haven’t you thought much about this?</p>
<p>There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital costs. Some people feel there should be a government insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital expenses for everyone. Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1. Others feel that all medical expenses should be paid by individuals through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or other company-paid plans. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place <italic>yourself</italic> on this scale, or haven’t you thought much about this?</p>
<p>Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every effort to improve the social and economic position of Blacks. (Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.) Others feel that the government should not make any special effort to help Blacks because they should help themselves. (Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.) And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place <italic>yourself</italic> on this scale, or haven’t you thought much about this?</p>
<p>Next I am going to read you a list of federal programs. For each one, I would like you to tell me whether you would like to see spending <italic>increased</italic> or <italic>decreased</italic>. . . . (What about) . . . S<italic>ocial Security</italic>? (Should federal spending on <italic>Social Security</italic> be <italic>increased</italic>, <italic>decreased</italic>, or kept <italic>about the same</italic>?) . . . <italic>welfare programs</italic>? (90s and 00s) . . . <italic>child care</italic>? (00s only) . . . <italic>aid to the poor</italic>? (90s and 00s) . . . <italic>Food Stamps</italic>? (80s only).</p>

<p>Interaction effects in logit models cannot be interpreted like interaction effects in ordinary least squares regression, or sign, size, and significance can vary across observations. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11416441">Norton, Wang, and Ai’s (2004)</xref> inteff routine for STATA, I computed corrected mean interaction effects for each Ideology × Year interaction in each model. Results were remarkably similar to, and in some respects sharper than, those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11416441">Table 2</xref>.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1532673X11416441">
<label>7.</label>
<p>Relatively minor differences in significance levels result from the removal of the pre-2000 data from the analysis. Among other things, these changes may result from the decreased sample size and the removal of the constraint that control variable coefficients be equal over 1984-2008, rather than 2000-2008.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-1532673X11416441">
<label>8.</label>
<p>Cutting categories instead by whether citizens identify with the “correct” party and assigning culturally conservative, economically liberal citizens to the Democrats and culturally liberal, economically conservative citizens to Republicans make little difference to results.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-1532673X11416441">
<label>9.</label>
<p>All control variables were again set at their means; the ideological dummies were set at zero.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1532673X11416441">
<label>10.</label>
<p>Plausibly, such a sample may lack the variation in socioeconomic status and efficacy seen in the wider population.</p>
