When I walked out of my house, I found that the sun was still in the sky, and the republic had not imploded. Yes, Barack Obama had been elected to another term as President of the United States, making some people elated and others deflated. (Or perhaps considering harming themselves or moving to another country.) No one predicted mass suicides, or that the sun would go away, but plenty of people predicted, in one way or another, that the results of this particular presidential election would end life as we know it in the United States.</p><p>It was an election cycle filled with more vitriol than I can remember in my adult life, and unfortunately, that continued even after the results were in. Nowhere was that more evident than on the <italic>social</italic> networking site Facebook. Look, the Supreme Court has ruled that you have the right in this country to say whatever you want, as long as you don’t incite violence or yell “fire” in a crowded theater. But the rest of us also have the right to turn you off, to “de-friend” you (as I did with several people on both sides of the aisle once they had reached an intolerable level of annoyance) and to talk about other things for a change. I have some friends who dropped off of Facebook entirely because they just couldn’t stand all the political rants. Sure, elections are important, but if in every post you accuse the other guy of being an idiot, a modern-day Hitler, or the devil himself, what does that add to civil discussion of the issues? Ah, but some people aren’t interested in civil discourse, and therein lies the rub.</p><p>So I choose to ignore anyone who is perpetually red in the face, with spittle running down his or her chin, convinced that the end is near because of who’s in the White House. We can disagree, even vigorously, without being disagreeable. Still, I’m willing to give a pass even to those who think “no one in his right mind could vote for candidate X,” with one exception. If you practice journalism, or teach the practice of journalism, you owe it to the profession and to the students you teach to keep your opinions to yourself.</p><p>No one forced you to become a journalist or into teaching the craft; it’s something you chose. Along with that comes the requirement that you not “like” a certain political figure on Facebook (unless you “like” the opponent too in an effort to be well versed in what each of them believes), that you not put bumper stickers on your car or signs in your yard, and that you not forward any and every post that paints the candidate for the opposing party in the most demeaning possible terms, often with no factual basis to support the outlandish claims made. Would you include such information in a news article or report you were responsible for?</p><p>Having suffered disappointment at the hands of both Republicans and Democrats, it was easy several years ago to switch my voter registration to Independent. It’s something that every journalist, journalism teacher, and journalism student should consider. Even that little “r” or little “d” next to your name says something about what your political beliefs are, and that’s the first thing someone in the camp in question will look for if you write or say something that they interpret as negative.</p><p>Of course, the notion of a perfectly unbiased journalist is a myth. We all come to the table with certain mind-sets and ways of thinking about things. But we’re supposed to at least <italic>try</italic> to see the other side of the argument. Yes, the sun is still in the sky, but the republic might very well implode if those of us who call ourselves journalists or who are involved in training the next generation of “sense-makers” carry on like lunatics. You gave up that right when you took on the journalistic banner. Now that this election is in the books, how about we rethink our role in a democracy?</p><p>So, am I elated or deflated? I hope you’re still wondering in 2016.</p></body></article>
