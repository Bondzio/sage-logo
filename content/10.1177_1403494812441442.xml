<p>Each year, the journal receives nearly 500 articles to be considered for publication. There are several steps towards publication.</p>
<sec id="section1-1403494812441442">
<title>Editorial selection of reviewers</title>
<p>We have a large database of reviewers. We typically initiate the process by inviting two or three persons to review. Stepwise, we make sure that at least two reviewers have agreed to the invitation. When we get negative responses, new persons have to be approached. The worst case was an approach to a total of 25 persons. All this takes time. Many reviewers decline to review – they feel that the burden of just another review is too heavy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812441442">
<title>Waiting for a response from reviewers</title>
<p>We usually ask the reviewer to submit the review within 3 weeks. Our best reviewers present their review to the journal within a few days. Our worst reviewers agree in the first place, but never submit a review in spite of several emails reminding them of their promise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494812441442">
<title>First editorial decision</title>
<p>Having received at least two reviews, the Chief Editor makes a decision. Very few articles are accepted without revision – most articles with a potential for publication are returned to the author(s) for a response on critical issues presented in the reviewer comments. This often takes time. In a number of situations where only minor corrections are needed, I typically write in the decision letter to the author(s) that no more reviews will be required.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812441442">
<title>Re-review after revision</title>
<p>The revised manuscript is sent for review to the same reviewers who commented on the previous version. Sometimes a reviewer has declared no interest in reviewing a revised version. Then we have to find another reviewer. It takes time and sometimes the new reviewer adds further scientific critique. As Chief Editor, I then decide if the article should once more be sent back to the author for revision. Sometimes, I receive directly contradictory review conclusions: one says accept without modification; the other says reject. Then I typically ask a co-editor for an opinion before I finally conclude. Such a process of course takes much time.</p>
<p>At the journal, we are very sorry for the slow review process, but the economy of the journal does not allow for a large academic staff to handle manuscripts.</p>
