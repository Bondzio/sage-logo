<abstract>
<p>This article examines a selection of the North American scholarly research that calls for “moving beyond” a “Black/White binary paradigm.” Some scholars suggest this paradigm limits or obscures a complex understanding of the historical record on race, racism, and racialization for Asian, Latina/o, Mexican, and Native Americans. On the face of it, the notion of a Black/White binary paradigm and the call to move beyond appears persuasive. The discourse of a Black/White binary paradigm, however, confuses, misnames, and simplifies the historical and contemporary experiences structured within what is, in fact, the racially incorporative matrix of a black/white Manicheanism. We assert this call sets up blackness and, by extension, people socially defined as “black” as impediments to multiracial coalition building. As a result, “moving beyond” is epistemologically faulty and politically harmful for African-descended people because it is based on “bad faith” toward blackness.</p>

<p>The past 20 years has seen a steady growth in the scholarly critique of what has been called the “Black/White binary paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea, 1997</xref>, p. 1219). Such works include <italic>Beyond Black/White: The Racisms of our Time</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021934712471533">Martinez, 1993</xref>); <italic>The Black/White Binary Paradigm of Race: The “Normal Science” of American Racial Thought</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea, 1997</xref>); <italic>Beyond Black and White: Race, Ethnicity, and Gender in the U.S. South and Southwest</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934712471533">Cole &amp; Parker, 2004</xref>); and <italic>Latinos, Asian Americans, and the Black-White Binary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934712471533">Alcoff, 2006</xref>). This critique, which is now the focal point of an ostensibly new way of framing race politics, in the United States particularly, revolves around the viewpoint that to comprehend the complexity of race in North America, scholars must “move beyond” the Black/White binary paradigm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021934712471533">1</xref></sup> It is argued that this paradigm has “etched racial dichotomies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934712471533">Hewit, 2004</xref>, p. xi) that exclusively focus on people socially defined as black and white. Consequently, the historical record on processes of race, racism, and racialization is limited or obscured. As a result, moving beyond advocates argue that alternatives to the Black/White binary paradigm are needed to capture the complexity of racism. But what do scholars mean when they speak of this Black/White binary paradigm? What does “moving beyond” mean and for whom? What are the implications and limitations of this call? How might we understand relations and dynamics of oppression and advantage or privilege from this viewpoint? Furthermore, if we are to move beyond, where are we moving to, and does this “place” have the analytical depth and clarity essential to the struggle for social transformation?</p>
<p>Engaging this debate and exploring these questions are important because the struggle over concepts and theories reveal not only (undeclared) cultural biases and assumptions but also political struggles over sociomaterial conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934712471533">Alford &amp; Friedland, 1985</xref>). The call to move beyond is reflective of political struggle—but what is the nature of this political struggle? Many scholars who argue to move beyond claim their aspiration is to form progressive, multiracial coalitions and alliances and to make visible what has been rendered invisible by the so-called Black/White binary paradigm.</p>
<p>At first impression, critiques of the so-called Black/White binary paradigm appear persuasive—but only if one accepts a priori that race scholarship is dominated by this paradigm and that it functions to restrict how race is understood, theorized, and addressed. What is more, many claimants of this position contend that African and European American scholars who employ the so-called Black/White binary paradigm obscure the histories and claims making of Asian, Native, and Latina/o Americans. There are problems, however, with proposing a multiracial coalition based on a critique of the so-called Black/White binary paradigm. One such problem is identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021934712471533">Jared Sexton (2010)</xref>, who argues that this call is premised on the belief “of an ‘endemic’ black-white model of racial thought” (p. 90). For Sexton, this notion is “something of a social fiction—one might say a <italic>misreading</italic>—that depends upon a reduction of the sophistication of the paradigm in question” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021934712471533">Sexton, 2010</xref>, p. 90). If Sexton is correct, and we believe he is, then the call to move beyond is fundamentally flawed because it is built on an inadequate understanding of power relations that structure what is, in fact, a black/white Manicheanism. A Manicheanism is a moral and symbolic framework that constructs the world as polarized by forces of good and evil, represented in the oppositions between lightness and darkness and between black and white (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934712471533">Bastide, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934712471533">Fanon, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712471533">Hoch, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021934712471533">Stone, 1981</xref>). Contrary to moving beyond advocates’ claim of a Black/White binary paradigm, the black/white Manicheanism is an incorporative racial matrix in the psychosocial world of European culture that gives meaning to a broad range of identities. Furthermore, this misreading and reduction rests on the presupposition that this call is warranted and that one <italic>can</italic> move beyond what is posited as a simple binary. This assumption and call to action needs to be interrogated and deconstructed not only because the former is erroneous but also because the latter implicitly reproduces anti-blackness as a presupposition for multiracial coalition building.</p>
<p>We argue in this essay that a deconstruction of the move beyond discourse reveals that knowledge about racism, but more specifically, anti-black racism, is not substantively advanced and, in fact, creates two distinct problems. First, by misreading and misnaming a real historical and contemporary experience as a paradigm, the discourse creates the false dilemma of needing to move beyond. Second, the discourse sets up blackness (interestingly enough, not whiteness), and by extension, those people socially defined as “black,” as an impediment to the laudable goals of a multiracial coalition and complex understanding of race relations in North America. In this way, moving beyond, in terms of praxis (action, epistemology, and politics), is a discourse based on “bad faith” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934712471533">Gordon, 1994</xref>) toward African-descended peoples. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934712471533">Gordon (1994)</xref>, bad faith is denial of the humanity of the black body and the consistent imputation of a negative value to it as a means of defining the (non-black) self.</p>
<p>In order to address these and the other salient issues, this article will examine some of the North American scholarly research on moving beyond the Black/White binary paradigm. This examination is by no means exhaustive; however, it aims to apprehend the implications for advancing this agenda for African-descended peoples as well as other people “of color.” In North America, this discourse is most explicitly articulated by Asian, Latina/o, and some European academics in the United States; we found few if any African or Native Americans among its supporters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021934712471533">2</xref></sup> What follows in this essay is a demystification of the moving beyond discourse that is presumed necessary for achieving postracial alliance. Demystifying this discourse entails three primary objectives: (a) understanding how moving beyond advocates conceptualize the Black/White binary paradigm to be simplistic, one-dimensional, and exclusionary for non-African groups of color; (b) critiquing the misapplication of the paradigm concept to what is, in fact, a black/white Manicheanism; and (c) critically elaborating how racial difference in North America is saturated with the determinants of the black/white Manicheanism. We show that the call to move beyond is far more than semantics. It is a gesture and enactment of power by groups granted the privilege to move beyond and to articulate a discourse that disregards, obfuscates, and downplays the realities of oppression based on the black/white Manicheanism. We conclude by demonstrating how the move beyond thesis constitutes an epistemology and politics that is both detrimental to and untenable for African-descended peoples.</p>

<title>Defining the Black/White Binary Paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021934712471533">3</xref></sup></title>
<p>One of the primary moving beyond advocates, legal scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Juan Perea (1997)</xref> defines the Black/White binary paradigm “as the conception that race in America consists, either exclusively or primarily, of only two constituent racial groups, the Black and the White” (p. 1219). Believing that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934712471533">Thomas Kuhn’s (1970)</xref> conceptualization of a paradigm is generalizable to social studies, Perea argues that the black and white binary is the “most pervasive and powerful paradigm of race in the United States” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea, 1997</xref>, p. 1219). He argues that race scholarship is dominated by this paradigm and that it delineates how race is understood. Consequently, this paradigm is believed to narrow the theoretical lens and emaciate a potentially robust response from civil society. According to Perea, the exclusive focus on African and European Americans by scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0021934712471533">Cornel West (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021934712471533">Toni Morrison (1994)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021934712471533">Andrew Hacker (1992)</xref>, inter alia, is seen as a reification of the Black/White binary paradigm’s worst elements. Many other interpretations of the Black/White binary paradigm are implicitly informed by a similar reasoning. In general, the critique has three cohering themes.</p>
<p>First, the Black/White binary paradigm is argued to be a one-dimensional and simplistic academic discourse on race in the areas of law, feminism, and other social studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea (1997)</xref>, for example, contends that as a simplistic one-dimensional discourse, the paradigm structures race analysis through a Black and White binary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934712471533">Linda Martin Alcoff (2006)</xref>, in the chapter “Latinos, Asian Americans, and the Black-White Binary,” echoes Perea’s argument: “The hegemony of the black/white paradigm has stymied the development of an adequate account of the diverse racial realities in the Unites states and weakened the general accounts of racism that attempt to be truly inclusive” (p. 253). As such, it is argued that this so-called Black/White binary paradigm is unable to conceptually capture the negative processes of racialization and racism outside of this binary.</p>
<p>Second, the Black/White binary paradigm is argued not only to misrepresent history but also to obscure the historical experiences of non-African people of color. The paradigm is said to ignore the racist practices and the history of discrimination experienced by Latinas/os, Mexicans, Chinese, Japanese, Native, and other negatively racialized groups in the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934712471533">William Carrigan and Clive Webb (2004)</xref>, for example, in “Muerto por Unos Desconocidos (Killed by Persons Unknown): Mob Violence Against Blacks and Mexicans,” argue that “the literature on lynching in particular is <italic>blinded</italic> [italics added] by a black-white dichotomy that precludes any substantial analysis of mob violence against non-black minorities” (p. 36). In another example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712471533">Neil Foley (2004)</xref> argues in the same edited text as Carrigan and Webb that a
<disp-quote>
<p>long history of black-white racial thinking has not only <italic>impinged</italic> [italics added] upon the freedom of Mexican Americans and other Latinos, but it has also <italic>stifled</italic> [italics added] the ability of all Americans to reconsider and reconfigure racial discourses in new and productive ways. (p. 126)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021934712471533">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, it is argued that this binary paradigm links racism exclusively to skin color and negates or denies structural and other aspects of racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934712471533">Alcoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0021934712471533">Stasiulis, 1999</xref>). This association of racism to skin color is also viewed as negating the racism faced by peoples who are not denigrated by skin color. To counter what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934712471533">Alcoff (2006)</xref> calls “the hegemony of the black/white paradigm” (p. 253), she argues that racism can operate through axes of racialization that are not necessarily connected to skin color, such as the denigration of physical features (the physical-characteristics-other-than-color axis), the denigration of culture (culture-origin axis), and “nativism” (p. 259). Racial discrimination against Asians and Latinas/os, Alcoff argues, has operated along these axes of racialization, and a Black/White binary paradigm is believed to obscure this fact.</p>

<title>Assessing the Concept of the Black/White Binary Paradigm</title>
<p>As we turn our attention to an assessment of these critiques, a look at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea’s (1997)</xref> use of <italic>paradigm</italic> is warranted. This examination is necessary because many scholarly works unquestioningly and uncritically follow Perea’s footsteps in their understanding and use of the term <italic>paradigm</italic>. Here, we do not dismiss the concern of Perea and others even as we suggest that their nomenclature and analysis are in error. Our central point is that moving beyond the Black/White binary paradigm obscures the political nature of knowledge production and that its nomenclature and analysis are not merely in error; the discourse depends on sophisticated erasure of and animus toward blackness.</p>
<p>We first begin with the issue of nomenclature. Borrowing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934712471533">Thomas Kuhn (1970)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea (1997)</xref> asserts that “a paradigm is the set of shared understandings that permits us to distinguish those facts that matter in the solution of a problem from those facts that do not” (p. 1216.) Thus, Perea contends, paradigms define what is seen as relevant and as such direct “fact gathering and investigation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934712471533">Perea, 1997</xref>, p. 1216). Applying Kuhn’s argument to the Black/White binary paradigm, Perea believes that scholarly theorizations of race and racism are defined and limited by this paradigm. We do not take issue with Perea’s (or Kuhn’s) <italic>definition</italic> of paradigm. The problem lies with the application of <italic>paradigm</italic> to what is, in fact, a black/white Manicheanism. We suggest that this semantic appropriation of an analytical term applicable only to the sciences, as it was intended in Kuhn’s iteration, is fatally flawed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021934712471533">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Kuhn, interplay exists between scientific inquiry and a scientific worldview. He argues that a paradigm “is what the members of a scientific community share, and, conversely, a scientific community consists of men [<italic>sic</italic>] who share a paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934712471533">Kuhn, 1970</xref>, p. 176). Given this argument, there is a misapplication of the concept of paradigm to a black/white Manicheanism. The so-called Black/White binary paradigm is not a product of verifiable <italic>science</italic> arrived at by the consensus of members in the scientific community. Rather, from an objective view of history, we do not have a paradigm but a Manicheanism borne of western European culture, history, and religion.</p>
<p>Paul Hoch, in <italic>White Hero Black Beast</italic> (1974), explains that in European cultural mythology, there is a Manichean moral framework that constructs the world as polarized by forces of good and evil. These forces of good and evil are symbolized in the oppositions between lightness and darkness and black and white (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934712471533">Dyer, 1997</xref>). This Manicheanism is most evident in European languages where whiteness is the positive thesis to the negative antithesis of blackness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934712471533">James, 1981</xref>). Color symbolism also plays a connecting role with language and moral framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021934712471533">Williams, 1966</xref>). This Manicheanism and its attendant language are frequently evoked in popular culture through the use of mythologies. While the use of such cultural mythology is abstract in theory, in practice, it has been displaced onto the bodies of real people—Europeans are mythologized as those who epitomize and embody all that is civilized, good, and light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0021934712471533">Wilson, 1993</xref>). On the other hand, Africans (cursed with blackness of skin) epitomize and embody all that is evil and dark (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934712471533">Jordan, 1968</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021934712471533">Kitossa (2005)</xref> has referred to the transvaluation of skin color to human bodies as an anthropomorphic symbolic transference. This transference in psychosocial terms means that blackness as “race” is a “tribal stigma” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021934712471533">Goffman, 1963</xref>) located in and on the bodies of African people. Equally, too, whiteness is located in and on the bodies of European people, however, with a crucial difference. This difference is that whiteness is a positive, chameleon-like, marked and unmarked racialization and a privileged location that eludes the markings of a racial position and, as such, is constructed as a “natural” rather than a raced category (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934712471533">Dyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934712471533">Frankenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934712471533">Gordon, 1994</xref>). Moreover, the power of whiteness resides not only in its cloaking quality but equally in its status as a property right and a franchise that can be extended to a variety of groups at the expense of socially defined black people.</p>
<p>The association of blackness to the skin of African people was and is a symbolic association that is neither innocuous nor accidental. It was the primary indicator of slave versus free status. The crucial point is that whiteness as a positive social and ideological currency carries significant symbolic ideological weight in juxtaposition to a negative blackness. This weight resides in its Manicheanism because not only does this oppositional relationship provide color designations, but it also provides the social and symbolic definitions and representations that mark the boundaries of power, privilege, and belonging in Western society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934712471533">Deliovsky, 2010</xref>). It can be argued, then, that history and social relations dictate that Africans are not granted the privilege of moving beyond a Manicheanism that situates them as the primary antagonist in this historical and social drama that constitutes whiteness and the relative symbolic positioning of other racial groups.</p>
<p>Since the black/white Manicheanism is not “shared” as is a paradigm, and having no “scientific” verification nor the consent of African peoples, it is more appropriately understood as a violent cultural imposition. To understand it differently and to separate the violent reality of the Manicheanism from the ongoing and historical facts of its conceptualization and then ask those who are victimized by it to simply move beyond is grossly unfair. Less charitably, the uncritical acceptance of the moving beyond thesis creates an implicit demand that African-descended peoples are complicit in their silencing and/or erasure for the sake of a multiracial alliance.</p>

<title>Analysis of Moving Beyond the Black/White Binary Paradigm</title>
<p>The uncritical acceptance of the Black/White binary paradigm and what it may mean for African-descended peoples situates the call to move beyond as problematic and in need of challenge. In raising doubt about the self-evidence of the moving beyond thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712471533">Feagin, Vera, and Batur (2001)</xref> reject its (latent and manifest) premises when they argue it is “a confused term sometimes used by analysts critical of an emphasis on issues of white and black Americans in the United States” (p. 5). Furthermore, they continue, this criticism “fail[s] to note that the reality implied in the terms ‘black’ and ‘white’ . . . are . . . much more than an abstracted scholarly paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712471533">Feagin et al., 2001</xref>, p. 5). They contend “the underlying structural reality [in the African American experience] is the nearly four-hundred-year-old system of <italic>white-on-black oppression</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712471533">Feagin et al., 2001</xref>, p. 5). Taking Feagin et al.’s arguments one step further, “black” and “white” is not only a system of white-on-black oppression, it is also, à la Franz Fanon, a Manicheanism that shapes aesthetic and moral valuations and is operative in the determination of power and privilege in North America. Thus, contrary to the moving beyond advocates, the black/white Manicheanism is not a one-dimensional and simplistic discourse that exclusively represents blackness and whiteness. This Manicheanism, rather, reflects a process of negative and positive racialization that is a symbolic matrix (of inclusion and exclusion) that incorporates other racial/ethnic (and class) categories, albeit in a manner both contingent and hierarchical.</p>
<p>In the sociosymbolic order of Western culture, it is the polarity between whiteness and blackness (which is projected on the bodies of Europeans and Africans in North America) that gives intermediate racial groupings (i.e., in-between people; “ethnic” whites; not-quite-whites; honorary whites; “brown,” “yellow,” and “red” people; etc.) their meaning. These groupings or categories, much in line with the “Great Chain of Being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934712471533">Jordan, 1968</xref>), have situated black and white as negative and positive polar extremes with other racialized categories distributed between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934712471533">Deliovsky, 2010</xref>). A telling example of how the Manicheanism has historically worked as an incorporative matrix can be found in the literature from the Knights of the White Camelia located in mid-19th-century Louisiana. It was postulated that
<disp-quote>
<p>history and physiology teach us that we belong to a race which nature has endowed with an evident superiority over all races…And it is a remarkable fact that as a race of men is more <italic>remote from the Caucasian and approaches nearer the black African</italic> [italics added], the more fatally that stamp of inferiority is affixed to its sons, and irrevocably dooms them to internal imperfectability and degradation. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934712471533">Jacobson, 1999</xref>, p. 155)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significantly, rather than the black/white Manicheanism representing a strict binary, it provided (and still does) a contextual frame for how other groups were and are defined. Operating simultaneously is that in European racial cosmology (rooted in Judeo-Christianity), whiteness does not exist without blackness a priori (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934712471533">Jordan, 1968</xref>). The black/white Manicheanism suggests that a hierarchy exists and that European people (and others by extension) implicitly understand their position and sense of <italic>self</italic> relative to others.</p>
<p>Speaking to this dialectic of race and identity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021934712471533">Thomas Nakayama and Robert Krizek (1999)</xref>, in “whiteness as a Strategic Rhetoric,” contend that being white means not having any other “blood lines” that contaminate it. They state, “Unlike other categories, one can only be white by not being anything else” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021934712471533">Nakayama &amp; Krizek, 1999</xref>, p. 97). However, what they do not say is the “anything else” is not a free-floating signifier. The cognitive opposite is not brown, red, or yellow but black. For moving beyond advocates, the fact that a fundamental part of white nation building was and is the “othering” of all groups of color is seen as just grounds for moving beyond the so-called Black/White binary paradigm. Without doubt, various marginalized groups have been and are historically, ideologically, and symbolically (negatively) signified in the white imagination. Nevertheless, for reasons stated above, black is the fundamental “Other” racial reference in the sociosymbolic order of white society. As a fundamental reference, blackness is often invoked in the denigration of other groups. As an example, to signify both the inferiority and oppression of the Irish in the 19th century in the United States and the Quebecois in 20th-century Canada, they were labeled “white niggers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021934712471533">6</xref></sup> In the 19th century also, when Jews and the Irish (and Chinese) were pictorially represented, they were often Africanized in color and phenotype. With reference to Jews, for example, their physiognomy was demarcated as inferior by its perceived physical and genetic proximity to Africans. Quoting a passage from <italic>Races of Men</italic> by Robert Knox (1850), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934712471533">Matthew Jacobson (1999)</xref> illustrates this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>Brow marked with furrows or prominent points of bone, or with both; high cheek-bones; a sloping and disproportioned chin; and elongated, projecting mouth, which at the angles threatens every moment to reach the temples; a large, massive, club-shaped, hooked nose, three or four times larger than suites the face—these are features which stamp the African character of the Jew, his muzzle-shaped mouth and face removing him from certain other races. (p. 180)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our argument here is not to deny that non-African groups of color or those whites marked by ethnicity or religion were racialized according to perceived differences. Indeed they, too, have been marked by Western European culture’s obsessive investment in race. Yet to demonstrate the saliency of skin color racism and that an inverse correlation is impossible, when African people were racialized, they were not “yellowed” or “reddened,” nor did they need to be visually “blackened,” for they were already constructed as “black” and, as such, embodied blackness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934712471533">Stuart Hall (1997)</xref> explains, “For blacks, ‘primitivism’ (Culture) and ‘blackness’ (Nature) became interchangeable. . . . Not only were blacks represented in terms of their essential characteristics. They were reduced to their essence” (p. 245). This tautologically “racialized regime of representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934712471533">Hall, 1997</xref>, p. 249)—blackness is their essence and their essence is their blackness—persisted from antiquity to its inscription in 17th-century black and slave codes (in the Caribbean and Virginia colonies). These facts established blackness as a condition of chattel slavery. Integral to “the purity condition” of whiteness was the impure condition of blackness. Thus, the two groups that ideologically and symbolically typified these categories of whiteness and blackness also represented polar ends of a racial cosmology and hierarchy. African-descended people provided the outermost boundary on the negative polarity of this incorporative Manicheanism. Consequently, all other shades of people were (ideologically and symbolically) assessed within these polar extremes, though in some colonial settings, their actual material and social status was determined by labor demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934712471533">Chowdhry &amp; Beeman, 2007</xref>). It is important to note that this incorporative matrix does not prevent other non-African people of color from being subjected to exploitation and white supremacy. The point being dramatized, however, is that blackness signifies an entirely unique social position not shared by others, while simultaneously providing the outermost boundary in the assessment of Others. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021934712471533">Steve Martinot (2003)</xref> points out, African Americans “occupied the real center of white racialized identity” (p. 70). African-descended people’s historical and structural position in Western culture was not only significant to the racialization process; it was the foundation on which whiteness and white supremacy came into being. The call to move beyond not only negates these points but, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021934712471533">Jared Sexton (2010)</xref> argues, “gloss[es] over discrepant histories, minimize[s] [the] inequalities born of divergent structural [and ideological] positions, and disavow[s] the historical centrality and uniqueness of anti-blackness for the operations of ‘global white supremacy’” (p. 90).</p>
<p>The historic derogation of blackness and consequently African people in European and some Asiatic cultures is an important point to stress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021934712471533">7</xref></sup> The historical centrality and uniqueness of anti-blackness legitimated, and continues to legitimate, a high tolerance for brutality and indifference toward African-descended people’s suffering.

<title>Racism and Skin Color</title>
<p>We do not wish to mute the argument that racism can operate through other axes of racialization other than skin color; however, the relationship between (white) racism and skin color is undeniably one of the most enduring and salient aspects of the black/white Manicheanism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934712471533">Marimba Ani (1994)</xref> states, “No ethnology of European culture [and racism] can with honesty ignore the significance of color in the mind of the European” (p. 284). Furthermore, Ani explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>“whiteness” is central to the European self-image, just as their image of others necessarily involves “blackness” or “nonwhiteness,” as it is put negatively in European terms. This aspect of the European aesthetic helps to define the content of European cultural nationalism, and white supremism, [and] in this way, becomes identifiable as one of its most significant characteristics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934712471533">Ani, 1994</xref>, p. 284)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As one of its most significant characteristics, skin color operates to fix African-descended people in a state of permanent visibility and, paradoxically, selective invisibility. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934712471533">Fanon’s (1967)</xref> “fact of blackness,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934712471533">Robyn Weigman (1995)</xref> calls this the “visible epistemology of black skin” (p. 21). All bodies within a racialized schema are epistemic texts on which histories and ideological constructions are marked and read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021934712471533">Jackson, 2006</xref>). The “fact of blackness” requires an understanding of the saliency of blackness as a negative and relational social coordinate. In the context of a white supremacist society, then, the “real center of the white racialized identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021934712471533">Martinot, 2003</xref> p. 70) is condensed on blackness and the African body. The embodied nature of blackness (and whiteness) cannot be ignored or overlooked because it informed and shaped how, under specific historical conditions, non-black and non-white people were and continue to be differentiated and categorized. For Weigman, “the logic of race in U.S. culture anchors whiteness in the visible epistemology of black skin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934712471533">Weigman, 1995</xref>, p. 40) and defines the boundaries of whiteness and blackness. It also, she continues, “situates every subject in U.S. culture within the panoptic vision of racial meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934712471533">Weigman, 1995</xref>, p. 40). All people are drawn into this “economy of [racial] visibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934712471533">Weigman, 1995</xref>, p. x; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934712471533">Dei, Karumanchery, &amp; Karumanchery-Luik, 2004</xref>) as white or black or “whites of a different colour” or variations in between.</p>
<p>Showing the limits of Perea’s and Alcoff’s readiness to eject black and white as analytic categories, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934712471533">Frank, Akresh, and Lu (2010)</xref> show that darker-skinned Latina/o immigrants in America experience skin color discrimination in the area of income. They found that “the burden of race is not borne equally by all members of the contemporary Latino immigrant population” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934712471533">Frank et al., 2010</xref>, p. 396). The reason lies in the fact that skin color marks and contributes to inequality. As such, Frank et al. conclude, “Latinos can choose their racial identification . . . [but] this choice is constrained by the color of their skin and skin color-based discrimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934712471533">Frank et al., 2010</xref>, p. 396; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021934712471533">Mann, 1993</xref>, pp. 4, 164). Understanding the economy of racial visibility, which hinges on a black/white Manicheanism, is necessary for comprehending how all groups are drawn into the “panoptic vision of racial meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934712471533">Weigman, 1995</xref>, p. 40). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934712471533">Dei et al. (2004)</xref> argue that “while skin color cannot stand alone as the singular lynchpin by which the race concept is held together, there is a permanence and salience to skin color in relation to the problematics of categorization and social differentiation” (p. 23).</p>
<p>Relative to skin color, therefore, the black/white Manicheanism is a key factor in the categorization and social differentiation of human beings in the West. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934712471533">Dei et al., (2004</xref>, p. 92), the “economy of racial visibility” whereby skin color operates as a signifier of social value and moral worth is a function of power. A caveat is needed here—racial visibility is not solely the issue since one may find South Asians who are more phenotypically “black” than many African Americans as well as African Americans who can and do “pass” for white. Rather, the issue is that the social construction of blackness, along with an imagined ideal African phenotype, is deeply grounded in Western culture. Recall, however, that it is not simply Europeans and Africans who are assigned currency in this “economy of racial visibility.” Other negatively racialized groups occupy subordinate positions relative to Europeans yet superordinate to African people, who have occupied the lowest position (signified by blackness) in the Western imaginary.</p>
<p>None of this intends to negate the absolute domination of Native Americans and the theft of their land through white settler colonialism or to obviate colonialism and imperialism toward other people of color around the world. Our argument, rather, without excluding concrete material facts, is that the positioning of blackness and its assignment to African-descended people gives shape and context to the oppression of other racially dominated groups. More, however, needs to be said here. The white supremacist posture toward other racially dominated groups, whom we call “middling racial groups,” structures “positionalities of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934712471533">Dei et al., 2004</xref>). These positionalities of power can, at times, allow for positive ambivalence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934712471533">Stephenie Cole (2004)</xref>, for example, in “Finding Race in Turn-of-the-Century Dallas,” points out that due to demographic and labor conditions, the “obsession with blackness created interstices for other nonblack people of color—Mexican Americans, Asian immigrants, Russian Jews and others—to claim privileges not offered in other locales” (p. 77). This ambivalence, within definable limits, shapes and contextualizes the <italic>privileges</italic> experienced by other negatively racialized groups relative to African peoples. Indeed, historical research has demonstrated that marginalized non-African groups of color were also active in accessing this privilege by disassociating themselves from blackness. For example, the Mexican American civil rights movement of the 1930s to the 1950s was premised on the argument that as Mexicans, they were “whites of a different culture and color” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712471533">Foley, 2004</xref>, p. 135). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712471533">Foley (2004)</xref> explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>Many middle class Mexicans learned early on that hostility to the idea of “social equality” for African Americans went right to the core of what constituted whiteness in the United States. Whether or not they brought with them from Mexico racial prejudice against blacks—and certainly many Mexicans did—middle-class Mexican leaders . . . went to great lengths to dissociate themselves socially, culturally, and politically from the early struggles of African Americans to achieve full citizenship rights in America. (p. 135; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0021934712471533">Zuberi, 2001</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some Latina/o American groups, nevertheless, that their struggles have vacillated between being considered white—and, therefore, extending the white franchise or at least not being lumped in with African Americans as black—and demanding the nonenforcement of certain laws that would negatively racialize them (e.g., immigration) stands on a very different ground from African Americans, whose struggles have largely centered on the enforcement of inclusionary laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934712471533">Economist, 2007</xref>). Given the historic differences in their struggles and that in strategic ways, white and light-skinned Latinas/os have appealed to whiteness to win gains, it is clear that phenotypically recognized African-descended persons do not have the luxury of positive ambivalence.</p>
<p>A move beyond would render unintelligible the vital elements involved in racialized processes of inclusion and exclusion. Indeed, the paradox in some of the scholarship claiming to move beyond the Black/White binary paradigm demonstrates complicity in what they seek to reject. The previous quote by Foley is one such example. The call to move beyond is far more than semantics, though. Concretely, it is a gesture and enactment of power by groups granted the privilege to move beyond. “Positionalities of power” grant middling racial groups the power to articulate a discourse that disregards, obfuscates, and downplays the realities of oppression based on the black/white Manicheanism. It also situates these groups as victims of whiteness and never perpetrators of anti-blackness. But, akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021934712471533">Albert Memmi’s (1991)</xref> observation about the Jew and other near-whites in colonial North Africa, these middling racial groups have one thing in common: They have a sense of what Memmi would argue is a “profound satisfaction of being negatively better than the colonized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021934712471533">Memmi, 1991</xref>, p. 17), which in our case is African-descended people in a white supremacist context. Without negating the effects of whiteness on middling groups, they, nonetheless, are “never completely engulfed in the abasement into which colonialism [White supremacy] drives them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021934712471533">Memmi, 1991</xref>, p. 17). Thus, borrowing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934712471533">Jared Sexton (2008)</xref>, how (and by whom) the move beyond is narrated “structures the generally tense and conflicted relations, political and otherwise, between communities of color, whether between blacks and immigrants or between blacks and the multiracial contingent” (p. 253).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021934712471533">
<title>Moving Beyond May Take Us Out of Bonds</title>
<p>In closing, moving beyond advocates argue that alternatives to the Black/White binary paradigm are needed to account for changing experiences of race and racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021934712471533">Martinez, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021934712471533">Omi &amp; Winant, 1994</xref>). Uncritical acceptance of the Black/White binary paradigm situates the call to move beyond as questionable and problematic and all the more urgently in need of challenge. Perhaps, in the laudable quest for multiracial alliances, the call to move beyond has been uncritically accepted as a necessary tactic in the antiracist struggle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934712471533">Sexton (2008)</xref> warns against the “unexamined desire for new analyses and the often anxious drive for political alliance” (p. 252). Moreover, he calls into “question the motive force of a nominally critical intervention on the ‘black-white paradigm’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934712471533">Sexton, 2008</xref>, p. 252). If an integral part of this move beyond postulates that blackness is an epistemic obstacle to effective antiracism politics, does this not imply that multiracial alliances are “a social formation for which the exclusion of the category of racial blackness is a sine qua non” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021934712471533">Sexton, 2010</xref>, p. 89)? And to exclude racial blackness means, ultimately, to excise those defined as black from this coalition. In other words, the black body may be counted for more than three fifths of a person for the antiracist cause, but African people’s history and narratives must be checked at the door. Not only does this (implied) excision do a gross disservice to those victimized by this Manicheanism; it erases their history and obscures how other non-African people of color are affected by it as well as contribute to it. This situates moving beyond as a faulty and politically harmful epistemological framework for African-descended people, and what is more, it is an act of bad faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021934712471533">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Without question, there is a need for a complex reading and analysis of racial oppression; however, the refusal to grant primacy to this “visible epistemology of black skin” suggests there is more to this call than an academic pursuit. Put another way, it is one thing to argue that we need a complex understanding of the multiracial makeup of North America; it is quite another to frame the black/white Manicheanism as <italic>the</italic> reason for this lack of scholarly work. To reiterate, pointing the finger at the black/white Manicheanism creates, in general, two fundamental errors. One, it creates a false problem by confusing and misnaming a real historical and contemporary experience and, as such, grossly simplifies its complexity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0021934712471533">Michael Steinberg (2001)</xref> argues,
<disp-quote>
<p>Putting the wrong name on a problem is worse than having no name at all. In the latter instance, one is at least open to filling the conceptual void. In the first instance, however, words lead us down a blind alley. They divert us from the facets of the problem that should command our attention and . . . lead to remedies that are ineffectual or worse. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As we see it, in our case, the “worse” leads us to the second fundamental problem: It sets up blackness (interestingly enough, not whiteness), and by extension those people socially defined as black, as an impediment to the laudable goals of a multiracial coalition and complex understanding of race relations in the United States. It is disconcerting how the articulation of moving beyond implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) situates blackness as an obstacle or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934712471533">Sexton (2008)</xref> argues, “[standing] in the way of future progress, silencing the expression of much needed voices on the political and intellectual scene” (p. 252). It appears that “the force of anti-blackness consistently troubles the myriad efforts at mediation and amelioration among the nonwhite” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934712471533">Sexton, 2008</xref>, p. 253).</p>
<p>It goes without saying the challenge is not to move beyond but to theorize the black/white Manicheanism through a critical inquiry that captures its complexity. This complexity must bear in mind how thoroughly saturated is the sociosymbolic structure of racial difference with the determinants of the black/white Manicheanism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021934712471533">9</xref></sup> The black/white Manicheanism “has and continues to situate every subject in U.S. culture within the panoptic vision of racial meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934712471533">Weigman, 1995</xref>, p. 40). These racial meanings were and are often configured in relation to and against black (and white) racial designations. Thus, rather than calling to move beyond, it would be more conceptually creative and politically advantageous to work toward analyzing the black/white Manicheanism in a way that makes clear the relationship between this Manicheanism and other racially marginalized groups. Thus, to develop an epistemologically deep understanding of race, racialization, and racism in the North America, the significance of anti-blackness must be apprehended, not as a superior form of oppression but as a form that gives shape and context to the oppression of other racially marginalized groups, while creating a qualitatively distinct oppression for African-descended peoples. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934712471533">Jared Sexton (2008)</xref> cogently argues,
<disp-quote>
<p>anti-blackness is longstanding and ongoing but also . . . unlike other forms of racial oppression in qualitative ways—differences of kind, rather than degree, a structural singularity rather than an empirical anomaly. But all of this is not…to participate in the ranked determination of suffering. It is, instead, to properly locate the political dynamics and to outline the ethical stakes at hand. (p. 245)</p>

<p>Canadian scholars have contributed little to this debate, though there is implicit agreement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0021934712471533">Stasiulis, 1999</xref>). There may be several reasons for the lack of Canadian engagement. First, Canada has a national image of not being racist or at least not as racist as the United States. Additionally, there is the assiduous projection of its being a “raceless nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934712471533">Backhouse, 1999</xref>). Second, Canada did not have a system of plantation slavery but domestic and small-holding slavery; thus, populations of African-descended peoples were and remain small in spite of successive periods of immigration. The black/white Manicheanism that defines the history of the social relations of production in the United States may be seen as unbecoming of race theorizing in Canada. Finally, the model of multiculturalism, in both theory and practice, undermines multi-racial alliance because it promotes inter-group competition for state resources. Critical researchers in Canada, however, note that the Canadian practice of aggregating racial inequality data conceals the full scope of discrimination experienced by African Canadians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934712471533">Hum &amp; Simpson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021934712471533">Rodney &amp; Copeland, 2009</xref>).</p>

His approach appears to be a conflicted one. He recognizes that in a white supremacist society, such as the United States, the negative racialization of African Americans is a central foil against which various racial identities were and are defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021934712471533">Marable, 2009</xref>, p. 246).

As a consequence, Marable accepts that African Americans must assume responsibility to reach “out to the newer voices and colors of US society—Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Island Americans, Middle East Americans, American Indians, and others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021934712471533">Marable, 2009</xref>, p. 226). From Reconstruction to the present, there is no historical evidence that African Americans have exclusively sought gains at the expense of other negatively racialized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0021934712471533">Wilson, 1993</xref>). His discourse thus begs the question why other negatively racialized groups are imagined to have no obligation to reach out to African Americans.</p>

<p>There are Asian American scholars who have not embraced the moving beyond thesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021934712471533">Mari Matsuda (2002)</xref> gives a brief account of the structuration of black-white relations on U.S. racial dynamics and its impact on Asian Americans. Further, she explores how the African American intellectual tradition, civil rights, and black power movements and their leaders played a role in facilitating the radicalization of Asian American politics. Matsuda cautions against reading her critical analysis as endorsement of a blind call to move beyond: “Theory is important. I don’t want my comments taken as anti-intellectual, anti-theory, or anti-deconstruction in particular. My attack is on deconstruction that comes without a progressive politics and without a material component” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021934712471533">Matsuda, 2002</xref>, p. 395). More detailed than Matsuda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0021934712471533">Frank Wu (2002)</xref> argues that the choice between the Black/White binary paradigm and the “rest of us” is not a real choice. He posits that the moving beyond thesis has opened a conversation of productive tension between African and Asian Americans.</p>

<p>Anthropomorphic valuations of blackness and whiteness reach into antiquity. This priority cannot be ignored given that discourses of moral geography, medico-scientific, and religious anti-blackness continued through the Christian and non-African Islamic medieval period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934712471533">Bastide, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712471533">Brackman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934712471533">James, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021934712471533">Lewis, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021934712471533">Pastva, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021934712471533">Stone, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021934712471533">J. Washington, 1984</xref>). There is, of course, the fact that Africanness and blackness were not always negative signifiers in Western culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934712471533">Bernal, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712471533">Diop, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0021934712471533">Snowden, 1970</xref>). Nevertheless, it is incorrect to assume that Asian and Latina/o expressions of anti-blackness derive solely from the competitive racial politics in the United States. There is substantial evidence that Latin American cultures—being derivative of the Western heritage and, in the Americas, being former slave-holding societies—have endogenous expressions of anti-blackness and pro-whiteness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021934712471533">Rout, 1976</xref>). A notable historical account is that of the venerable “father” of human rights, former-conquistador-turned-priest of Chiapas, Bartolome de Las Casas. He argued that the indigenous people were (innocent) children of the Judeo-Christian God and should thus be spared the brutality and genocide arising from Spanish rapaciousness. Such horrors, he argued, should be visited on Africans, who, after all, were the “cursed” children of Ham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934712471533">Davis, 2006</xref>, p. 98). Isabella and Ferdinand obliged with the requisite protective laws, even if the Spanish colonizers ignored them. In contemporary times, the “cleansing” of Africans from Chile and most parts of Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021934712471533">Rout, 1976</xref>) stand as evidence of anti-African racism in Latin America. With respect to Asians, it is little known that the black/white Manicheanism is endogenous, though more aesthetic than moral. Of course, the anthropomorphism of blackness and whiteness has been amplified by contact with the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021934712471533">J. Russell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021934712471533">Sauter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021934712471533">Wagatsuma, 1967</xref>). In India, the issue of the Dalits and the history of the African presence and racism in India are hardly known in the West outside a few intrepid African-centered scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021934712471533">Rashidi &amp; van Sertima, 1987</xref>). The venerated Ghandi proclaimed, “I venture to point out that both the English and the Indians spring from a common stock, called the Indo-Aryan” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0021934712471533">Singh &amp; Watson, 2009</xref>, p. 18). Ghandi’s passionate dislike for Africans was as much a function of class pretensions as it was a product of race consciousness attributed to his Brahmin heritage.</p>

<p>A cogent example of contingent middling privilege merging with “bad faith” toward blackness is the idea of “Black Orientalism,” coined and elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021934712471533">Helen Jun (2006)</xref>. Jun intends Black Orientalism to signify the past (and present?) complicity of African Americans in the reproduction of U.S. and Western anxiety over “Asia rising.” We cannot undertake a fully elaborated critique of this idea, but three points are noteworthy. First, Black Orientalism requires one to forget that African Americans were not, then or now, owners of the means of production or controllers of societal institutions and the mass media. The imagination is strained to conceive of how African Americans are in a position to control the life chances of Asian Americans by exercising orientalist reason. In the contemporary context, Jun’s thesis requires forgetting that Asia is now the destination for many low-skilled and low-waged jobs that African Americans were once consigned to. Second, there are the more complex facts of epistemology, geography, and political philosophy. It should be clear from its geographical signification that the “Orient” excluded Africa. Hegel and others who nurtured the political theory of Orientalism imagined a racial and moral geography in which Africa was beyond the pale of human recognition. What little historical significance Africa was believed to have was a consequence of the necessarily despotic, humanizing influence of the <italic>Oriental</italic> (i.e., Arab; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021934712471533">Simon-Aaron, 2008</xref>). Finally, the inappropriate nomenclature and overly inclusiveness of <italic>Black Orientalism</italic> neglects the tradition of radical anticolonial politics that saw revolutionary collaboration and mutual respect between African Americans and Asians. Two emblematic examples include Marcus Garvey’s influence on Ho Chi Minh’s political theory of decolonization as well as Garvey’s admiration for Minh and the role that Japanese American activist Richard Aoki played in the formation, arming, and training of the Oakland chapter of the Black Panther Party.</p></fn>
