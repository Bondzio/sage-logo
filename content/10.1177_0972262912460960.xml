<p><italic>The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none.</italic></p>
<p>T. Carlyle</p>
<p>601 Lexington Avenue (formerly known as Citicorp Center)—a 59-storey tower—designed by architect Hugh Stubbins Jr. and structural engineer William J. LeMessurier, is an engineering marvel and one of the ten tallest skyscrapers in New York. In 1978, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the structure after a discussion with a Princeton University engineering student and design engineer Joel Weinstein. Subsequent studies made by LeMessurier revealed potentially fatal flaws in the design of the building due to which the structure could collapse and cause immeasurable damage. LeMessurier approached Citicorp directly stressing the need for urgent remedial action. LeMessurier risked both professional humiliation and financial ruination but today he is respected for his candor and intrepidity.</p>
<p>One of the prime ministers of our mighty nation had famously stated that of every rupee allocated for development, only fifteen paise reached the grassroot beneficiaries for whom it was intended.</p>
<p>Satyendera Kumar Dubey was a project director at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and he was murdered in cold-blood because he was fighting corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral highway construction project.</p>
<p>According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India the spectrum scam cost as much as 1.76 lakh crores<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0972262912460960">1</xref></sup>. Beyond doubt this money could have been better utilized in educating the poor children in the country, providing support and vocational training to the unemployed youth, providing water and food to the malnourished, shelter to the homeless and thus made India a superpower.</p>
<p>The aforementioned remark and the tragic incidents compel one to think that is not it high time that serious thought is given to ‘Business Ethics’ education. The work under review is undoubtedly an essential book for our time when, in sooth, the term ‘business ethics’ may sound more like an oxymoron. In fact, the book will be helpful to all corporate managers because of the eye-opening and soul-searching information that it contains.</p>
<p>The superlative tome under review is an enthralling odyssey of 12 relishing chapters. The book has a consistent approach throughout. Each chapter begins with a thought-provoking quote (sometimes quotes) made by an intellectual luminary(ies). Each chapter contains description of real-life incidences and has boxes which contain brain-rattling cases and ends with enlightening key takeaways. The book brings out the differences between legal and ethical, clearly explaining that what may be legally correct may not be ethical or perhaps morally correct and although some actions may be illegal yet they are ethical. There can, however, be cases where unethical actions might be unintentional! Nonetheless, the book looks at ethics as the instauration on which a business is built and not merely as an optional extra.</p>
<p>The first chapter provides a clear-cut answer to the enigma <italic>Being ethical in business, if it leads to reduction in shareholder value, is unethical!</italic> The chapter dissects three terms logic, aesthetics and ethics. It explains the necessity of building a moral compass and using it in day-to-day life and is enriched with two case studies: one relating to Angadias (local couriers) and the other related to a village Plachimada where Coca-Cola ran into trouble and earned the ire of the villagers. Through subtle examples the second chapter brings out the truth that the conclusions and actions of two managers might be the same although the process of arriving at the conclusions might be very much different. It examines the consequentialism and utilitarianism theories and contains several caselets which are likely to put a normal human being in great dilemma. The third chapter examines a number of ethical questions which arise while relating a firm to its shareholders, customers, employees, community and society at large. It builds the base of a theory known as Agency Theory which has been discussed meticulously in the eighth chapter. The fourth chapter dwells on the credo <italic>caveat emptor</italic> which in spite of acts like the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act and several other exemplary court rulings is perhaps as much valid today as much as it was 50 years earlier. It has eye-opening cases related to unit-linked insurance products (ULIPs), legal battles of Microsoft, sub-prime borrowers, the small car known as Ford Pinto, skin lightening creams and the Infant Food Formula Controversy.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter performs a fine dissection of the obligations of an employee as well as employer. The chapter contains a case study pertaining to Enron (now infamous for a large-scale corporate fraud), another case study related to the famous Aircraft Brakes scandal in which Goodrich Company had received a contract to supply wheels and brakes for a new Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) for the US Air Force. It also sheds light on various issues related to outsourcing. The chapter throws light on the fact that the laws of the home country of a company might be very much different from the laws of another country in which the company might be operating due to which an employee might lose his/her job for a practice which may be proper in one country and unacceptable in other country. The sixth chapter looks into issues related to predatory pricing, dumping, price fixing, denigration of competitors’ product(s) and poaching of employees. The seventh chapter explains various measures which firms can embrace in order to control pollution and looks into negative and positive externalities, carbon credits, carbon trading and afforestation credits. The eighth chapter looks at some of the reasons due to which many companies do not wish to establish their plants in a state which was once the epicentre of Indian industry. The chapter also examines the irreparable and irreversible damage which the city of Bhopal and its residents suffered in 1984 due to leakage of methyl isocyanate, the treatment meted out to animals in different countries, CSR initiatives by various Indian firms and the seminal theory known as ‘Agency Theory’.</p>
<p>The ninth chapter contains many suggestions which can help create ethical organizations, including lessons which can be learnt from ancient India. It performs a root cause analysis of many policies an organization might follow which verily force employees to indulge in unethical behaviour. The tenth chapter discusses certain games which provide an insight into a human being’s thought process and values. It contains case studies to help the reader understand the concepts of Fairness, Justice and Intentions. The eleventh chapter explores sundry mechanisms through which management education can play a constructive role in improving the ethical climate. The twelfth chapter contains brilliant insights from the Mahabharata which can go a long way in understanding the world.</p>
<p>The author of the work under review has built on the work of Milton Friedman—a Nobel laureate; Jach Welch—legendary CEO of General Electric; Albert Camus, Homer, Wiliam Styron and William Golding—all highly acclaimed novelists; Peter Drucker—acclaimed writer and famed management guru; John von Neumann, Oskar Morgenstern (co-developers of Game Theory) and Joseph Badaracco—Harvard Business School professor; Stanley Milgram—social psychologist from Yale University known for his path-breaking experiments. The author of the work under review has also drawn from movies like <italic>Modern Times</italic> (which featured the legendary Charlie Chaplin), <italic>Wall Street, Lord of the Flies, To Kill a Mocking Bird</italic> and the documentary film <italic>An Inconvenient Truth</italic> directed by Davis Guggenheim.</p>
<p>After reading the book I felt that Business Ethics in itself is as vast a field of study as Marketing Management, Human Resource Management, Production Management, Finance Management or Retail Management. At the same time it is true that managers might confront situations in their professional life when it becomes very difficult to distinguish between what is correct and what is not correct. Perhaps Protagoras was correct when he said ‘Truth is relative. It is only a matter of opinion’ in a dialogue with Socrates.</p>
<p>Although the book itself says that it is intended for corporate reading yet it will be of immense use to almost every human being including management students, management teachers as well as policy makers. It would do the reader a great deal of good to acquaint himself or herself with management jargon such as moral, immoral, amoral, monopolistic, quasi-monopolistic and countervailing duty because these terms have been used in the book without much explanation although the context itself might help the reader in comprehending the aforementioned terms. The book explains in a subtle way that the genesis of most of the difficulties lies in a simple lack on connection between what is known to be good and the ability to act on that knowledge. It also brings out the truth that what men can tear-down because of being self-centred can also be built-up by other-centred men.</p>
