<p>The author uses his experience to sharpen our understanding of how continually occurring paradoxes during change tend to slow down, stall, or stop the change progress. This occurs in part because of how leaders react in the face of dilemmas or when confronted with difficult choices to make. Sometimes the situation poses equally positive or negative choices or choices that negate each other. In such circumstances, many leaders often jump to one or the other too quickly, revert into analysis or avoidance, or simply chose what they are familiar or comfortable with. In today’s complex world, these types of decisions are less sustainable and can lead to further problems.</p>
<p>Managing polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492612455139">Johnson, 1996</xref>) often involves shifting one’s mind-set. As Einstein reminds us “You can never solve a problem on the level at which it was created. . . . You must learn to see the world anew.” When faced with the horns of a dilemma, either/or behavior often emerges when both/and thinking is really needed.But that is easier said than done. Larry Peters’ examples illustrate how these situations show up, how leaders respond, and the type of support that can help move the process forward. He also has helped to differentiate how the behaviors can resemble typical resistance but are actually a different phenomenon of dealing with paradox.</p>
<p>For leaders and change agents, this article will be useful in better understanding a common, but often misunderstood, situation occurring during change.</p>
