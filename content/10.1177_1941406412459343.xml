<p><bold>Background</bold>. Nutrient intake in the preconception period can have profound effects on pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy during adolescence is often unplanned and associated with lower rates of prenatal care. Poor baseline nutrition status could contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes. Design A secondary analysis of data obtained from 2 randomized controlled trials conducted from 1997 to 2007 was performed with the objective of quantifying intakes of folate, vitamin D, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)—nutrients potentially affecting pregnancy outcomes in adolescent girls of childbearing age. <bold>Participants</bold>. Two cohorts of girls living in a metropolitan area were analyzed. The first group, a sample of 64 healthy 9-year-old girls, was followed for 10 years. The second, a similar cohort of 134 healthy girls, was followed for 8 years. Information about nutrient intake from food sources was collected and analyzed during the times the participants were 14 to 19 years old, considered years of potential pregnancy. <bold>Statistical analysis</bold>. Nutrient intakes of folate, vitamin D, and PUFAs were compared with dietary reference intake values. Nutrient intakes were considered repeated measures and fit with a linear mixed-effect model to evaluate the change over time. <bold>Results</bold>.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nutrient intake in the preconception period and during pregnancy may have a profound effect on the development of the fetus and the outcome of the pregnancy. The nutrient most commonly considered in relation to pregnancy outcomes may be folic acid, deficiency of which is associated with an increased incidence of neural tube defects. However, other nutrients may have similar impacts on pregnancy outcomes. For example, vitamin D deficiency in the mother has been linked to issues such as low birth weight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412459343">1</xref></sup> poor bone growth in the infant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412459343">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412459343"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412459343">4</xref></sup> and increased risk of asthma in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412459343">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412459343">6</xref></sup> Attention has also been given to the fatty acid intake of pregnant women in recent years. Increasing consumption of certain omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may have beneficial outcomes for the developing fetus, including improved cognition and visual development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412459343">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2009, approximately 410 000 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years gave birth in the United States. Compared with adult births, births to teenagers are at greater risk for low birth weight or prematurity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412459343">8</xref></sup> and are associated with high public health costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412459343">9</xref></sup> Because teenagers are less likely to seek prenatal counseling and, overall, have less prenatal care than pregnant women in older age groups, it is unlikely that inadequate intake of nutrients potentially affecting the outcome of pregnancy will be identified and addressed during prenatal care. Although studies such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have evaluated the overall nutrient intake of adolescent populations in the United States, no study has limited itself to a population of adolescent girls who have the potential to become pregnant and evaluated the intake of a group of specific nutrients, deficiency of which is associated with outcomes in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the intake of key nutrients associated with optimal pregnancy outcomes, specifically folate, vitamin D, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in a population of girls from the time they were 14 until they were 19 years old in a Midwestern metropolitan area.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>This study includes data from 2 trials conducted at the Creighton University Osteoporosis Research Center from 1997 to 2007. The first study, beginning in 1997, was a convenience sample of 64 healthy 9-year-old girls recruited from a metropolitan area and assigned to a calcium-rich diet or their usual diet. The following year, a similar cohort of 134 healthy girls were recruited and randomized to 1 of 3 groups: a calcium-rich diet with weight-bearing exercise, usual diet with weight-bearing exercise, and a control group asked to continue their usual diet and exercise patterns. The ethnic distribution of the participants was fairly homogenous; 97% of the study population was non-Hispanic white. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and every 3 months for 10 years in study 1 and for 8 years in study 2. For the purposes of this study, data on nutrient intake from food sources were collected and analyzed during the times when the participants were 14 to 19 years of age, considered the years of potential pregnancy. Institutional review board approval was obtained at both participating institutions.</p>
<p>Nutrient intake from food sources was assessed from 3-day diet records completed for 2 week days and 1 weekend day. The participants and their parents were instructed by a registered dietitian to record measured amounts of food and report brand names when reporting dietary intake. The agreement between observed and reported intakes from 3-day food records in young girls has been documented and was selected as the best overall choice for diet intake collection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412459343">10</xref></sup> Food records were analyzed by a registered dietitian using the Food Processor Nutrition and Fitness software (version 7.8, ESHA Research, Salem, OR, 2001). Folate intake analyzed in the database included total folate naturally occurring in food and folic acid fortification of food products (folate = folic acid + food folate), according to the manufacturer.</p>
<sec id="section3-1941406412459343">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Nutrient intake information that was collected at 4 time points during the year was averaged for each year of age. Descriptive statistics and plots of the mean (±2 standard errors) were used to display the change in nutrient intake values across the study period. The nutrient intake values observed over time were considered as repeated measures and fit with a linear mixed-effect model to evaluate the change in nutrient intake between any 2 visits while accounting for the within-subject correlation of repeated measures. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. The proportion of the population with a nutrient intake below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for nutrients with an established EAR value was calculated and used as the measure of nutrient adequacy. For nutrients without an EAR, such as omega-3 fatty acids, intakes were descriptively compared with the adequate intake (AI) level. All data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.2, 1998 SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Vitamin D Intake</title>
<p>There was no change in vitamin D intake as the girls increased in age from 14 to 19 years (<italic>P</italic> = .18). The mean vitamin D intake for girls 14 to 18 years old was 169.29 international units (IU)/d (95% confidence interval [CI] = 150.98-187.60). The EAR for vitamin D established in 2010 is 400 IU/d, and this number was used for the calculation of percentage below the EAR. Regardless of assignment to a high-calcium or control group, the vast majority of participants did not meet the EAR for vitamin D at any point in time as they increased in age from 14 to 19 years, with 94% to 100% of the population having intakes below the EAR during their adolescent years.</p>

<title>PUFAs: Omega-3 and Omega-6</title>
<p>Mean intake of omega-6 was 4.6 g/d (95% CI = 4.4-4.9), and mean intake of omega-3 in girls aged 14 to 19 years was 0.49 g/d (95% CI = 1.46-0.52). PUFA intake did not change as the girls increased in age (<italic>P</italic> = .17 and 0.23 for omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, respectively). Because an EAR has not been established for either omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids, the AI level was used for comparison. The AI for omega-6 fatty acids is 11 g/d and that for omega-3 fatty acids is 5 g/d. At no point in time did the median intake of omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids meet the AI, and at several points in time, intake of these fatty acids was less than half of the AI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most studies evaluating nutrient intake are cross-sectional in nature. The longitudinal scope of this study gives valuable information regarding intakes of key nutrients associated with pregnancy outcomes in adolescents who have the potential to become pregnant and who have documented low rates of prenatal care. This study demonstrates inadequate intakes of key nutrients that are related to pregnancy outcomes in a population of adolescents with the potential to become pregnant. Poor nutrition habits prior to conception may make it unlikely for these adolescents to meet the increased nutrient demands of pregnancy, and the poor baseline nutrient status on conception may affect the potential pregnancy outcome. Because two thirds of the pregnancies in this population are unplanned,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412459343">8</xref></sup> this population of adolescents is unlikely to be taking a prenatal vitamin prior to conception to prevent nutrient deficiencies in the preconception period. Yeung et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412459343">11</xref></sup> in an analysis of NHANES data to determine the contribution of supplements to folic acid intakes, found that whereas 26% of children and adolescents had supplemental folic acid intake from vitamins, in the 14- to 18-year-old age group, this number decreased to 19%, making it clear that supplementation initiated in childhood decreases into the adolescent years. Other NHANES data have repeatedly demonstrated that supplementation rates in adolescents are low. In 1999-2002 NHANES data, rates of dietary supplement use was the lowest among adolescents 14 to 18 years old, at 26%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412459343">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412459343">13</xref></sup> and in NHANES 2003-2006, vitamin and mineral supplementation in girls 14 to 19 years old was the lowest of any reported female group, at 19%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412459343">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine released the “Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D” in November 2010, establishing an EAR, which is defined as intake sufficient to meet the needs of 50% of the North American population, and the recommended dietary allowance (RDA), which is defined as intake that is sufficient to meet the needs of 97.5% of the North American population. For vitamin D, these values were set at 400 and 600 IU/d, respectively, for all age groups except infants younger than 1 year and adults older than 71 years. Bone health was the outcome considered for the establishment of the recommendations. However, because current evidence suggests that vitamin D insufficiency increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, adolescent women have become an important demographic to study.</p>
<p>Studies consistently demonstrate that maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy leads to infant vitamin D deficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412459343">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412459343">15</xref></sup> with many repercussions for the infant, both skeletal and nonskeletal in nature. Infants of vitamin D–</p>
<p>deficient mothers show conditions consistent with rickets, including splaying of the distal metaphysic of the femur and the presence of craniotabes in utero and at birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412459343">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412459343">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412459343">16</xref></sup> These deficits persist into the first decade of life, with a decrease in bone mineral content at 9 years of age in children whose mothers were vitamin D deficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412459343">2</xref></sup> Inadequate vitamin D intake by the mother during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412459343">1</xref></sup> increased odds of having a cesarean section,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412459343">17</xref></sup> increased risk of preeclampsia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412459343">18</xref></sup> and increased risk of asthma in the offspring later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412459343">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412459343">6</xref></sup> Milk and vitamin D intake during pregnancy have been associated with infant birth weight independent of other factors, with each additional microgram of vitamin D (40 IU) associated with an 11 g increase in birth weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412459343">19</xref></sup> Other studies have shown that infants born to vitamin D–deficient mothers are more likely to be classified as growth restricted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412459343">20</xref></sup> and have lower birth weight and 1-minute APGAR scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412459343">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vitamin D occurs naturally in very few foods. The main source of dietary vitamin D is from foods that have been fortified, including milk and some milk products, some juice and breakfast cereals, and even margarine. Estimation of vitamin D intakes of the population are available through NHANES data; however, dietary intakes of vitamin D were not available in the continuous 1999-2004 NHANES because of incomplete values in food composition tables. NHANES 2005-2006 intakes of vitamin D data have been released, and these data have been analyzed to provide national estimates of intake of vitamin D and compare them with levels from 1997. In adolescent girls 14 to 18 of age, only 32% had an intake of vitamin D (from food or supplements) that exceeded the AI at that time, which was 200 IU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412459343">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412459343">23</xref></sup> Moore et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412459343">23</xref></sup> in 2005 documented that the lowest intakes of vitamin D are in female teenagers and women; only half of teenage girls had an intake that met the AI of 200 IU at that time.</p>
<p>The suboptimal vitamin D intake may in part be a result of decreased consumption of milk products and increased consumption of caffeinated beverages. The participants in our study did show a trend toward increasing caffeine consumption as they aged (<italic>P</italic> = .06), and previous studies have demonstrated that high intakes of soft drinks, fruit juice, and ice tea are associated with increased odds of vitamin D deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412459343">24</xref></sup> Vitamin D requirements in this age group can also be met through adequate exposure to sunlight. There are several factors that can interfere with this, including skin pigmentation, sunscreen use, and geographical location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412459343">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increased intakes of PUFA during pregnancy and lactation have been associated with improvement in mental development of the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412459343">7</xref></sup> A meta-analyses of PUFA supplementation in women with high-risk pregnancies reported a reduced risk of early preterm delivery (RR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.18-0.84).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412459343">26</xref></sup> Insufficient evidence exists for the establishment of an RDA for these nutrients; however, several agencies have established guidelines for intake. The Food and Nutrition Board has established AI levels for both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. For girls 14 to 19 years old, the AI for omega-3 fatty acids as a-linolenic acid is 1.1 g/d. For omega-6 as linoleic acid, the AI for ages 14 to 18 years is 11 g/d, and for 19 years of age it is 12 g/d. The World Health Organization 2009 Expert Panel on fatty acids in human nutrition recommends for adults that 2% to 3% of the total energy intake is provided by linoleic acid (n-6) and 0.5% to 2.0% of total energy calories by n-3 PUFAs. For adult pregnant women, the minimum intake for adult health and infant development of 0.3 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid + DHA (both of which are omega-3 PUFAs) should consist of at least 0.2 g/d of DHA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412459343">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our findings confirm a suboptimal intake of PUFAs, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in a population of adolescent, nonpregnant girls. The intakes of PUFA in our population did not meet recommendations and are less than half of the AI values defined for this population. Studies of pregnant women in Mexico and Canada have found average linoleic acid intakes of 11.2 to 17.7 g/d and a-linolenic acid intakes of 1.5 to 1.6 g/d, intakes which would meet the United States AI guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412459343">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412459343">29</xref></sup> In these studies, even with higher intakes of PUFA omega-6 and omega-3s, the participants did not meet the goal for DHA intake. This raises significant concern about the DHA intake in a population consuming less than half of the AI for PUFAs. Unlike folate, it appears likely that initiation of supplementation of PUFA intake at any stage in pregnancy can at least partially make up for previously low intakes prior to conception and during early pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412459343">27</xref></sup> The knowledge that intakes of PUFAs in the population are routinely low is critical to assist health care practitioners in targeted nutrition interventions during prenatal counseling.</p>
<p>Folate and folic acid intake prior to conception and in the early stages of pregnancy significantly reduces the incidence of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, anencephaly, and encephalocele, all of which are associated with significant increases in morbidity and/or mortality. Folate is a type of B vitamin that occurs naturally in food and is found in green beans, peas, lettuce, orange juice, legumes, spinach and other greens, and organ meat. Folate functions as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfers in the metabolism of nucleic and amino acids. Folic acid, which is much more bioavailable than folate, is the oxidized form of folate that does not occur naturally in foods but can be commonly found in supplements. According to the RDA, the recommended daily dose of folic acid for women of childbearing age (15-44 years) is 400 µg/d beginning 3 months before conception and continuing throughout the first trimester. In 1998, the US food supply was fortified with 430 to 1400 µg of folic acid per pound of fortified food because of the fact that only 29% of US women of childbearing age were taking a supplement containing 400 µg of folic acid. This fortification was expected to add approximately 100 µg of folic acid to the average person’s diet. A 19% reduction in neural tube defects resulted from this mandatory folic acid fortification of the US food supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412459343">30</xref></sup>; however, approximately 2500 infants with neural tube defects are still born annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412459343">31</xref></sup> This analysis was conducted after mandatory fortification of grain products with folate. Although it has been shown that folate intakes increased after mandatory supplementation, our data show that intakes still remain below recommended levels, and at some ages, intake of folate is less than half of the RDA. Even though folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age, national data have shown that it is unlikely that this population will be taking a multivitamin supplement. In addition, because of the possibility of stigma associated with teenage pregnancy, these young women may be less likely to seek prenatal health care early in the first trimester, which is the critical period of neural tube development.</p>
<p>As a whole, this age group is less likely to have planned pregnancies and therefore may be less likely to begin prenatal vitamins in the preconception period or to seek prenatal care early in the pregnancy. Stigmas or fear of the reaction of family and friends may also cause a delay in seeking prenatal care.</p>
<p>This study has several weaknesses. All dietary intakes are self-reported, and information on intake from any dietary supplements is not available in these participants. In addition, the increase in folic acid as a result of supplementation of grain products after it become mandatory may not have been completely accurate because of delays in updating the database by the manufacturer. Although information on folic acid from food sources is available, the manufacturer included it under the “folate” field in the database, making it impossible to calculate folic acid equivalents and account for the increased bioavailability of folic acid compared with folate.</p>
<p>The sample size is small and limited to a region of primarily Caucasian girls. In addition, although the sample size of each age group is relatively stable from the time the participants were 14 to 17 years old, the small sample size of women aged 18 (33% of the original cohort is available) and 19 years (29% of the original cohort is available) is small. However, despite this attrition at the end of the study, the homogeneous nature of the population may make the remaining participants a representative sample. Biomarkers of adequacy, such as 25(OH)D levels for vitamin D status, were not available.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Future Direction</title>
<p>This study provides evidence that midwest adolescent girls with childbearing potential have inadequate intakes of nutrients that may affect the outcome of pregnancy and may be at increased risk for suboptimal outcomes should they become pregnant. Dietary intakes alone are not currently adequate to meet the recommended intakes. Health care practitioners should be aware of inadequate intakes and provide nutrition counseling and targeted nutrition intervention in this at-risk population to ensure that nutrient intake is adequate to maximize the potential for optimal pregnancy outcomes. Public health professionals should be aware of the need to incorporate health and nutrition education into outreach</p>
<p>programs that affect this age group, including school lunch requirements and food security programs.</p>
<p>Future research should be conducted on a population that is more racially and ethnically diverse. Disparities in health care outcomes may lead to a higher proportion of adverse pregnancy events, such as prematurity, in other ethnic populations. It is likely that factors such as socioeconomic status and food insecurity may be having a profound effect on the intake of these nutrients in populations that were not included in this study.</p>
