<p>In this volume, competence is described and analyzed as a personal accomplishment that occurs as one occupies various organizational roles (from reporters and politicians to CEOs, HR staff and nurses). While the volume represents an eclectic mix of descriptions about competence, we can draw some timely conclusions. Since chapters skip from competence as evidenced via episodic enactments to inferred abilities demonstrated from completed actions, let us consider a selection of the latter first and follow with a selection of the former.</p>
<p>Some of the document-based chapters rely upon the researcher’s interpretation about behavior deemed competent. Meex and Verplaetse consider corporate mission statements, long known for illustrating organizational identities, as a place for recognizing organizational competence. To discern different aspects of organizational competence, they sort the statements into features of volition and ability, inarguably paramount in evidencing competence. Similarly, Scheepers examines organizational evidence for the use of the term competence within diversity action plans of the Flemish public administration. She finds descriptions advocating that individuals take responsibility for developing their own competences, concluding that these documents used the term competency as a way to publicly balance contradictory values and goals of diversity without stating exactly <italic>how</italic> they will be achieved. These chapters take written statements as evidence of author intention and infer authorial or organizational competence.</p>
<p>Another set of chapters straddles the fence between constructed texts and the conversations that prompted them. The political interview and editorial meeting conversations demonstrate competence by virtue of the role one plays. For instance, Tennerman illustrates the interplay between the interviewers’ skills (asking hard questions) and their goal to represent politicians’ words fairly (often impacting the politician’s ability to gain competency in the public’s eye). The politicians must balance institutional versus personal roles by their use of agency (in this analysis represented by pronoun usage: I, me or my). The chapter based on editorial floor conversations illustrates two journalists’ particularly adept display of professional competence. Van Hout and Van Praet’s analysis nicely bridges the written texts by deconstructing how writers speak about how they will construct their stories.</p>
<p>In contrast to mostly written textual evidence, two chapters stand noteworthy for dissecting interactional episodes. Roberts analyzes employee interviews and demonstrates how majority group members skillfully blend institutional and personal discourses to gain employment successfully. The second set of interviews she analyzed illustrates the failure of some ethnic minority group members, who she surmises have not been appropriately linguistically socialized, to demonstrate the proper agency and ‘reflexive self-awareness’ to gain managerial promotions. Based on these analyses, Roberts claims that using competence for hiring and promotion actually perpetuates inequality. Similarly, Pawlack postulates subtle differences between nurse and family-member translators. Family members went to great lengths to create understanding (even for terms with which they had little familiarity). However, it was the difference between the nurse-translator who focused more on the potential procedure (opening up a space for acquiescence) and the family-member who used declaratives, relating what the doctor was in fact going to do, that revealed the subtle competence nurses display.</p>
<p>Overall, each chapter contributes something to our understanding of competence within organizations (aside from Mautner’s chapter, which presents critical theoretical claims about religious institutions without any supporting discourse evidence). Given the range of topics in the volume, the editors missed the opportunity to help readers sort through the implications of diversely demonstrated organizational competence. The introductory chapter alludes to the broad range of competence definitions, yet the editors failed to organize the chapters into any sensible groupings. One useful organizational scheme would have been to divide the volume into sections based on chronology: from the organization’s inception and the writing of a mission statement, to hiring employees and everyday moments on the job, to marketing the organization to external stakeholders. In these ways, we could recognize competence as it spans a professional or organizational lifecycle.</p>
<p>The authors nuance individual performance features, rarely describing competence as a jointly-produced interactional accomplishment. While three chapters use interactional data, in the final analysis competence is relegated to an individual or role category. We are left learning only about competence as a personal and not an interactional accomplishment. Within the everyday work of organizations, competence must be recognized as the ability to coordinate actions to achieve common goals. Discourse analyses promise to shed light on how interactants jointly create meaning from utterances, gestures and documents. Just how interactional competency is constructed and how we use discourse as a means of coordinating joint actions is very important, but not illustrated here.</p>
<p>Although two chapters briefly address ‘negative’ competence, competence is mostly shown as observable behavior. Missing are organizational practitioners who comment on what is <italic>not</italic> displayed (or violated) through their sanctions. Taken for granted among members, organizational competence becomes accountable when called into question in the public realm. Interestingly, most of the occupations included entail public displays: government offices, politicians and their journalists. In these scenes, competence is always a question to be determined. Another moment when competence is questioned is when a newcomer appears on the scene. Newcomers such as ethnic minorities or those undergoing a new medical procedure provide personal moments when organizational rules or strongly held beliefs for how competence should be displayed come to the fore. For these reasons, this volume provides an entrée, but not the definitive statement.</p>
<p>Perhaps this volume tells us more about the inconsistent and contradictory ways organizations use competency terminology and its inferences to achieve their goals while leaving the onus on individual workers to ‘achieve more equality’ by continuing to develop their own competencies. We may conclude that the shift to competency-based hiring and promotion show that the promise of equality is not being achieved through organizational actions.</p>
