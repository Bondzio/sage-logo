<abstract>
<p>Dreamwork is usually associated with long-term psychotherapy or intensive group work, but it can also be highly effective in short-term counseling when a dream encapsulates an ongoing problem in a client’s life. The transactional analysis literature on dreams is briefly summarized, and relevant research is cited from the growing field of dream studies. Dreamwork can be particularly effective in dealing with recurring nightmares, as shown in a case example. A mature woman sought help to overcome a long-term pattern of sleep disturbance caused by a recurring nightmare in which she was attacked. The problem was resolved by using the nightmare to change her script.</p>

<p>The use of dreams as a significant component of healing and guidance has had a checkered history in the West, ranging from the ancient healers in the Australian Dreamtime to healer-priests in the Greek temples of Asklepios, through the mystic saints in the Catholic Church to the emergence of psychoanalysis in Europe in the early twentieth century. By the middle of the 1900s, Carl Jung and his followers had greatly expanded on Freud’s theories, and by the 1970s, most of the new therapies, including gestalt, psychodrama, psychosynthesis, and even cognitive therapy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0362153713486108">Beck, 2004</xref>), were developing their own characteristic approaches to working with dreams. In the 1980s, trauma studies added a new understanding of the origins of nightmares, and the last 2 decades have brought new insights about sleep and dreams from neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>Although transactional analysis did not develop a specific approach to dreaming, many of its practitioners, from Berne onward, have incorporated a certain amount of dreamwork through their knowledge of other therapies (mainly gestalt). I believe transactional analysts could benefit from using dreamwork in their practice as a way of quickly reaching the core issues of script. Repetitive nightmares not only reveal wounding in the psyche but also, if not promptly attended to, continue to reinforce the image of self as a victim.</p>
<p>A word about counseling and psychotherapy: In actual practice, there is considerable overlap between the two approaches, even though the ITAA has chosen to define them as separate fields. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0362153713486108">Tilney (1998</xref>) described the difference as being “in the level of intrapsychic restructuring involved: ‘counselling’ consisting mainly of a restructuring of currently available resources while ‘psychotherapy’ involves deeper level interventions to make additional resources available” (p. 21). Dreamwork seems to operate across the interface between the two levels. Dreaming itself, including nightmares, is a natural process during which conscious events trigger emotional responses that reach back into previous experiences. In this article on nightmares, I concentrate on the client’s need for immediate alleviation of distress allied to a conscious restructuring of script beliefs based in early childhood.</p>
<sec id="section1-0362153713486108">
<title>Eric Berne and His Followers</title>
<p>To summarize briefly Eric Berne’s use of dreamwork, when he wrote his first book in 1947, <italic>The Mind in Action, </italic>he included a lively chapter on dreams from a Freudian perspective as well as a more speculative section on <italic>physis</italic> (Berne, 1947/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0362153713486108">1968</xref>, pp. 98-102) as the force of nature for creative growth and healing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486108">Bowater and Sherrard (1999</xref>) linked the energy of physis with the source of dreams.</p>
<p>After his first book, Berne scarcely mentioned dreams again until his last book,<italic> What Do You Say After You Say Hello? </italic>(1972/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713486108">1988</xref>), yet he apparently continued to use them, if only as diagnostic indicators of life script. In Chapter 9 of <italic>Hello</italic> (pp. 172-175), he described a number of script-set dreams, that is, dreams that reveal the dreamer’s fantasy-image of the world in which he or she lives (p. 174). One woman dreamed of “living in a concentration camp which was run by some rich people who lived up on the hill,” an accurate metaphor of life with her husband’s parents. Another one had a recurring nightmare of holding onto the walls in a sloping tunnel with enemies at each end, which dramatically portrayed her reluctance to find a way out of her real-life dilemma. And another client sardonically described by Berne “lived her script life crunched up on a small ledge on the face of a sheer cliff. She had a portable cliff that she carried with her wherever she went” (p. 175). Although Berne did not describe precisely how he worked with these dreamers, the indication is that he challenged them to find a way out of their life script dilemmas.</p>
<p>Subsequent transactional analysts such as Muriel James and Robert and Mary Goulding used dreamwork as part of their transactional analysis group therapy programs, incorporating gestalt action techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0362153713486108">Goulding &amp; Goulding, 1979</xref>, pp. 196-197; James &amp; Jongeward, 1971/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0362153713486108">1996</xref>, pp. 246-247). There was also a useful article by George Thomson in the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0362153713486108">1987</xref> on “Redecision Work with Dreams.” In it he described how a group member who had dreamed she was stuck in the midst of busy traffic whizzing past her was encouraged to symbolically enact a resolution. After that article there was not much more specifically about dreamwork in the transactional analysis literature for over a decade.</p>
<p>Then in 1999 I began writing a series of short articles, two of them cowritten with Evan Sherrard (1999 and 2011), advocating that transactional analysts use dreamwork as a continuing part of their work, whether in psychotherapy or counseling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486108">Bowater and Sherrard (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713486108">Bowater (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486108">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713486108">2009</xref>) specifically addressed the value of using nightmares for diagnosis and script change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0362153713486108">Bowater (2003</xref>) provided an overview of applying transactional analysis to clients’ dreams and described how a client, in the context of a supportive group, used two dreams—one a lifelong recurring dream, the other a brief vision—to achieve dramatic script change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486108">Bowater, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0362153713486108">Bowater and Sherrard (2011</xref>) also reviewed some ethical concerns relating to the use of dreams in the course of therapy. These articles have presented clear examples of the use in dreamwork of close listening, OK relationships, ego states, Adult reflection on metaphor, conscious and unconscious processes, script analysis, physis, autonomy, and redecision work. Elements of Jungian theory, gestalt, and psychodrama have also been incorporated.</p>

<title>Dream Research</title>
<p>Throughout these years, research on dreaming has continued apace, particularly fostered by the multidisciplinary International Association for the Study of Dreams and disseminated through their conferences and publications (see www.asdreams.org). Their quarterly academic journal, <italic>Dreaming,</italic> is now published by the American Psychological Association and draws articles from researchers around the world. Landmark books such as <italic>Trauma and Dreams </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713486108">Barrett, 1996</xref>) and <italic>Dreaming: An Introduction to the Science of Sleep </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0362153713486108">Hobson, 2002</xref>) have made major contributions to our understanding of how dreams work. Evolutionary psychology has also contributed threat simulation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0362153713486108">Revonsuo, 2004</xref>), which identifies a positive value in nightmares as opportunities for the dreamer to practice new ways of handling any threat to physical or emotional survival. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486108">Barrett and McNamara (2007</xref>) recently edited a valuable three-volume collection of articles by the leading researchers in the field entitled <italic>The New Science of Dreaming</italic>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0362153713486108">Hill (2004</xref>) developed with her students a fully tested cognitive-experiential model as described in her textbook <italic>Dream Work in Therapy</italic>.</p>
<p>Particularly interesting has been research demonstrating the direct relevance of dreaming to issues of daily life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0362153713486108">Domhoff (2007</xref>) summarized in Barrett and McNamara, major laboratory studies reveal</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>that dreams are overwhelmingly about everyday settings, people, activities and events…with only a relatively small amount of bizarreness.… Detailed analyses of lengthy dream journals. reveal the consistency of specific dream elements (for example, characters, types of social interactions, and themes) over months, years, and decades, which supports the idea that dreams are coherent and meaningful.… Many aspects of dream content are continuous with waking conceptions and concerns. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since dreaming occurs every night in normal sleep, anyone keeping a dream journal over time soon discovers that the more vivid dreams reflect aspects of our emotional experience that may be puzzling, disturbing, or even humorous and usually involve some form of metaphor or parallel story, as if the dream is highlighting something that does not fit the dreamer’s current frame of reference. In fact, a recent article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0362153713486108">Ruggeri, Mosca, and Zei (2011</xref>) was based on examining all 130 dreams of a client in therapy for 3 years and concluded that all of her dreams showed elements of problem solving, confirming a widely held theory of dreams as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486108">Barrett (2001</xref>) in<italic> The Committee of Sleep</italic>. Hartmann’s (1998/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0362153713486108">2001</xref>) comprehensive <italic>Dreams and Nightmares: The Origin and Meaning of Dreams </italic>went so far as to suggest that during REM sleep, when chemical controls are relaxed, “the nets of the mind” are opened wider to allow “a broadening of memory through cross-connections, an increase in connections, a weaving in of new experience” (p. 14). Thus, any form of intensive reflection, such as counseling, will stimulate the dreaming mind to make its own contribution.</p>
<p>This is also my experience with clients. As we work consciously with current life problems, the client’s dreams are also at work bringing up memories and fears, creating metaphors and stories, challenging the limits of inadequate beliefs, even raising possible solutions. I have learned to ask for dreams from the start of my work with all clients and to pay particular attention to recurring dreams. I find that dreams quickly reach the heart of client issues. Even if there is little time to explore a dream report, a counselor can catch the essential theme by noticing what the dream ego is doing and feeling, that is, whether it is active or passive, timid or courageous, Victim or Persecutor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0362153713486108">Karpman, 1968</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0362153713486108">
<title>Recurring Nightmares</title>
<p>An area that I think needs urgent attention by counselors and therapists of all kinds is the detrimental impact of repetitive nightmares, not only because of their influence on the dreamer’s self-image as a continual Victim but also for the disruption of healthy sleep, which then begins to undermine physical health. In the worst cases, people become so fatigued that their ability to function in complex work, or even to drive safely, is compromised. Sleep deprivation is a serious public health issue, already being addressed in some countries through legislation to limit hours of concentrated work without regular breaks (e.g., for long-haul drivers). A friend of mine, driving a long distance at night, described how she hallucinated a mammoth blocking the road in front of her, which forced her to stop the car and wake up!</p>
<p>A fuller example is that a year ago, a young woman in another city contacted me via my Web site in desperation after she had gone to sleep at the wheel of her car and crashed it. She was sleep deprived because of chronic nightmares. After I had clarified her situation by e-mail, I offered some simple guidelines, which were enough to help her to stop the nightmares within a week. I especially encouraged her to practice consciously taking an active role in the dream stories and to stop being passively bullied. She had already had long-term counseling but had not addressed her nightmares in that context. She was actually delighted to discover that she could use the dream scenarios as stories for which she could create new endings, and she put that idea into action straight away! The immediate reward was better sleep, which gave her more energy, thus setting up a positive cycle of change. Whether or not she resumes counseling, better sleep will improve her health and general resilience.</p>
<p>I understand nightmares, and other bad dreams, to be symptoms, like physical pain in the body, that draw our conscious attention to serious unresolved issues in the dreamer’s life. A nightmare typically wakes the dreamer at a point of terror, horror, or helplessness, not knowing how to obtain help, a classic Victim state. When this is repeated night after night, the dreamer’s emotional state as a Victim is constantly reinforced. To move out of it, the dreamer needs to apply conscious Adult thinking to the dilemma, supported by protection from the Parent, as transactional analysts know from working with the drama triangle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0362153713486108">Karpman, 1968</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0362153713486108">Choy’s (1990)</xref> useful model of the winner’s triangle.</p>
<p>When the cause is identified as exposure to traumatic violence—such as war, disaster, crime, an accident, or excessive punishment—sharing the experience with one or more sympathetic others will usually release the worst emotions fairly rapidly, and the fact will be emphasized that the dreamer has survived, with life ahead. But when the cause is disenfranchised grief about a hidden loss—such as an undeclared relationship breakdown or family shame or incest—or the dreamer simply has no one to trust, the nightmares may continue unresolved and the dreamer becomes resigned to them, living with debilitating reminders of loss, fear, or shame. Respect and sensitivity are needed in responding to the dreamer’s intense emotions, and where necessary, time may need to be given to establish a sense of safety before the person can open up about a traumatic nightmare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0362153713486108">
<title>A Simple Intervention</title>
<p>A basic principle can be applied by any good friend, or a counselor, to relieve the immediate effects of a nightmare or disturbing dream. Having listened to the story line, you ask the dreamer what could he or she do next to survive the situation, or at least to mitigate the impending harm. In other words, you encourage the person to bring Adult consciousness to bear on the problem in its symbolic form and to begin to imagine a new ending, thus creating a new neural pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486108">Arden, 2010</xref>). Because the nightmare is often a metaphor for a real-life dilemma, actively imagining a new ending may break through an internal impasse. Even the certainty of death can be transcended, as I have shown in my work with a 94-year-old man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486108">Bowater, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Here are some simple examples from my own practice.</p>
<sec id="section5-0362153713486108">
<title>The Ambassador</title>
<p>Joseph, an 83-year-old retired teacher, presented a series of dreams in which he seemed to give up before completing a task. In the most striking one, he was an ambassador to the United Nations, designated to speak against a foreign nation that wanted to use an enormously destructive petrol bomb. He wanted to tell them bluntly to stop because it was wrong, but he realized that this would have no effect and stayed silent. Discussing the dream, he realized that an ambassador is tasked with speaking up as a trusted representative of his people and that he might still be able to influence some of the foreign delegates, if not the more powerful leaders. Challenged to continue the dream story, he decided to speak his point of view anyway and observed that there were one or two nods among those on the other side, so he knew he had been heard. This was a revelation to Joseph, who then created new endings for his other dreams and began to let go of his old script belief that “I’m not important.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0362153713486108">
<title>The Chasm</title>
<p>Alison, at 65, had become physically disabled but wanted to complete a big creative project that she had begun. In her dream, she was stranded halfway up a mountain, facing a dangerous crossing along a fallen tree trunk over a deep chasm. She could see it was too hard for her, but she had no energy to go farther up or down, so she was stuck. Alison thought she had only the choice to go forward, risking her life, or to give up the goal. Further thought revealed that she could call for help, take a rest for a while, or search for a less difficult path up the mountain. She visibly relaxed as she let go of her driver to “Be strong,” allowed herself to take care of her needs, and proceeded at her own pace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0362153713486108">
<title>The Death Cloud</title>
<p>Rhys, a professional man of 60, had had a terrifying nightmare at intervals all his life. In it he found himself in a strange place, saw a dark cloud coming, and knew that he was about to be put to death. He always woke shaking with fear, which often contributed to poor sleep and affected him all day. No efforts to go into the dream had helped him before. Since the nightmare had begun early in his life, we explored some of his early experiences and discovered that he had been hospitalized at age 2 and again at 4, without support from his parents because that was considered a better approach in those days. Of course, that had left him alone in terror. This realization made absolute sense to him and removed the fear of something demonic, although it also gave him no escape from the memory. How could he change the ending? As he turned it over in his mind, he hit on a novel solution: If the nightmare repeated, he would simply exit his body! And when the nightmare did come back a few days later, he saw the cloud of doom approaching and told himself he could leave his body. The death cloud disappeared and he woke without fear, even deliberately repeating the experience to be sure it was real. Months later, the nightmare has not returned, the terror has gone, his sleep has improved, and he feels as if he is no longer afraid of death. The nightmare had encapsulated a buried trauma from a preverbal stage of his life, linked with a fear of death.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, the clients generated their own metaphor in a dream that expressed the dilemma; used their Adult ego state, with Parent permission, to find a solution that fit; visualized (and felt) the new ending to the dream; and felt greatly relieved as a result. Newly empowered, they carried the method forward to apply to other dreams and dilemmas in their lives. In transactional analysis terms, this is a simple form of redecision work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0362153713486108">Goulding &amp; Goulding, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>I have since discovered articles and books by Barry Krakow, a cognitive therapist and leading specialist in sleep disorders. He advocates teaching nightmare sufferers to change the dream in any way they like, regardless of meaning, in order to break the habitual pattern and reactivate healthy mental imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0362153713486108">Krakow &amp; Neidhardt, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0362153713486108">Krakow (2004</xref>) trains nightmare sufferers to do systematic imagery rehearsal to gain confidence in breaking the old habit. While I think that this process is a good start, I suggest a closer alignment with the story of the dream to bring about a deeper resolution. For example, Rhys had tried many ways to dismiss or go into his recurring nightmare, without success. When he realized that it was actually based on early childhood trauma, he intuitively chose the child’s only defense: dissociation. This made sense to his now well-developed Nurturing Parent. Joseph had been a teacher, a role in which he was expected to speak out. The context of both his life and his dream demanded that he find a reason to speak, rather than give up or imagine some irrelevant adventure to distract him.</p>

<title>Mattie’s Fighting Dream</title>
<p>Mattie, aged 69, came to me on the recommendation of a friend and with her doctor’s support. My Web site carries basic information about my values and my approach to both psychotherapy and counseling, including dreamwork. She had funding for only 10 sessions, so we needed to use our time especially effectively. She brought a note from her adult daughter, who wrote that her mother’s nightmares were getting worse. “Most of the time it is terrified screaming, sometimes angry burbled yelling.… I know that she has lunged out of bed before and has seriously injured herself, and this is very worrying.… I don’t believe she has had a good solid night’s sleep for years.”</p>
<p>Mattie was a dignified, well-spoken woman of mixed Pasifika, Maori, and European descent, recently retired with honor from a social work position. She lived alone but was in close contact with her daughter, whom she had raised on her own since leaving her alcoholic husband when the child was 6. Having been raised in the Catholic faith, she expressed strong values of honesty and caring but also a degree of self-discounting. I liked her, and she seemed ready to trust me.</p>
<sec id="section9-0362153713486108">
<title>Dream Report: Fighting an Attacker</title>
<p>Mattie described being constantly terrified by nightmares about an unknown man attacking her. She would throw herself around, trying to get away from him, yelling at him to “Get away, leave me alone!” But she did not remember particular details, only the recurring state of terror, which would wake her up.</p>
<p>She dreaded the nightmares, which started soon after she went to sleep, and she would awaken several times a night and go to the toilet, trying to prevent more dreams. This had been going on for years but was not helping. She had resigned herself to the situation, not knowing what else to do. She was on medication for anxiety and high blood pressure, smoked 10 cigarettes a day, but did not drink alcohol. She wanted to be free of the nightmares and to sleep in peace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0362153713486108">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>The fact that the nightmares were so intense, persistent, lacking in story, and came early in the night fit the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713486108">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). The violent physical movement signaled a nightmare disorder, again a symptom of high stress. I considered the lack of good-quality sleep a real threat to her health and in need of urgent attention.</p>
<p>I explained the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle to her and that it was not harmful for her to have brief wakings in a natural rhythm about every 1.5 hours during the night, as long as she settled back again to sleep. This was a relief to her. I asked what stresses she faced in her life. None, she said; it was all peaceful now.</p>
<p>But her dreams portrayed her trying to get away from a persistent male attacker, with a childlike level of terror. So I asked about her childhood, and she told me an unhappy story. Her mother had died a week after she was born, and there was conflict among the relatives over who would look after the baby. Dad, although an alcoholic, had decided to keep the baby with him and his mother for the first 2 years. Mattie had a Maori grandmother, whose loving care must have given the little girl a good, stable start. Then Dad married again, at which point Mattie began being raised by a European stepmother and subjected to constant emotional and physical abuse, including humiliation for being blacker than her younger half-siblings. She dreaded the frequent hidings from both parents and tried to please them both. They trained her thoroughly never to argue or fight back. At school, however, she did well and aimed to become a nurse.</p>
<p>Then she married a violent alcoholic man who also beat her and sexually abused her within the marriage. She endured this for 7 years. So, both of the men closest to her had physically attacked her.</p>
<p>This sounded like the source of the terror evident in her nightmares. Yes, she said, surprised to see the pattern. She added that she had never told anyone about this before, even her daughter, because she wanted to protect her child. She also never again wanted to get into a close relationship with a man. Telling her story, she could now see how seriously she had been abused. I commended her on her strength in getting herself and her daughter out of the marriage and raising her on her own. In fact, Mattie struck me as a woman of considerable courage and strength.</p>
<p>By now we had used up the first therapy hour. I asked her to keep a journal of her thoughts and dreams for the week and to practice consciously imagining new endings for her nightmares, although I did not have time to coach her. In fact, she already knew the ending she wanted: She wanted the attacker to go away!</p>

<p>In the second session, Mattie reported that she had slept much better and had awakened yelling only a couple of times. She also could not remember having any dreams! We were both pleased that the intensity of terror was rapidly reducing, thus giving her new hope. She had written a good deal more about her childhood memories and the amount of blame she had carried, assuming there must have been something wrong with her that made her deserve the constant punishment. I explored this with her, decontaminating her Adult, as she continued to unburden herself. I listened, validating her distress and anger.</p>
<p>We now understood the traumatic origin of the nightly terror she had experienced, but I still did not know why it had become so much worse in recent times, long after the original events. The answer emerged in the third session when she described how she had taken a boarder (no intimacy) into her rented house 10 years before out of compassion for his circumstances (he had a young child to care for). He was a Vietnam War veteran who turned out to be “an absolute bully” who constantly kept her up late at night telling her horror stories of his war traumas and demanding frequently that she type up letters about his case. She did not know how to resist him. When he flatly refused to move out of the house, Mattie and her daughter moved out, which was when the nightmares began again. He then helped her to obtain a job in social work, with clients whom she loved, but he worked in the same office, and he and his manager continued to bully her. She put up with it for 7 years, until she could not stand it any more and reluctantly resigned, 6 months before seeing me. However, her former boss still owed her for overtime she had worked, and she was still having nightmares and poor sleep.</p>
<p>Thus the bullying had reawakened the earlier traumas and stimulated the nightmares, which had become a habit, dreaded every night. The less sleep she got, the more anxious she became: a vicious cycle. And she still had not told anyone until she saw me. Telling was a great relief to her. The nightmares had achieved their purpose of bringing out the abused side of herself to be seen and heard at last. At the end of this third session, Mattie made a clear decision: “I will not be bullied any more.”</p>

<sec id="section12-0362153713486108">
<title>Ongoing Work</title>
<p>A week later she happily reported sleeping soundly with even less waking up, so her natural resilience was returning. She was even reducing her smoking. She did not need to fight off the attacker any more; she had won and he had given up the attack! She talked freely about her life, while I continued the process of decontamination, validating her healthy responses and quietly challenging her discounting of herself.</p>
<p>At the fourth session, only a month after starting, she reported that she had had no disturbing dreams at all and was becoming aware of pleasant dreams as she awoke in the morning.</p>
<p>In the next few sessions, we explored more of Mattie’s history, focusing on how she could learn to stand her ground assertively against bullying in the future, and this became the theme of our work for several more sessions. She was a keen learner and knew that she could stand up for others, so why not for herself? She practiced speaking her truth in chair work, wrote a letter to request the money she was owed, and found a potential part-time job. She was becoming more autonomous, more confident in being herself.</p>
<p>In the last session, we reflected on how quickly she had achieved these changes and agreed that a crucial factor must have been releasing the story of abuse she had carried unspoken all her life and finding that her buried grief and anger were actually valid. Telling her story, at last, to an empathic outsider gave her the opportunity for release, so much so that she gladly gave permission for me to use her story to help others. She was also a mature woman, self-reflective and ready for change, with an adult daughter (and her partner) who loved and supported her. Thank you, Mattie!</p>

<title>Reflection</title>
<p>For me it seemed essential that Mattie break the cycle of constant nightmares first so that she could have more restorative sleep to assist her in making other changes in her life. The theme of the nightmares gave strong clues as to their origin: the typical pattern of trying to defend herself against assault by a male figure. The level of terror suggested a child’s lack of power, so exploration of her family background was indicated. And this revealed that she had locked her story away inside herself, thus creating the posttraumatic stress disorder, with nightmares as the only safety valve.</p>
<p>The nightmares had reached such a level of intensity that she was thrashing around in her bed. Normally, REM sleep protects the body during dreaming by inhibiting the movement of the large muscles, thus creating a temporary state of paralysis. This condition is listed in the<italic> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713486108">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>, p. 580) as a <italic>nightmare disorder </italic>and is obviously dangerous to life and limb. Reducing stress is urgently needed. Researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0362153713486108">Fantini and Ferini-Strambi (2007</xref>) have referred to this syndrome as<italic> REM behavior disorder </italic>and have suggested, among other things, that it is characteristic of people who show little aggressiveness in daytime behavior, which was certainly true of Mattie.</p>
<p>Mattie’s scripting was not only based in her family of origin but also compounded by religious sexism and her social status as a woman of color in a European-dominant society. So her recovery could have taken much longer if her nightmare had not pinpointed the core issue so clearly and persistently: Stop abusing me! Moreover, the dream showed her engaged in the forbidden action: fighting the man. She had only to own the role and translate it into reality. But the heavily enforced parental scripting to be submissive in real life, to always be good, had blocked her way. In her sixties, the energy of physis within her was driving her to break out, and in a sense, my role as counselor was to give her the tools and unlock the door.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the examples described in this article, I have shown how it is possible to relieve rapidly the suffering of people who are troubled by recurring nightmares and other disturbing dreams by working directly with the information conveyed in the dreams. Not all dreams require deep analysis, and many dreamers can move on with healing themselves when given some basic guidelines and personal encouragement. Often a repetitive dream or theme pinpoints a specific issue that needs the dreamer’s conscious attention, and counselors should ask their clients for such indicators in the initial data gathering along with inquiring about their quality of sleep. I do not mean to imply that all of a client’s dreams are automatically relevant to the goals of counseling or that a lot of time should be spent exploring dreams. But in my experience, there is often a key dream theme that enables dreamer and counselor to focus quickly on the heart of the client’s disturbance.</p>
<p>I believe that counselors should ask their clients about dreams because many people do not realize their significance, may not even recall them, or may avoid reporting nightmares for fear of going “mad.” Counselors who have had no prior experience with dreamwork may need to attend a dream workshop and practice with a peer.</p>
<p>Dreamwork is also an empowering process for clients because they begin to realize that crucial insights come from within their own being. And as the counselor, I feel rewarded myself as I see the Aha! moment dawning on a client’s face.</p>
<p>I would like to let Eric Berne have the last word. Advising therapists in 1966, he quoted the old Latin medical slogan “Je le pensay, &amp; Dieu le guarit [I dressed it, &amp; God healed it],” adding dryly, “The therapist does not cure anyone, he only treats him to the best of his ability, being careful not to injure, and waiting for nature to take its healing course. There is no need for false humility, but only for facing the facts: we treat them, but it is God who cures them” (Berne, 1966/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0362153713486108">1994</xref>, p. 63).</p>
