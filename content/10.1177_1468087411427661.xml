<abstract>
<p>This article reviews experimental studies on deposits in engine combustion chambers, with emphasis on deposit composition, damage to engines, formation mechanisms and study methods. The existence of combustion chamber deposits will definitely influence performance and emissions of engines, and is inevitable with the use of petroleum fuel and lubricating oil. These all make it necessary to study the formation, composition, structure and influential factors of deposits, which will provide the basis for reducing deposits in engines. Influential factors and methods of reducing deposit formation are also included. First, the deposit damage to engines is briefly introduced, with a focus mainly on the decline in engine performance and the deterioration of emissions, and the reasons for these phenomena are explained. Next, conclusions on deposit research approaches to their chemical composition and physical structure are drawn. Finally, with regards to deposit formation in gasoline and diesel engines, deposit composition and factors influencing deposit formation, such as engine type, fuel type, oil type, additives, exhaust gas recirculation, etc., are enumerated through experimental studies on engines. Studies on deposit formation with some newly developed types of fuel are also included. The mechanism of deposit formation under these different conditions is explained, and the methods for reducing deposit formation are summarized.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The existence of combustion chamber deposits (CCDs) definitely influences the performance and emissions of engines, and is inevitable with the use of petroleum fuel and lubricating oil. The deposits may cause unfavorable effects on exhaust emissions in various ways. With regards to NOx emissions, the deposits tend to lead to increased emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411427661">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411427661"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411427661">3</xref></sup> Statistically, a significant increase is observed in NOx emissions with an increase in deposit thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411427661">4</xref></sup> The low thermal conductivity of deposits, especially non-volatile deposits such as ash, produces higher in-cylinder temperatures, thus leading to higher NOx emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411427661">1</xref></sup> Higher hydrocarbon (HC) emissions is also observed with an increase in engine deposits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411427661">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087411427661">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411427661"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087411427661">7</xref></sup> and extra HC emissions due to deposit accumulation accounts for 10–20% of the total HC emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411427661">8</xref></sup> CO emissions of engines can also be obviously influenced by the increase and decrease of deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411427661">6</xref></sup> Adsorption and desorption of hydrocarbons by the porous deposits are considered to be the major causes for the undesirable increase in HC emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411427661">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Engine performance can also be greatly affected by deposits. It is easy to understand that the existence of deposits will diminish the volume of the combustion chamber, which will lead to a change in the nominal compression ratio, thus influencing the normal combustion of engines. Uncontrolled surface ignition, resulting from deposit-created hot spots, can lead to knocking, run-on and rumble.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411427661">1</xref></sup> The heat regeneration and thermal insulation effects of deposits will also result in an increase of octane demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411427661">10</xref></sup> Another effect caused by the deposits in engines is diesel knock, whose tendency increases rapidly with deposit accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411427661">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, excessive deposits may impair engine performance, and even cause engine failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411427661">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087411427661"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411427661">14</xref></sup> For example, the excessive deposits in a piston ring groove may cause the piston rings to stick and may cause cylinder scoring. The flaked deposits from the combustion chamber may cause difficulties in start-up and poor drivability of engines.</p>

<title>Existence of deposits</title>
<p>Deposits are widely formed on the combustion chamber surfaces of various combustion devices, such as boilers, furnaces, burners and engines. This article mainly focuses on the deposits in the combustion chamber of internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>Deposits exist in engines once petroleum fuel and lubricating oil are used. For this reason, the study of engine deposits proceeds with the development of engine technologies. In 1925, Orelup studied the factors influencing carbon formation in engines, and took a picture of the deposits on the surface of the cylinder head. After that, many researchers in various countries conducted studies on the deposits. Kalghatgi wrote two reviews on the deposits in gasoline engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087411427661">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087411427661">16</xref></sup> Although some differences exist in the two reviews, deposit structure, properties, influencing factors of deposit formation and the ways to control deposit formation were included in both reviews. As for the composition of deposits, it is thought, in general, that inorganic substances, carbon granules and oxidized products of organics are the main components of the deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087411427661">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following early studies by Nishiwaki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087411427661">18</xref></sup> and Hayes et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087411427661">19</xref></sup> Nishiwaki and Hafnan investigated the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the deposits in diesel and gasoline engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411427661">20</xref></sup> One diesel engine with a stroke of 90 mm and a bore of 94 mm and one gasoline engine with a stroke of 79 mm and a bore of 66 mm were used to conduct the experiments.</p>
<p>The physical properties of deposits from gasoline and diesel engines in different parts are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087411427661">Table 1</xref>. The values in the table show the differences in deposits in different engine types and different positions in the engines. The differences between the physical properties of deposits from gasoline and diesel engines may arise from the difference in combustion chamber sizes, load, speed, fuel types and oil types. As for the volatility of deposits, Owrang showed that up to 50% of the deposits, formed inside a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine, consisted of volatiles, and the composition of the deposits was strongly related to the composition of the engine oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087411427661">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>Although formed in many parts of the engine, deposits formed on the piston top and the cylinder head surface attract the most attention because of their large influences on combustion through the increased compression ratio and increased surface temperature. Deposits on nozzles, piston ring grooves, piston lands and valves have also been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411427661">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087411427661">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087411427661">24</xref></sup> For example, Diaby et al. found that the deposits in the first ring grooves of the diesel engine investigated were mainly carbonaceous and resulted principally from the lubricant degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661">23</xref></sup> Haji-Sulaiman and Mat-Isa found that gasoline doped with a trace amount of used engine oil exhibited a high intake-valve deposit-forming tendency in their simulated study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087411427661">24</xref></sup> All these studies also showed that the lubricating oil played an important role in deposit formation.</p>
<p>The mechanism of deposit formation in the engine cylinders is quite complex. Many factors, such as the types of fuel and lubricating oil, in-cylinder gas temperature and pressure, cooling water temperature and the size of engines, govern the formation of deposits. For example, Eilts mentioned that an effective reduction of deposit formation is possible by increasing the compression ratio, the charge air and exhaust gas pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468087411427661">25</xref></sup> However, the thickness of deposits does not increase without limit, and reaches an equilibrium thickness after a long period of operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468087411427661">26</xref></sup> The reasons may arise from the evaporation, burning and degradation of deposits or flaking from the surface. When analyzing the disappearance of deposits, the most direct method is to refer to the results of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA curves of the deposits under oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres indicate that most of the deposits are evaporated, oxidized or burned because of the high temperature in the combustion chamber. Substances that are hard to oxidize or are not volatile accumulate on the surface of the combustion chamber, and thus deposits are formed. The remaining deposits can possibly flake off the surface of the combustion chamber,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411427661">14</xref></sup> thus achieving equilibrium of deposit loading.</p>

<p>The most direct and easiest method of deposit investigation is the photographic observation of deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468087411427661">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468087411427661"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468087411427661">29</xref></sup> Weighing the deposits directly scraped from the combustion chamber walls is also employed frequently.

<title>Deposit formation</title>
<p>Much research has been carried out on the formation and composition of deposits. Although the conclusions vary according to the conditions of the experiments, deposit formation is basically governed by the type of fuel and lubricating oil and the engine operating conditions. Research on deposit formation on diesel and gasoline engines is discussed briefly below.</p>
<p>For deposits in gasoline engines, Kalghatgi illustrated that the deposits formed in the engines and, as the deposits continued to grow and insulate the cooler metal substrate, the deposit surface temperature rose and deposit material of lower volatility and higher melting point could be observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087411427661">15</xref></sup> Zerda et al. suggested that the main cause of deposits formed in engines was the incomplete combustion of fuel and thermal cracking of the lubricating oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411427661">9</xref></sup> Price et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468087411427661">38</xref></sup> and Uehara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468087411427661">39</xref></sup> showed that aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons with higher flash points in fuels were the key components of deposits in the combustion chamber, and furthermore, deposits in engines were oxidative condensation polymers of aromatic hydrocarbons. For the formation process and its influencing factors, Cheng pointed out that a porous, solid crust was formed over the dense viscous liquid, on the bottom layer, causing the formation of a large thermal gradient between hot combustion gases and the cool metal surface of combustion chamber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468087411427661">40</xref></sup> Güralp et al. found that the thickness of deposits was closely related to surface temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468087411427661">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>For deposits in diesel engines, Eilts found that the combination of low wall temperature and unburned fuel causes more deposit formation in combustion chambers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468087411427661">25</xref></sup> Shurvell et al. thought that deposits or carbon deposits might be defined as a heterogeneous mixture made up of carbon residue (ash), carbonaceous mixtures (soot) and oxygenated resinous organic materials that bind together as mixtures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468087411427661">42</xref></sup> Gebhard et al. suggested that initial deposits on the cool chamber metal basement mainly consisted of volatile materials that were difficult to oxidize, with a low melting point and contained more carbon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468087411427661">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In diesel engines, new injection systems produce higher temperatures and pressures at the injector tips. This environment initiates deposit formation at and around the injector tip, which leads to significant power loss and increased smoke generation. Much research has been carried out on injector tip deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468087411427661">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468087411427661"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468087411427661">45</xref></sup> With the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD), there has been an ever escalating number of injector deposit incidents in high-pressure common rail (HPCR) fuel systems ( ≥ ∼1500 bar), causing deterioration in both performance and emissions. These deposits tend to be internal and are difficult to remove. Internal diesel injector deposits have become an issue in the field as both fuel and engine technologies have changed. Solubility appears to be the key to internal deposit formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468087411427661">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for the research methodology of deposit formation processes, test rig experiments simulating deposit formation in engine cylinders and engine experiments have been most widely used. Problems will arise when studying engines because of the particularity of the deposits. That is, deposits gathers on the surface of the combustion chamber, and engines must be dismantled to study deposits. On the one hand, a long operation time is required to obtain deposits with measurable thickness, and on the other hand, engines need to be disassembled after operation to collect the deposits, which will definitely influence engine performance in the next operation. Thus, an approximation method makes more sense to study deposits, e.g. a laboratory-scale deposition–corrosion apparatus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468087411427661">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>An indubitable advantage lies in experimental simulation methods, but real engine experiments can provide the properties of deposits more directly and exactly. Thus, more research on deposits is performed on engines, among which the influencing factors on deposit formation constitute the priority of concerns. Below, conclusions are drawn on typical deposit formation on gasoline and diesel engines, and then rules of deposit formation and methods for reducing deposits deformation can be acquired.</p>
<sec id="section13-1468087411427661">
<title>Diesel engine deposit formation</title>
<p>On diesel engines, the directly injected fuel sprays impinge against the combustion chamber walls, resulting in the formation of soot deposits that are unevenly distributed on the surface of the walls depending on the location of spray impingement.</p>
<sec id="section14-1468087411427661">
<title>Engine influence factors</title>
<p>It is easy to understand that engine conditions, combustion chamber geometrical shape and compression ratio, etc. will definitely influence the formation of deposits. These factors have been studied earlier, and a representative study was made by Eilts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468087411427661">25</xref></sup> When investigating the influencing factors of engine deposits, Eilts suggested that deposit formation could be reduced with increase of compression ratio, inlet air, exhaust gas pressure and the load, etc. The reason is that the deposits in the tests described in this work were probably formed mainly from fuel that had been deposited on the wall in the liquid state and evaporated incompletely, and higher temperatures will lead to less fuel deposited. However, with the development of engine technologies and the improvement of fuel and lubricating oil, some new influencing factors also emerge.</p>

<sec id="section15-1468087411427661">
<title>Influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)</title>
<p>EGR is widely used in engines with a notable contribution in reducing NOx emission. Yet, problems also arose with the increase of particulate matter (PM) emission, especially on deposit formation. Singh et al. investigated the influence of EGR on lubricating oil, and comparison was given on the influence of EGR on deposit formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468087411427661">27</xref></sup> A constant speed, two-cylinder, four-stroke, air cooled, direct-injection (DI), diesel engine (Indec PH2) of 9.7 kW rating coupled with an AC alternator was chosen for this experimental study. Experiments were conducted under normal operating conditions without EGR and with 25% EGR. Engine runs of 96 hours in each condition were completed in 16 test cycles, each of 6 hours, and photographs of the different investigated parts were taken.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411427661">Figure 7</xref> shows a comparison between deposits on the piston top with and without EGR, and a comparison between deposits on the cylinder head and injector tip are also given by Singh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468087411427661">27</xref></sup> It can be seen clearly that EGR will definitely aggravate the formation of deposits. The reason is that the lower combustion temperature and lower oxygen concentration in the flame enhance soot formation and slower soot oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468087411427661">48</xref></sup> It has been mentioned above that NOx emission will deteriorate with the increase of deposits. The non-volatile parts of the deposits, such as ash, produce higher in-cylinder temperatures, thus leading to higher NOx emissions. Thus, it makes sense to control the EGR rate within a reasonable range to realize low NOx emissions and deposit formation.</p>

<p>Distinctive conclusions can be drawn from this study that the usage of EGR will greatly increase the formation of deposits. If the formation of deposits with different ratios of EGR can be investigated and NOx emission results can be monitored, then it is indicative of choosing a proper EGR ratio to achieve a good balance between the emission and deposit formation.</p>

<title>Influence of fuel type</title>
<p>Diesel and gasoline are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. New combinations will lead to new types of fuel. The influence of fuel on deposit formation is also important with new types of fuel emerging. Tarkowski et al. studied the influence of fuel on deposit composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468087411427661">32</xref></sup> Two engines of Leyland type with similar time of running supplied with standard fuel (SO) and ecological fuel of city-diesel (C-D) type produced by Petrochemia Plock (Poland) were chosen to conduct the experiment. By analyzing the composition of deposits from the combustion chambers, the conclusion was made that deposits from the ecological fuel contained four to five times less iron compounds than the standard fuel, which accounted for a smaller attrition of the combustion chamber elements. It must be mentioned that chemical analysis, X-ray diffractograms, Mossbauer absorption and Raman wave-number were used in analyzing the deposits. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087411427661">Figure 8</xref> shows the results of X-ray diffractograms. It can be seen from the figure that the deposits from the engine supplied with improved fuel oil contains less iron, copper, chromium, vanadium and silicon oxides. In addition, the content of phosphorus and sulfur compounds is smaller. Actually, iron compounds in the deposits mainly come from the abrasion of engines. The increase and decrease of the iron compounds in the deposits are shown clearly in the figure. Thus, proper reformed fuel, for example, fuel with a lower T90 temperature, will lead to less deposit formation with decreasing abrasion of engines. Then, a number of benefits will arise from the improvement of fuel, such as lower emissions and better engine performance. Thus, the significance of fuel improvement is obvious.</p>

<title>Influence of lubricating oil</title>
<p>Lubricating oil plays an irreplaceable role in wear reduction and rust prevention in engines. Yet, it was found that lubricating oil also exerted an influence on the formation of deposits.</p>
<p>The influence of lubricating oil on the deposits was thoroughly investigated by Diaby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661">23</xref></sup> They found the influence of lubricating oil degradation on the formation of deposits on the first ring groove using a four-cylinder engine for the formation; characterization of the first ring groove deposits of diesel engine pistons have never been clarified, although the deposits in this area are known to lead to reduced engine durability and performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661">23</xref></sup> The grade of the lubricant used for both tests was 5W-30, and the fuel type used was a low sulfur diesel. About 6% of a commercial cerium additive (provided by Rhodia Electronics and Catalysis) in the form of nano-particulate cerium oxide dispersed in an organic solvent was added in the fuel in order to check the contribution of fuel in the deposit formation. Results showed that the deposits, with a structure of cracked varnishes, mainly resulted from the degradation of lubricating oil. Deposits were termed as ‘oily’ and ‘dry’ according to their volatile organic matter content. SEM/energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), TGA, pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and FTIR spectroscopy were used to study the physical and chemical characteristics of deposits. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087411427661">Figure 4</xref> showed the results from an SEM. By analyzing the chemical properties of the deposits in first ring groove, a conclusion was drawn that they were mainly carbonaceous and resulted principally from lubricant degradation. These deposits contained a noticeable proportion of metallic elements from the wear of engines.</p>
<p>It can be found from the studies that lubricating oil performs an important role in the formation of deposits. Thus, it will be of great importance to improve lubricating oil, not only in lubrication ability, but also in the function of deposits and emission reduction. For lubricating oil, some is thrown into the combustion chamber at top dead center (TDC), or adheres to the cylinder liner. Just like fuel, some remains on the surface, and may degrade without being burnt or evaporated, and thus contributes to the formation of deposits. On the other hand, lubricating oil may also enter the piston ring groove or piston ring land, and degrade, which makes a large contribution to the major part of the deposit formation here. Particulate substances with incomplete combustion may also gather on the surface of the combustion chamber and contribute to deposit formation, together with fuel and lubricating oil. With the operation of the engines, deposit formation will finally achieve equilibrium.</p>

<title>Influence of fuel additives</title>
<p>Fuel additives play a great role in making up for defects and improving the quality of the fuel. However, problems, such as toxic emission, follow the benefits. In addition, the formation of deposits is influenced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468087411427661">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zerda et al. investigated the influence of fuel additives on the microstructure of deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468087411427661">30</xref></sup> The experiment was conducted in a production spark-ignition 3.1L V6 port fuel injected laboratory test cell engine. Two different types of surfactant additive chemistry were evaluated in this study, one derived from polyether amine (PEA) and one derived from polybutene amine (PBA). At the completion of each test, deposit material was removed by scraping each of the cylinder head regions and piston top regions of the six combustion chambers. The sample material from each respective region of the six cylinders was then mixed together to form one large average sample for that region. The conclusion was drawn that the surface area of deposits decreased with the increase of additive concentration by comparing two types of additives, PEA-1 and PBA-1, at 200 ppm and 400 ppm. A structural comparison of the deposits from the cylinder head, intake valve and piston top was also made, and showed that deposits from the cylinder heads were more porous than those of the piston tops. Likewise, deposits from the intake valves were less porous than those of the combustion chambers. The highlight of the work by Zerda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468087411427661">30</xref></sup> was that the surface area of the deposits were evaluated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) theories, and density functional theory was used to evaluate pore size distribution.

<p>Just as the lubricating oil influences deposits in diesel engines, so does lubricating oil influence the formation of deposits in gasoline engines, and much research similar to the methods of Diaby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661">23</xref></sup> was made to verify the influence of lubricating oil on deposits in gasoline engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468087411427661">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468087411427661">56</xref></sup> For example, Ahrenfeldt et al. generated deposits on a 0.48 l single-cylinder high compression ratio spark ignition (SI) engine fueled by synthetic gas. The results of the experiment indicate that the deposits were possibly derived from the lubricating oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468087411427661">57</xref></sup></p>

<title>Injection system</title>
<p>Along with the development of technology, DISI engine technology is increasingly used on gasoline engines for the reason that it offers tremendous potential in fuel saving. Port fuel injection engine technology is also widely used for its low manufacturing cost. Deposit formation also differs in the two types of injection systems.</p>
<p>In a DI engine, a concern is its propensity to form deposits on the inlet valve. In extreme cases, these deposits can lead to poor drivability and deteriorating emission performance. Different injection systems lead to different deposit formation mechanisms. However, factors, such as fuel types, lubricating oil types and additives, influence deposit formation in port fuel injection (PFI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468087411427661">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468087411427661">52</xref></sup> and DI gasoline engines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087411427661">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468087411427661">58</xref></sup> in the same way. Few studies have been made for different injection systems influenced by the same fuel, lubricating oil or additives, which will lead to a better understanding of deposit formation and methods for reducing deposit formation for different engine types.</p>
<p>In GDI engines, deposits can cause pre and post ignition of the fuel–air mixture, increased occurrence of engine knock, decreased power and increased emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468087411427661">59</xref></sup> Deposits formed at the injector tip may cause abnormal fuel injection, which will lead to unsteady engine operation. The way to decrease the deposits here may focus on the reformation of fuel, proper design of injector tips, and control of injector tip temperatures.</p>

<title>Effect of fuels on deposit formation in diesel engines</title>
<p>Lack of petroleum fuel and restrictions on emissions force people to research alternative fuels or add other substances to existing fuels to achieve better performance. Emulsified diesel fuel and palm oil are two representative innovative measures. However, they also cause deposit formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468087411427661">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study on engines fueled with emulsified diesel</title>
<p>Water in emulsified diesel fuel plays an important role in reducing combustion chamber temperature and increased momentum of the fuel spray, which enhances the air entrainment into the flame, which will lead to lower NOx and PM emissions. The main intention is to reduce peak temperature in the combustion zone. It is believed that the water could lower the gas temperature by means of water evaporation and thus decreasing the rate of thermal-NOx formation. However, investigations have found that emulsified diesel fuel could also influence the formation of deposits. Husnawan et al. studied deposits in a cylinder head fueled with four types of diesel fuel emulsion samples containing 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% vol. water and 20% palm oil methyl ester (POME).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468087411427661">29</xref></sup> Deposits were collected from a single-cylinder DI Yanmar diesel engine after 25 hours for each set of test fuels with a constant speed of 2500 r/min. It was found that less aromatic and less reactive deposits would be formed with an increase of water in the fuel. Four pictures of cylinder heads were also given by Husnawan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468087411427661">29</xref></sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087411427661">Figure 10</xref>. It can be found that deposits increase when water in fuel emulsions increases. Emulsified diesel will lower combustion temperature, and thus more deposits will form. TGA was also carried out, from which obvious differences could be found in different deposits.</p>

<title>Studies on engines fueled with palm oil</title>
<p>Since petroleum fuel is in short supply, many types of alternative fuel are used in engines. Some problems follow the economic benefits. The formation of deposits in engines is one of them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468087411427661">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kalam and Masjuki investigated the emission and deposit characteristics of a small diesel engine when operated on preheated CPO with emulsions with 1%, 2% and 3% water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468087411427661">31</xref></sup> The experiment was conducted on a water-cooled, four-stroke DI Yanmar engine. Conclusions were made that lower emissions of CO, HC and PM and higher NOx emission were found when fueled with preheated CPO, compared with that of OD fuel and CPO emulsified fuels. The main reasons are that preheated CPO reduces its viscosity, improves fuel volatility and produces complete combustion, but increases deposits that cause higher NOx emissions. Deposit characteristics were given by TGA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087411427661">Figure 11</xref>, which explains the reason why higher NOx emissions were found when fueled with preheated CPO, since preheated CPO increased the fraction of ash deposit. In addition to the physical properties of CPO, one important reason is that CPO is an oxygenated fuel, which includes oxygen in it. The existence of oxygen will reduce the emissions of CO, HC and PM.</p>

<p>Since the use of CPO will lead to lower emissions of HC, CO and PM and higher NOx emissions and more deposits, it is sensible to choose proper types of fuel and after-treatment devices to realize low emissions, as required.</p>
<p>The lack of fossil fuel promotes palm oil to be an important type of alternative fuel. The research of Kalam and Masjuki comprised the characteristics of deposit emission of engine fueled with palm oil and emulsified palm oil and its contrast with diesel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468087411427661">31</xref></sup> It provided an important basis for replacing diesel fuel with palm oil in a better way.</p>

<title>Reforming fuel</title>
<p>Whether for diesel or gasoline engines, fuel reformation is an important way to improve engine performance and to reduce the emissions. Deposit formation will markedly decrease when fueled with properly reformed fuel, which is favorable for the reduction of deposit formation, and it is a good choice to reform fuel to achieve both lower deposit formation and better engine performance. Gasoline with high aromatic compounds and low T90 adversely affects injector deposits, while CCDs sharply accumulate when T90 exceeds 150 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468087411427661">50</xref></sup> One example of reducing deposit formation through diesel fuel reformation is the use of a type of diesel fuel, known as ecological fuel. Deposit formation will decrease, together with lower engine abrasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468087411427661">37</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1468087411427661">
<title>Proper EGR</title>
<p>In diesel engines, the existence of EGR will definitely decrease the NOx emission, but the PM in the exhaust will come back into the intake system, which will influence the formation of deposits, which is well illustrated in the study of Singh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468087411427661">27</xref></sup> Then, a proper EGR ratio will result in a decrease in both deposits and NOx emissions. The existence of EGR will decrease the oxygen concentration in the intake charge, which reduces reaction temperatures, which leads to reduced NO formation and reduced particulate oxidation. A lower combustion temperature will lead to more deposit formation. PMs caused by incomplete combustion are also an important reason for deposit formation, as this greater number of PMs will offer opportunities for adhering to the surface of the combustion chamber to form deposits.</p>

<sec id="section29-1468087411427661">
<title>Improving the lubricating oil</title>
<p>In diesel engines, it can be clearly seen from the study of Diaby et al. study that the degradation of lubricating oil exerts a great influence on the formation of deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661">23</xref></sup> Deposit formation will decrease by improving the degradability of oil through the proper reformation of lubricating oil or the use of additives, as a large part of the deposits are formed due to the degradation of lubricating oil.</p>
<p>Since the metallic PM in lubricating oil will influence the degradation of oil, another way to decrease deposit formation is to diminish the metallic PM in the lubricating oil in the oil pan. In gasoline engines, it was similarly found that lubricating oil also contributes to the formation of deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468087411427661">57</xref></sup></p>

Heat absorption of water droplets, when evaporating, will lower combustion temperature. The formation of deposits will increase with decreasing temperature, and this is the reason why deposits increase when water content increases.</p>

<sec id="section31-1468087411427661">
<title>Additives</title>
<p>Fuel and lubricating oil additives are often used to suppress deposits. Detergent additives are used most in fuel to reduce deposit formation. Although how these detergent chemicals act with the CCD structure and other physical properties of the deposits are not well understood, it can be seen through the investigation of two types of additives made by Zerda et al. that the use of additives will diminish the inner surface of deposits and thus decrease the damage of deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468087411427661">30</xref></sup> The main function of lubricating oil additives in reducing deposit formation is to increase the anti-degradation of lubricating oil, since the degradation of lubricating oil is the main contribution to deposit formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411427661">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Summary</title>
<list id="list1-1468087411427661" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Deposits will exist as long as petroleum fuel is used in engines, and they will influence the performance of engines, such as the deterioration of emissions, decreasing power, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The deposit formation process can be concluded from the influencing factors of fuel and lubricating oil.</p>
<p>Fuel injected into the combustion chamber may not be burnt completely, which adheres onto the surface of the combustion chamber. Part of the fuel gathering on the surface may not evaporate or be burnt, and thus deposits are formed. For lubricating oil, some of it is thrown into the combustion chamber at TDC or adheres to the cylinder liner. Just like fuel, some of it remains on the surface and may degrade without being burnt or evaporated, and thus contributes to the formation of deposits. On the other hand, lubricating oil may also enter the piston ring groove or the piston ring, and degrade, which makes a great contribution to the major part of the deposit formation here. Particulate substances with incomplete combustion may also gather on the surface of the combustion chamber and contribute to deposit formation together with fuel and lubricating oil. With the operation of engines, deposit formation will finally achieve equilibrium.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>The existence of deposits is inevitable, but their quantity can be reduced through some proper measures. Conclusions on how to restrain deposit formation could be made from the influencing factors of deposit formation. The use of detergent or surfactant additives in fuel, anti-degradation additives in lubricating oil as well as gasoline with lower T90 temperature and ecological diesel will lead to less deposit formation. Structure change is another method of decreasing the damage to the performance of engines.</p></list-item>
