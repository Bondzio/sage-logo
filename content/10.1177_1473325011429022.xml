<abstract>
<p>This article explores the experiences of six college students learning and using feminist leadership techniques for the creation and implementation of a performance-based, peer education, sexual assault prevention program. The program was established and governed through the use of two models for feminist leadership, <italic>Visions; Building a Feminist Community</italic> and <italic>Theatre for Community, Conflict, and Dialogue</italic>. Both models emphasize a collaborative leadership style and process, which includes a strengths focus, ethic of care, and modeling responsibility to the group. Data were collected via in-depth interviews, field notes, and written evaluations focusing on the group experience. Data reveal how the creation and implementation of this program impacts students’ engagement with feminist leadership practices and how this shapes them as leaders. Data also illustrate valuable implications for future practice, policy, and research development.</p>

<body>
<p>I have composed this article to illustrate the experiences of six college students with learning and using feminist leadership techniques in the creation and implementation of a performance-based, peer-led, sexual assault prevention program at a large state university. This illustration explores how participation in this process fosters the students’ identification with feminist leadership practice and constructing embodied knowledge. I utilized a feminist leadership model as described in <italic>Visions; Building a Feminist Community</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429022">Hawxhurst and Morrow, 1984</xref>) to provide students with feminist leadership skills and performance techniques illustrated in <italic>Theatre for Community, Conflict, and Dialogue: The Hope is Vital Training Manual</italic> by Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd (1998)</xref>. I begin the article by exploring feminist leadership and embodied knowledge theories and scholarship. Next I describe the methods used to collect and analyze the data. The heart of the article consists of an analysis of student experiences designing and implementing this program. I conclude the article with a discussion of how these findings enhance our understanding of how to engage undergraduate students in feminist leadership practice and constructing embodied knowledge within a social work practice, policy, and research context.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1473325011429022"><title>Feminist leadership scholarship</title>
<p>How does feminist theory intersect with leadership practice? There is a short history of scholarship in social work literature investigating feminist leadership theory and practice. However, within the past few years a small group of researchers have started to define and investigate feminist leadership in a social work context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429022">Collins and Lazzari, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011429022">Gardella and Haynes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). These scholars have argued for understandings of feminist leadership as a model for ethical, empowered engagement within groups and organizations. Lazzari, Colarossi, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429022">Collins (2009)</xref> defined feminist leadership as a process that is collaborative, relational, and a constant awareness of gender and power. Relational is further defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011429022">Freedberg (2009)</xref> as the holistic (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) method of relating to others; in leadership practice this is a focus on the motivational and emotional aspects of guidance integrated with an awareness of how power is shared. These authors illustrate a second feature of feminist leadership as understanding one’s positionality in relationship to those with whom we work. That is race, class, gender and other power-laden demographics that influence our embodied, lived experiences as leaders and followers. Feminist leaders maintain an awareness of one’s positionality, which includes attention to how one’s positionality intersects with setting goals, decision-making, and interpersonal interactions. Feminist Leadership is further elucidated as involving ‘reconstructing power as empowerment, for example, making decisions with others, sharing control of resources and educational curricula, and generating ideas or ideologies and knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>: 352).</p>
<p>Feminist leadership theory is borne out of transformational leadership, as conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011429022">Bass (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011429022">Burns (1978)</xref>. Transformational leaders are described as agents of change who transcends one’s own needs to garner support and action on behalf of the needs of the greater collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). They empower followers to develop their abilities to benefit the entire community. In practice, transformational leaders motivate followers to engender respect and pride towards one another and the organization. They clearly communicate the mission, values, and goals of the organization and integrate this with problem-solving and task completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011429022">Eagly et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Shared leadership theory is a more recent iteration of transformational leadership. This departs from transformational leadership by focusing on a relational leadership practice and examining power within hierarchical relationships. Shared leadership focuses on the processes of community building versus the outcomes. In other words, the act of community building is integrated with relational, consensual, mutually beneficial goals between the leader and the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429022">Fletcher and Kaufer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Feminist leadership is founded on transformational and shared leadership theories and practices. Lazzari, Colarossi, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429022">Collins (2009)</xref> define collaboration as consensual decision-making, open communication, establishing goals together, and communally determining how goals will be accomplished. Feminist leadership practice emphasizes women’s leadership as imbued with an ethic of care, which is illustrated through a need to care for others via communication and collaboration. Specific practices would include creating an agenda which promotes collaboration, an awareness of power and gender, and relational skills; promoting policies in the workplace that focus on feminist issues (child care, equal pay, flexible schedules); creating organizational goals to be gender equitable; and empower women to be feminist leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011429022"><title>Embodied knowledge theory</title>
<p>Our bodies influence all aspects of our daily experiences, relationships, and identities. Our physical self interprets the world and creates knowledge based on our senses (sight, sound, touch, hearing, taste), our corporeal ability or disability, and how our bodies inhabit space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011429022">Ellingson, 2006</xref>). Social and cultural values are placed upon us based upon the color of our skin, the amount of fat we carry, the utility of our limbs, and the genitals with which we were born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429022">Phillips, 2007</xref>). Many social work scholars have emphasized the importance of integrating the lived body into social work research and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011429022">Cameron and McDermott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429022">McCormick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429022">Phillips, 2007</xref>). Attention to the body renders visible the knowledge we construct through our senses, abilities, physical traumas, and gender-based discrimination. It is essential to include embodied knowledge in a discussion about sexual violence prevention, given that this type of violence is situated upon the body as a site for power, domination, and colonization.</p>
<p>Embodied knowledge theory articulates the physicality of intersecting oppressions based on race, ethnicity, ability, gender, sexual identity, religious expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011429022">Cameron and McDermott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011429022">Tangenberg and Kemp, 2002</xref>). Given that the members of this study are involved in creating a performance-based, sexual assault prevention program and that sexual violence is a physical and gendered form of oppression it seems to be particularly relevant to infuse an exploration of how embodied knowledge is constructed and experienced by the study members.</p>
<p>The prevention program the students created is performance-based. The students are using their bodies to perform scenarios that depict situations in which sexual assault occurs. I guided students through this process using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd’s <italic>Theatre for Community Conflict and Dialogue</italic> (1998)</xref>. Integrating an understanding of how we use our bodies to create knowledge with feminist leadership theory appears to be a promising foundation for practicing leadership development with college students. This is due to an emphasis in feminist theory on an individual’s subjective embodied experience based on intersections between race, class, gender and other power-laden demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429022">McCormick, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>‘Embodied Knowledge’ is an epistemological and ontological move towards privileging bodies as agents of knowledge production. This move rebels against a Western Intellectual Tradition of mechanizing our daily experiences, e.g. relegating our thoughts to our mind, emotions to the body, and privileging the mind over the body, which forces a false split. The theoretical goal of embodied knowledge is to acknowledge that all individuals have bodies, which are inscribed by culture and society into sexual and racial categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011429022">Ellingson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429022">McCormick, 2011</xref>). These culturally created categories (situated bodies) dictate the perspectives, experiences, and opportunities individuals and groups experience as a lived reality. If we agree that experiences, perspectives, and opportunities differ based on a body’s situatedness, then we may ‘challenge the claim that there is such a thing as universal knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011429022">Wilcox, 2009</xref>: 106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011429022">Grosz, 1994</xref>). The intended outcome from practicing embodied pedagogies is to reintegrate the body, emotions, and spirit into teaching, learning, and knowledge construction practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429022">McCormick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429022">Phillps, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011429022">Tagenberg and Kemp, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Our bodies carry our past joys and traumas as well as hope for the future. Thus a strong effort to build trust, comfort, and safety is essential for a rich, integrated embodied experience to occur. All of these methods are compatible with feminist leadership tenets and have the potential to create a new understanding of how feminist leadership can be further developed and applied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011429022"><title>Reflexivity</title>
<p>Qualitative research paradigms assert that research is influenced by the social conditions in which it is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429022">Hesse-Biber and Leavy, 2011</xref>). The researcher must delineate her or his position in relation to the study and remain in constant self-reflection about how that position can influence all aspects of the study. My relationship to this study is shaped by my position as a white, educated, middle-class, heterosexual woman. My race and social status have given me the privilege of obtaining education and skills in feminist leadership, embodied knowledge, and social work. My position as a small woman who was socialized to be polite and accommodating, I believe, has situated me to be a target for various forms of sexual harassment throughout my adolescent and adult life. I believe that the confluence of all these factors have set the stage for me to create and evaluate an intervention using a framework and skills that are of unique interest to me and this intervention targeted towards a social problem I have personally experienced. I must remain in constant critical reflection about how my personal biases toward this project influence the research process.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1473325011429022"><title>Building feminist community</title>
<p><italic>Living our Visions</italic> was written as a guidebook that would enable feminists to create a feminist revolution. Revolution is described as raising consciousness, networking with women across cultural, class, and race boundaries, forming coalitions that support full participation by women, and ending all forms of oppression. The group process theory established in the book incorporates the feminist leadership tenets explicated by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011429022">Gardella and Haynes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). Feminist group process is defined as ‘an analysis of power and a working commitment to confront and dismantle arbitrary power discrepancies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429022">Hawxhurst and Morrow, 1984</xref>: 25). This involves an awareness and acknowledgement of the privileges each member brings to the process, which is meant to diminish power over one another. The authors caution readers to avoid mistaking collaborative group process as a haphazard, unstructured, leaderless method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429022">Hawxhurst and Morrow, 1984</xref>). Rather feminists are encouraged to direct the process ‘thoughtfully and deliberately in ways that are meaningful to each woman in the group’ (1984: 25).</p>
<p>Michael Rohd, influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011429022">Augusto Boal (1985)</xref>, created a manual that provides a brief theoretical overview and explicit instructions on how to build a community theatre troupe, that uses theatre for social change. The manual <italic>Theatre for Community, Conflict, and Dialogue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd, 1998</xref>) utilizes exercises from Boal and other theatre for social change practitioners. The purpose of the manual is to give community theatre practitioners tools to create a cohesive performance troupe, with group facilitation skills, to enter a community and engage the community with creativity, dialogue, and consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The assumption guiding these tools is that everyone has the capacity to engage in this kind of theatre. All that is required is a ‘desire to engage in dialogue about the oppressions in our lives and to use theatre as a tool to effect that engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd, 1998</xref>: xi). Another assumption is that all aspects of a human being crave dialogue. Our identities, experiences, relationships, and communities are created through dialogue. ‘If dialogue is essential, then its absence is a violation of the most profound sort’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd, 1998</xref>: xi). Rohd’s techniques are a map towards community dialogue, which is assumed to lead to transformation. The aim is to render the invisible, visible and give voice to those who have been silenced.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1473325011429022"><title>Program description</title>
<p>This project involved bringing together students (volunteer) and giving them the knowledge and tools necessary to create and present a performance-based, interactive program that engages undergraduate audience members in verbalizing and performing solutions for scenarios in which sexual assault can occur. My research explores the experiences of the volunteer students with learning and using feminist leadership skills and using bodies to create and perform a presentation aimed at sexual violence prevention. Understanding the perspective of the volunteer students provides valuable data on how this process can foster positive learning, leadership, and activism experiences for students involved with this project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011429022" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Qualitative methods were chosen as a tool to achieve the goals of this study. Constructivist research methods allow for a sensitive, nuanced exploration and analysis of a topic, which is a useful approach for understanding how to foster subjective, individual expressions of feminist leadership and constructing embodied knowledge in college students.</p>
<p>A critical theory paradigm informs the design of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429022">Hesse-Biber and Leavy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429022">Marshall and Rossman, 2011</xref>). The critical theory paradigm values the subjective truths of each individual, but asserts these realities are mediated by a power-laden context, which informs how we behave, create meaning, and produce knowledge about our lived experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011429022">Morrow and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011429022">Ponterotto, 2005</xref>). Critical theory asserts discovering an absolute truth is not possible, but rather multiple truths exist and are shaped by the context in which the knowledge is created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429022">Hesse-Biber and Leavy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429022">Marshall and Rossman, 2011</xref>). From this perspective, I hold an emancipatory perspective, wherein we created opportunities and worked to foster the will of those involved with a study, as researchers and participants, toward social action and liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429022">Marshall and Rossman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011429022">Ponterotto, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011429022" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants of this study were six members of a peer education group at a large, state university located in the southwestern region of the United States. Member demographics include two males, four females, ages 19–29 years, five are currently enrolled students, one is a recent graduate, one person of color, five white students, one self-identified as lesbian, the other five members self-identified as heterosexual. Because of the bounded focus of the study, the homogeneity of the participants, the demographic variation of participants, and the incorporation of multiple sources of data, the sample size of this study was appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011429022">Sandelowski, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>I used a non-probability purposeful criterion sampling procedures to recruit participants who could provide rich information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011429022">Patton, 1990</xref>). Therefore I sampled persons actively attending group meetings. Efforts were made to recruit study members with diverse race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual identity variation; however, most who remained active in this program have similar demographic characteristics. This may be due to the subject matter, sexual violence prevention is a concern typically associated with heterosexual women.</p>
<p>The university institutional review board approved this study and all study members were given informed consent. Recruitment was accomplished through multiple methods. An email specifying the purpose of the project, information about potential interventions, and an invitation to an orientation to the project and current study was sent to specific students who expressed interest in being part of the prevention program, three university resource center listservs, and to members of the community that knew students that would be interested in participating in the project.</p>
<p>Multiple sources of data were gathered, including participant observation, participant journals, and individual interviews to increase the rigor of the study and to provide deeper and richer analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429022">Marshall and Rossman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429022">Morrow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011429022">Morrow and Smith, 2000</xref>). Triangulation of multiple sources of data deepens the understanding of a topic by combining multiple methods of data collection to produce multiple points of view in order to produce a robust account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011429022">Barusch et al., 2011</xref>). As a participant observer, I wrote field notes after each group meeting. As both participant and an observer with the development of this program I wanted to immerse myself in the research setting and experience the process as the participants did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429022">Marshall and Rossman, 2011</xref>). I collected reflexive evaluations from each person that attended each meeting. Each participant was asked to write an evaluation of each meeting. I conducted the six in-depth semi-structured interviews. In-depth interviews create rich qualitative data, which can provide great insight into a specific issue or topic. Sample questions from the interviews are as follows:
<list id="list1-1473325011429022" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What drew you to this project?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What do you think is going well with the project?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What do you see as the challenges with the project?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>I used line-by-line descriptive and analytic coding techniques as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011429022">Charmaz (2006)</xref> to analyze this data. I began by immersing myself in the data by listening to the audio-recorded interviews, reading transcripts created from the interviews, and reading the written evaluations twice. I used open and focused coding techniques as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011429022">Charmaz (2006)</xref>. Open coding consisted of line-by-line analysis of segments of the data by creating a literal summarization of the data using key words verbalized by the interviewee/writer. By utilizing the constant comparative method of comparing data to data, data to codes, and codes to data, I engaged in focused coding, or developing themes in the data. The descriptive themes were used to create analytical categories. I created analytical themes by creating an amalgamation of concepts from previous literature and interpretations we made from the descriptive themes. Throughout the data collection and analysis process: I used analytic memos to explicate the analysis process by notating comparisons in the data, codes, and themes; to document the developing grounded description; and to write about changes in codes and themes.</p>
<p>In an effort to infuse credibility and rigor into the design of this study, I included several strategies identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011429022">Creswell (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011429022">Barusch, Gringeri, and George (2011)</xref>. To establish accountability for my research process, my findings, interpretations, and report thereof, I documented a detailed account of my sampling rationale, an audit trail of all tasks and decisions undertaken for the project, discuss the limitations of my data collection methods, and provide a detailed description of how the data was collected and analyzed. These processes establish accountability through providing readers with a transparent description of how the data was collected and analyzed. This allows the readers to critique the research process, which may inform how the findings presented are interpreted and developed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is two-fold. The first aim is to describe the thoughts, feelings, and individual understandings of how each participant experiences the creation of an interactive, peer-led sexual assault prevention program. A second focus is to understand how those experiences foster students’ identity as feminist leaders. The following research questions were created to address this purpose:
<list id="list2-1473325011429022" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How does creating and implementing a performance-based, peer education sexual assault prevention program impact the creators/presenters?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does this experience impact these individuals’ identity as feminist leaders?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>

<p>Through analyzing this data I found many examples of how using a feminist leadership model to create and implement a performance-based, peer-led sexual assault prevention program impacted these students and fostered their identification with feminist leadership skills. These instances combine to produce a number of feminist strategies that participants use to negotiate their voice and role within the group. Although participants identify many strategies, I focus here on those that involve individual growth, trust in the group, and a greater ease using one’s body to create knowledge. I identify common themes in participant responses and use these themes to place each strategy into one of three analytic categories. The first category explores group dynamics between group members. Some members had more knowledge and peer leadership experience than others; thus understanding how this knowledge and experience or lack thereof was negotiated within the group context illustrated the power of collaborative leadership. I describe this category as ‘sharing power’. The literature identifies this practice as a basic tenet of feminist group process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429022">Collins and Lazzari, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429022">Fletcher and Kaufer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). Sharing power is a technique utilized to diminish the power differences between all members in a group.</p>
<p>The second category comprises strategies that I label ‘Empowerment’. This concept reflects the core goal of feminist leadership and feminist group process, which is to foster and cultivate the growth of individuals via a group experience. This growth allows the group members to re-engage with other communities modeling the same practices they learned in the feminist community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the final category I describe strategies of ‘embodied knowledge’. Members within the group discuss instances of an emerging ease and comfort with using one’s body to create contextual, gendered knowledge as a means for disrupting attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate sexual assault. Incorporating an understanding of experiences with feminist leadership with the production of embodied knowledge provides a theoretical foundation for developing practices that foster feminist leadership skills in college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429022">McCormick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429022">Phillps, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011429022">Tangenberg and Kemp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011429022">Wilcox, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec9-1473325011429022"><title>Sharing power</title>
<p>For the group members that participated in this study, sharing power with one another was a complex process of which some members were highly attuned and others seemed to be unaware. Sharing power involves a great deal of self-awareness of one’s privileges, strengths, and weaknesses and how those aspects of one’s positionality can impact various members of a group with a common goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429022">Collins and Lazzari, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429022">Fletcher and Kaufer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The manifestation of having power or not having power was a continuous thread through interviews and written feedback with the participants. The following quotation illustrates how one group member possessed a greater sense of self-efficacy than others, which allowed this member to feel like he has a voice in the group, but sensed the discomfort of other group members when sharing his voice. Eric is achieving a core goal of Feminist Leadership; through participation in the group he is increasing his awareness of how his positionality may limit or silence those with a less powerful positionality. Eric is a 19 year-old Caucasian man, who has a large build and stature, with a charismatic, confident interpersonal style.<disp-quote>
<p>Um, I feel like not everyone is always talking and because I’m always, I’m used to always talking just because that’s how I am. Sometimes, I’m like, oh wait, I have to let someone else talk, and … when not everyone is voicing their opinion sometimes it makes me feel a little uncomfortable.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As Eric’s comments demonstrate, sharing power, sharing voice has been established as a group norm, but it is not explicitly processed within the group. It is likely never processed in other groups Eric navigates. However, his comments show a growing awareness of the power he wields in a group and how that power may have an oppressive influence on others.</p>
<p>Another member describes her experience with power while engaging with the group. Gwen disclosed feeling silenced by a particular group member, Lori. Gwen goes on to discuss her confusion and frustration around Lori’s seeming unwillingness to share power in the group. Gwen is 25 years old, Caucasian woman.<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t feel like I was being heard. I felt a little silenced … cuz Lori seemed very adamant about what she already had and how she wanted to use it … where does participation come in when one person has all the material already and she’s gonna work on it all and you know, does that make sense?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen’s words demonstrate that the practice of sharing power involves an active, ongoing awareness of one’s participation or lack thereof in the group. Gwen is indirectly asking a question about the group process illustrated in the group agreements ‘How well do I invite others to share their perspectives?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011429022">Women’s Resource Center, 1999</xref>). Gwen is expressing a desire to contribute and be part of the creative process and interpreting the actions of Lori as a deliberate effort to seize vocal power and creative control.</p>
<p>Gwen goes on to observe through a written evaluation of how her interpersonal style may be contributing to how others respond to her.<disp-quote>
<p>I am trying to determine if it is just me, communication styles, or what exactly but I know that I felt a little ‘shut down’ by some people when giving my own suggestions/feedback. Not sure if I am just taking things personal or perhaps I am responsible for making others feel resistant to my opinions (maybe my tone or word choice) … ? Trying to look at it from others’ perspectives as I know that early on in the meeting I didn’t feel heard or valued.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen seems to be wrestling with how her interpersonal style (tone, word choice), which could be interpreted as her positionality, is contributing to her experience of feeling silenced. This dissonance could be viewed as growth for Gwen, where she is feeling incongruence with what she knows and understands about feminist leadership and how she and others are behaving in the group. Not only is she concerned about Lori’s behavior, but her own. This dissonance seems to be a first step to awareness of how one is or is not utilizing feminist leadership techniques within the group. Gwen’s interpersonal style is connected to positionality, because Gwen is articulate, has strong opinions, and the benefit of a solid education. All of these abilities and background give Gwen power that others in the group may not have, which could contribute to others feeling silenced or a need to silence Gwen.</p>
<p>Lori expressed concerns about her role in the group as being powerful and possibly silencing of others. Lori’s growing awareness of her position in the group reveals growth in her understanding of how to share power. Lori wrote the following feedback after a group meeting. Lori is a 29 year-old, Caucasian woman, and a student.<disp-quote>
<p>I think in the future I will try to back off (again, as always, this is a challenge for me!) and not take responsibility for the group going in ways I am envisioning etc. I still feel like I’m a bit of a steamroller, but I don’t know how to stop!</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Lori is experiencing dissonance with her understanding of Feminist Leadership as being collaborative and shared experience. Lori’s self awareness of her role in this group and likely past groups is growing, which lends credence to one of feminist leadership’s tenets, to foster the capacity of community members towards greater responsibility to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). Many feminist theorists discuss how sharing power with others is a means for modeling respectful, responsible, safe method for community building and leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429022">Fletcher and Kaufer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). Sharing power is one step towards reaching the ultimate goal of feminist community building, which is empowerment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325011429022"><title>Empowerment</title>
<p>Most of the interviewees identified personal growth and empowerment as an outcome from being involved with the student group. This was recognized as a goal of the group as well as a specific outcome. When I asked participants whether or not they witnessed or experienced personal growth nearly all stated specific examples of their growth or that of others. For example, Eric made the following observation about a sister group member: ‘One of the girls has said that she’s not really comfortable with acting … and that’s … how she started at the beginning of the meeting … and she’s been more and more open … she says, oh, I’d actually be comfortable doing this.’</p>
<p>Not only does this quote illustrate that utilizing a feminist leadership approach is creating an empowering experience for a group member, but it illustrates how witnessing the growth of others impacts other group members. The hope is that by modeling feminist leadership techniques group members will incorporate these techniques into their own lives and connect using those techniques with fostering opportunities for others to grow and develop.</p>
<p>Alicia is a 19 year-old student and has a shy, introverted, cautious presence within the group. During the first several group meetings Alicia insisted she did not feel like she had enough knowledge or presence to educate her peers. However, seven or eight meetings later Alicia agreed to present at our first engagement. Below is how Alicia described her growth process: ‘I’m surprised by how much I’ve learned … I guess being willing to (present), cuz you’re probably like, as you go to each meeting, you naturally get more comfortable, but you have to let yourself be comfortable, I guess.’ Shortly after the interview Alicia submitted the following written reflection:<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone seems to have a part that fits him or her really well. I liked all of the changes we made, and I thought we learned a lot about what we needed to say and how we needed to say it in order to conduct an effective presentation.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Alicia uses the term ‘we’, rather than ‘I’, which shows a sense of belonging the group and a merging of her growth with the evolution of the group. Alicia’s developing comfort with the topic, group members, and perceived power within the group has empowered her to contribute to educating her peers. This growth and empowerment is a core goal of feminist community building and leadership theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429022">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429022">Hawxhurst and Morrow, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429022">Lazzari et al., 2009</xref>). Alicia’s experiences with the group may contribute to her engaging with future groups utilizing feminist leadership techniques.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1473325011429022"><title>Embodied knowledge</title>
<p>Creating embodied knowledge strives to dismantle the binary between theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011429022">Ellingson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429022">McCormick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429022">Phillips, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011429022">Tangenberg and Kemp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011429022">Wilcox, 2009</xref>). Embracing different ways of knowing is a radical tool for leadership development, ‘social work practice that presumes to address issues of power requires nuanced understanding of the body as both an object and site of power … struggle, and resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011429022">Tangenberg and Kemp, 2002</xref>: 14). This work suggests that leaders surrender the role of expert and embrace an alternative language to create, produce, and reflect upon the leadership process. As previously stated, Lazzari, Colarossi, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429022">Collins (2009)</xref> discuss the importance of a person’s situatedness, in other words, gender, race, ability, age, and other physical expressions which create varied lived experiences, in relationship to creating a feminist leadership experience. Understanding one’s positionality, one’s embodied knowledge, in relationship to others can contribute to sharing power, a reflexive group process, a method for creating knowledge and leadership within the group, and an expansion of the group’s repertoire for raising awareness, disrupting dominant paradigms, and challenging attitudes that make sexual assault acceptable. The following quote illustrates Gwen’s understanding of how embodied teaching and learning contribute to the peer education project.<disp-quote>
<p>I think a montage could be, be something without words. Nobody has to memorize anything … I think images can be very powerful and we can tie that into pop culture and rape culture … how powerful images are for us … So … coming up with really specific images … could be really powerful but it doesn’t require a lot, and it doesn’t require you to speak. You don’t even have to make eye contact with the audience. It really has to do with the image you’re creating with the people, the other performers and the message you’re trying to get across.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Engaging the group members as well as audience members in embodied knowledge creation experiences requires using a collaborative, nurturing, capacity oriented approach. Embodied methods are compatible with feminist leadership theory and have the potential to create a new understanding of how the theory can be further developed and applied.</p>
<p>Rae is 27 years old, female, Caucasian. Rae clearly articulates what it feels like in her body to engage in the peer-led presentations:<disp-quote>
<p>And I would feel comfortable with stumbling around doing my first presentation like this in front of people. I would feel comfortable doing that and potentially making mistakes, potentially turning red and having sweaty armpits and doing all those things. Like I could, I could be OK with that.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The integration of her bodily sensations with engaging in sexual assault prevention is essential to a holistic awareness of the social-cultural impact sexual assault has on women and how engaging in this kind of activism and prevention work is inscribed on our bodies. Sexual assault is inherently an embodied expression of power, control, and violence. Thus using our bodies to counteract, disrupt, and create healing experiences are powerful education and leadership technique that is compatible with and enriches current feminist leadership practice and theory.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1473325011429022"><title>Implications for social work practice and research</title>
<p>The results of this study yield valuable information for social work practice and future research. The results of this study offer two specific recommendations for practitioners seeking direction on how other communities may create, implement, and evaluate both a peer-driven sexual assault prevention programs and address other topics identified by the peer educators. These two recommendations are to (1) utilize a specific model for teaching leadership skills and (2) engage the peer educators in writing reflections about how they are learning and using the leadership skills.</p>
<p>Within the creation of peer education programs it is important to utilize a specific model for teaching feminist leadership, creating community, and constructing embodied knowledge. The two models used in this study are <italic>Visions; Building a Feminist Community</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429022">Hawxhurst and Morrow, 1984</xref>) and <italic>Theatre for Community, Conflict, and Dialogue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429022">Rohd, 1998</xref>). Using an established model provides a foundation for giving students structure, focus, and a resource for developing feminist leadership skills. It is important to choose a model that fits the goals of the project, which means investigating existing programs and conceptions for the type of work being undertaken. To find an appropriate model, I recommend exploring existing peer education programs that utilize feminist leadership skills. Second, ask program directors what models they are utilizing. Another method for finding a model would be to examine scholarship exploring the impact and utility of leadership building among a population of interest.</p>
<p>Future iterations of this peer education project may involve moving away from the models this study used and creating a new model that reflects new goals identified by the peer educators. A recommended trajectory would be to begin the project with an established model and then make adaptations after the group members have learned the leadership skills, developed group cohesion, and a deeper understanding of the problem being addressed by the project. Allowing peer educators to reinvent existing models would give them a sense of ownership and command of the skills they have been practicing. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429022">Hawxhurst and Morrow (1984)</xref> model used is dated. We re-defined, re-prioritized many of the tenets and skills described by Hawxhurst and Morrow. As a group we could record our reiteration of the Hawxhurst and Morrow model and make this manuscript available for other peer education programs to use.</p>
<p>A specific practice that encourages peer educators to develop as leaders is engaging the peer educators in writing reflections about their experience creating the program. This exercise helps the peer educators understand how they use feminist leadership skills within this project and future situations in which these skills might apply. Having the peer educators revisit this reflection several weeks later, and at continuous intervals reinforces their understanding of how to use feminist leadership techniques, create community, construct embodied knowledge, and chart their own growth throughout their participation in the program.</p>
<p>In assessing implications for future research, it is important to continually investigate how peer educators can learn and use feminist leadership skills and construct embodied knowledge with diverse populations, in multiple settings. It is in these settings where scholars can explore the transformational power of teaching feminist leadership practice, construct embodied knowledge, and determine the impact this practice can have on a community. By engaging other populations (e.g. adolescents, prisoners, homeless communities) in peer education program development, valuable information will be discovered by using feminist leadership skills and constructing embodied knowledge. This information would articulate contexts in which teaching feminist leadership skills would be beneficial towards addressing problems of concern within a community, in this case, sexual violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1473325011429022" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this investigation are in tandem with social work values. The themes I found in the data, sharing power, empowerment, and embodied knowledge, resonate with social work theories, practices, and goals. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011429022">National Association of Social Workers (NASW) (2008)</xref>. Code of Ethics states three core values to which professional social workers should adhere as importance of relationships, dignity and worth of the person, and service. These three values are explicitly investigated and practiced within the confines of this research project. This study also contributes to a growing body of literature within social work on feminist leadership and embodied knowledge. The theoretical lens, leadership practices, and evaluation methods used could be applicable to a variety of settings with diverse populations. Engaging these practices have the potential to reconstruct communities and systems to practice feminist leadership skills. For example, using collaborative decision making, creating an ethic of care, and privileging embodied knowledge reconstructs how communities solve problems. That potential means of reconstruction may proffer new methods for conducting research, prevention practice, and peer education development.</p>
