<p>Since this issue is the first to bear our names as coeditors, we take the opportunity to introduce ourselves. Matthew Gordon is a member of the English Department at the University of Missouri (Columbia). His research interests include dialectology and sociolinguistics. Peter Grund is on the faculty of the English Department at the University of Kansas. He specializes in the history of the English language, historical pragmatics, and corpus linguistics. Despite the traditional rivalry between our institutions, we are delighted to be working together, and we feel our research strengths combine to offer solid coverage of the areas served by the journal.</p>
<p>We also take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Anne Curzan and Robin Queen, who preceded us at the editorial helm. They introduced new features such as the “In the Profession” column that have set the journal apart from others, and they published important research that has brought greater scholarly prominence to the journal. Our appreciation for the outstanding service they have provided continues to grow as we attempt to fill their shoes.</p>
<p>This issue collects three articles that illustrate the breadth of research currently undertaken within English linguistics. Drawing on a wide range of materials, the articles provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the lexical, syntactic, and lexico-syntactic resources of the English language. At the lexical end, “The N Word: Its History and Use in the African American Community,” by Jacquelyn Rahman, explores the history, emerging meanings, and associations of the N word. Focusing on the use of <italic>nigga</italic> by a number of African American comedians (including Richard Pryor, Mo’Nique, and Cedric the Entertainer), she illustrates the major role that the comedian’s background, the audience, and the pragmatic context may play. Overall, Rahman convincingly argues that, though contested, <italic>nigga</italic> “is a feature of AAE that, for some African Americans, is particularly salient for foregrounding an aspect of identity that casts the speaker, addressee, or referent as a pragmatic and resourceful survivor in the diaspora.”</p>
<p>The focus turns to syntax in María José López-Couso and Belén Méndez-Naya’s “On the Use of <italic>As If, As Though</italic>, and <italic>Like</italic> in Present-Day English Complementation Structures.” This article highlights the variable but clearly structured use of the “minor declarative complementizers” <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> with particular types of verbs including <italic>seem, appear</italic>, and <italic>look</italic>. On the basis of corpus data, the authors present significant new information on these little-researched complementizers, and reveal the strong influence of various factors including medium and text type on the choice of complementizer.</p>
<p>At the intersection of syntax and lexis, the final article, “An Alternative Analysis of the English <italic>Get</italic>-Past Participle Constructions: Is <italic>Get</italic> All That Passive?,” by Liljana Mitkovska and Eleni Bužarovska, proposes a more fine-grained analysis than previously suggested of what is usually referred to as the “<italic>get</italic>-passive.” Noting the varying semantic and structural properties of constructions involving <italic>get</italic> + a past participle, the authors illustrate that many examples (such as <italic>He got dressed</italic>) cannot be classified as passive, but should instead be seen as “middle voice.” Within this category, they identify a number of subtypes that suggest a “continuum from active to passive poles, covering a range of events in which the active role of the subject is gradually diminished.” Paying attention to this continuum promises a greater understanding of current usage and future developments of constructions of <italic>get</italic> + a past participle.</p>
