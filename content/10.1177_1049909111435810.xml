<abstract>
<p>In this study, we investigated patient's meaning attribution to pain in hospice and pain therapy unit, using a qualitative approach: narrative-based medicine. The data presented here were related to patients (n = 17) hospitalized in Rimini Hospice (Italy). These data were compared to those of patients (n = 21) with noncancer pain (control sample). The interviews were then analyzed according to the technique of thematic narrative analysis. The results of our research identified a differential process in pain processing in relationship to the meaning that the patient attributed to pain. The thematic analysis of the interviews allowed the inductive construction of a specific network of pain dimensions, which were summarized in “the pain chronogram.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the literature, there are many studies aimed to define, classify, and measure pain in terms of severity and intensity with specific rating scales .<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435810">1</xref>
</sup> We know that pain<sup>

<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435810">3</xref>
</sup> is a subjective experience that includes cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, and symbolic components. As a consequence, it becomes important to analyze chronic pain in a qualitative approach,<sup>

</sup> allowing the assessment of patient’s pain meanings, beyond its simple measurement, which is more appropriate in cancer pain conditions.</p>
<p>Pain quality is the result of the meaning that the patient’s attributes to his or her disease experience, in an attempt to attribute a sense to his or her own suffering. It is known from the literature that people suffering from persistent cancer and chronic noncancer pain have several comorbidities, deeply influencing patient’s quality of life, and as a consequence, pain becomes an experience that involves all aspects of the person, together with his or her family and social context.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111435810">9</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111435810">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pain phenomenology underlines that both pain perception and elaboration, in terms of the meaning given by the person who is suffering, cannot be separated from the use of linguistic categories that are functional to its communication. Understanding the narrative of pain means to understand the meaning that a person attributes to his or her suffering and, therefore, the actions taken for its management as a part of his or her own everyday experience.</p>
<p>Experience to illness is reconstructed in the form of a story, within a narrative structure that tends to confer to the illness, a meaning on the basis of a specific semantic network, which is culturally defined, and interconnects singular subjective meanings. Narratives are not only limited to describe and tell the experiences and events of illness but also build them at the same time as they attribute them the particular significance that the illness assumes in each specific cultural context on the basis of the peculiar relevance structures. The narrative provides the opportunity to understand the experience of others by providing a culturally mediated and understandable representation.</p>
<p>We believe that understanding patient’s pain meanings system is extremely important in hospice, in order to improve patients’ taking charge and treatment. Since there are few researches on this subject in the literature, we performed a study on patient’s pain meanings system in hospice, studying the following issues: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435810">1</xref>) patient’s awareness of his or her own pain and illness, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111435810">2</xref>) if patient thought that pain was manageable, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435810">3</xref>) the reaction to pain, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111435810">4</xref>) thoughts and emotions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111435810">5</xref>) if patient felt to be sufficiently in relationship with his or her affective context, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111435810">6</xref>) if there were other concerns. We then analyzed these factors using the narrative-based medicine (NBM), asking patients to explain their own pain meanings through their linguistic reconstruction.<sup>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>This research aimed to apply the NBM for the improvement of the provided palliative care quality through the understanding of the patient’s subjective experience of pain in hospice. We wanted to assess if this instrument could be applied to cancer pain therapy, if it could allow to understand new factors influencing pain perception. We also wanted to assess NBM applicability in pain and palliative care.</p>
<p>Our aim was, moreover, to assess whether specific characteristics of cancer pain could be found in patient’s narratives and whether there were similarities and/or differences with noncancer pain. We wanted to verify, in other words, whether these 2 different types of pains resulted in patient’s different perceptions and meaning attribution to pain itself.</p>
<p>This study was the first step of a wider project, for the production of integrated guidelines, to be experimented and validated for the implementation of clinical integrated audit for pain and palliative care quality improvement.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1049909111435810">
<title>The Sample</title>
<p>From April 2008 to February 2009, we interviewed 38 patients admitted in the Department of Pain and Palliative Care of Infermi Hospital (Rimini, Italy) with chronic pain. Of all, 17 patients suffered from cancer pain, in advanced stage of disease, and were treated with opioid; 21 patients suffered from noncancer pain (spinal and postsurgical pathologies, low back pain, etc) and were in study phase for the treatment selection and/or waiting for starting intervention procedures for pain relief.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049909111435810">
<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Patients with breakthrough pain, serious psychopathologies, sleepy state, psychic disorientation, and cognitive deficit were excluded from the study. Each patient signed an informed consent after a thorough explanation of the research aims and methods.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049909111435810">
<title>The Semistructured Interview</title>
<p>The interview used for the assessment of pain experiences was a semistructured interview, which was administered by the Research Team (a psychologist, a sociologist, and an anthropologist) with experience in palliative care and NBM. The interview investigated 7 dimensions: neurosensory, emotional-affective, cognitive, symbolic, behavioral, social, and therapeutic or palliative interventions dimension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111435810">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The interview provided some illustrative questions for each dimension that could be modified according to the specific case and to the sociocultural level of the interviewed patient.

<sec id="section7-1049909111435810">
<title>Interview Analysis</title>
<p>The interviews were then analyzed using the technique of thematic narrative analysis, within the methods of qualitative or case-centered type.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111435810">26</xref>
</sup> We used the thematic analysis and focused on the temporal dimension contained in the interviews, which was the common thread of pain stories. This allowed the construction of “the pain chronogram” (Raffaeli and Giarelli model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111435810">Figure 1</xref>). The chronogram was divided into 3 different phases of pain. The first stage could have an acute or gradual onset that created a conscious demand for health care, which relied on a diagnosis expectation by the health personnel. The second stage (“daily rhythms”) is where patients showed their instability using health and nonhealth strategies and faced patients with similar experiences (time range still opened to the care and with recovery ability if an effective therapeutic strategy recurred). The third stage was the last phase, which included the chronic pain real time with open, recursive, and unfinished outcome.</p>

<title>Pain Cronogram</title>
<p>Our semistructured interview allowed us to investigate pain complexity in its multidimensionality, assessing the 7 dimensions of interview for each patient.</p>
<p>The first stage of the chronogram was represented by the beginning of patient’s pain experience, the expression of how (mode of onset), where (localization), and when (time) it started and included only the neurosensory dimension of pain quality.</p>
<p>The type of painful sensation and its somatic localization became, subsequently, extremely problematic and of difficult identification because of its huge sudden onset and acute pain, which was sometimes torturing and continuous, and required the use of descriptive metaphors (needles, knives, etc).</p>
<p>In the second phase, the pain gained its daily time, more or less regular, its own rhythm that was made of acute, latency, or continuity periods, or developmental progression stages according to the cases. This second stage was faced mainly through the cognitive dimension in order to monitor the emotional–affective dimension, which appeared more and more influenced by the neurosensory dimension. The second stage also included the behavioral dimensions, made of actions, activities, posture, and daily life gesture, which represented the extreme defense against the non-sense of pain, the difficult research for order in the disorder that pain inevitably created. This particular network of cognitive, emotional-affective and behavioral dimensions (characterizing the second stage of pain) produced, in medium-long term, processes concerning the symbolic and social dimension (as result of chronic pain influence in patient’s life). This was the third stage, a recurrent result, because it could always intervene to change the dimensions that had produced it.</p>
<p>This last phase is specific of chronic pain, where pain is experienced as a real disease condition. We found out that pain reached this last phase mainly in the narratives of Pain therapy sample, whereas patients with cancer pain (Hospice sample) remained in the first 2 stages, without reaching the final stage with the open, recursive and unfinished outcome.</p>
<p>The symbolic dimension, in particular, implied processing of pain meanings, which allowed giving a sense also to the suffering, and an interpretation to better face it without surrendering to it. For someone, this research of pain meaning became the stoic acceptance of pain.</p>
<p>Also, the social dimension needed a medium- and long-term adjustment, addressing the impact of pain on social relationships and the necessary adjustments, which required starting with the problem of lack of pain verbalization; hence, the sufferer was often unable to express himself or herself with a suitable language, both verbally (complaints, requests, etc) and nonverbally (faces, claudication, tearing, etc).</p>
<p>The pain seemed to shape the world of the sufferer, to reshape his or her life, creating a world of suffering fundamentally different from that of daily life, and essentially impossible to communicate with it. This world of pain was no longer centered on intersubjectivity but on the body that was suffering, and, as such, was inevitably indescribable and individual. Other people (except a few closer) could not access this painful world and therefore often did not recognize it.</p>
<p>The social dimension, finally, became integral part of a sufferer’s global evaluation of his or her own quality of life, of how it had changed after pain onset.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Until mid-1990s, the theme of pain has been studied as a totally bodily experience, using physiology instruments to understand its neurophysiological and clinical characterization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111435810">2</xref>
</sup> Studies on the emotional–behavioral component have been developed only recently.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435810">3</xref>
</sup> These studies, however, never correlated physical pain with the component of linguistic elaboration as an intrinsic factor of pain type specificity.</p>
<p>Our study leads a way to this type of investigation. The language reveals a state of specificity, which characterizes and distinguishes the processes of care in different conditions of pain. We believe that this may be strictly related to the functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on pain, showing important relationships between pain intensity and its brain projection, and to the interactions with endocrine–emotional systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909111435810">27</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111435810">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We used the technique of thematic narrative analysis, within the methods of qualitative or case-centered type, for the analysis of the data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111435810">25</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111435810">26</xref>
</sup> This technique is based on the study of the particularity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111435810">29</xref>
</sup> of the specific sequence of events and actions told in the story of each patient. For this reason, NBM scientific character is not based on claims of generalization to a certain population of inferences identified from a probability sample, such as in the case of statistical quantitative approaches that are centered on variables. The narrative analysis, on the contrary, is based on the possibilities to infer certain theoretical propositions from the specificity of the case that are, to some extent, transferable to similar cases. Therefore, it is a process of inductive type, which is widely used in social sciences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049909111435810">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Among different types of narrative analyses, the thematic analysis is the type of analysis that is mostly used and consists in focusing the attention on what is told, rather than “how” it is told, or the modality of narrative production in the social or narrative context.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049909111435810">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The attention of the thematic analysis is concentrated on the content narrated and, in particular, on the plot that the narrative builds between the narrated events, on their sequence, as temporal order with a particular meaning that the analysis wants to reveal.</p>
<p>The main issue, which the thematic analysis had to face, was how to grasp the connections among the interview dimensions, the particular network of reciprocal causes that the narrative plot contained. This was necessary to fully understand the quality of pain that the patient had developed during his or her suffering experience. For this reason, we constructed an inductive model to reconstruct the specific intersection between different dimensions in the sequence that pain showed: the pain chronogram.</p>
<p>The results of our research identified a differential process in pain processing, according to the type of meaning that the patient attributed to pain. Hospice patients, in particular, characterized pain as a symptom of another illness (cancer), on which the drama and the anxiety of each patient was concentrated. Our research revealed how the primary cancer disease, resulting in anxiety and anger (total pain),<sup>

</sup> characterized specifically cancer pain, which could not be detached from the pathological disease in both patient’s thoughts and narrative. Cancer pain was fitted mainly in the first and second phase of the chronogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111435810">Figure 1</xref>), where the treatment aimed to remove or sedate the possible physical cause of pain.</p>
<p>In the first phase, there were only the neurosensorial dimension, this result well described the problem of the inability to talk about pain, of how pain resisted and destroyed the language, and of pain was expressed through cries and screams in a presymbolical, nonverbal language, in opposition to any possible meanings. The sufferer must struggle to overcome the inability to speak about pain, to verbalize an experience that seemed to resist the language through narration, presenting itself sometimes almost as a dreamlike or hallucinatory experience.</p>
<p>In the second phase, hospice patients used the cognitive dimension to reprocess emotional and affective dimensions, in order not to let emotions and moods at the mercy of neurosensory dimension, which was marked by pain. The pain cognition came into play, allowing to start a laborious, always precarious, but absolutely necessary reprocessing of pain.</p>
<p>The cognitive reprocessing allowed in this way to face pain, using certain coping strategies, ranging from diversion of attention to various types of activities (behavioral dimension).</p>
<p>The interviews of hospice patient did not reach the third stage of the chronogram, which was specific for chronic pain (as illness state) and found only in the pain therapy sample. The third stage was due to a constant, recurrent, and sometimes also contradictory search of a way for describing and expressing such an invasive life experience that seemed sometimes devoid of a plausible meaning or resistant to every attempt of explanation and characterization. Pain became the whole problem; therefore, it was a state of illness in itself, which could be identified as a pathological condition with an autonomous status.</p>
<p>This contrast between cancer and noncancer perception of pain, as a symptom and as a disease itself, is extremely important in pharmacological and psychological therapy choice by care team and should be considered when programming therapeutic–palliative interventions.</p>
<p>The results of our study can be improved administrating the interview to a larger number of patients in hospice, repeating the research in different hospices, and quantitatively evaluating the meanings of pain.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study showed the presence of important differences in the way of perceiving, elaborate, and mentally represents pain between cancer pain and noncancer pain patients. Hospice patients, in particular, showed mainly neurosensorial, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional–affective dimensions, and considered as a symptom of cancer disease. From the comparison between Hospice and Pain therapy patients emerged that noncancer pain seemed to shape the whole world of the sufferer, creating a suffering world, which was fundamentally different from that of daily life, and essentially impossible to communicate with.</p>
<p>These differences should be addressed in further studies with larger samples and analyzing more variables.</p>
