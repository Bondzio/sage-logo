<p>This special <italic>Management Communication Quarterly</italic> Forum celebrates our journal’s 25th Anniversary by honoring the indispensible contributions Linda Putnam has made to the establishment of our field through the advancement of <italic>MCQ</italic> as a disciplinary home. During the course of <italic>MCQ</italic>’s first 25 years, Linda has been a highly visible, constant, and consistent leader in shaping both the journal and the field of organizational communication studies. Hence, when our journal sought to recognize the scholar who has had the most impact on <italic>MCQ</italic>’s success, the choice was clear. And we were all thrilled to recognize Linda’s contributions with the inaugural <italic>Management Communication Quarterly</italic> Life Time Achievement Award, which she received this past May (2012) at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association.</p>
<p>Many of Linda’s contributions to <italic>MCQ</italic> and to our field are well known among us and are clear points for us to celebrate: the intellectual construction of our discipline, the push of our discipline outward on both interdisciplinary and global levels, and the thoughtful, compassionate mentoring of students into scholars. Much of this visible work has played out in the pages of <italic>MCQ</italic>, and for that, all of us involved with our journal are forever grateful. Less visible, but just as vital and essential, has been the advocacy role Linda has played for our journal and our field as we have worked to shape an identity within the social science community. One of the most important instances of Linda’s behind-the-scenes work was the persistent and persuasive lobbying she conducted for <italic>MCQ</italic> leading directly to our journal’s acceptance into the Thomson Reuters rating system, which is such an important marker of <italic>MCQ</italic>’s place within the broader social science field.</p>
<p>While we had insufficient time at the ICA award presentation to detail Linda’s contributions, the present forum gives us the opportunity to celebrate Linda’s lifetime achievements for <italic>MCQ</italic> more fully, which is what our readers will find in the articles that follow. Five renowned organizational communication scholars join with Linda for our celebration. Each of these scholars has worked closely with Linda over the course of <italic>MCQ</italic>’s publishing history and each will share personal reflections on the significance of Linda’s contributions to our journal in this quarter century.</p>
<p>In the opening article, Patrice Buzzanell discusses how Linda’s ideas have contributed to the constitution of our field and how Linda has relied on <italic>MCQ</italic> as a research home to accomplish this. Boris Brummans reflects in his article on Linda’s mentoring of graduate students and junior faculty, particularly looking at its role in shaping the field and the growth of the journal by drawing parallels with Buddhist master–student relationships. In the third article, Gail Fairhurst describes how Linda’s work on conflict and negotiation, the interpretive turn, organizational discourse, and the communicative constitution of organizations has created an identity for our field vis-à-vis other fields and how <italic>MCQ</italic> has served her with a springboard in this endeavor. Next, Dennis Mumby examines Linda’s contributions toward expanding the international scope of organizational communication theorizing by using the journal as a platform. The forum concludes with two articles. Cynthia Stohl first offers a set of summary reflections on Linda’s contributions to the journal and closes the main article section. Subsequently, Linda herself provides a forward-looking article in which she charts her views on how <italic>MCQ</italic> should move forward into its next quarter century.</p>
<p>The articles in this special 25th Anniversary Forum both signal and celebrate the pivotal role Linda Putnam has played in <italic>MCQ’</italic>s first quarter century. More importantly, these six articles also signal and celebrate <italic>MCQ</italic> as the place where organizational communication scholars share their knowledge and move our field forward. We thank and applaud Linda for her commitment to creating that place within the pages of this journal, and we take her continued support as inspiration for heading into our next 25 years.</p>
