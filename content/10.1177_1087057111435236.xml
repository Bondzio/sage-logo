With a plaque inhibition assay and a time-of-addition experiment, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the IAV replication at several stages of the life cycle. In the Western blot and EGFP-LC3 localization assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the accumulation of LC3II and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. In the RT-PCR and Western blot assays, we found procyanidin could inhibit the expression of Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. Finally, by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation–fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer and the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 heterodimer. In conclusion, we have established an HTS platform and identified procyanidin as a novel and promising anti-IAV agent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a severe worldwide threat to human health, which can give rise to thousands of deaths, enormous economic losses, and social disturbances. Influenza viruses are RNA viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family (including influenza A, B, and C); the type A (i.e., IAV) has a negative single-stranded RNA with eight gene segments. By the antigenicities of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), it can be further classified into many subtypes; up to now, 16 serotypes of HA (H1–H16) and 9 of NA (N1–N9) have been found in the avian and mammalian hosts. Through the antigenic shift, a new virus strain can be generated by the exchange of HA and NA genes from different species, leading to a new pandemic. Although IAV consists of many subtypes, they have a common feature: The genome of IAV consists of eight RNA segments, with each segment flanked by the untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5′ (13 nt) and 3′ (12 nt) termini, which are highly conserved among all IAV subtypes and among the eight segments themselves. These conserved sequences can anneal to form a bulged duplex structure that is essential for the transcription and replication of IAV, called the vRNA promoter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057111435236">1</xref></sup> Using this common feature, it is possible to establish a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform for all kinds of IAV subtypes.</p>
<p>On the basis of this common feature, we established a platform for high-throughput drug screening based on an IAV vRNA promoter luciferase reporter plasmid. Using this HTS platform, we analyzed 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and found that 7 medicinal plants had excellent inhibition on this platform that has not been reported. We picked out the blueberry (<italic>Vaccinium angustifolium</italic> Ait.), grape seed (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L), and cinnamon bark (<italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> Presl) because, after examining many previous reports, we found that these plants had a common active compound, procyanidin. Procyanidin is a subclass of flavonoids that possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiarthritic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057111435236">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that procyanidin can inhibit the infections of hepatitis C virus (HCV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111435236">3</xref></sup> severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057111435236">4</xref></sup> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057111435236">5</xref></sup> herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057111435236">6</xref></sup> and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057111435236">7</xref></sup> but to our knowledge, there are no any reports about its ability to inhibit the infection of IAV. Therefore, we decided to determine the anti-IAV effect of procyanidin and explored its mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>Autophagy has been reported to be involved in the replication of IAV, and inhibiting autophagy can inhibit IAV replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057111435236">8</xref></sup> IAV infection impedes the autophagy signal pathway by (1) producing many reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NOX2 NADPH oxidases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111435236">9</xref></sup> which damage Atg4 and lead to the accumulation of LC3II (a light chain of the microtubule-associated protein), which is a mammalian Atg8 homologue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057111435236">10</xref></sup>; (2) binding to beclin1 by the IAV M2 protein, thus impeding the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057111435236">11</xref></sup>; and (3) upregulating the expression of Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. All of these lead to the accumulation of autophagosomes and prevent the IAV component from degradation. In addition, autophagy also plays an important role in the induction of the cytokine storm, which has been thought to be a main cause of death in IAV-infected patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057111435236">12</xref></sup> so we decided to focus on the inhibition of procyanidin on IAV-induced autophagy.</p>

<title>Plant Extraction and Compound</title>
<p>Eighty-three examples of medicinal plants were collected from the Yulin medicine market (Guangxi Province, China). Each specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of Medical College, Shantou University (Shantou, China). The extracts from these medicinal plants were obtained according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Committee Publishing House of People’s Health, 2000). Procyanidin (purity &gt;98%) was purchased from the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China).</p>

<title>Construction of Plasmids</title>
<p>To create an IAV vRNA promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, human pol-I promoter (GenBank: NT_167214.1) was cloned into a pGL3-basic vector and named the pPol-1 vector. A pGL3-Basic plasmid was used as the template for the amplification of the luciferase (luc) gene. The PCR products were cloned into the pPol-1 vector and named the pPolI-vluc plasmid, which contained a negative strand luciferase (–Luc) gene flanked by the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of the IAV A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1) NP segment.</p>
<p>To construct the bimolecular fluorescence complementation–fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET) plasmids, two segments of a red fluorescent protein (GenBank: HQ423140.1), corresponding to amino acids 1 to 159 and 160 to 262, were inserted into a pcDNA 3.0 plasmid and named pMC and pMN, respectively. Beclin 1 (NM_003766.3) and Atg5 (NM_004849.2) were inserted into the pMC plasmid and named pMC-beclin and pMC-Atg5, respectively. Bcl2 (NM_000633.2) and Atg12 (NM_ 004707.3) were inserted into the pMN plasmid and named pMN-bcl2 and pMN-Atg12, respectively. Atg16L1 (NM_030803.6) was inserted into a pEGFP-C1 plasmid and named pEGFP-Atg16.</p>
<p>To construct a pEGFP-LC3 plasmid, human LC3B gene (NM_022818.4) was inserted into a pEGFP-C1 plasmid. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.</p>

<sec id="section6-1087057111435236">
<title>HTS Assay</title>
<p>A549 cells were seeded into a 96-well microplate and transfected with the pPolI-vluc plasmid using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A pRL-CMV plasmid was used as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the virus was introduced. After infection, the cells were grown in the virus growth medium (minimum essential medium [MEM]; 0.5 µg/mL tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone [TPCK]–trypsin [Sigma, St. Louis, MO], 0.125% [wt/vol] bovine serum albumin) containing the corresponding drugs (the plant extracts and procyanidin). The incubation time and multiplicity of infection (MOI) are shown in the following corresponding text. In the blank group, the cells were not treated with the virus and drug. The Luc activity was determined with the Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using the GloMax-Multi+ Detection System Base Instrument with shaking (Promega, Madison, WI). The data from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, were collected and analyzed. All experiments with IAV were performed in a biosafety level 3 containment, including enhancements required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Select Agents program. Moreover, the Z′ factor, which is a statistical parameter to quantify the suitability of a particular assay for use in a full-scale, high-throughput screen, was calculated according to a previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057111435236">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Plaque Inhibition Assay</title>
<p>MDCK cells were seeded into six-well plates for 24 h. Before the experiment, the viruses were pretreated with a series of mediums containing procyanidin (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 µg/mL) for 2 h and then washed with PBS three times. The pretreated viruses were added and adsorbed for 1 h (MOI = 0.001) and washed with PBS three times, and the cells were cultivated in a series of mediums containing procyanidin (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 µg/mL) for 48 h. After frost-thawing one time, the supernatants were collected and the titers were determined using a plaque assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057111435236">13</xref></sup> The concentration of procyanidin required to inhibit virus titer by 50% (50% effective concentrations [EC<sub>50</sub>]) was calculated using Origin 8.0 software. The antiviral index (AI) is represented as the ratio of IC<sub>50</sub> to EC<sub>50</sub>.</p>

<title>Time-of-Addition Experiments</title>
<p>To detect which stage(s) the IAV life cycle was inhibited by procyanidin, we performed a time-of-addition experiment, as reported previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057111435236">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057111435236"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057111435236">18</xref></sup> which contained four tests: (1) Before infection, the virus was incubated with a medium containing procyanidin (25 µg/mL) for 3 h; (2) before infection, MDCK cells were incubated with a medium containing procyanidin (25 µg/mL) for 3 h; (3) procyanidin was added during viral adsorption for 1 h and removed by washing three times with PBS; and (4) procyanidin (25 µg/mL) was added at the beginning of incubation and removed by washing three times with PBS at the different time points after virus challenge. The incubation time was 24 h (MOI = 0.001). Other performances were same with the aforementioned plaque inhibition assay.</p>

<title>Dot-Like Aggregation of EGFP-LC3II onto Autophagosomes</title>
<p>After transfection with the pEGFP-LC3 plasmid for 6 h, A549 cells were infected with IAV (MOI = 2.0) and treated with drugs. At 8 h postinfection (PI), the cells were visualized under an invert fluorescence microscope (10 × 40), and the percentages of cells containing EGFP-LC3 dots to cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were calculated in 10 fields chosen at random from three independent experiments.</p>

<title>Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)</title>
<p>Extraction of RNA and RT-PCR reactions was performed according to the protocol of the TRIzol Reagent Kit and RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). The PCR product was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel and visualized on a UV-transilluminator.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>The anti-LC3B antibody, anti-beclin1 antibody, anti-Atg5 antibody, anti-Atg7 antibody, anti-Atg12 antibody, and anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and performed as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057111435236">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>BiFC-FRET Analysis</title>
<p>To assess the influence of procyanidin on the dissociation of the beclin-bcl2 heterodimer by the BiFC assay, A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates for 24 h. After being cotransfected with the pMN-beclin and pMC-bcl2 plasmids for 6 h, the cells were infected with IAV at an MOI of 2 for 8 h. After 1 h at 4 °C, the fluorescence intensities were determined at 610 ± 10 nm after excitation at 587 ± 20 nm using a Tecan infinite M1000 premium Quad4 monochromator microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The BiFC signals were shown as ΔFI<sub>610nm</sub> after deduction of the background fluorescence intensity.</p>
<p>Because the influence of procyanidin on the formation of the Atg5-Atg12 heterodimer will influence the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer, we only quantified the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal between the Atg5-Atg12 heterodimer and Atg16. A549 cells were seeded onto a 96-well microplate for 24 h, and after being cotransfected with the pMN-Atg5, pMC-Atg12, and pEGFP-Atg16 plasmids for 6 h, the cells were infected with IAV at an MOI of 2, washed three times, and incubated for 8 h. After 1 h at 4 °C, the fluorescence intensities were determined by a Tecan infinite M1000 premium Quad4 monochromator microplate reader using the following settings: excitation at 488 nm with a 20-nm bandwidth, emission at 610 nm and 509 nm with a 20-nm bandwidth, a 100-µs lag time, and a 200-µs integration time. All FRET values were deducted against the background value, and the FRET efficiency (FRET<sup>e</sup>), expressed as the ratio of acceptor- and donor-emission intensities, was calculated according to the instructions of the Magellan Standard Soft (Tecan infinite M1000) and as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057111435236">20</xref></sup>:</p>

After 6 h, the cells were infected with IAV at an MOI of 2, washed three times, and incubated for 8 h. After 1 h at 4 °C, the cells were fixed using 3% formaldehyde for 20 min and visualized using an upright fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). All images were acquired under the same setting.

<title>Establishment of the IAV vRNA Promoter Luciferase Reporter HTS Platform and the Initial Screening by This Platform</title>
<p>The design of the IAV vRNA promoter luciferase reporter HTS platform is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111435236"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>. As shown in the figure, a negative strand of luciferase gene (–Luc) is flanked by the UTRs at the 5′ (13 nt) and 3′ (12 nt) termini, called the vRNA promoter, and then further flanked by the human pol-I promoter (rRNA promoter) and pol-I terminator. After transcription of this pPolI-vluc plasmid, a negative strand of luciferase RNA (–Luc RNA) flanked by the UTRs at the 5′ (13 nt) and 3′ (12 nt) termini would produce in cell nucleus transcribed by human rRNA promoter. After infection with IAV, the PA, PB1, PB2, and NP proteins of IAV would enter the cell nucleus and form vRNPs, which would transcribe the negative strand luciferase RNA (–Luc RNA) into positive strand luciferase RNA (+Luc RNA); +Luc RNA could be translated into luciferase. Determination of the activity of luciferase could detect the influence of testing drugs on IAV replication.</p>

In the establishment of our HTS platform, we first constructed a pPol-1 vector that contained a human pol-I promoter, and then we inserted a negative strand luciferase (–Luc) gene flanked by the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of the IAV A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1) NP segment to construct a pPolI-vluc plasmid.

When the two proteins interact, the two nonfluorescent fragments are brought into proximity, and an intact fluorescent protein will be reconstituted.

(<bold>M–P</bold>) The BiFC assay for the interaction of beclin1 and bcl2. A549 cells were cotransfected with the pMC-beclin1 and pMN-bcl2 plasmids. After excitation at 587 nm, the fluorescence intensity was detected at 610 nm using a microplate reader.

(<bold>R</bold>) The BiFC signal of the beclin1-bcl2 heterodimer is expressed as ΔFI<sub>610 nm</sub> after the deduction of the background fluorescence intensity. In the blank group (BG), the cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids but not infected with influenza A virus (IAV). In the negative control (NC), positive control (PC), and procyanidin (Pro) groups, the cells were transfected and infected with IAV. In the NC group, the cells were not treated with drug, whereas in the PC and Pro groups, the cells were treated with ribavirin (25 µg/mL) and procyanidin (25 µg/mL), respectively. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 2.0; incubation time = 8 h.

<p>Then we examined the influence of procyanidin on the dissociation of the beclin1-bcl2 heterodimer. After infection with virus, the BiFC signal in the NC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>Fig. 6N</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>R</bold></xref>) significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decreased as compared with that in the BG group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>Fig. 6M</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>R</bold></xref>), whereas the BiFC signals in ribavirin-treated and procyanidin-treated groups significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>Fig. 6O</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>P</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111435236"><bold>R</bold></xref>) as compared with the NC group. This indicates that ribavirin and procyanidin could promote the stability of the beclin1-bcl2 heterodimer.</p>
<p>To further confirm the influence of procyanidin on the interaction between the Atg5-Atg12 heterodimer and Atg16 in physiological conditions, we performed the immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-Atg5 antibody and then performed a Western blot assay using the anti-Atg16 antibody. We found that Atg5 could co-immunoprecipitate with Atg16; after infection with IAV, the conjugation of Atg5 and Atg16 was obviously increased, and ribavirin and procyanidin could inhibit these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1087057111435236"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>). Using the same method, we found that beclin1 could co-immunoprecipitate with bcl2; after infection with IAV, the conjugation of beclin1 and bcl2 was obviously decreased, but ribavirin and procyanidin could increase the level of the beclin1-bcl2 heterodimer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When confronted with a sudden outbreak of an IAV pandemic, no matter what subtype it is, an HTS platform that can screen the drugs effective against all types of IAV will be very useful. Our HTS platform has this character. In our HTS platform, we use the common promoter of all IAV subtypes, which is highly conserved among all types of IAV and among the eight segments themselves, so in theory, this HTS platform should have excellent universality, and in fact, we have found that eight strains of IAV, including four subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2, and H5N1), can transcribe this common vRNA promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111435236"><bold>Fig. 1E</bold></xref>). Therefore, we deduce that the drugs screened by this HTS platform may have the ability to inhibit all subtypes of IAV, which will be very useful for the sudden outbreak of pandemics.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this HTS platform, the transfection efficiency can reach 60% to 80% (i.e., 60%−80% cells in a well of a 96-well plate can be transfected), and the MOI we used is 0.01—that is, in the first round of infection, only 1% of cells are infected, and a large number of cells are not infected but have been transfected with the pPolI-vLuc plasmid, so several rounds of infection will take place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111435236"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). The drugs that inhibit the replication of IAV at any stage of the IAV life cycle (e.g., entry, uncoating, biosynthesis, and assembly) will decrease the yield of progeny viruses and thus decrease the infectious dose of the virus at the next round of infection, so the total yield of luciferase will decrease. Therefore, this platform also provides a method for screening anti-IAV drugs, no matter which stage(s) of the virus life cycle they target.</p>
<p>Using this HTS platform, we screened 83 examples of Chinese herbal medicine and obtained 35 examples that could significantly inhibit IAV vRNA promoter transcription activity. After examining a lot of literature, we found at least 7 examples that had not been reported up to now (i.e., <italic>Peucedanum praeruptorum</italic> Dunn., <italic>Lantana camara</italic> L., <italic>Litsea cubeba [Lour.]</italic> Pers., <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> L., <italic>V. angustifolium</italic> Ait., <italic>V. vinifera</italic> L, and <italic>C. cassia</italic> Presl); many of the others had been recorded or reported in Chinese ancient or modernistic literature but many not in scientific journals. There is a common problem in the research of traditional Chinese medicine: The active ingredient and mechanism of action are not clear. As for the above 7 examples, we found that <italic>V. angustifolium</italic> Ait., <italic>V. vinifera</italic> L, and <italic>C. cassia</italic> Presl are rich in procyanidin, and many studies show that procyanidin is one of the major active ingredients of these herbal medicines, so we decided to research its effect and mechanism on anti-IAV infection.</p>
<p>Procyanidin is a very strong antioxidant. IAV infection will lead to the accumulation of autophagosomes by producing a lot of ROS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111435236">9</xref></sup> so we speculate that the antioxidant of procyanidin may be related to its anti-IAV activity by inhibiting the accumulation of autophagosomes induced by IAV. In our study, the plaque inhibition assay showed that procyanidin could inhibit the replication of IAV. The Western blot and dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3II assays showed it could inhibit the accumulation of LC3II, which showed that procyanidin could reduce the autophagy induced by IAV. The RT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that procyanidin could inhibit the expression of the autophagic genes Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. The BiFC-FRET and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that procyanidin could inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer and the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 heterodimer. So we think that one of the mechanisms of procyanidin on anti-IAV infection is related to its ability to inhibit the autophagic gene expression and the autophagic signal pathway. But it is only a part of the mechanism of its anti-IAV activity because our time-of-addition experiments have shown that procyanidin can inactivate IAV directly. Moreover, procyanidin also can inhibit the NF-kappaB signal pathway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057111435236">28</xref></sup> which is an important pathway needed by IAV replication.</p>
<p>Phytotherapy has a long history to cope with resistance against viruses and plays a fundamental role in traditional medicines in China, Korea, Japan, and India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057111435236">29</xref></sup> In 2009, the swine H1N1 IAV pandemic originated from Mexico and the United States, which prompted the Chinese government to release three editions of a document titled ‘‘Recommended Schemes for Pandemic Influenza A Diagnoses and Treatments.’’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057111435236">30</xref></sup> The third edition recommends the use of not only oseltamivir and zanamivir but also four anti-flu traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. In fighting the pandemic, traditional Chinese medicines have played a significant role. But the mechanism of action of many traditional Chinese medicines is poorly understood, so our task and purpose are not only to select these drugs but also to rapidly categorize these drugs according to their targets of action and obtain the most optimal prescriptions.</p>
