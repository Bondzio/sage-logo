<p>Due to the imperatives of furthering development and curbing global warming, the novel trend of nuclear renaissance has become prevalent on the east coast of China during the past decade. The country has begun aggregating a considerable amount of capital and resources with the goal of expanding its nuclear energy capacity. There are currently 11 nuclear power units in operation and 24 reactors under construction. A four-fold increase of operating nuclear power plants is projected after 15 years, according to the original plan; however, dramatic political effects following the recent Fukushima nuclear incident have slowed the proposed expansion. The newly envisaged construction plans have also been suspended by the State Council due to widespread security concerns.</p>
<p><italic>The Politics of Nuclear Energy in China</italic> was published at a time when the issue of global warming and the ‘nuclear power great leap forward’ intersected. It includes a systematic analysis of the factors which have shaped nuclear energy development in China. Discussing issues of cost effectiveness, decision-making processes, lobbying interests, technology, fiscal policy, and even public participation, Xu Yi-chong examines the narratives related to the development of nuclear energy since 1939. He diachronically explores continuities and changes in nuclear power development by adopting Douglass C. North’s approach as an analytical framework. Xu investigates the spectrum of individual actors and organizations under formal and informal institutional repertoires as well as the incentive structure under which the actors pursue their goals in China’s political context.</p>
<p>As opposed to the development of nuclear power in Western countries, the vexing question surrounding the development of nuclear power in China, according to Xu, is not whether the country ought to adopt nuclear power, but rather how it should develop nuclear power. Instead of a single, integrated policy enhanced with a relatively tight network such as in France, United Kingdom, and South Korea, governance of nuclear energy in China is still carried out using what Kenneth Liberthal and Michel Oksenberg defined as ‘fragmented authoritarianism’ (<italic>Policy Making in China: Leaders, Structures, and Processes</italic>, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988), in which the lack of a coherent policymaking agency and competition amid various actors and bureaucracies creates constant bargaining in the policymaking process. In this regard, the nuclear energy sector is not immune to the hurdle that has long plagued Chinese technology adaptation: institutional fragmentation disabling good governance of science and technology research and nuclear power implementation. Nevertheless, in terms of the decision-making process, Xu points out that the three dominant policy communities of the science and technology sector – namely, the Chinese Communist Party, the military, and the scientific community – have reached out to previously excluded actors such as various key ministries, provincial governments, electricity corporations, think tanks, and industry organizations. Meanwhile, a series of institutional changes have enabled diversified investments in power projects, allowing the breaking of the monopoly held by state-owned enterprises, which has motivated numerous players to participate in the electricity sector. This is one of the reasons why nuclear power has expanded since 2002.</p>
<p>Yet, as Xu argues, the strategy of self-reliance combined with importing advanced technology has completely failed. Despite the fact that nuclear energy has gained widespread public support as an alternative for addressing the current dependency on coal, the heated debate over the path of nuclear technology adaptation has been limited to whether or not the development of nuclear energy ought to be done in cooperation with a foreign partner. Ultimately, technological or economic impediments are not the most significant constraints hindering the development of nuclear energy; rather, institutional capacity and the extent to which the rules of the game can be shifted towards effective implementation remain the key factors in determining the future of nuclear power.</p>
<p>To sum up, <italic>The Politics of Nuclear Energy in China</italic> provides an empirical account of the decision-making process and offers rational explanations of political behaviour under complex political configurations. With its analysis from a historical perspective, this book is worth reading for those who are interested in understanding the interaction and/or contestation between various actors involved in the deployment of nuclear energy in China.</p>
