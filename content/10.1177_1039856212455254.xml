<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Over the last decade there has been a reduction in the number of junior medical staff recruited into psychiatry in Australia and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212455254">1</xref></sup> The reasons for this decline are multiple and complex. Psychiatry is considered the least attractive medical specialty due to a perceived lack of prestige, apparent lack of scientific foundation, perceived low effectiveness of treatments and the limited degree to which it draws upon medical training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212455254">2</xref></sup> Other factors include stigma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212455254">3</xref></sup> the poor image of psychiatry in the media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212455254">4</xref></sup> and poor marketing of psychiatry as a career.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212455254">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Metro North Mental Health - Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (MNMH-RBWH) is one of the busiest mental health services in Queensland. It has a catchment population of 300,000, 134 beds and 430 staff across the hospital and community services, with 41 psychiatrists and 30 registrars. With three RBWH registrars awarded Maddison Medallions for the best exam performance across Australia and New Zealand by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) in 2004, 2007 and 2011, the service has a reputation for excellent psychiatric training and, unlike most Queensland Mental Health Services, has historically not experienced difficulty recruiting psychiatric trainees.</p>
<p>However, it became apparent over 2007–2008 that the number of trainees recruited from amongst RBWH junior doctors was declining and, in 2008 and 2009, none of our new trainees was from within the RBWH. As a major teaching hospital, we were clearly not fulfilling one of our key roles and we obtained our psychiatric trainees from largely non-metropolitan hospitals, thus depleting their workforce.</p>
<p>When we investigated the reasons for this, junior doctors reported having found their mental health experience unsatisfactory. They attributed this to lack of orientation and poor understanding of their role, and described almost exclusively becoming the ‘ward doctors’ whose primary role was to oversee the medical management of inpatients (e.g. physical examinations, investigations, writing up medication sheets).</p>
<p>Coincidently, we learned of an innovative new program entitled ‘Engaging Interns (PGYI) and Residents (PGY2) in Mental Health Training’, developed by Dr Kealy-Bateman, Director of Training at Illawarra Mental Health Service, in response to difficulties attracting psychiatric registrars to that service. Based on the Australian Curriculum Framework for Junior Doctors Version 2.1, the program was designed to provide junior doctors with a range of psychiatric experiences during their rotation. Implementation was followed by a substantial increase in applications for psychiatry training.</p>
<p>With a view to improving the training experience of RBWH junior doctors, the RBWH invited Dr Kealy-Bateman to present his ‘Illawarra Program’ at our Psychiatric Grand Rounds. This presentation was well received by our medical staff and we formed a working party to introduce a similar program at the RBWH. We developed a modified Illawarra checklist for our junior doctors to guide and record their mental health training. The psychiatry experience was to include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856212455254" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>interviewing and admitting patients;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>presenting history and mental state examination to a registrar;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>discussing risk assessments;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>performing suicide risk assessments;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>attending the Psychiatric Emergency Centre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>attending community clinics and home visits;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>witnessing electro-convulsive therapy (ECT);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>attending a Mental Health Review Tribunal hearing;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>attendance at five tutorials on (i) rapid tranquilisation/management of agitated patients, re-feeding syndrome and anxiety; (ii) mental status examination (MSE) and cognitive assessment; (iii) Psychosis and the Mental Health Act; (iv) substance use disorders; and (v) suicide, depression, self-harm and the vulnerable personality;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>invitations to our weekly psychiatric grand rounds and journal club.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Pleasingly, in 2010, one year after the introduction of the new programme, we again started to recruit RBWH junior doctors. In 2010 and 2011 we recruited three RBWH junior doctors each year into psychiatry. We also started to receive positive junior doctor feedback following their psychiatry rotation.</p>
<p>A further impetus to embedding our program came in 2011, when the Queensland Medical Education Council allocated our service a Psychiatry Medical Education Registrar (an advanced psychiatric trainee in her elective year) to co-ordinate and supervise junior doctors. We saw the impact of this position on our recruitment for 2012, with a total of six interns from the RBWH entering psychiatry training. Because the Medical Education Registrar was only available for 12 months, the duties of our Chief Psychiatric Registrar have been amended to ensure junior doctor training continues as a priority.</p>
<p>In summary, over the last 10 years there has been growing difficulty in attracting junior doctors into psychiatric training, but this is not inevitable. The Illawarra and the RBWH experiences demonstrate that providing junior doctors undertaking psychiatry rotations with rewarding and meaningful training experiences in psychiatry can greatly improve recruitment into our speciality.</p>
