<abstract>
<p>Much of the memorialization of John XXIII centres around clichés and stereotypes of a humble peasant pope elected to a ‘transitional’ papacy. In truth, Angelo Roncalli was an historian who brought the perspective of history to the papacy, in particular, a close study of the Council of Trent and the reforms instituted by St Charles Borromeo. Roncalli’s scholarship was highly significant not simply in his decision to call Vatican II but, more importantly, in his style of leadership, the language that he used and the historical framework that guided his ideas. The central idea for John XXIII was how the church undertakes the process of change and adapts itself to the challenges of a new historical era. The pope’s call for <italic>aggiornamento</italic> needs to be contextualized to his wide reading of history and his intuition of a new historical epoch for the church and the world in the course of the 20th century.</p>

<p>In his magisterial work, <italic>What Happened at Vatican II</italic>, John O’Malley SJ uses a clever literary device to speak of those ‘present’ in St Peter’s Basilica for the Second Vatican Council: not just the Council Fathers, lay auditors and representatives of other churches and denominations, but a complex group of historical characters that, according to O’Malley, seemed to have had an influence on the very convocation of the council:<disp-quote>
<p>Hauntingly present in St Peter’s were de Maistre, de Lamennais, Pius IX, and Pius X. Present as well were Guéranger, Beauduin, Migne, Mersch and Lagrange. Alongside them were Möhler, Newman, and Teilhard de Chardin. In a dark corner skulked Darwin, Marx and Freud. Not to be forgotten in a brighter corner were folks like Maréchal and Buber. The ghosts of Mussolini and Hitler found entrance. Pope Pius XI was present in the basilica, but Pius XII stepped into the spotlight at almost every juncture. This list is far from complete.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1030570X13486785">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The list is indeed far from complete. Without any shadow of a doubt, another character ‘present’ in St Peter’s Basilica for the Council was St Charles Borromeo (1538–1584), the great reforming bishop of Milan following the Council of Trent (1545–1563). Borromeo was ‘present’ at Vatican II because he played a decisive role in the historical and intellectual formation of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the much loved Pope John XXIII (1958–1963). Roncalli was an historian who brought the perspective of history to the papacy, in particular, a close study of the Council of Trent and the reforming work of Borromeo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1030570X13486785">2</xref></sup> Roncalli’s critical five-volume study (hereafter called the <italic>Atti</italic>) undertaken throughout the course of his life was highly significant not simply in John XXIII’s decision to call Vatican II but, more importantly, in his style of leadership, the language that he used and the historical framework that guided his ideas. The key question for Roncalli was how the church undertakes the process of change and adapts itself (and its mission) to the challenges of a new historical epoch. The Vatican Council’s call for <italic>aggiornamento</italic> needs to be contextualized to Roncalli’s wide reading of history and his intuition of a new historical epoch for the church and the world in the mid-20th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1030570X13486785">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>When did Roncalli first ‘meet’ Charles Borromeo? Roncalli was born in the small village of Sotto il Monte, just outside of Bergamo in northern Italy, on 25 November 1881. Bergamo is part of the ecclesiastical province of the prestigious archdiocese of Milan. Since his death in 1584 and subsequent canonization in 1610, Borromeo has often been seen as the model par excellence for Catholic clergy, especially bishops. Devotion to Borromeo permeated post-Tridentine Catholic clerical formation, especially in northern Italy, where Roncalli was born. As he commenced studies in the minor seminary at Celana, just outside Sotto il Monte, Roncalli remembered the sculpted image of Borromeo on the front door of the college that Borromeo had founded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1030570X13486785">4</xref></sup> In his great spiritual testament <italic>Journal of a Soul</italic>, commenced when he was a teenager, Roncalli wrote, ‘I have been many days without going to confession. And to think that St Charles Borromeo went to confession twice a day!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1030570X13486785">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following studies in Rome and ordination to the priesthood in 1904, Roncalli returned to Bergamo as the secretary of the newly appointed Bishop Giacomo Radini-Tedeschi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1030570X13486785">6</xref></sup> Roncalli spent nine years closely working with the bishop, who modelled for him social awareness and a zealous commitment to pastoral ministry, especially the extensive visitation of the diocese of Bergamo and the convoking of a diocesan synod in 1910. During this time, Roncalli was lecturer in history, patristics and apologetics at the diocesan seminary. Roncalli also found the time to research and publish articles on the previous bishops of Bergamo and the history of diocesan synods. Synods and councils began to shape Roncalli’s historical thinking.</p>
<p>In 1906 while accompanying Bishop Tedeschi, who was involved in the planning of a forthcoming provincial council, to Milan, Roncalli took himself off to the diocesan archives and made an astonishing discovery that would have lifelong implications. Roncalli discovered dozens of pages of archival material regarding Borromeo’s apostolic visitation to the diocese of Bergamo in 1575 in the wake of the Council of Trent. For the avid historian, this discovery captured his historical imagination, as he later wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>I had nothing interesting to do while I waited except to visit the large archdiocesan archives that house many yet unexplored historical treasures, and not just those of the Archdiocese of Milan. I was immediately taken with the collection of thirty-nine parchment volumes entitled <italic>Archivio Spirituale – Bergamo</italic>. I explored these and returned to see them on successive visits. What a pleasant surprise for me! To find all those interesting documents on the Church of Bergamo in one place, which at the time following Trent – the most intense period of fervor of the Catholic Counter-Reformation – was so noted for Church renewal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1030570X13486785">7</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Roncalli brought this material to the attention of the bishop. Tedeschi convened a special diocesan committee with Roncalli as secretary to copy the material, transcribe it, edit it and prepare it for publication to coincide with the 300th anniversary of Borromeo’s canonization, which was due to be celebrated in 1910. The material took considerable time to prepare and the first volume was almost ready for publication. However, by 1914, the First World War had broken out, Tedeschi had died, Roncalli had been moved aside, and the new bishop showed little enthusiasm for the project. But Roncalli stored the material and held onto the dream of one day seeing it published.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1030570X13486785"><title>Trent and Borromeo</title>
<p>In the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic>, Roncalli framed Trent and Borromeo in a particular way. He reinterpreted Trent and Borromeo by moving away from the polemical anti-Protestant/Counter-Reformation historical perspective in order to embrace the little understood or appreciated sub-text of Trent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1030570X13486785">8</xref></sup> – pastoral renewal, concern for the <italic>cura animarum</italic> or the care of souls, the reform of ecclesiastical discipline such as obligatory residence for bishops, and the restructure of diocesan governance that required the regular convocation of synods and provincial councils and regular episcopal visitation. For Roncalli, Borromeo was the bishop par excellence and the principal agent in terms of enacting Trent’s decrees regarding pastoral renewal and episcopal solicitude for the <italic>cura animarum</italic>.</p>
<p>Who was Charles Borromeo? He was born in Arona near Lago Maggiore in 1538 and studied canon and civil law at the University of Pavia. Borromeo was called to Rome by his uncle Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) and named Secretary of State with responsibility for the papal states. He was appointed ‘administrator’ of the diocese of Milan in 1560 and participated in the last session of the Council of Trent in 1563. Borromeo received the full title of Archbishop of Milan after episcopal consecration in 1563 and entered Milan in 1565 to take possession of his see. He was the first resident bishop in more than 80 years. This is a highly significant fact in the evolution of Borromeo’s ecclesiastical career and in his remarkable transformation from curial bureaucrat of his uncle-pope to the ‘pastor of souls’ in the diocese of Milan and model bishop throughout the entire Lombard region of Italy. This pastoral dimension of Borromeo’s life and ministry took concrete shape when he followed Trent’s injunction for bishops to reside in their diocese and to have charge of one diocese only. To do so, Borromeo resigned all Roman offices and surrendered those titles and duties that would have prevented him from fully embodying Trent’s requirement of residence for diocesan bishops.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1030570X13486785">9</xref></sup> Borromeo undertook regular and systematic visitation of his own diocese of Milan as well as extensive apostolic visitation of the dioceses of his province such as the Bergamo visit of 1575. This is what captured Roncalli’s historical imagination and life-long fascination.</p>
<p>What was the nature of Borromeo’s apostolic visitation to Bergamo in 1575? The <italic>Atti</italic> contains reports of pastoral visitation and episcopal decrees issued by Borromeo on his three-month visitation to Bergamo that are recorded in both Latin and Italian. The visitation was extensive and included the diocesan curia and cathedral chapter, convents and monasteries of men and women religious, hospitals and charitable institutions, all parish churches and places of worship, and numerous lay confraternities. There are extensive parish inventories regarding the state of the built fabric and the number and condition of ecclesiastical requisites such as vestments, church plate, furnishings and art work. There are also numerous petitions to Borromeo regarding the improper conduct of clergy, disputes regarding church property and the dispersal of ecclesiastical funds, and the absence of clergy from their parishes, which caused lay people to complain about the deficiency of Masses, the lack of catechetical instruction and other devotional activities.</p>
<p>Despite the contested theological agenda of the Protestant Reformation, the Council of Trent legislated that it was the responsibility of bishops to address local issues of their dioceses as a matter of urgency and correct deficiencies such as the absence of clergy from parishes, the scandalous nature of multiple benefices, the relatively inferior nature of clerical training and the poor quality of the built fabric in some parish communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1030570X13486785">10</xref></sup> While Trent felt the need to issue ‘<italic>anathema sit</italic>’ in order to enforce doctrinal compliance regarding disputed theological matters, the council also emphasized the development of a specifically ‘pastoral’ style of ministry, exemplified by Borromeo, in order to counter Protestant objections regarding the long and sometimes total absences of bishops and parish priests from the territories entrusted to their care. As O’Malley states, this pastoral dimension of Trent ‘was about transforming bishops from collectors of benefices into pastors of souls’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1030570X13486785">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1030570X13486785"><title>Critical historical scholarship</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the project of editing and publishing the contents of the <italic>Atti</italic> collapsed in 1914. It was a ‘nice idea’, but many historical forces militated against its success. Three decades later, Roncalli resumed the work of editing this material. The historical context is significant. By this stage, Roncalli had left his native Bergamo and was serving as papal diplomat in the Orient, first in Bulgaria (1925–1934) and then in Turkey and Greece (1934–1944). As a papal diplomat, Roncalli self-consciously described his diplomatic missions as the ‘pastoral’ endeavour of the bishop, to be pastor, shepherd and father of all regardless of religious or cultural differences. Roncalli was exercising this ministry in places where the Catholic Church was in a minority and often treated with suspicion by the Orthodox. As the secretary of his beloved bishop in Bergamo, Radini-Tedeschi, Roncalli had seen at first hand the value of extensive pastoral visitation of the diocese by the bishop. Now he was undertaking this ministry himself, often going to isolated regions and encountering small pockets of Catholics that had not seen a priest in years, let alone a bishop.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1030570X13486785">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a remarkable burst of energy and activity, Roncalli resumed the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic> in the early 1930s. He was now a bishop himself exercising that same pastoral ministry he had witnessed in Radini-Tedeschi and literally ‘following’ Borromeo as he studied the latter’s visitation of the Bergamo diocese in 1575. In this historical study, Roncalli brings together the world of Trent and Borromeo and his own daily experience as a bishop and papal representative. One of the driving forces behind the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic> was the fact that Roncalli not only discerned meaning in the past but retrieved meaning from this past world of Trent and Borromeo as revealed in the <italic>Atti</italic>, in order to address a question, an issue or an intellectual preoccupation. For Roncalli, the question or driving force related to his understanding of the Christian tradition and how the church changes in the course of its history and adapts itself to new historical circumstances. Roncalli discerned in Trent a period of change, renewal and adaptation for the church, in particular, a renewed understanding of the office of bishop as exemplified by Borromeo through his use of instruments such as provincial councils, diocesan synods and extensive episcopal/apostolic visitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1030570X13486785">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the <italic>Atti</italic> acts as a key critical source that enabled Roncalli to construct both an historical framework and language around which he shaped his vision of Vatican II and his sense of discerning <italic>aggiornamento</italic> for the Catholic Church of the 20th century. This historical framework articulated at Vatican II and in its designation as a ‘predominantly pastoral council’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1030570X13486785">14</xref></sup> bears direct relationship to Roncalli’s lifelong study of Trent and Borromeo. As an historian, Roncalli uses the <italic>Atti</italic> to develop a lifelong sensitivity to history, an increasing openness to critical thinking and an ability to discern meaning in, and to link, somewhat forgotten historical periods. Above all, it demonstrates the capacity to negotiate the process of historical change which he intuits throughout the 20th century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1030570X13486785"><title>The prism of pastoral ministry</title>
<p>Roncalli published the first volume of the <italic>Atti</italic> in 1936. By this stage, he had been a bishop and papal diplomat in Bulgaria for almost ten years and was discerning ‘a new era for the Catholic Church in the Orient … new times, new needs, new forms’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1030570X13486785">15</xref></sup> This historicized form of language is crucial not only to Roncalli’s interpretation of Trent, but, more importantly, to his later convocation of Vatican II and his sense that the Catholic Church in the course of the 20th century was entering ‘a new historical era’. The first volume of the <italic>Atti</italic> was not the work of some amateur history enthusiast. It was published by the Jewish firm Olschki, a highly reputable Florentine publisher, and thus is a work that corresponds to the highest standards of critical scholarship. The dense volumes of the <italic>Atti</italic> are certainly not ‘page-turning best sellers’, but neither are they purely of a hagiographical nature or the amateur efforts of someone writing local history.</p>
<p>In many of the biographies of John XXIII, brief references are made to his editing of the <italic>Atti.</italic> Some of the authors often treat this as Roncalli’s hobby or pastime during his years in the Orient, in much the same way that one collects stamps or makes model aeroplanes. What they miss is the fact that they are dealing with a serious historian thinking critically about some of the crucial historical, theological and ecclesial issues of the day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1030570X13486785">16</xref></sup> Roncalli uses history to help him interpret change and to come to an understanding of how the church responds to the challenges of a new epoch. Roncalli would often work on the <italic>Atti</italic> late into the night after the business of papal diplomacy was done for the day. Roncalli’s engagement with the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic> can be described by adopting the words of Macchiavelli:<disp-quote>
<p>On the coming of evening, I return to my house and enter my study; and at the door I take off the day’s clothing, covered with mud and dust, and I put on garments regal and courtly; and reclothed appropriately, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them with affection, I feed on that food which only is mine and which I was born for.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1030570X13486785">17</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>As an historian and papal diplomat, Roncalli uses the <italic>Atti</italic> to enter ‘the ancient courts of ancient men’. He enters the world of Trent and Borromeo to find meaning in the past in order to shape his sense of the present and the future.</p>
<p>Roncalli’s Introduction to Volume 1 of the <italic>Atti</italic> published in 1936 is a highly specialized piece of historical writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1030570X13486785">18</xref></sup> In it, Roncalli retraces the origin of the project in Milan in 1906, the diocesan commission in Bergamo that was formed and then disbanded, and the desire to publish something edifying about Borromeo and the historical traditions of Bergamo. In discussing the Council of Trent, Roncalli shifted the historical discourse from the polemical and disputatious nature of the Reformation/Counter-Reformation and stated that Trent contributed to ‘a vigorous regaining of Catholic life’. Roncalli only makes two indirect references to the Counter-Reformation. Despite the religious upheaval of the time, he called this ‘a period of mysterious and fruitful rejuvenation for the Church’. In the reform decrees of Trent, Roncalli detected a ‘pastoral ardour’ that contributed ‘to the transformation and spiritual elevation of clergy and people’. He believed that the Council of Trent ‘had awakened a potent force of energy that was unknown in any previous period of the history of the Church’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1030570X13486785">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the Introduction, Roncalli reserved a special place of honour for Borromeo in bringing about or enacting the pastoral directives of Trent. According to Roncalli, Borromeo is justifiably hailed as the master/model bishop who ‘extended the benefits of his prodigious reforming activity throughout the parishes of the Lombard region’. Borromeo is recognized for his pastoral zeal in applying the spirit of Catholic reform. Here, Roncalli is shifting the historical discourse away from the more severe and ascetic myths of Borromeo as a hardline enforcer of Tridentine legislation towards a concept of him ‘as a man able to respond to the new and changing needs of the time and of the restoration of Christian life in all its forms and manifestations’. Far from being a rigorist, Roncalli argues that Borromeo possessed the exquisite art of being able to provide for the needs of the time and adapt himself as circumstances warranted. To all intents and purposes, it appears that the author is ‘writing himself in the text’.</p>
<p>Having framed Trent and Borromeo in a more positive light, Roncalli goes on in the Introduction to describe the importance of provincial councils and diocesan synods as prescribed by Trent and enacted by Borromeo. This is a key concept for Roncalli, the sense of life, dynamism and renewal promoted by the church when acting in a ‘collegial’ manner, that is through general/ecumenical councils, provincial councils of an ecclesiastical province, or diocesan synods. In the eyes of Roncalli, Trent (and Borromeo) promoted a new awakening for the church, a new way of ‘doing business’ through the instruments of provincial councils and synods of which, according to Roncalli, the province of Milan was the best exemplar. While Roncalli was studying the historical changes instituted by Trent and Borromeo, he was undertaking the ministry of papal diplomacy in the Orient where, in both the predominantly Orthodox and Catholic Eastern tradition, synods have pride of place in how the church goes about its business. Whatever the nature of the debates regarding the so called ‘spirit of Vatican II’, there is no doubt that in the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic>, Roncalli definitely discerns a certain ‘pastoral spirit’ around Trent and Borromeo that shapes and guides his vision of the Church.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1030570X13486785"><title>Paris/Venice/Rome</title>
<p>Soon after his arrival in Paris, Roncalli witnessed the publication of Volume 4 of the <italic>Atti</italic> in 1946. A significant amount of the work of transcription, composition and correction of the proofs had been done by his erstwhile Bergamasque collaborator Don Pietro Forno (1877–1938).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1030570X13486785">20</xref></sup> By this time, Roncalli was approximately 65 years of age, with a heavy workload given the prestigious nature of his position as Apostolic Nuncio in Paris. Time had always been his enemy and age was advancing. Finance to fund the publishing of the <italic>Atti</italic> relied on the generosity of benefactors from Italy when this was possible. Forno had died in 1938 leaving more of the administrative and technical details to Roncalli. But the <italic>Atti</italic> and the world of Trent and Borromeo was the lens through which Roncalli continued to view the church, its history, the necessity for change and adaptation and his own personal life and ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1030570X13486785">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a particular intensity in Roncalli’s diary entries for this period. At Sotto il Monte in 1950 for the customary one month of annual leave Roncalli stated: ‘Today I have recommenced preparations for my final volume <italic>Gli Atti d. V. A. di S. Carlo Borromeo a Bergamo</italic> with great pleasure and keenness. That S. Carlo will help me to not delay any longer.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1030570X13486785">22</xref></sup> During this same period of annual leave, Roncalli wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>My work on the fifth volume ties me to the desk … . If I had fifteen days of total freedom, my work would be finished. That conversation with all the Bergamasque souls of 1575 in the company of S. Carlo Borromeo gladdens and edifies my soul. It tells me amongst other things that <italic>omnia temus habent</italic> (all things have their time), and that the times are similar: and the pessimism of the present is neither rational or useful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1030570X13486785">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This diary entry deserves analysis. First, Roncalli calls his work on the <italic>Atti</italic> a ‘conversation’ with the people of Bergamo in 1575, hinting at a sense of intimacy and familiarity. This is a diocese that Roncalli loved and knew so well, especially in the intimate way he ‘follows’ Borromeo across the city and diocese of Bergamo in the course of the latter’s visitation. But what is the nature of this conversation that, according to Roncalli, gladdens and edifies his soul? No doubt, it is the more ‘pastoral’ dimension that Roncalli gave to Borromeo’s apostolic visitation notwithstanding the many instances of necessary inspection, correction and at times severe judgment on immoral behaviour.</p>
<p>During his time as Apostolic Nuncio in Paris (1944–1953), Roncalli continued the nightly vigil of working on Volume 5 of the <italic>Atti</italic> at the end of a heavy day of commitments. On a visit to Rome for official business, he snatched a free morning to continue correcting the proofs of the <italic>Atti</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1030570X13486785">24</xref></sup> On successive visits to Sotto il Monte, Roncalli continued to find small amounts of time dedicated to correcting the proofs. Even wet weather outside was an advantage, to keep Roncalli indoors and working at the desk. Months go by and there are gaps in his diary where Roncalli does not mention the <italic>Atti</italic>. At one stage, Roncalli had taken to working in a separate room on the top floor of the nunciature in Paris in order to finish the <italic>Atti</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1030570X13486785">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic>, Roncalli kept alive a vivid sense of ‘conciliar’ history, of the various twists and turns in the church’s history and how councils have been shaped by the particular historical contingencies of the time. His particular fondness for Trent throughout the entire course of his adult life meant that this council especially was always part of Roncalli’s historical imagination. On 1 November 1950, Roncalli was present in Rome for the solemn Declaration of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the company of some 600 bishops from around the world. He called this ‘a truly conciliar gathering’ (‘una vera riunione conciliare’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1030570X13486785">26</xref></sup> It was not, strictly speaking, a council of the church in the normal way that one defines a council historically, canonically and theologically. And yet for Roncalli, an historical event such as this, the gathering of a significant number of the world’s bishops to celebrate an important event in the life of the church, constituted in his mind something of the sense of being together ‘in council’.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his time in Paris, Roncalli had a visit from Jean Guitton (1901–1999), French philosopher and theologian, who would later be invited to the Second Vatican Council as a lay observer and subsequently become a close confidant of Pope Paul VI. This audience with Guitton was one of many that Roncalli had almost every day as part of his responsibilities as Apostolic Nuncio, with heads of state, diplomats, bishops, religious, leading intellectuals and civic leaders. According to Guitton:<disp-quote>
<p>I visited Monsigneur Roncalli … and he spoke to me about his diocese of Bergamo and of his bishop, Monsigneur Tedeschi, of whom he wrote a biography. Tedeschi was a prelate aware of social concerns, a friend of Leo XIII and Cardinal Mercier … . Roncalli spoke to me without ceasing in less than grammatically correct French. As he spoke, he played with his zucchetto and kept touching his soutane in much the same way that a cloth merchant does. He does not seem to me to be living in Paris or in Rome but in the diocese of Bergamo, the one he calls the model of all dioceses for the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1030570X13486785">27</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Despite Roncalli’s best efforts, determination and intense commitment to complete Volume 5 of the <italic>Atti</italic>, his dream was not realized. In 1953, he was appointed Patriarch of Venice and elevated to the College of Cardinals. He had been away from Italy for almost 30 years and returned home to take charge of a prestigious and historically important diocese, albeit a relatively small one, which at that time consisted of some 360,000 faithful, 500 priests and 100 parishes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1030570X13486785">28</xref></sup> At 71 years of age, Roncalli was one of the oldest Patriarchs of Venice. Roncalli was conscious that, despite his age, he now had what he had always desired, that is, full governance as a diocesan bishop:<disp-quote>
<p>It is interesting to note that Providence has brought me back to where I began to exercise my priestly vocation, that is to pastoral work. Now I am ministering directly to souls. To tell the truth, I have always believed that, for an ecclesiastic, diplomacy (so-called!) must be imbued with the pastoral spirit … .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1030570X13486785">29</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This was no ecclesiastical reward after a long diplomatic sojourn. What did Roncalli do in Venice? Like his historical mentors of old, he commenced a full programme of pastoral activity, extensive visitation of the diocese and convened a diocesan synod for 1957. He also found time to recommence the editing of the <italic>Atti</italic>. Once again, pastoral ministry and historical perspective came together.</p>
<p>On 28 October 1958, Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was elected to succeed Pope Pius XII. Much has been made of his election as supposedly a caretaker or transitional pope. Roncalli would indeed be a ‘transitional’ pope in the best sense of the word. He would help the church ‘transition’ into a new historical epoch or era that he had been discerning throughout the course of the 20th century. In his mind, an ecumenical council was the best mechanism for the church to enter ‘this new epoch’ in much the same way that he believed Trent and Borromeo enabled the church of the 16th century to enter that new era of pastoral renewal and adaptation.</p>
<p>In 1958, it was customary for a papal ‘coronation’ to be held on Sunday but the newly elected John XXIII insisted that it be celebrated on 4 November, which happened to be a weekday. Why this change to established Vatican protocol? It was the feast of San Carlo Borromeo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1030570X13486785">30</xref></sup> John XXIII insisted on another innovation. The newly elected pope would preach a homily that would slightly extend the four-hour ceremony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1030570X13486785">31</xref></sup> In that homily, John XXIII spoke of how there were those who expected the new Pontiff ‘to be a man of state, a diplomat, a man of science or the organizer of social life’. According to Roncalli, these expectations created an image of the supreme pontiff ‘that is not in conformity with the true ideal’. He went on to note that the new pope realized in himself the splendid image of the Good Shepherd described by John the evangelist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1030570X13486785">32</xref></sup> References to this text from John ch. 10 recurred repeatedly throughout Roncalli’s episcopacy as the ‘perfect’ biblical and pastoral image of the bishop as shepherd. As he formally commenced his pontificate, Roncalli recalled the richness and power of this image. In fact, Roncalli insisted that the image and responsibility of the shepherd caring for the sheep was something dear to his heart. All the other human qualities of knowledge, diplomacy and organization could complete and enhance the pontifical office but in no way were they to replace them. The central point was the zeal of the pastor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1030570X13486785">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the end of the address, John XXIII spoke directly about the significance of Borromeo’s feast-day and brought together the biblical image of the shepherd and the historical importance of the great archbishop of Milan. He stated that the image of Borromeo had been dear to him throughout all his priestly and episcopal life, ‘this great pastor of souls in the history of the Church in all the ages’. John XXIII recalled his episcopal ordination in Rome in 1925 at the Church of San Carlo. According to the pope, divine providence had reserved for San Carlo Borromeo the highest responsibility to cooperate in an exceptional measure in the reconstruction of the ecclesiastical order. Borromeo’s participation in the application of the pastoral reforms of Trent and the example he showed in Milan and other diocese throughout Italy gave weight to his glorious title as model bishop and admirable example of episcopal holiness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1030570X13486785">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the much anticipated Second Vatican Ecumenical Council commenced in 1962, following that impressive entrance procession that demonstrated in a new and dramatic way the truly global and universal character of the Catholic Church, Pope John XXIII was pleased to welcome all the bishops of the world. In that great throng of bishops assembled in St Peter’s Basilica, mention should be made of the decisive historical ‘presence’ of one bishop in particular – San Carlo Borromeo. That’s why in his opening address <italic>Gaudet Mater Ecclesia</italic>, Roncalli speaks of ‘history, the teacher of life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1030570X13486785">35</xref></sup></p>
